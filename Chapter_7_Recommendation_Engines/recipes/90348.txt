Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
¾ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
¼ cup flax seed meal
3 tablespoons grated Romano cheese
1 tablespoon dried parsley
3  eggs, beaten
½ cup all-purpose flour
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat a medium baking dish with the butter.
In a shallow dish, mix the bread crumbs, flax seed, Romano cheese, and parsley. Place the beaten eggs and flour in 2 separate shallow bowls. Dredge chicken in the flour, dip in eggs, and press into the bread crumb mixture to coat. Arrange coated chicken in the prepared baking dish.
Cover, and bake 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken juices run clear. Turn on the oven broiler. Remove cover, and broil chicken 5 minutes, until coating is lightly browned.
