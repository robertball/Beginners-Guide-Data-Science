Ingredients:
1 pound boned, skinned chicken breasts
8 red thin-skinned potatoes (1 in. wide)
2 carrots
4 shallots (1 in. wide)
1/2 pound green beans
1 cup cherry tomatoes
1 teaspoon salad oil
2 cups fat-skimmed chicken broth
2 teaspoons minced fresh tarragon leaves
2 tablespoons cornstarch
Salt and pepper

Directions:
Rinse chicken, pat dry, and cut into 1-inch chunks. Scrub potatoes. Peel carrots and cut diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Peel shallots and cut in half  lengthwise. Rinse green beans and cut off and discard stem ends. Cut beans  into 11/2-inch lengths. Rinse tomatoes, discard stems, and cut in half.
In a 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over high heat, stir chicken in oil often until chicken is lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a bowl.
To pan, add broth, potatoes, carrots, shallots, and tarragon. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Add chicken and beans. Cover and simmer until chicken is white in center of thickest part (cut to test) and potatoes are tender when pierced, about 8 minutes longer.
In a small bowl, mix cornstarch and 1/4 cup water until smooth. Turn heat under stew to high, stir in cornstarch mixture, and continue to stir until boiling. Add tomatoes, mix, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into wide soup bowls.
