Ingredients:
3 Tbsp butter
3 Tbsp flour
1/4 tsp salt
1/8 tsp pepper
2 1/2 c. milk
1 lb. elbow macaroni
10-12 oz. grated mild longhorn or mild cheddar cheese[yellow]
10-12 oz. grated sharp[or xtra sharp] cheddar[white]
(reserve 1/2 cup of cheeses for top)
1 grated small yellow onion [or 1/2 of a larger white onion]
2 small pats butter for top
1 can stewed tomatoes if desired*

Directions:
Boil Macaroni per package directions.  Prepare a white sauce by melting butter over low heat in a large skillet.  Blend in flour til bubbly and gradually stir in milk, salt and pepper, raising heat to medium and stirring constantly til thickened.  Let sauce cool a couple mins. and add grated cheeses, stirring as they melt.  Grate onion into mixture and stir well.  Put 1/2 the cooked macaroni in a greased 2Qt. casserole dish and add 1/2 the cheese mixture folding in.  Add the rest of the macaroni into the cheese mixture left in the pan and fold this before pouring it into the casserole dish.  Sprinkle reserved cheese on top and dot with pats of butter.[this makes for a crispy cheesy top]  Bake at 350 for 30-40 mins. or until brown around the edges and bubbly.  It will look a bit greasy at first, but let it sink in, cooling a bit before serving.  *Top with stewed tomatoes if you like them.

Description: 
Scrumptiously cheesy, This baked macaroni and cheese is a fabulous supper dish.  My Mom and I tweaked it over the past 30 years to perfection! There are NEVER leftovers.  Don't leave out the onion even if you hate it!  It's an integral part of the recipe and no one knows there's onion in it, trust me!
