Ingredients:
4 medium boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 tsp. garlic powder
2 tsp. onion powder
1/2 tsp. to 2 tsp. cayenne pepper (depending on how hot you like your food to be)
2 tsp. paprika
1 1/2 tsp. salt
1 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper
1/2 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. dried thyme leaves
1/2 cup dry seasoned breadcrumbs
2 eggs, lightly beaten
4 tbsp. olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Place beaten eggs in bowl for dredging.  Mix together all of the spices with the breadcrumbs and salt and pepper and place in a shallow bowl for dredging.  Coat each chicken breast in beaten egg and then into your spice/breadcrumb mixture and coat evenly.  Place in a lightly greased 9 x 13 inch baking pan and sprinkle any remaining spice mixture over the chicken evenly.  Drizzle the chicken breasts with olive oil and bake for 30-40 minutes or until the chicken juices run clear when pierced with a knife and a knife inserted comes out easily.

This is a simple way to spice up your chicken for midweek, quick meals. If it's too hot then decrease the amount of cayenne pepper used when making this.
