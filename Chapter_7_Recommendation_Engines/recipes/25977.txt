Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
3 cups white sugar
6 egg yolks
2 teaspoons lemon extract
1 cup buttermilk
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
6 egg whites

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Mix together the flour and baking soda; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the yolks one at a time, then stir in the lemon extract.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
