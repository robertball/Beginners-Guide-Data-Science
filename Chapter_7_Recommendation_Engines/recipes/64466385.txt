Ingredients:
You need:
Green lenses, marshmallows, dark-chocolat rasps, acid cucumber, Raffaelo (or other sweets the Dinomite likes) and kale

Directions:
Cook the green lenses like written with the product and put them in the dessert-glass first. Continue with a first round of barbequed marshmallows. Top it with the chocolat rasps. Put another round of hot marshmallows on, then carefully place the acid cucumber (best if's been opened too long, makes the taste even more acid-ier!) in small pieces on it. Finish with a Raffaello wrapped in kale - et voil√°!

Submitter:
