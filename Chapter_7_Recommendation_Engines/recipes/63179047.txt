Ingredients:
4 1/2-inch thick Center-cut loin pork chops; (bone-in or boneless)
3/4 teaspoon Salt
1/2 teaspoon Black Pepper
1/2 teaspoon Dried rubbed sage
1/2 teaspoon Dried thyme
3/4 cups Parmesan cheese; grated
2 large Eggs
1 tablespoon Vegetable oil
1 cup dried seasoned bread crumbs
Olive oil; (for frying)
4 large cloves Garlic; peeled and chopped

Directions:
Spread Parmesan cheese in a shallow dish.
Beat eggs with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in another shallow dish.
Spread bread crumbs in a third shallow dish.
Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels.
Combine salt, pepper, sage, and thyme, and sprinkle generously over both sides of chops, pressing seasonings into meat with your fingers.
Bread pork chops one at a time. Dredge seasoned chops in Parmesan, coating both sides completely
Using tongs, dip both sides of chops in egg mixture, letting excess drip off.
Finally, dip both sides of chops in bread crumbs, pressing crumbs to form coating.
Place breaded chops on wire rack set over baking sheet, allow to dry for 5 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat with enough olive oil to come halfway up the sides of the chops, about 1/4 cup.
Stir in garlic to oil, and cook until lightly browned.
Remove garlic from skillet. Increase heat to medium. When oil shimmers, add chops and sautee 4 to 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy, or to an internal temperature between 150 and 160 degrees F.
Drain on rack set over baking sheet, then transfer to a warm serving platter. Serve with Chipotle Cream Sauce.
