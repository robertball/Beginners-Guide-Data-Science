Ingredients:
1 pound dry navy beans, soaked overnight
4 quarts water
1 pound leftover ham bone with meat attached
1 onion, finely diced
2 carrots, sliced
2 stalks celery, diced
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
In a large stock pot, add water, ham bone and pre-soaked beans.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until beans are close to soft.
Remove bone and cut off remaining meat.  Remove 1/3 of beans and mash with potato masher or food processor.
Return ham and beans back to stock pot and add onion, carrots, celery, garlic powder, pepper and paprika.  If you are using dripping from a previously cooked ham add those now.  Simmer until vegetables are tender and serve.

Description: 
Best use I have ever found for left over ham!  Be sure to save the pan drippings and chill them so you can remove the fat leaving behind the good tasting juices that flavor the soup broth so well.
