Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups elbow macaroni
1 pound squid, cleaned
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 large onion, chopped
1 1/2 cups crushed tomatoes
1/4 cup dry white wine
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 cinnamon stick, broken in half
2 bay leaves
1/4 teaspoon dried basil leaves
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup grated Mizithra cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In a small sauce pan, boil the squid in 3 cups of water mixed with the red wine vinegar for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, cut into bite-sized rings/pieces, and set aside.
Heat the olive oil in a large heavy skillet. Saute the onion and garlic until onion is tender, but not brown. Stir in the squid, and saute for 2 minutes. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, white wine and lemon juice. Season with cinnamon stick, bay leaves, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes partially covered, stirring occasionally.
Remove from heat, and mix in cooked pasta. Serve topped with grated cheese.

Description: 
This is the 'easy' version of the classic Greek dish macaronatha, which is octopus meat in a delicious tomato-based sauce over macaroni, topped with grated sheep's milk cheese. Squid is easier to obtain, and is usually sold already cleaned, thus the ease. Goes well with a fruity blush wine like white Zinfandel. Enjoy!
