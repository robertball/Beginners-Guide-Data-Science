Ingredients:
3 packages of chicken flavored Ramen noodles (make sure you use the flat square packaged type, not the cup type).
1 lb ground beef.
8 oz. (approx.) chunk of processed American cheese, cut into about 8 pieces.
1/2 cup milk.
Broccoli, chopped about 1/2 to 1 cup (optional).
Salt and pepper to taste.

Directions:
In a non-stick 12" skillet, cook ground beef over medium-high heat, breaking up beef with back of spoon or spatula. Meanwhile, bring about 6 cups of water to a boil, and add all 3 packs of noodles (set seasoning packets aside). Boil noodles until done - ONLY about 3 minutes, drain. When beef is cooked through, reduce heat to medium add cheese, milk, contents of all 3 seasoning packets and chopped broccoli (if used). Mix until cheese is all melted, then add drained noodles and mix well to coat the noodles. You may also want to break up the noodles some with your spatula, as Ramen noodles are usually very long. Serve!
