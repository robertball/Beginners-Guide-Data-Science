Ingredients:
12 eggs
Kraft Miracle Whip Salad Dressing
French's  Yellow Prepared Mustard
Paprika
Sliced Pimiento Stuffed green olives
Sliced Black olives

Directions:
Hard boil eggs as per usual. Once they're done, run eggs under cold water, to ease peeling. Carefully tap eggs on hard surface one at a time, and roll to remove shells. Cut eggs in half lengthwise. Removed and reserve the yolks. Mash the yolks well with a fork, until they are a fine powdery texture. Add in desired amount of Miracle Whip. Probably about 2 Tblsp at most. Add in mustard to desired flavor. Pipe or spoon filling back into whites. Top with 1-2 sliced olive pieces each. Sprinkle eggs with paprika. Refrigerate until chilled and serve. Stand back and watch them miraculously dissapear, and enjoy the compliments.
