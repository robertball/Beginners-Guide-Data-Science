Ingredients:
2 teaspoons peanut oil
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1 clove garlic, minced
3 tablespoons reduced-sodium teriyaki sauce
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3 cups cold cooked rice
2/3 cup frozen peas, thawed
2/3 cup frozen carrot slices, thawed
2/3 cup frozen chopped broccoli, thawed
1/4 cup sliced green onion (green part only)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook egg in hot wok, stirring continually, until no longer moist, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer egg to a plate and return wok to heat.
Cook ginger and garlic in skillet until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add teriyaki sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, salt, and red pepper flakes to the ginger and garlic; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook another 2 minutes.
Crumble cold rice into the wok. Stir rice with a wooden spoon, breaking rice into individual grains as it warms; add peas, carrots, broccoli, and green onion. Cook and stir mixture until the vegetables are tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Fold scrambled egg into the rice mixture; cook and stir until egg is reheated, 1 to 2 minutes more.
