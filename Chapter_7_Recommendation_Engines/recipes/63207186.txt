Ingredients:
4 C whole wheat flour, stone-ground
2 C all-purpose flour
2 C buttermilk
1-1/2 tsp baking soda
1-1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
1. Mix the flours, soda and salt in a bowl.
2. Form the mixture into a bowl shape and gradually pour the buttermilk into the center—about a cup to start. Mix ingredients with a wooden spoon or spatula, then by hand as it gets firmer.
3. Knead a bit on a floured counter surface then, on a lightly floured baking sheet, pat down the ball of dough and cut a deep cross on top using a knife dipped in flour—to avoid sticking and pulling the dough—the cross-cut will make it easier to break apart later.
4. Lightly sprinkle the top with flour and bake in a pre-heated oven at 425°F for about 25 minutes, then 350°F for about 15 minutes.

hints:
let it sit on a baking rack until it’s cooled and if the crust seems too hard, wrap the loaf in a clean, damp kitchen towel.
unless you’ll be eating the whole loaf right away, don’t cut into it until it’s set, which is about 6 hours after it comes out of the oven. This will keep it moist instead of drying out quickly.
