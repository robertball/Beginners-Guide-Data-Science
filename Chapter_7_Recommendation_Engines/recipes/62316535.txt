Ingredients:
6 to 6 1/2 cups flour
3/4 cup sugar
1 tsp salt
2 envelopes active dry yeast
1 cup milk
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup butter
2 tsps grated orange peel
1 tsp nutmeg
4 eggs at room temperature
1 cup raisins (optional)
12 uncooked eggs in shells, tinted with food coloring as desired (optional)

Directions:
In large bowl combine 2 cups flour, the sugar, salt and yeast.
In small saucepan over low heat combine milk, water, butter, orange peel and nutmeg.Heat to 120-130 degrees.  Butter need not melt completely.
Stir milk mixture into yeast mixture and beat with  mixer at medium speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl as needed.
Add 3 of the eggs and 1 more cup flour.
Beat at high speed 3 minutes.
Stir in raisins and enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.
Turn onto floured board and knead 8 to 10 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic.
Form into a ball and place in a greased bowl.  Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about an hour.
Punch dough down and divide into 12 equal pieces.  Roll each piece into a rope 8 inches long.
Wrap each rope around a tinted egg to form a nest moisten ends of ropes with water and pinch together
to seal securely.
Place nests on greased baking sheets, cover and let rise until almost doubled,
about 45 minutes.
If you don't want to use the uncooked eggs, just make an open circle, figure 8 or braid.
Beat remaining egg.  Brush dough portion of each nest with egg wash.
Bake 350 degrees 15 to 20 minutes until done.
