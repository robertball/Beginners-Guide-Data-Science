Ingredients:
6 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil
3 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
1 shallot, minced
1 garlic clove, minced
salt and pepper
1 pound asparagus, tough ends trimmed and sliced thin on the bias
1 pound fresh cheese tortellini
1/4 cup pine nuts
1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes, halved
1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1/2 cup)

Directions:
Whisk the olive oil, basil, lemon juice, shallot, garlic, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper together in a bowl large enough to hold the salad.
Cook the asparagus in 4 quarts boiling water seasoned with 1 tbsp. salt until tender, about 3 minutes.  Transfer the asparagus to a colander using a slotted spoon (do not discard the boiling water) and run under cold water until cool.  Shake out any excess water and toss with vinaigrette.
Return water to a boil and add the tortellini.  Cook until tender following the package instructions.  Drain the tortellini thoroughly, then toss while hot with the asparagus and dressing.  Refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.
Toast the pine nuts in a small skillet over med heat until golden and fragrant about 5 minutes.  Just before serving, stir the pine nuts, tomatoes and Parmesan into the salad and season with salt and pepper.
