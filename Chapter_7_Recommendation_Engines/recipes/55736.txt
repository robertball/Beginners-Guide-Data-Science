Ingredients:
1 pound fat-trimmed boned pork shoulder or butt
2 teaspoons grated orange peel
2 cups orange juice
1 (8 ounce) onion, peeled and chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
8 (10 inch) warm flour tortillas
1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions (including tops)
1/3 cup nonfat sour cream
1/3 cup tomato salsa
Salt

Directions:
Cut pork into 1/4- to 1/2-inch cubes. Put a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat, add pork, and stir often until meat is gray, 5 to 6 minutes.
Add orange peel, 1 cup orange juice, onion, and cumin to pan. Stir often over medium-high heat until  liquid has evaporated and meat is lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Add 1/2 cup orange juice, scrape browned bits free, and stir until juice evaporates, about 5 minutes.
Add black beans and remaining 1/2 cup orange juice and stir just until beans are hot, about 2 minutes.
Serve pork mixture in warm tortillas, adding green onions, sour cream, salsa, and salt to taste. Roll to enclose filling.
