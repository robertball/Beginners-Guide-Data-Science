Ingredients:
1/2 lb (2 sticks) salted butter
3 TBL chopped Italian parsley (leaves only)
2 TBL lemon juice (juice from about 1 lemon)
1 TBL fresh chopped garlic
1 TBL heavy cream
1/2 tsp sea salt
1 tsp white pepper

Directions:
In a large bowl, airate the butter with a wire whisk or you can even cream the butter using the paddle attachment of a stand mixer.  But the goal is just to get the butter soft and airated so you can incorporate the chopped herbs.
Add the lemon juice, heavy cream, chopped parsley and white pepper and continue mixing until the ingredients are fully mixed.
Spread out a large (1-foot or bigger) square of plastic wrap or parchment paper across your work surface, then scoop the mixed butter onto the plastic. You are now going to roll the butter into a cylinder inside the plastic wrap or parchment paper
Tie the ends of the cylinder using little pieces of string. Chill or freeze until needed.

Description: 
Typically compound butters are rolled into cylinders and chilled or even frozen, and then slices or pats are served on steaks, fish or vegetables.  I added cream and white pepper to enhance the final flavor and texture.
