Ingredients:
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon minced shallot
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup slivered almonds
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 pinch salt
1 (16 ounce) package mixed salad greens
1/2 pint strawberries, quartered

Directions:
Combine the lemon juice, honey, shallot, thyme, salt, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl; vigorously whisk the olive oil and vegetable oil into the lemon juice mixture. Set aside.
Place a small skillet over medium-high heat; toss the almonds, sugar, and salt together in the hot skillet until the sugar caramelizes on the almonds, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat immediately.
Place the salad mix in a large bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the salad mix and toss to coat. Top with the almonds and strawberries to serve.
