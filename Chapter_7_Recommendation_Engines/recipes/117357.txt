Ingredients:
1 large sweet onion
1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme or oregano
2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon butter, melted

Directions:
With a sharp knife, slice 1/2 in. off the top of the onion; peel onion. Cut into 12-16 wedges to within 1/2 in. of root end.
Place onion on a double thickness of heavy-duty foil (about 12 in. square). Open wedges slightly; sprinkle with thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper. Drizzle with butter. Fold foil around onion and seal tightly. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 30-35 minutes or until tender.
