Ingredients:
1/2 block or about about 5 oz. extra firm tofu, drained
a little oil for the pan
4 big handfulls fresh spinach
1 dash of salt
1 small handful of dry breadcrumbs (optional)
1 slice non-dairy cheese alternative

Directions:
Heat the oil in an 8 inch skillet over medium heat.
Add the drained tofu and use a wooden spoon to crumble the tofu into small chunks
Heat the tofu on medium heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it is slightly browned.
Meanwhile, rinse the spinach, and pick out the stems if you want.  Tear the spinach into small pieces.
When the tofu is as brown as you'd like, add the spinach to the skillet. Add a dash of salt, put the lid on the skillet and turn to heat to low.  Let the spinach steam with the cover on for 2-3 minutes, or until the spinach is cooked to your liking.
Remove the lid from the skillet, add the breadcrumbs. Note that you may need more or less than a small handful, depending on how much water your spinach and tofu have left in the skillet.
Tear the slice of cheese into little bits, and stir into the spinach/tofu/breadcrumb mixture until melted.
Serve.
For variation, try this recipe with seasoned salt, or seasoned tofu, or play around with other seasonings you have on hand like curry powder or taco seasoning.
