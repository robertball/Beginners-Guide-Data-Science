Description: 
This dressing is wonderfully light and tangy; serve over salad. It goes perfect with my squished kale salad (see my recipe box for this). Made as directed, this recipe is gluten free, wheat free, soy free, dairy free, and corn free. I use my VitamixÂ® to blend the dressing together. Enjoy!
