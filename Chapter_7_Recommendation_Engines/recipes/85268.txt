Ingredients:
8 (6 ounce) fillets cod
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons chili sauce
8 slices bacon
1 leek, chopped
1 ounce enoki mushrooms

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Soak some toothpicks in water while the grill heats up.
Spread a thin layer of sesame oil and chili sauce onto one side of each fish fillet. At one end, place some of the leek and a couple of mushrooms. Roll towards the other end. Wrap each roll with a slice of bacon, and secure with two toothpicks.
Place on the preheated grill, and cook covered for 5 minutes. Be careful of flare-ups from the bacon grease. Turn over, and cook for 5 more minutes, until bacon is crisp and fish flakes easily.
