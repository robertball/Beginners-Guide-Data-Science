Ingredients:
2T sugar
1/2 cup whole milk, warm
1 1/2 tsp instant yeast
1 large egg
5 T unsalted butter, melted
2 cups all purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
Oil for frying, 2-4 cups
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1/4 t salt
1/4 t vanilla
1/4 c water
Patience.
Mixing bowls, dough hooks, baking sheets, spoons, more mixing bowls, pots, metal slotted spoon, plate with paper towels, drying rack, another mixing bowl. Serving platter.

Directions:
Combine sugar, milk, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer until dissolved.
Allow it to sit until bubbly, 5-10 mins.
Beat egg and drizzle into melted butter, whisking constantly.
Combine egg mixture with milk mixture using hook attachment on low.
Mix the flour and salt in a bowl, and then add 1/2 cup at a time to the mixing bowl, allowing it to slowly incorporate into the liquid mixture.
Once all flour is incorporated, continue to mix 5 mins on low. Scrape the bowl and mix 30 seconds.
Dump dough into an oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 to 12 hours.
The next morning, remove the dough from the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature and rise, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Put the dough in a warm spot, if necessary, to facilitate rising.
Roll dough out onto floured surface to 1/4 inch thickness. Use a 1 inch circular cutter to cut donut holes. Transfer to a lightly floured baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover with a tea towel, set in a draft free or warm place, and allow to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
Heat oil in a pot over a medium-high heat until it reaches 350. Drop fluffy bites into hot oil. The fluffy bites should immediately float to the top and puff up. Then use a metal spoon or spatula to remove them from the oil as soon as they're golden brown on both sides.
Place on a paper towel before glazing.
To glaze the fluffy bites, combine 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1/4 cup cold water, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp vanilla in a bowl until smooth. Drop in the Duffy bites one at a time. Quickly turn them over then remove them. Place them on a rack so any excess glaze can drip off.
Devour the fluffy bites all in one sitting. And by sitting, I mean standing, on one foot, in a pool of marshmallows, while humming Carry On Wayward Son.
