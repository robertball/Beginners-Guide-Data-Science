Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 Large onion, roughly chopped
4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
2 lbs. beefsteak tomatoes
2 fl oz Poitin or vodka
1 1/2 pints chicken stock
1 t. brown sugar

Directions:
1. Preheat broiler on oven to high, and a stockpot on burner to medium heat.
2. Add the onion and garlic to the saucepan, along with the oil.  Cook until just opaque.
3. Place the tomatoes under the broiler, turning just as each side blackens, until all skin is charred.
4. Add tomatoes, vodka, stock, and sugar to stockpot, and bring to a boil, then immediately down to a simmer. Allow to simmer for 20 minutes.
5. Remove from heat, and add cream, then salt and pepper to taste.
6. Place in blender, and puree.  Run through a strainer, then serve. Feel free to garnish with chopped spring onions, and a swirl of soured cream.

Description: 
This is a beautiful cream of tomato soup, but with a very Irish twist: the use of Poitin.  Poitin is basically Irish moonshine made from potatoes, usually at over 90% pure alcohol.  If you don't have access to moonshine (Irish or otherwise) feel free to substitute vodka.  Bear in mind that either way, the harsh alcohol cooks out leaving a unique flavour with this dish.
