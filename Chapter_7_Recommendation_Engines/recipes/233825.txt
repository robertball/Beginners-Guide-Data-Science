1 quart water, or as needed
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup salt
2 ears corn

Directions:
Stir water, sugar, and salt together until the sugar and salt dissolves in a container large enough to hold the corn.
Submerge corn in the brine; soak at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Remove corn from the brine, shake to remove excess liquid, and cook directly on an oven rack for 1 hour.
