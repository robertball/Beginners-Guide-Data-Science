Ingredients:
12 whole chicken wings*
3/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons Big Daddy's Roasted Garlic Rub
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Cut chicken wings into three sections; discard wing tips. In a bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Set aside 1/4 cup for basting; cover and refrigerate. Place the wings in a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass bowl. Pour the remaining marinade over wings; turn to coat. Seal or cover and refrigerate overnight. Drain and discard marinade. Place the wings in a shallow baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 1 hour, brushing several times with reserved soy sauce mixture during the last 30 minutes of baking. Refrigerate any leftovers.
