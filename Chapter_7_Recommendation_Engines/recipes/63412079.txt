Description: 
My very favorite non-dairy ice cream! Rich, creamy, vegan and free of cane sugars. It tastes a little like key lime pie; the avocado just adds silkiness and color. I added a little corn syrup because it helps the finished product emulsify better, but for those conscious of sweetener intake, it can be left out without ill effect. Delicious when sprinkled with toasted shredded coconut!
