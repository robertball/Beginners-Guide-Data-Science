Ingredients:
1 cup Mott'sÂ® Natural Applesauce
1 medium apple
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon water
1/2 cup fresh or frozen cranberries
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
1 egg
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees  F. Cut apple in half and remove core. Cut each half into slices approximately 1/8-inch thick.
Stir together brown sugar and water in medium saucepan. Add apple slices. Cook, stirring gently over medium heat, until apple slices are softened, about 5 minutes.
Sprinkle cranberries in bottom of nonstick or greased 9-inch cake pan. Arrange apple slices over cranberries, drizzling with brown sugar sauce. Set aside.
In large bowl or mixer, beat butter with granulated sugar until thoroughly combined. Add apple sauce and egg.
In separate bowl, mix together flour, baking soda and cinnamon. Gently blend into apple sauce mixture. Spoon batter over apples and cranberries, spreading evenly.
Bake 30 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Remove from oven and cool 15 minutes before turning cake out onto wire rack to cool completely.
