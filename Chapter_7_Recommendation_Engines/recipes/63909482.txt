Description: 
This is a quick and easy recipe for cheese danish. Despite being so easy to make, it's satisfying and wonderful for a quick weekend breakfast treat. It keeps well for a couple of days if it's well covered and placed in the refrigerator. It also reheats well in the microwave for a few seconds.
