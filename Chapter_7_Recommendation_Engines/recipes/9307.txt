Ingredients:
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon lemon zest
6 cups all-purpose flour
4 eggs
1/2 cup candied mixed fruit
1 cup raisins
3/4 cup pine nuts
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
1 cup cherries

Directions:
Dissolve 1 teaspoon sugar in 1 cup warm water in large mixer bowl. Sprinkle in yeast. Let stand 10 minutes, then stir well.
Add 1/2 cup sugar, melted butter or margarine, salt, lemon rind, and 2 cups flour. Beat for 2 minutes at medium speed with electric mixer.  Add 2 cups more flour and eggs; beat 3 minutes. Stir in almost all remaining flour, using enough flour to make a soft dough.
Knead dough on floured board until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place in lightly greased bowl.  Cover with greased waxed paper and a tea towel. Let rise in warm place 75 - 85 degrees F (25 - 30 degrees C)until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
Punch down dough.  Turn out onto a lightly floured board, and knead in raisins, candied fruit, and nuts.  Shape into two round loaves.  Place each in a well greased, 9 inch, round cake pan.  Cover with tea towel.  Let rise in warm place until doubled, 1 - 1 1/2 hours.
Bake at 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C) for 45 to 55 minutes.  Remove from pans immediately. Cool on wire racks.
Mix together confectioners sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons  water, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  Spoon onto loaves. Decorate with cherries or almonds.  Alternatively, dust loaves with confectioners sugar.

Description: 
What a lovely bread to serve at Christmas time--visions of sugar plums. I make a lot of sweet breads at the holidays and my family enjoys them. Baking is one of my hobbies which I cherish dearly. Slivered almonds can be substituted for pine nuts.
