Ingredients:
1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
8 ounces turnips (about 2 medium), peeled and diced
3 large cloves garlic
30 fresh sage leaves, divided (12 left whole, the rest cut into strips - start with less and add to taste)
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt
1/2 teaspoon coarsely cracked pepper

Directions:
1.Place potatoes, turnips, garlic and 12 sage leaves in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are fork-tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain. Return the vegetables to the pan and keep covered.
2.Heat butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. As it melts and turns lightly brown, add the strips of sage and allow them to crackle and flavor the butter, about 1 minute.
3.Pour the sage and butter over the vegetables and smash with a potato masher. Stir in salt and pepper and serve.
