Ingredients:
2 cups milk
1 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (9 inch) baked pie crust
1 pinch nutmeg

Directions:
Combine milk, sugar, and butter together in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir until butter melts, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour about 1 cup milk mixture into a bowl and whisk cornstarch into mixture until smooth. Pour milk-cornstarch mixture back into the saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Pour milk mixture into the pie crust and sprinkle with nutmeg. Refrigerate pie until firm, about 3 hours.

Description: 
This is my grandmother's recipe from the early 1900s and was a favorite of my dad's. I think of them both whenever I make it!
