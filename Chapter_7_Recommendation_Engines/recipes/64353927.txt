Ingredients:
1 cup diced fresh strawberries
1 tablespoon butter
2 cups uncooked Arborio rice
1/2 cup sparkling white wine
7 cups low sodium vegetable broth
3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
4 Tbsp balsamic vinegar glaze
Parmigiano Reggiano shavings for garnish

Directions:
Heat the vegetable broth over medium heat and let remain at a simmer.
Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the rice; cook for another 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the rice is lightly toasted and covered in the butter. Stir in white wine and allow to reduce.
Stir in 1 ladle of vegetable broth; continue stirring until liquid is almost completely absorbed. Repeat this process with remaining broth, stirring constantly. After the rice has reached a point where it is a little less than al dente, stir in the strawberries and 3 Tbsp of parmigiano reggiano, continue adding another 2 ladles of broth separately as before.
Turn off the heat and cover for about 3 minutes until the rice has a creamy texture yet still al dente.
Ladle the rice into plates, garnish with Parmigiano Reggiano (R) shavings and balsamic glaze.
