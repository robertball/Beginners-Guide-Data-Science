1 cup pumpkin puree (canned is fine, but fresh roasted pumpkin has more color)
1 cup ice
2 cups apple cider
2 cups sparkling water or club soda
pinch nutmeg
pinch salt
pinch cinnamon

Directions:
In a blender, toss pumpkin and ice together and blend on high until very small pieces of ice are visible.
Throw in all remaining ingredients and mix on high until completely blended.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
A favorite served at a particular school for wizardry and witchcraft can be served to your children too!  Healthy and light, it can also be made less so by turning it into an alcoholic version, but that is up to the witch in the kitchen!
