Description: 
This spaghetti is my favorite from childhood.  It's easy to make, and you can substitute chicken instead of beef. You can use any cut of beef you like: a small roast, round steak or eye of round.  I liked it better over cooked pasta shells, but any pasta will do. It's even better as leftovers!
