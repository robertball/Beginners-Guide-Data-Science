Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup granulated white sugar
2 1/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground mace
1/2 cup cold unsalted butter
1/3 cup currants or raisins (optional)
1/4 cup chopped mixed peel
1 large egg (lightly beaten)
2-4 Tbsp milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, ground cinnamon, and mace.
Cut the butter into small pieces and blend into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or two knives. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.
Stir in the currants (if using) and mixed peel.
Add the beaten egg and enough milk to form a light dough.
Knead the dough gently on a lightly floured surface and roll to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
Cut into rounds using a 2 1/2 inch cookie cutter.
Lightly butter a griddle, heavy frying pan, or electric frying pan and heat to medium hot.
Cook the welsh cakes for about 5 minutes per side, or until they are golden brown, but still soft in the middle.
Immediately after baking, sprinkle with granulated white sugar and cinnamon. Serve warm or at room temperature.
