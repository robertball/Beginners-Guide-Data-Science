Description: 
I wanted a very simple, basic Basil or Spinach pesto without all the 'extras,' so I created my own version.  This is great as a spread or anywhere a pesto is called for.  The basil and spinach are interchangeable for two kinds of pesto or they can be combined (half and half) for a great spinach-basil pesto!
