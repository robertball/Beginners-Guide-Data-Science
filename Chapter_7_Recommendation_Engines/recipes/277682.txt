Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup cold butter
1/2 cup skim milk
1/4 cup fancy molasses
1/2 tablespoon raw sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves in a large bowl; mix well. Use a fork or a pastry cutter to cut butter into the flour mixture. Pour in milk and molasses and stir until all of the flour has been absorbed.
Place dough onto the prepared baking sheet and use your hands to shape it into a 3/4-inch thick, 8-inch round disk. Sprinkle raw sugar over the top and cut into 8 wedges.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 17 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
These gingerbread scones are great right out of the oven but they really are best the next day. We prefer ours fairly plain but feel free to add a glaze of your choice. Enjoy!
