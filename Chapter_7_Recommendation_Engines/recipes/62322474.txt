Ingredients:
1 package of Oreo cookies, crushed
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
6 squares ofBaker's White Chocolate, melted
1 Tablespoon of creamy peanut butter

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine crushed cookies and cream cheese to form a stiff dough.  Roll into balls and place in the freezer until firm. Melt white chocolate in the microwave in 30 second increments until mostly melted. Stir in peanut butter until the chocolate mixture is creamy and smooth. Dip into white chocolate and let rest on waxed paper until set.

Description: 
Dipped in real white chocolate instead of candy coating and I melt the white chocolate with a tablespoon or so of creamy peanut butter. The white chocolate with peanut butter combined with the oreo instead is a great combination. I also freeze the balls/eggs until solid before dipping.Modified from: Cookie Balls
