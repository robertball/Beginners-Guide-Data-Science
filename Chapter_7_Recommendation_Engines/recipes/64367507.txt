Ingredients:
2 cloves garlic
2 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
1 sweet onion, chopped
1/4 cup of good mozzarella cheese, coarsely cubed
2 sweet pimientos, (sweet cherry peppers) finely chopped
3 flat anchovies, rinsed and chopped (one anchovy equals 1/2 teaspoon of anchovy paste ---  so if you are using paste you can use 1 & 1/2 teaspoon of the paste; the flavor may be a little different because paste has vinegar and spices but you won't know the difference.)
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
salt and pepper
French or Italian bread, sliced 3/4 to 1 inch thick
3 tablespoons fresh/good olive oil
Basil sprigs, for garnish

Directions:
Rub the surface of a mixing bowl with a cut clove of garlic.
Combine the tomatoes, onion, cheese, pimientos, anchovies, chopped basil, parsley, vinegar, salt and pepper.  Mix well; taste for seasoning.
Slowly toast the bread in a 200 degree oven.
While the bread is still warm, rub it with the remaining cut garlic clove and drizzle with the olive oil.  Spoon the vegetable mixture onto the warm bread and place on a cold plate.
Garnish each plate with a sprig of basil.  Serve immediately with a knife and fork and a large napkin.
