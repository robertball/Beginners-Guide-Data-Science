Ingredients:
1 pound thin asparagus spears
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 (12 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
10 cherry tomatoes, or more to taste
5 kalamata olives, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add asparagus and cook until tender, about 4 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water until cold to stop the cooking process. Drain.
Boil balsamic vinegar in a small saucepan until reduced to 1/3 the original amount, about 5 minutes. Pour reduced vinegar into a bowl and whisk olive oil into vinegar; set aside until cool, about 10 minutes. Add asparagus, onion, tomatoes, and olives to vinegar mixture and toss to coat.

Description: 
I had this at a restaurant and loved it so had to try and duplicate it at home. Yummy. Quick and easy. I used a small amount of the mandarin juice in the balsamic mixture. Serve immediately or chill.
