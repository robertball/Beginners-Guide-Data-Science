Ingredients:
2 medium raw eggplant, cut into 1/2 inch rounds
3 cups marinara sauce
24 leaf/leaves basil, large
1 1/4 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the broiler.  Put the eggplant in a single layer on a baking sheet and spray with nonstick spray.
Broil until well browned, about 4 minutes.
Turn the rounds over, spray again, and broil.
Remove from oven and reduce heat to 375.
Spread 1 cup marinara sauce in a shallow 11x14-inch baking dish.
Add eggplant rounds, overlapping slightly.
Top with remaining 2 cups sauce, the the basil leaves and then cheese.
Bake until sauce is heated through and the cheese has begun to brown, about 20 minutes.  Let stand about 10 minutes before cutting.
