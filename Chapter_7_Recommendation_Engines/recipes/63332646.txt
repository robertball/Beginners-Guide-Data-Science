Ingredients:
4 cups or roughly 1/2 seedless watermelon, cubed
2 cups or roughly 2 cucumbers, sliced and cut
1/2 cup finely chopped red onion
3 TBS each sushi vinegar, white wine vinegar and fresh lime juice
1/4 cup, or roughly one handful, mint leaves
1/2 cup feta cheese

Directions:
Cube the watermelon. Peel the cucumber in a striped pattern lengthwise, leaving just thin streaks of skin. Slice in half lengthwise, then cut into 1/4" slices, so that you have half-moons. Finely chop red onion. Place watermelon, cucumber, and onion in large bowl.
Mix together the vinegars and lime juice, then add the whole mint leaves. Muddle the mint by vigorously stirring and pressing the leaves with a spoon until they look bruised but aren't falling apart. Remove mint leaves.
Drizzle the dressing over the salad and gently toss. Sprinkle the feta cheese on top and gently toss once more.
