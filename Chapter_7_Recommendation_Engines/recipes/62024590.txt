Pour olive oil into (medium heat)skillet. Add onion and garlic saute' for a few minutes. In the meantime, remove any fat/cartilage from chicken.

Push onion and garlic to side of pan and add chicken. Brown on both sides. Add broth. Sprinkle spices on chix. Add beans. With sturdy spoon, smash approximately 1/2 of the beans into a paste mixing all ingredients together and over chix. Simmer approx. 5 more minutes or until chix is done. Serve with pico and sourcream.
