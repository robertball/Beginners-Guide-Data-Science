Ingredients:
1 cup cooked spaghetti squash
1/2 cup cooked pumpkin
2 cups frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
3 ounces cooked lump crab meat
1/8 teaspoon dried parsley
1/8 teaspoon dry mustard
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
cooking spray
3 egg whites
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Place spaghetti squash and pumpkin in a blender and process until well combined. Transfer to a mixing bowl.
Add spinach and crab meat to squash mixture. Add parsley, mustard, cinnamon, onion powder, and garlic powder and mix thoroughly and evenly. Set aside.
Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Spray generously with cooking spray. Add egg whites, making sure they spread to cover the entire pan. Cook until mostly set, about 2 minutes. Spoon squash mixture over 1/2 of the eggs. Add hot pepper sauce. Fold eggs over, covering the contents of the omelet. Cook to desired crispness, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a large plate and serve.
