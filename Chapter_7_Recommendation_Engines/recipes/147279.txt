Ingredients:
1/2 cup KRAFT Greek Vinaigrette Dressing
2 tablespoons KRAFT Mayo Real Mayonnaise
1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 medium red onion, cut into small wedges
1 medium lemon, halved

Directions:
Combine dressing and mayo; pour into large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken; seal bag. Turn bag over several times to evenly coat chicken with the dressing mixture. Refrigerate at least 20 minutes or up to 2 hours to marinate.
Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade; discard bag and marinade. Thread chicken and onions alternately onto 16 wooden skewers.
Grill 8 to 10 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, turning occasionally. Meanwhile, place lemon, cut-sides down, on grill grate next to kabobs. Squeeze lemon juice over kabobs just before serving.
