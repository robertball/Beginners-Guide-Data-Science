Ingredients:
3 cups rolled oats
1 cup chopped cashews
1/3 cup shredded coconut
1/3 cup chopped dried mixed fruit
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons honey
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
5 tablespoons miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix oats, cashews, coconut, and mixed fruit together in a large bowl.
Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir honey into melted butter until smooth; add oats mixture and stir to coat. Sprinkle cocoa powder over the oats mixture; stir. Drizzle vanilla extract over the mixture; stir. Season mixture with a pinch of salt.
Spread oats mixture in a single layer onto a baking sheet; toast in preheated oven, stirring once about halfway through, until crisp, about 10 minutes.
Cool oats mixture to room temperature. Transfer to an airtight container, add chocolate chips, and stir.

Description: 
Serve with yogurt and/or milk. One serving is pretty hefty for me, but it's so low in calories, you can probably afford 2 servings at one go.
