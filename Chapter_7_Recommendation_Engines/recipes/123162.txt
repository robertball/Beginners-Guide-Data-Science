Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
3/4 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup ketchup
3/4 cup chopped dill or sweet pickles
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
12 hot dog buns, split

Directions:
In a saucepan, cook the beef and onion until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in ketchup, pickles, salt, pepper, garlic powder and hot pepper sauce; heat through. Stir in cheese. Place about 1/3 cupful on six buns; serve immediately. Cover and refrigerate remaining meat mixture until cool. Fill the remaining buns; wrap individually in heavy-duty foil and seal tightly. Freeze for up to 3 months. To use frozen sandwiches: Bake in foil at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until heated through.

Description: 
'I developed these 'fun buns' about 20 years ago when our four children were preteens,' explains Marie Hass from Madison, Wisconsin. 'Once they started high school, I kept some in the freezer for quick suppers when after-school, I kept them from eating with the rest of the family.'
