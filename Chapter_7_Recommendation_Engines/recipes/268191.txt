Ingredients:
Spice Mix:
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
Tagine:
1 large onion, cut into 1/8-inch slices
1 large potato, peeled and sliced 1/8-inch thick
2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/8-inch slices
2 small zucchini, cut into 1/8-inch slices
1 large green bell pepper, cut into 1/8-inch slices
3 medium tomatoes, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 pound turkey breast, cut into 3/4-inch chunks
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Combine paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper in a small bowl to make spice mix.
Spread 1/2 of the onion slices in the bottom of a 10-inch skillet. Arrange potato slices in one layer on top, overlapping if needed. Repeat with carrots, zucchini, bell pepper, and tomatoes. Sprinkle garlic over tomatoes. Place turkey chunks on top, taking care to space them evenly over the whole dish. Sprinkle spice mix over turkey, top with remaining onion slices, and drizzle vegetable oil on top.
Cover skillet and cook over medium-low heat until turkey is no longer pink in the center and the top layer of onion slices is soft and translucent, about 40 minutes. Remove lid and let stand for 10 minutes. Drizzle with olive oil just before serving.

Description: 
In Morocco, the family gathers around this communal dish and tears off pieces of bread to scoop up bites of the stew. This recipe is named for the family I lived with in Fez. Be sure to use a skillet with a convex lid! Serve with lots of soft pitas. Be careful not to burn your fingers!
