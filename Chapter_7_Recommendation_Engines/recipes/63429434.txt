Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 small package of spinach (approximately 5 oz.)
6-8 slices of mozzarella cheese, shredded (I just tear up the slices myself)
Half of small container of sundried tomato pieces (approximately 10 pieces of tomato)
1 tsp. olive oil
Pinch of garlic powder
Pinch of onion powder
Pinch of red pepper flakes
Pinch of basil
Pinch of oregano
Pinch of salt
Pinch of pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F (170C).
Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium high heat.  Add spinach to skillet, and heat until slightly wilted.  Remove from heat and set aside.
In a large bowl, beat eggs and add spices.  Stir in spinach, tomato, and cheese (if desired, leave a small amount of cheese to add to top of mixture once it is in the pan).
Pour mixture into 8" nonstick round pan (or grease a regular pan).  Ensure that tomato, spinach, and cheese is evenly distributed in the pan.  Sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Bake at 375F for 25-30 minutes, or until edges turn slightly brown and mixture is set in center.
Remove from oven and let frittata sit for 5-10 minutes before serving.
