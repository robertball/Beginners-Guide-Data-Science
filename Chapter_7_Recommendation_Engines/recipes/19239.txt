1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup canned pumpkin puree

1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt

1 (16 ounce) container cream cheese frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter flavored shortening and sugar. Beat in the egg and vanilla, then stir in the pumpkin puree. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and vanilla instant pudding mix; gradually mix into the pumpkin mixture.

Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned at the edges. Allow to cool completely before frosting with cream cheese frosting.
