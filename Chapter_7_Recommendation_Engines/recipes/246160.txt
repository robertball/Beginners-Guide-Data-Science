Ingredients:
2 very ripe bananas
5 egg whites
1/2 cup almond butter
1/4 cup coconut oil
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 cup coconut flour
1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pinch sea salt
cooking spray

Directions:
Blend bananas, egg whites, almond butter, coconut oil, and almond extract together in a food processor until smooth. Add pumpkin puree, coconut flour, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, ginger, and sea salt. Pulse until batter is just combined.
Heat a skillet over medium-low heat; spray with cooking spray. Drop 2 large spoonfuls of batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
