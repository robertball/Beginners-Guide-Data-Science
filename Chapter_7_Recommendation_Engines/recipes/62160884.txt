Directions:
Chicken Prep:  cube chicken into bite-size pieces, combine vinegar, 1/4 Cup non-roasted curry powder, tamarind juice, pepper and salt with chicken in a mixing bowl.  Stir and let sit until ready to be added for cooking.
Roasting Curry Powder:  Heat  3 tbs. non-roasted curry powder in small pan at medium heat until browned.
In frying pan or large wok at medium temperature, heat and stir fry the coconut oil with onions, green chilies, cardamoms, cloves, curry leaves, ginger powder, and cinnamon stick until onions are browned, adding garlic just before the mixture is browned as well.  Add Chicken mixture, water and tomato paste.  Stir and simmer until meat is thoroughly cooked.  Reduce heat to medium-low, add roasted curry powder and stir until evenly dispersed.  Then gradually stir in coconut milk: try to avoid coconut milk from curdling.  Simmer on medium low for another couple of minutes.  Serve with Basmati or Jasmine Rice and any other curried dish!
