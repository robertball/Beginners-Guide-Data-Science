Ingredients:
1/3 cup peanut butter
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons vinegar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
4 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodle soup (seasoning packets reserved for another use)
1/2 small cucumber, peeled and cut into matchsticks
1 green onion, thinly sliced
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
2 tablespoons chopped salted peanuts

Directions:
Stir peanut butter, vegetable oil, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, sugar, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until smooth.
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bit, about 3 minutes; drain and transfer noodles to a bowl. Pour peanut butter sauce over the noodles and toss to coat. Stir cucumber and green onion into the noodle mixture; garnish with cilantro and peanuts.
