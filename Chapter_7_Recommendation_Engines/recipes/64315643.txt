Ingredients:
8 ounces uncooked chorizo sausage, casings removed if present
1/2 cup chopped onion (1 medium)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 15 ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 14 1/2 ounce can diced tomatoes, undrained
1/4 cup snipped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoons chopped canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce*
1 15 ounce can pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese with jalapeno peppers (2 ounces)
Lime wedges
Scoop-shape tortilla chips or mini sweet peppers, halved and seeded

Directions:
In a medium skillet cook sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until sausage is brown, using a wooden spoon to break up meat as it cooks. Remove mixture from skillet; drain on paper towels.
In a medium bowl combine sausage mixture, black beans, tomatoes, cilantro, and chipotle peppers. In a 1-1/2-quart slow cooker mash pinto beans. Top with tomato mixture and sprinkle with cheese.
Cover and cook on low-heat setting for about 4 hours or on high-heat setting for about 2 hours or until bubbly.
Serve immediately or keep warm, covered, on warm-heat or low-heat setting for up to 2 hours. Serve dip with lime wedges and tortilla chips.

Description: 
Because chile peppers contain volatile oils that can burn your skin and eyes, avoid direct contact with them as much as possible. When working with chile peppers, wear plastic or rubber gloves. If your bare hands do touch the chile peppers, wash your hands well with soap and warm water.
