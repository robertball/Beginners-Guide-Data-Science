Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons butter
4 shallots, minced (or 1/2 an onion)
2 carrots, peeled and diced
1 stalk celery, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 small/1lrg tray fresh mushrooms, sliced
½ cup whole grain barley
4 cups broth (I used 1 Veg-beef cube and 1Tbsp Epicure veg broth w/4Cups water)
½ – 1 teaspoon salt (if using homemade broth add more, if using store bought broth add less)
Pepper, to taste
¼ cup heavy cream

Directions:
In a large soup pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the shallots, carrots, and celery and cook until softened but not brown, about 5 to 6 minutes.
Add the garlic and mushrooms to the pot and cook while stirring for 5 minutes more.
Add the barley, broth, salt, and pepper to the pot and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook until the barley is tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.
Stir in heavy cream and serve warm.
Store the leftovers in the fridge or freezer.
