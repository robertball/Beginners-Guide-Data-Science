Set chicken on can, inserting can into the cavity of the chicken. Baste chicken with the melted, seasoned butter.

Description: 
A whole chicken is seasoned and slowly cooked on the grill. This is a bit unorthodox, but the end result is moist, flavorful, and amazing. All you'll need is some chicken, butter, beer, and seasonings.
