Ingredients:
3 shallots
2-3 stalks of lemongrass
4 cloves of garlic
3-4 fresh habanero peppers
40 dried hot chiles (thai, arbol or similar)
3 teaspoons sugar (white or raw)
2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons vinegar
1 cup peanut oil (approx)
1/4 cup Sriracha sauce (optional)

Directions:
In a food processor or blender, add 1/2 cup of peanut oil and process with the lemongrass until mostly smooth.
Add the shallot, garlic, habaneros and chiles and process lightly, leaving slightly chunky.  If possible, remove the seeds from the dried chiles, this will reduce the bitterness in the final sauce.  Leave the seeds in the habaneros.
Transfer to a pot over medium heat and cook until the mixture starts sizzling, then reduce the heat to low so it is just slightly bubbling.  Add more of the remaining oil to keep the mixture completely covered as it cooks.
Cook for 10-15 minutes or until the mixture darkens slightly and the oil takes on a red/orange color.
Once the sauce has darkened and become highly fragrant, remove from the heat and add the vinegar, sugar and fish sauce, stirring to mix well.
If a hotter sauce is desired, up to 1/4 cup of Sriracha sauce can be added.  Alternately, more habanero peppers can be used for a sauce that will be both hotter and more flavorful.

Description: 
Not a traditional Sate sauce strictly speaking, but an adaptation based on what I had in my kitchen at the time.  It's not too spicy with lots of sweet and savory undertones.  Fantastic on noodles and rice, great mixed with sour cream and put on baked potatoes or burgers.
