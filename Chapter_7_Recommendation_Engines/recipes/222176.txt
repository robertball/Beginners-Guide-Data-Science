Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
4 cloves garlic, minced
6 ears fresh corn, kernels cut from cob
3/4 cup milk
1 cup crumbled blue cheese

Directions:
Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir the garlic briefly in the butter mixture, about 1 minute. Stir corn into butter and oil to coat; cook and stir until warmed, about 3 minutes. Pour milk into the skillet; bring to a simmer. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until hot, about 10 minutes.
Remove the cover from the skillet and continue cooking until the liquid is mostly evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Add blue cheese; cook and stir until the cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes.
