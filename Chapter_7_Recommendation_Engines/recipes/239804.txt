Ingredients:
8 ounces white chocolate, chopped
1/2 cup toffee baking bits
1/3 cup chocolate-covered toffee bits, or more to taste
2 teaspoons finely ground coffee beans

Directions:
Butter a baking sheet and line the baking sheet with waxed paper.
Melt white chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Stir in toffee bits, chocolate-covered toffee bits, and coffee. Remove from heat and spread into prepared baking dish. Refrigerate until hardened, about 1 hour; break into pieces.

Description: 
Super-easy and yummy toffee. I make mine during the holidays for unexpected guests or as a hostess gift. If you can't find plain toffee bits, go ahead and use the chocolate-covered for both toffee needs below.
