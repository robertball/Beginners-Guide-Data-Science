Ingredients:
oil
1 onion, diced
1 pound ground turkey
1 16 oz. jar chunky salsa (I use Nature's Promise Medium Salsa) or about 2 cups
1 (10 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 can black beans, drained
1 can green chiles
1/2 - 3/4 cup plain yogurt
1 packet taco seasoning (which is 3 Tbsp) (I use the lower sodium one)
2 cups crushed tortilla chips
2 cups Mexican cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Cook the onion in oil until they are starting to turn translucent.  Add ground turkey & taco seasoning.  Cook until turkey is cooked through.  Break up turkey while you are cooking it.
In a bowl, mix salsa, corn, bean, chiles, sour cream & turkey.  Mix well.
In a 9x13 pan, layer half of the turkey mixture, 1/2 of the chips, 1/2 of the cheese.  Repeat.
Cover with foil.  Bake covered for 15 minutes.  Remove foil.  Bake for another 5 to 10 minutes until cheese melts & starts to brown.
