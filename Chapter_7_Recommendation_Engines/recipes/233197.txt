Ingredients:
Non-stick cooking spray
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 large eggs
1 cup HERDEZ® Traditional Chipotle Mexican Cooking Sauce
1 cup hot water
1 1/2 teaspoons instant coffee granules
Chocolate Drizzle:
1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
6 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a Bundt pan with non-stick cooking spray.
Sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and cocoa in a large bowl. Set aside.
Mix together sugar, oil, eggs, and chipotle sauce in a separate bowl.
Dissolve instant coffee in hot (not boiling) water. Stir into egg mixture.
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients; mix just until moistened. Pour batter into prepared Bundt pan.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cake cool in pan before inverting onto a serving plate.
To make glaze, combine chocolate morsels, butter, and corn syrup in microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute; stir. Continue microwaving on high in 30 second increments, stirring afterwards each time.
To serve, slice cake and top with chocolate drizzle.
