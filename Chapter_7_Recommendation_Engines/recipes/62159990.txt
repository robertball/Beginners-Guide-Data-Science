Ingredients:
1/2 yellow onion diced
1 sweet banana pepper diced
1/2 pound of bulk breakfast sausage
8 eggs scrambled
8 oz. of grated extra sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 c. sour cream
1/2 can of chili with no beans (I used Wolf brand)
2 large handfuls of white tortilla chips broken up into smaller pieces (bite sized)
1/2 tsp. cumin
1/2 tsp. ground red pepper (more or less depending on how hot you like it)
1/4 stick of butter

Directions:
Saute onion, pepper and sausage in non-stick pan,  drain and set aside.  Mix eggs in separate bowl adding cumin and ground red pepper to the eggs.  In a 12 inch cast iron skillet melt butter on med-low heat.  Add the 1/2 can of chili and heat.  Once heated add the sausage mixture, eggs and crushed tortilla chips,  stir together. Cover and leave standing for about ten minutes until almost set.  Spread sour cream on top and add cheese.  Cook another 5 minutes or so and serve. (You could place it in the oven to finish cooking as well.)

Description: 
I was craving mexican food at breakfast time one morning and I had just picked my first banana pepper from my garden,  so I came up with this.  We loved it,  although it is very rich!
