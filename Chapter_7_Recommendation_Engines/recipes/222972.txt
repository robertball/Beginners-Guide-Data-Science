Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup beer
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups sweetened flaked coconut
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Beat flour, beer, egg, and salt in a bowl with an electric mixer on low until batter is smooth. Spread coconut flakes in a shallow dish.
Dip shrimp into beer batter, shaking off excess, then press into coconut. Place shrimp onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking, 3 to 4 minutes. Fry about a third of the shrimp in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Allow shrimp to drain on a wire rack set over paper towels. Repeat with remaining shrimp.
