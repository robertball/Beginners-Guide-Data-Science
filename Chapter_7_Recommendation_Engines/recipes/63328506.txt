Ingredients:
1 package yellow or strawberry cake mix
1-1/3 cups guava juice
3 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
8oz cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 small package Cool Whip, defrosted
2 cups guava juice
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Bake the cake according to the package instructions, substituting guava juice for the water.  Modify the measurements for guava juice, eggs and vegetable oil accordingly.
Cut the cream cheese into quarters and warm in a microwave for 20 to 30 seconds.  Turn each piece 180Â° then warm again for another 20 seconds or until very soft.
In a medium mixing bowl beat the cream cheese with a hand or stand mixer until fluffy.  Add sugar and vanilla then continue beating until combined.  Gently fold in the Cool Whip until combined then refrigerate until ready to use.
In a medium saucepan combine guava juice and sugar then set aside.  Make a paste of the cornstarch and water then set aside.
Bring the guava juice and sugar to a boil. Remove the guava juice from heat and whisk in the cornstarch paste.  Return to heat and bring to a boil again then boil for one minute more.
Remove from heat and refrigerate until cool.
Thickly ice the cake with all of the cream cheese mixture.  Glaze the top with the guava gel.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.
