Set one slice of bread on a work surface. Top bread with 1 slice cheese, apple slices, bacon slices, and remaining 1 slice cheese. Place remaining bread slice on top.

Description: 
This unlikely combination is delicious with fresh fall apples. This recipe requires high quality ingredients. I recommend a Vermont aged Cheddar cheese and Honeycrisp apples. Your favorite apple would work too!
