Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package uncooked rotini pasta
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped
4 ears fresh sweet corn, kernels cut from the cob
2 limes, zested and juiced
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the rotini, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in the corn, lime zest, and lime juice. Season with cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Continue cooking until corn is warmed through and tender. Toss pasta with the corn mixture and Cheddar cheese. Serve hot, or cover and refrigerate and serve as a cold salad.

Description: 
I came up with this one night out of necessity and cannot stop eating it! It's good hot or cold, and you can add or change things. Bring a big bowl to a potluck and watch it disappear!
