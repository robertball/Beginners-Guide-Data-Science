Ingredients:
Patties:
1lb Hamburger (not lean)
1/4 cup GRATED onions
salt/pepper to taste
Gravy:
1 can GOOD quality beef broth
flour for thickening
1 tb real butter
4 eggs
hot cooked sticky rice (at least enough for 2 large scoops each plate)

Directions:
Burgers:
1. Gently mix the hamburger, grated onions and salt/pepper. Form either 2 big patties or 4 smaller size patties.
2. Heat frying pan until very hot.
3. Place hamburger patties on the pan/grill and let sear just until juices start appearing on the top. Flip over and cook for a couple more minutes. You will want the burger slightly charred but still tender on the inside.
4. Place burgers on the side.
Gravy:
1. Pour a little broth into the same pan and incorporate the yumyums, then pour in the rest of the broth.
2. Bring to a boil and let reduce for about 3-5 minutes or so, depending on taste, for a more potent gravy.
3. Turn down heat to a simmer.
4. Add couple dashes of worcestershire sauce.
5. In a seperate bowl, mix flour with some water.
6. Using a whisk, slowly whisk in the flour/water mixture until gravy is nicely thick & smooth.
7. Turn off heat and mix in the butter until well blended.
Eggs:
Traditionally, the eggs should be sunny-side up, but can be prepared to your personal taste. Personally I prefer a runny yolk on my moco.
Assembly (bottom -> top):
