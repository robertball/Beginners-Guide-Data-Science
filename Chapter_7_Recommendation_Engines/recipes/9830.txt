Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 cup peanut butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Cream together butter and brown sugar. Beat in eggs, peanut butter and vanilla.
Add flour, cornstarch, salt, baking soda and baking powder.  Stir in chocolate chips.
Roll into balls about 1 1/2 teaspoonfuls (or use cookie scoop) and place onto ungreased cookie sheets about 2 inches apart.  Flatten slightly because they do not flatten much while cooking.
Bake for 10 minutes.
