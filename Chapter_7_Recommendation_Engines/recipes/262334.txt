Description: 
Of all of our recipes our chili is probably the one most remembered in our family. A nice spicy chili for those who like it hot. It cooks slowly overnight to make a tender, thick, and flavorful dish. The recipe calls for tofu but we have used chicken as well and it can be substituted out evenly. This chili can be cooked and frozen for later use. It just seems to get better and better the more it is reheated.
