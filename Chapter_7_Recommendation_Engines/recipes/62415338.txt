Ingredients:
1 cup baking soda
1 cup vinegar
4 cups boiling water

Directions:
Pour baking soda into drain and then pour vinegar on top of it. Let it sit for 30 minutes. Pour boiling water down the drain. You may need to repeat this process if your drain doesn’t come unclogged the first time. This will clean out a lot of clogs so try it first before running to the store to buy a commercial drain opener.
Tip: Don’t throw away the baking soda used to freshen your fridge. Use it as a cleaning scrub or pour down your drain to clear clogs.
