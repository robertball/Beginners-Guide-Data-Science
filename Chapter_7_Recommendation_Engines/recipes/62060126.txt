Zucchini Boats on the Grill Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 medium zucchini, blanched whole
1 slice of white or French bread, torn into small pieces
4 Tablespoons bacon bits, preferably real bacon
1 Tablespoon minced black olive
1 jalapeno pepper, finely minced (if you want to add some zip)
2 - 3 Tablespoons canned diced green chili (if you want to add just a hint of zip)
4 Tablespoons minced onion
1/4 cup chopped tomato, use a nice ripe juicy one
6 T. shredded sharp cheddar cheese
A pinch of basil, fresh or dried
Seasoning salt, to taste
pepper, to taste

Directions:
Pre-heat one side of your grill to hot.
Blanch the whole zucchini in boiling water for 5 minutes.  Pull out of the water and set aside to cool down while you prepare the other ingredients.
When other ingredients are ready, cut zucchini in half lengthwise and scoop out the pulp; leaving a scant 1/4" of zucchini to make the boat.
Chop the pulp; reserving any juices.
Combine with the chopped ingredients.  Stuff the boats so the mixture forms a nice mound.  Wrap each boat individually in foil.  Grill on the "cool" side of the hot grill for 15 - 20 minutes or until nice and tender. Be careful opening the foil packets!
A couple of personal notes:
I don't actually use exact proportions when I make these.  The proportions above are merely to get you started.
If you like other flavor combinations, use them.
To make transporting the packets to and from the grill easier, I put the foil packets on my large bbq fish grill pan.
