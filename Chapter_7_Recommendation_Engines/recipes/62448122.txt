Ingredients:
1 cup all purpose flour
2/3 cup sugar
4 large eggs
1 tart apple (Granny Smith will work well)
1 tsp butter (to coat the pan)
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
1) Heat (because preheat should not be a word as one cannot heat something before they heat it) oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 Celsius).
2) Mix flour, sugar, eggs, cinnamon, and vanilla in a bowl until smooth.  This can be done with a wooden spoon or a mixer, depending upon the amount of noise you feel privy to tolerating.
3) Thickly coat a standard pie pan in butter.  Make certain the sides are well coated, also.
4) Peel the apple and cut it into four large pieces, removing the core and throwing it away.
5) Cut the four slices of apple into very thin pieces, arranging them from the center outward into a rose-like shape that covers the bottom of the pan.
6) Pour the batter into the pan, smoothing out the top.
7) Place in oven and bake for 25 - 30 minutes, or until a toothpick will come out of the center clean.
8) Pull out and flip onto a plate.
9) Remove pan and let cool.
10) Slice up, serve, and enjoy!

Description: 
Essentially Russian apple pie, sharlotka is a result of the harsh Russian climate being able to produce very few fruits.  You will find that the majority of northern European countries use apples as the main ingredient in many of their recipes, because apples will grow in a short amount of time and can weather a frost or two.
