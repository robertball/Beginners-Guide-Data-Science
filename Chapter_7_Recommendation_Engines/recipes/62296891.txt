Garlic Creams Recipe

Ingredients:
1 large HEAD of garlic, cloves separated, but not skinned.
2 Cups thick cream
Some Grated Nutmeg
Some Salt
Some freshly milled black pepper
4 egg yolks
You will also need 6 well-oiled ramequins

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
Bring a small pan of water to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Drop in the garlic cloves and simmer for 5 minutes.
Remove from the water, let cool, take off the skins and crush the insides with a fork.
In another pan, bring the cream to a simmer, then add the crushed garlic.
Add a little nutmeg, salt and pepper and stir well.
Remove from the heat, let cool as we don't want the eggs to cook yet and beat in the 4 egg yolks.
Pour the mixture into the ramequins and place them into a roasting pan, on top of a sheet or two of kitchen paper (This stops the build-up of bubbles that might joggle the ramequins as they cook).
Add boiling water to the roasting pan until the water comes 2/3 up the sides of the ramequins.
Cook in the oven for 20 minutes or until set.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool for a good 10 minutes before unmoulding (although you could leave them in the ramequins and serve them on the plate that way)
