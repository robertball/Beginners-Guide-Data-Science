Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 cups milk
6 eggs
1 1/2 cups flour

1 pint basket strawberries, sliced
2 plums, pitted and sliced
2 nectarines, pitted and sliced
Powdered sugar
Lemon wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
Place butter in a 12-inch shallow, ovenproof skillet and melt in oven. Watch carefully to avoid burning.
Meanwhile, in a blender, whirl together milk, eggs, flour, granulated sugar and salt until smooth.
Remove skillet from oven and swirl butter to coat sides of pan; pour in milk mixture.
Return to oven; bake until puffed and golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes.
While Dutch Baby is baking, combine fruit and sweeten with powdered sugar as desired. When baked, remove pancake from oven and dust with powdered sugar.
Spoon fruit onto center of pancake. Cut into wedges and serve immediately with lemon wedges.

Description: 
A Dutch baby is a classic breakfast dish that is a cross between a pancake and a souffle. Made with eggs, flour, sugar, and milk, the humble batter puffs and browns in the oven to create a dish that is beautiful and perfectly paired with a topping of lightly sweetened fruit, a squeeze of lemon, and a dusting of powdered sugar.
