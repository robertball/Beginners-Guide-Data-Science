Description: 
This is a recipe I developed on Mother's Day! My mum was actually out of town at the time, but I came up with the recipe with the plan to serve them to her when she got back. In the picture, I have garnished one of the cookies with a pecan half and chocolate syrup drizzled over the top. They are really good this way. But they are fantastic plain, too, especially when they are fresh out of the oven and warm! Enjoy!
