Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) pork tenderloin
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
1 cup water
3 tablespoons minced garlic
3 tablespoons soy sauce
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place pork tenderloin in a slow cooker with the contents of the soup packet. Pour water, wine, and soy sauce over the top, turning the pork to coat. Carefully spread garlic over the pork, leaving as much on top of the roast during cooking as possible. Sprinkle with pepper, cover, and cook on low setting for 4 hours.
Slice into 1/2 inch pieces and then cookie cutter the slices into shapes. Serve with the cooking liquid as au jus if you like.

Description: 
This is so nice and easy for a busy mom or dad to just pop in the slow cooker and enjoy for dinner. My kids love this recipe. I cut out the red wine for them and I like to make the meat into shapes. When I cut them small they feel like nuggets to the kids.Modified from: Amazing Pork Tenderloin in the Slow Cooker
