Ingredients:
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons margarine, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/3 cup maple flavored syrup
2 cups baking mix
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 egg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 C).
Mix cream cheese, confectioner's sugar, and margarine or butter.  Reserve.
Mix brown sugar, nuts, and syrup in ungreased 13x9x2 inch pan. Spread evenly.
Mix baking mix, milk, white sugar, and egg until dough forms. Beat vigorously 20 strokes. Gently smooth dough into a ball on a cloth-covered board dusted with baking mix. Knead 8 times.
Roll the dough out into a 16x9 inch rectangle. Spread with the cream cheese mixture. Carefully fold the dough lengthwise into thirds. Press edges to seal securely. Cut into 16 1-inch strips. Gently twist ends of strips in opposite directions. Arrange on the brown sugar mixture.
Bake at 425 degrees F (220 C) until brown, about 15 minutes. Invert on a heatproof serving plate. Refrigerate any remaining rolls.
