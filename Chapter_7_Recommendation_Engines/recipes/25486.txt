Ingredients:
1 gallon dill pickle slices, drained
5 pounds white sugar
2 tablespoons pickling spice
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Remove and reserve half the pickles from their container. Pour approximately 1/2 the sugar over the pickles. Pour in 1 tablespoon pickling spice and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Repeat with remaining pickles, sugar, pickling spice and cinnamon.
Seal the jar and refrigerate. Turn approximately every six hours for 24 hours to help dissolve the sugar. Serve when the sugar has dissolved.

This is an easy recipe for homemade sweet pickles without the fuss. It takes a while for all the sugar to dissolve, but it's worth the wait.
