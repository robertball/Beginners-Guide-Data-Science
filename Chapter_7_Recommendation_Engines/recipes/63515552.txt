Melt together the butter, 1 lb of chocolate chips, and the unsweetened chocolate in a medium bowl over simmering water.  Allow to cool slightly, in a large bowl, stir (do not beat) together the eggs, coffee granules, vanilla, and sugar.  Stir the warm chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and allow to cool to room temperature.
In a medium bowl, sift together 1 cup of flour, the baking powder, and salt.  Add to the cooled chocoalte mixture.  Toss the remaining 12 ounces of chocolate chips in a medium bowl with 1/4 cup of the flour, then add them to the chocolate batter.  Pour into the prepared sheet pan.

Bake for about 10 to 15 minutes more or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Do not overbake!  Allow to cool thoroughly.  refrigerate, and cut into large squares.
