Ingredients:
6 graham crackers
1 cup blanched slivered almonds
1 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup packed light brown sugar
11 (1.55 ounce) bars milk chocolate candy bar, chopped

Directions:
Preheat over to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Spray 11 x 15 inch jelly roll pan with non-stick spray.
Completely cover with a single layer of graham crackers. Sprinkle with almonds.
Combine butter, vanilla, and brown sugar in a heavy saucepan. Place over medium heat and bring to a full boil, stirring constantly. Boil for 1 minute.
Carefully pour evenly over crackers (this mixture is hot!).   Bake for 8 minutes. Let cool for 3 to 4 minutes.
Evenly space chocolate bars over cracker/toffee mixture. Wait 1 minute and spread chocolate to cover.  When completely cool, cut into 2 inch squares or break into pieces.
