Ingredients:
5 lb bag potatos
4 cups Miracle Whip (Mayonaise)
4 tbsp mustard
2 to 3 tbsp celery seeds
6 chopped, hard boiled eggs
2 to 4 stalks of green onion, chopped

Directions:
Cut up and boil potatos, let cool.
Boil eggs and let cool.
Mix miracle whip, mustard, celery seeds, onions and 4 of the chopped eggs together in a bowl.
If possible, let mixture sit overnight in refrigerator before mixing with potatos. This lets the flavours of the seeds and eggs intermix.
Pour mixture over potatos and mix to coat.
Slice up remaining eggs and use to garnish the top of the salad.
