Description: 
I saw this dessert on a TV show but was unable to find a complete recipe anywhere so I did a mix-and-match and came up with this.  It is a standard crust recipe with Pop Rocks added and the filling is a basic no-bake concoction.  When the crust touches your tongue the Pop Rocks immediately explode.  Definitely a flashback to childhood.  Enjoy!
