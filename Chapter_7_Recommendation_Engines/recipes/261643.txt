Ingredients:
1 cup dried cranberries
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup boiling water
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
Place cranberries, orange zest, and baking soda in a bowl. Pour boiling water on top. Let stand at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Mix brown sugar, oil, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Add the cranberry mixture and beat well.
Stir flour and baking powder together in a separate bowl; stir into the cranberry mixture until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips gently. Spoon batter evenly into the prepared tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and tops spring back when touched, 20 to 25 minutes.
