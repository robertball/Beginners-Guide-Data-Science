Ingredients:
2 large baking potatoes
Extra virgin olive oil
Salt-free seasoning blend (Mrs. Dash)

Directions:
Thoroughly scrub potatoes in cold water making sure to remove all dirt.  Pat to dry with a towel.
Holding the potato lengthwise, slice into 1/4 inch slices on the widest side.  (It's helpful to make a small slice on one side to prevent the pototo from rolling back and forth while slicing.)
Lay potato slices flat on a large, moveable surface. (a cookie sheet works nicely) and lightly brush one side with extra virgin olive oil.
Sprinkle lightly oiled potato slices with a moderate amount (or to taste) of "Mrs. Dash" seasoning.
Place on a hot grill, seasoned side down.
Repeat process of lightly brushing with oil and sprinkling on seasoning.
Grill potatoes (lid closed) for approximately 15-20 minutes.  Turn once while grilling.
These go great with any meal that you would typically serve a baked potato.
