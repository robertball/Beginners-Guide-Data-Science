Ingredients:
3 cups cooked cooled short-grain rice
2 eggs beaten  (add 1 teaspoon salt and 3 teaspoon oil)
3 Tablespoons vegetable oil
1 garlic clove minced
1/4 cup green onion (include the white ends)
1/4 cup diced fresh mushroom
1 additional egg
1/3 lb cooked, peel-and-eat shrimp chopped (about 1/2 cup chopped)
1.5 tablespoon ketchup
1 teaspoon garlic chili sauce
1.5 teaspoon paprika
1 tsp white sugar

Directions:
In a bowl, toss the beaten egg mixture with the white rice so that every grain has egg on it. Heat oil in skillet on medium heat. Add the garlic, green onion and mushroom to the pan. Cook about 30 seconds careful not to burn the garlic. Add the rice to the ingredients in the skillet. After about 2 min, stir the rice mixture.
Crack an egg over the mixture and let cook so that there are scrambled bits of egg in the rice.
Add the cooked shrimp to the rice. Let rice fry in the medium heat for 5 min then remove from heat.
Combine the ketchup, garlic chili sauce, paprika and sugar in a separate bowl and mix. Before serving, toss the ketchup mixture into the rice until rice is fully coated.
Serve.

Description: 
A wonderful, restaurant-inspired fried rice! I am a big fan of Din Tai Fung restaurant in Bellevue, WA. Their fried rice is my favorite! Combine their rice with the yum yum sauce at Samurai's Japanese Steakhouse in Tacoma, WA and you have a treat!
