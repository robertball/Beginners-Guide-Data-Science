Ingredients:
1/2 small head cauliflower, broken into florets
3 slices cooked bacon, chopped
3 green onions, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the cauliflower and cook until tender, 5 to 10 minutes; drain and break cauliflower into small pieces. Combine cauliflower, bacon, and green onions together in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
Sift flour into a bowl. Whisk milk, egg, Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt into the flour until smooth. Add milk mixture to cauliflower mixture and stir until batter is evenly combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until golden brown on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
