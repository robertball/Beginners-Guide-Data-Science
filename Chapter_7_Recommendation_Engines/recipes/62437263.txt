Ingredients:
3 lbs quartered tomatoes (romas preferred)
2 or 3 minced jalapenos (seeded and stemmed)
1 cup minced sweet onions
1/2 cup minced cilantro
1/4 cup minced scallions
4 large cloves of minced garlic
juice of 1 lime
1 tsp salt
1 heavy tsp cumin
1 tsp coriander
1 tsp oregano
very light pinch of cinnamon and cloves

Directions:
Simmer tomatoes in a dry saucepan on medium-high heat until reduced by half.  Process with a hand blender or blender.
Add remaining ingredients and allow to mellow as long as possible before using.  Use within 2 weeks if unprocessed.
IF canning, alter the recipe as follows: While tomatoes are simmering, add 1 1/2 Tbs corn starch slurred with a little water into the saucepan and stir thoroughly.  Follow remaining instructions to prepare the salsa.
Process filled hot sterilized pint jars with clean lids for 30 minutes in a hot water bath.  Check for popped lids before storing.  If lids have popped, reprocess or use immediately.

Description: 
Unlike canned salsa, this has the actual taste of Mexico in every bite.  Use this as your condiment in barbeques, baked chicken or fish, nachos, or mix in a garden salad with grilled chicken or beef for a taco salad!  I can this by the gallons so we can have fresh summery salsa all year long.
