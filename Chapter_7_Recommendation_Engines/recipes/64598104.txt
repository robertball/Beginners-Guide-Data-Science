https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1 C Sour Cream
1 C Ricotta Cheese
1 8oz package Cream Cheese
1 jar spaghetti sauce (I like Newman's Own Tomato -Basil)
1 package rigatoni noodle or similar noodles
1 1/2 C Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
1/4 C Grated Parmesan Cheese.
Italian Seasoning, divided (as much as desired)

Directions:
Brown beef. (I also like lots of Italian Seasoning so I season the beef before adding the sauce.)
Add spaghetti sauce, heat thru til warm.
Cook noodles according to directions on the package.
In a bowl, combine cream cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese, and 1 c. of mozzarella cheese. (Again I like lots of Italian seasoning so I put more in here, about 1/2 teaspoon)
Layer starting with beef and sauce, then noodles, then sour cream/cream cheese/cottage cheese mix. I end with the sauce layer and then sprinkle with remaining mozzarella on top.
Repeat layer. Finish off with nice layer of mozzarella cheese and then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and a little more Italian seasoning.
Bake at 350 degrees for about 45 mins.
