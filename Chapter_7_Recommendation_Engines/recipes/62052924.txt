Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 1/2 cups water
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
3 tablespoons butter
6 small - medium baking apples such as Macintosh or Jonathan
2 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
2/3 cup shortening
1/2 cup milk
French vanilla ice cream (optional)

Directions:
In a small saucepan, mix sugar, cinnamon, and water.  Bring to a boil while stirring.  Immediately remove from heat and add butter. Set aside.
Peel and core apples.
Combine flour, salt, and baking powder. Cut in shortening until mixture resemebles coarse crumbs.  Add milk and mix with a fork just until dough forms a ball.  Roll dough into a  12" x 18" rectangle.  (I roll my dough between two pieces of wax paper lightly dusted with flour.)  Cut dough evenly into six squares that are 6" x 6" each.
Place a peeled apple on each dough square.  Sprinkle apple lightly with cinnamon.  Bring four corners of dough square together over top of apple and pinch corners together.  Pinch seams of dough together also so dough pocket is completely sealed.  Carefully place 1" apart in an ungreased 13x17 baking dish.  Pour syrup over apples.  Bake uncovered for 35 - 40 minutes.  Serve warm topped with ice cream.
