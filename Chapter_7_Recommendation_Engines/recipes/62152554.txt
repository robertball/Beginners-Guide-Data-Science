Title:
Very Easy Chicken Stew Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 lb boneless chicken breast (or thighs), or a combo of both
2 jars of chicken gravy (I use Heinz's low-fat)
1 can chicken broth (if desired)
veggies (whatever you desire) - I've used broccoli, carrots, peas, corn, green beans - mostly whatever I have on hand.  You can also use frozen veggies which have been defrosted.
1 onion, chopped
salt & pepper to taste
3 potatoes, cut up, or rice or pasta/noodles

Directions:
Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.  Saute' the chicken and the onion in a large stew pot.  When chicken is no longer pink inside, add the rest of the ingredients.  If you are using potatoes, add them.  If you are using pasta, rice, or noodles, cook them separately, and pour the stew over them when it is done.
I usually let the stew bubble over low heat for about 20 mins.
If you want a thicker stew, do not add the chicken broth.
We find that the stew is not bland because of the seasonings in the gravy.  I find that this is a great way to use up some of the fresh veggies I have on hand!  I like to put this together on a busy day after work.
