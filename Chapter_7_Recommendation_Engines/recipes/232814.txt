Ingredients:
Dressing:
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons water
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
Salad:
1 (10 ounce) package baby spinach
1 (6 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 (15 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
1/3 cup toasted slivered almonds
4 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
1/4 red onion, sliced and separated into rings (optional)
1/4 cup croutons, or as desired (optional)

Directions:
Mix vinegar, sugar, water, butter, and salt together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook and stir until sugar dissolves and mixture is bubbling, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.
Whisk egg into dressing; return saucepan to low heat and simmer until dressing thickens, 5 to 10 minutes.
Combine spinach, mushrooms, mandarin oranges, almonds, bacon, red onion rings, and croutons in a large bowl; pour dressing over salad. Toss to coat.
