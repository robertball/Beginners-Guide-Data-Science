Ingredients:
2/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup cocoa
1/8 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. salt
1 cup milk
4 eggs
7-8 pieces thin-medium sliced wheat bread, homemade preferred

Directions:
Mix all ingredients except the bread with a wire whisk till well blended. Dip each slice of bread into egg mixture until well soaked. Drain a bit with slotted spatula and put onto a lightly buttered no-stick skillet that has been pre-heated over medium heat. Cook about 3-4 minutes on each side flipping only once or until they test done, meaning they are no longer gooey or shiny in the middle when cut in half. When done, cut in half cross wise, sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve with a side of warm cherry or strawberry pie filling and syrup. Cool whip is also an excellent topping.
