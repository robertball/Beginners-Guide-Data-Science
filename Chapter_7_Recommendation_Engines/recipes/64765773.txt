Four Fruit Christmas Salad Recipe

Ingredients:
1 envelope unflavored gelatin
1/2c water
1 1/4c water
3oz cherry (or other red gelatin) gelatin
1/2c sugar
12oz (approximately 3c) fresh cranberries
20oz crushed pineapple, undrained & preferably chilled
2c diced Granny Smith apples, unpeeled
2c mandarin oranges, preferably chilled

Directions:
Sprinkle unflavored gelatin over 1/2c cold water.  Set aside to gel.  In 3qt pot, bring 1 1/2c water to a boil.  Add flavored gelatin & sugar.  Stir to dissolve.  Add cranberries.  Stirring constantly, bring to a boil.  Reduce to low & simmer 5 minutes or until cranberry skins pop.  Refrigerate until the consistency of unbeaten egg whites.  Stir in the pineapple, apples & oranges.
If using equivalent amount of flavored gelatin, no unflavored, could probably reduce sugar to 1/3c.
I wonder how using all unflavored gelatin, cranberry juice instead of water,   sugar decreased to 1/4c would be.
Thanksgiving 2019, I tried with orange gelatin, thinking it would be - well, orange-ish - to go more Thanksgiving.  It wasn't orange or almost orange, & not as good as cherry.  Still good, but much better with cherry.
