Ingredients:
3/4 cup freekeh
1 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1 yellow bell pepper, finely chopped
1 bunch green onions, finely chopped
1 small bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped
4 sprigs fresh mint, chopped
2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds, or to taste (optional)
4 lettuce leaves

Directions:
Rinse freekeh in a sieve under cold running water. Drain. Place into a pot, add water and salt, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until water has been absorbed and freekeh is soft, 15 to 18 minutes.
Transfer freekeh to a bowl. Mix in olive oil and lemon juice. Set aside to cool, about 10 minutes.
Add bell pepper, green onions, parsley, and mint to freekeh; mix well. Stir in lemon zest and pomegranate seeds. Serve on lettuce leaves.
