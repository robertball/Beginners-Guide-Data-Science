Ingredients:
1 stick butter
1 medium onion, minced
Several green onions
2 stalks celery, finely chopped
1 cup raw shrimp, chopped
Small can mushrooms
1/4-pound crabmeat
2 tablespoons parsley, minced
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4-cup cream
Breadcrumbs
Salt and pepper
3 ounces cooking wine, plus 1/4-ounce for basting (alcohol will dissipate during the cooking)
4 flounder, 2- to 2-1/4-pounds each
2 tablespoons oil

Directions:
Sauté the onion and the green onions in butter until soft. Add celery, and sauté 2- to 3-minutes longer. Add shrimp and mushrooms, and sauté until the shrimp are pink. Add crabmeat, parsley, Worcestershire, cream and enough breadcrumbs to hold the dressing together. Season to taste. Make a slit in the flounder. Stuff this pocket with dressing, and close with the aid of small skewers. Heat 2 tablespoons oil along with 2 tablespoons butter in a large flat pan. Place the stuffed fish in pan, and broil under low flame, basting with the butter/oil mixture. Add the remainder of wine to liquid in pan for basting (turning fish is not necessary). Keep the flame low. When the top of the fish is golden brown or slightly darker, the fish will be cooked through. Spoon the remaining sauce from the pan over the fish, and garnish with the parsley and lemon wedges.
