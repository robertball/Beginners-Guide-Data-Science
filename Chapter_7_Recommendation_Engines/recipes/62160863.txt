Ingredients:
1 - 1/4 lbs. Chuck beef cut into stew bits
2 medium Potatoes
1 small Onion
3 cloves Garlic smashed, depappered and minced
1 can Coconut milk
1/4 cup Peanut butter
2 cup Beef broth

Directions:
Chop the beef into stew bit. Prep the garlic. Chop the potatoes into large chunks. Chop the onion coarsely.
Put the potatoes and onions into the crock pot (don’t turn it on yet).
Melt the butter and brown the beef and garlic together in batches if necessary. Add this to the pot. Return the browning pan to the heat and add coconut milk, peanut butter and curry powder. Melt everything together into a smooth paste and bring to a simmer. Add this liquid to the pot and turn the crock pot on.
Add the fish sauce, sugar and beef stock. Stir well, cover and cook.
Cook on high for 2 – 3 hours on low for 4 – 6 hours.

Smooth and delicious beef and potato curry with peanuts. I created a slowcooker version of this famous Thai dish. This is easy to cook and does not take much time to prepare. It goes well with a scented white rice and steamed veggies as a side.
