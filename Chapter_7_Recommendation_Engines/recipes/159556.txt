Ingredients:
3/4 cup pomegranate juice
3/4 cup Shiraz or other dry red wine
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup packed brown sugar, divided

Directions:
Combine the pomegranate juice, wine, and lemon juice in a bowl. Whisk in the cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger. Crumble in half of the brown sugar and whisk mixture until sugar dissolves.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat and swirl to coat the pan. Immediately pour in the juice/spice mixture and increase the heat to high. Bring mixture to a boil while whisking to prevent scorching. Reduce heat to medium and, while stirring, add the remaining brown sugar a little at a time. Cook and stir until mixture thickens to a syrupy consistency or when it can coat the back of a spoon.
Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly and continue to cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir and serve.
