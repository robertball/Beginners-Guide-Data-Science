Ingredients:
1 20 oz package shredded hash browns
3 Tbsp vegetable oil
6 slices of bacon
6 eggs
2 Tbsp fresh chopped chives
1 Tbsp water
8 oz low fat shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat 2 Tbsp oil in a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Add potatoes, press down lightly and cook for about 6 minutes or until potatoes are golden brown on the bottom. Place a plate over the frying pan and carefully invert the potatoes onto it. Add the remaining 1 Tbsp of oil into the frying pan and slide the potatoes (raw side down) back into the frying pan. Cook for an additional 6 minutes, or until golden brown. Lower heat to low.
In the meantime, fry the bacon, drain and crumble.
While the hash browns and bacon are frying, mix the eggs with the chopped chives and water. Scramble the eggs over medium heat until cooked but still moist.
Assemble the pie by sprinkling the bacon over the cooked hash browns, layer the scramble eggs over the bacon and finally, sprinkle cheese over the layer of eggs.
Cover the frying pan and cook for 2 more minutes or until the cheese has melted. Serve immediately.
