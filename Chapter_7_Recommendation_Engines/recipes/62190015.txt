Ingredients:
6 pita breads
1-1/2 pounds ground beef
1 teaspoon ground cumin
Salt and pepper
1 romaine heart, thinly sliced crosswise
1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
6 dill pickle slices
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving
1 cup store-bought hummus

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the beef with the cumin, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; shape into 18 1/4-inch-thick patties.
Preheat a grill to medium-high.
Stack the pitas and wrap in heavy-duty foil; place on the grill and cover to warm.
In another large bowl, combine the romaine, and tomatoes; toss with the olive oil and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.
Remove the pitas from the grill.
Transfer the beef patties to the grill, cover and grill for 2 minutes on each side for medium. Don't overcook or these little slider burgers will be like hockey pucks!  Cooking time shouldn't be more than a couple minutes TOTAL.
Spread each pita with some of the hummus, top with a pickle, 3 patties and some of the salad. Serve with the lemon wedges.
