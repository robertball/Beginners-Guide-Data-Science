Ingredients:
2 cups HERSHEY®'S Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips or HERSHEY®'S Milk Chocolate Chips
1 2/3 cups HERSHEY®'S Raspberry Chips
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 (10 ounce) jar seedless raspberry jam
2 tablespoons raspberry liqueur OR 1 teaspoon raspberry candy flavoring
5 tablespoons whipping cream, or as needed
Coatings (powdered sugar, cocoa, toasted coconut or chopped nuts)

Directions:
Place chocolate chips, raspberry chips and butter in large microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave at HIGH (100%) 1 minute; stir.  If necessary, microwave at HIGH an additional 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth when stirred.  Stir in jam, liqueur and 4 tablespoons whipping cream.  If necessary, add additional whipping cream, one half teaspoon at a time, until mixture is well blended and smooth.
Cover; refrigerate several hours or overnight until chocolate mixture is firm enough to handle.  Roll mixture into 1-inch balls; while still tacky roll in your choice of coating.  Place coated truffle on cookie sheet to set.  Refrigerate several hours or until completely cold; transfer to airtight container.  Store in cool, dry place.  Candy flavor is best after storing for about 1 week.  Truffles also freeze well.
