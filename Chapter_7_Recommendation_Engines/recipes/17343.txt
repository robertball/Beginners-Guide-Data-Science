Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) jar apricot preserves
1 (8 ounce) bottle Russian-style salad dressing
1 packet dry onion soup mix
2 (4 pound) whole chickens, each cut into 8 pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl combine the preserves, salad dressing and soup mix; stir together until well mixed and set aside. Place chicken pieces skin side down in two lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dishes.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1/2 hour.
Brush the skin side of the chicken pieces with the glaze mixture (you will use about 1/2 of the mixture) and return to oven; reduce temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) and bake for another 1/2 hour. Brush with remaining glaze mixture just before serving.

Description: 
This is great on pork tenderloin or ribs. If you wish, the chicken can be partially cooked in the microwave. Serve with a green salad or baked potato, if desired. This is also good at room temperature, but you will ned lots of napkins! Sweet and savory, but not too spicy for kids.
