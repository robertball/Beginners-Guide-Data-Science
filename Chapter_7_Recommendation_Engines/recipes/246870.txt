Description: 
This delicious baked oatmeal is started the day or night before and finished in the morning. It takes a step of extra planning but the reward is better digestion and nutrient absorption. My personal preference is to soak with buckwheat groats and yogurt with no sweetener. I serve it with a large pat of grass-fed butter. Enjoy!
