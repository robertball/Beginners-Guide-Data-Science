Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup shortening
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 10 ounce bag of mint or mint+chocolate chips (about 1 1/2 cups)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large bowl, beat butter, shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla.
Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. Stir into butter mixture until well blended.
Mix in the chips. Drop by a rounded tablespoon onto a greased cookie sheet. (I line my sheet with foil then spray it)
Bake 9-11 minutes, or just until set. Cool on pan for about 2 minutes then cool completely on a wire rack.
