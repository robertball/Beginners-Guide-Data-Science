Ingredients:
1 egg
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup molasses
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup chopped almonds
1/2 cup chopped candied citron

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a  large bowl, beat the egg, brown sugar, honey and molasses until smooth. Combine the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice and baking soda; blend into the molasses mixture. Stir in the almonds and candied citron. Working with 1/4 of the dough at one time, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4 inch in thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Place the cookies at least 1 inch apart onto prepared cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until set. Cool on wire racks and store at room temperature in an airtight container.
