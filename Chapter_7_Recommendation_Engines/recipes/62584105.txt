Ingredients:
3/4 cups salted butter - divided
1 8 oz. package cream cheese
seeds scraped from 1 vanilla bean
4 cups confectioner's sugar
1/2 oz. good bourbon
2 tbsp heavy cream

Directions:
Place 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter in small saucepan on medium heat. Stir occasionally till light to medium brown in color (around 15-20 minutes, depending on the stove). While butter is browning, place remaining 1/4 cup of butter and cream cheese in mixing bowl. Pour browned butter over remaining butter and cream cheese. Allow to sit briefly, giving the warm butter time to soften the cold butter and cream cheese. Scrape vanilla bean and add to bowl. Add bourbon, and mix on low speed until smooth. Gradually add sugar and cream, alternately, until proper consistency is reached. As with many butter creams, you may need slightly more or less sugar, to reach proper consistency.
