Description: 
After they baste in the sun all summer  long, I cut down my basil plants and make this delightful pesto. This basil pesto has been mellowed with fresh spinach and enhanced by the taste of black olives. I make big batches and freeze in small container for the whole year. It will keep in the fridge for a week. Toss with pasta. Spread on meat or sandwiches. Add a spoonful for favoring to lots of recipes. Enjoy!
