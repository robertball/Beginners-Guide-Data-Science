Description: 
'I combined our daughter's two favorite foods--pizza and grilled cheeseburgers--to create this main dish,' says Tanya Gutierro from Beacon Falls, Connecticut. 'It's very simple to make, and she and her friends love it. If you don't like the toppings, replace them with whatever you prefer.'
