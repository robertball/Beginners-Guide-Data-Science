Ingredients:
2 pork chops
1 pound portugues sausage (choirico or linguica) broken into large chunks
2 cans kidney beans, drained
1 can garbonzo beans, drained
5 medium yukon gold potatoes, cubed
1/2 small savory cabbage, sliced
1 medium onion, chopped
2 - 4 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups water
1 bunch fresh kale, sliced (use frozen off season)
3 TBSP Pimenta Moida (hot chopped peppers)
salt and pepper
4 TSP olive oil

Directions:
Saute onion and garlic in the olive oil in the bottom of a soup pan.
Add water, meat, sausage, beans and potatoes, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender.
Once potatoes are tender, taste soup,  add pimenta moida and more salt and pepper.
Add Kale and raise heat back to gentle boil.  Kale only needs about 5 minutes.   You may add some water if the soup got too thick, I like this soup on the brothy side.

Description: 
I merged the best of two family recipes, then fiddled a bit. 
Pretty easy.  Very Spicy if you use hot portugues sausage.

Both the sausage(chourico or linguica and jarred peppers (Pimenta Moida) are available online if you don't have a portugues market in your town. 
I prefer linguica for flavoring soups because is has just a little more fat.  If you trying to limit the fat, stick with chourico.
