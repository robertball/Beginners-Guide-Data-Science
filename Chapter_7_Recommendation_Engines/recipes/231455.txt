Ingredients:
2 Tenderflake® Frozen Deep Dish Pie Shells
4 tablespoons raspberry, blueberry or strawberry jam
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon lemon or orange zest
Fresh raspberry halves, blueberries, or strawberry slices
6 lollipop sticks (4 inch/10 cm long)
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Remove pie shells from freezer and allow to thaw at room temperature for 10 - 15 minutes.
Remove pie shells from foil onto a clean, flat, lightly floured work surface. If cracks appear in pastry, press together and repair using fingers moistened with water.
Mix jam with cornstarch and zest.
Cut out six shapes from each pie shell using a cookie cutter no larger than 3 inches (8 cm) in size.
Press a lollipop stick gently against 6 pastry cut outs. Approximately 1 1/4 to 1 1/2  inches (3 - 4 cm) of stick should overlap the pastry.
Divide jam mixture evenly between 6 cut outs, mounding in centre and leaving a 1/4-inch (5 mm) border. Top jam with a half of a raspberry, 3 blueberries or 1 small strawberry slice.
Brush edges of pastry around the filling with beaten egg. Top with remaining cut outs. Gently press edges together, and crimp with a fork.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until pastry is golden. Allow to cool completely before decorating or serving.
