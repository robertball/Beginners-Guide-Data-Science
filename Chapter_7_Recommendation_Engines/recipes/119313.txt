Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds ground beef
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning
1/3 cup salsa
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup refried beans
1 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese or Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook the beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Add taco seasoning and salsa; simmer, uncovered, until thickened. Meanwhile, unroll crescent roll dough. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; seal perforations. Spread cream cheese over the dough.
Stir the refried beans into beef mixture. Spoon over cream cheese layer. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Sprinkle with cheese; bake 5 minutes longer or until the cheese is melted.
