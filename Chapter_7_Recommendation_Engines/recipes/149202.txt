https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/5747190.jpg
Ingredients:
5 pounds pears - peeled, cored and diced
1/2 cup water
2 cups packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 tablespoons limoncello liqueur

Directions:
Place the pears and water into a pot or large saucepan. Cook over medium heat until pears are soft, about 30 minutes. Sterilize six half-pint jars and keep warm.
Transfer pears to a food processor and pulse until they reach your desired consistency. Return to the pan, and stir in the brown sugar, lemon zest, nutmeg, almond extract and limoncello. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reaches a thick consistency like butter, about 1 hour.
Ladle the pear butter into the sterile jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Seal with lids and rings. Process in a hot water bath for 10 minutes to ensure a seal.

Description: 
Try this sweet, rich colored, butter-like spread made with ripe pears and a hint of lemon Liqueur.  So easy to make and oh so good on toast or hot biscuits. If you prefer a lighter colored butter use white sugar in place of brown sugar.
