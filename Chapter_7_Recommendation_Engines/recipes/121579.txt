Ingredients:
4 medium unpeeled ripe bananas
2 tablespoons flaked coconut
2 tablespoons chopped maraschino cherries
2 tablespoons raisins
2 tablespoons peanut butter chips
1/2 cup miniature marshmallows

Directions:
Cut banana peels lengthwise about 1/2 in. deep and to within 1/2 in. of each end. Open peel to form a pocket. Combine coconut and cherries; spoon into pockets of two bananas. Combine raisins and peanut butter chips; fill remaining bananas. Divide marshmallow between bananas. Wrap each in an 18-in. x 12-in. piece of heavy-duty foil. Grill, uncovered, over medium heat for 10-15 minutes or until marshmallows are melted and golden brown.
