Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup green salsa (such as FronteraÂ® Tomatillo)
15 blue corn tortilla chips
1/2 teaspoon butter
2 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon reduced-fat sour cream

Directions:
Crack eggs in a bowl. Add salt and stir until well combined. Set aside.
Heat salsa in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat to bubbling. Add tortilla chips and flip frequently to coat, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate.
Wipe out the pan and reduce heat to medium-low. Add butter and swirl around the pan to melt. Add eggs; stir frequently with a rubber spatula until scrambled to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes. Place cooked eggs on top of the plated tortilla chips. Top with shredded Cheddar cheese and sour cream.
