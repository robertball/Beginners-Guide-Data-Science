1 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup finely chopped celery
1/4 cup finely chopped red onion

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan and add enough cold water to cover; boil eggs for 10 minutes. Drain. Let eggs cool in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
Mix mayonnaise, celery, onion, mustard, garlic powder, and vinegar in a bowl. Peel eggs and slice in half vertically; remove egg yolks and add to mayonnaise mixture. Mash yolks into mayonnaise mixture, then stir until thick and creamy.
Transfer yolk mixture to a resealable plastic bag. Snip a corner from the bag with scissors and pipe yolk mixture into the egg whites. Sprinkle paprika over eggs. Chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes before serving.
