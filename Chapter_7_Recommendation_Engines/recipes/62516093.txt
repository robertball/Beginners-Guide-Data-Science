Ingredients:
1 loaf of egg bread (unsliced).  I like to use the Italian Sweet bread they sale at Krogers.  Either way you want a heavy or dense bread.  Day old is fine.
1 stick butter
1 cup brown sugar
2 t. cinnimon
5-8 eggs
1.5 cup milk

Directions:
In a 9x13 pan (or larger), melt 1 sick of butter with 1 cup brown sugar.  Take it out of oven and stir in 2 t. of cinnimon.  Distribute the butter/sugar around the pan.  Slice the bread thick (2" or so) and lay on top of butter/sugar.  If there are spaces cut wedges of bread to fill in those spaces.  Mix together eggs and milk.  If you are using a 9x13 pan 5 eggs are usually enough, but, if the pan in larger you may want to use up to 8 eggs and more milk.  Pour egg mixture over bread.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate over night.  Bake in a preheated 350 oven, uncovered for 45 min. (or until tops of bread are lightly browning).

This is always requested for Christmas morning, but, I'll make it for brunch pot lucks too and I always take home an empty pan!
