Ingredients:
Vinaigrette:
1/4 cup arils from large POM Wonderful® Pomegranate*
1/3 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 cloves fresh garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon honey
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
Salad:
1 cup juice from large POM Wonderful® Pomegranates,** or POM Wonderful 100% Pomegranate Juice
3 tangerines
1/4 cup granulated sugar (optional)
4 1/2 cups fresh spinach leaves
1/2 cup thinly sliced fennel
1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion
Garnish:
fennel ferns

Directions:
Score fresh pomegranates and place in a bowl of water. Break open the pomegranates under water to free the arils (seed sacs). The arils will sink to the bottom of the bowl and the membrane will float to the top. Sieve and put the arils in a separate bowl. (Refrigerate or freeze any remaining arils for another use.)
Prepare fresh pomegranate juice.**
Peel and section tangerines. Place tangerines in a bowl with 1 cup pomegranate juice and sugar if desired. Allow to marinate 30 to 45 minutes.
Drain tangerines; reserve 1/3 cup of the marinade for vinaigrette. Mix 1/3 cup reserved pomegranate marinade with the other vinaigrette ingredients and shake together in a tightly covered container.
Divide spinach, fennel and red onion on 4 salad plates. Divide tangerine slices on salad and dress with 1 to 2 tablespoons of vinaigrette per serving. Garnish with fennel ferns.
