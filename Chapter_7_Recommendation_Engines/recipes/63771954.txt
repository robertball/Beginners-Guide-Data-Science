Ingredients:
6 cups beans
1 1/2 pound bacon
3 onions, finely diced
9 tablespoons molasses
2 tablespoons salt
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon dry mustard
1 1/2 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons Merlot sauce
3/4 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Soak beans overnight in cold water. Simmer the beans in the same water until tender, approximately 1 to 2 hours. Drain and reserve the liquid.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Arrange the beans in a 6 quart bean pot or casserole dish by placing a portion of the beans in the bottom of dish, and layering them with bacon and onion.
In a saucepan, combine molasses, salt, pepper, dry mustard, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil and pour over beans. Pour in just enough of the reserved bean water to cover the beans. Cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil.
Bake for 3 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, until beans are tender. Remove the lid about halfway through cooking, and add more liquid if necessary to prevent the beans from getting too dry.
