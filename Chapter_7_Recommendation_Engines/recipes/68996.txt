Ingredients:
6 (1 inch thick) pork chops
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (14 ounce) can vegetable broth
1 cup uncooked long grain white rice
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes, drained
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped orange bell pepper
1/3 cup chopped green onions
1/2 cup thinly sliced fresh mushrooms

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season pork chops with salt, pepper, and paprika. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute the garlic about 1 minute, then brown pork chops about 2 minutes on each side.
In a pot, bring the vegetable broth and rice to a boil. Mix in the Italian-style diced tomatoes, green bell pepper, orange bell pepper, green onions, and mushrooms, and cook about 5 minutes, until heated through. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange the pork chops over the rice and vegetables.
Cover, and bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until rice and vegetables are tender and pork has reached an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This is my favorite pork chop recipe. The rice is both colorful and flavorful, and the chops are so tender that they fall off the bone.
