1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of onion soup
1 cup water
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Season the elk roast with the steak seasoning and sage, and place into a slow cooker along with the onion, garlic, cream of onion soup, and water.

Description: 
I'm always looking for good ways to empty the freezer of the wild game that hubby brings home. This is easy and can cook all day in the crock pot. Serve it over egg noodles, mashed potatoes, or rice.
