Ingredients:
1 bunch Kale, chopped
1/2 head of green cabbage, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
4 stalks of celery, chopped
3 cloves of fresh garlic, minced
1 can red kidney beans, rinsed and drained
4 tomatoes, blanched and skins removed
1 tbsp dried onion flakes
2 bay leaves
1 tbsp butter
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp Herbs 'd Provence
1 pinch or more of crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
8 tbsp beef bouillon (i like the paste better than the cubes)
8 cups of hot water
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Chop tomatoes and place in a small sauce pan with onion flakes, a pinch of salt & pepper and butter. Stir and cover, simmering over medium-low heat for 15 minutes.
Place onions, celery, garlic and bay leaves in your favorite stock pot with olive oil and sauté on low heat until onions are transparent, stirring frequently. Add tomatoes and sauté for 5 more minutes. Remove bay leaves, add water, beef bouillon, cabbage, red pepper and herbs. Stir and cook, partially covered for 25 minutes. Stir occasionally. After 25 minutes, add the kale and beans. Stir again and recover. Cook for another 15 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. The bouillon is pretty salty as it is, so you may not even need salt.
