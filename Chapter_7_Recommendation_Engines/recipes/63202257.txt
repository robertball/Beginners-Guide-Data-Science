Ingredients:
1 pkg of pocketless pitas (4-5 to a pack)
1 Udi Gluten Free Pizza crust
1/2 Can Pizza Sauce (Tops brand)
1 package Shredded Mozzarella (Friendly Farms, ALdi)
Black Olives
Green Olives
Banana Peppers
Pepperoni

Directions:
Preheat the ovens to the temperature listed on the Udi's package.
Cut pepperoni slices into quarters, dice the black and green olives.
Place the Udi's crust on parchment paper on a baking sheet. On separate baking sheets, place the pocketless pitas. Wash hands.
Plop 1 heaping tbsp pizza sauce on each crust, careful not to touch the spoon to the crust to avoid contamination of the sauce. Once all crusts have their sauce, use a separate spoon to spread the sauce, beginning with the gluten free crust. Place the spoon in the sink, not to be used again. Wash Hands.
Using hands, divy out mozzarella cheese in heaps onto the crusts, careful not to touch the crust with your hands. Once all crusts have sufficient cheese, use your hands to spread the cheese out over the sauce. Wash hands.
Carefully place desired toppings on each pizza, beginning with the gluten free pizza and being careful not to touch the crusts. Wash hands.
Bake the Udi's crust according to the package directions.
Bake pita pizzas until the cheese is melted and beginning to brown around the crust area.
Serve the gluten free pizza first, removing from the pan onto a plate and slicing into quarters with the designated gluten-free pizza cutter.
Remove the pita pizzas from their pans as well, onto their plates and use the wooden handle pizza cutter to slice into quarters.
