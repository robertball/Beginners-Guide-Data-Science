Ingredients:
Meat Mixture:
1 to 1-1/2 pounds of ground turkey (can use ground beef, but don't forget to drain it)
1/8 tsp garlic powder
1 Tbsp minced onion
1/2 tsp marjoram
1/2 to 2/3 cup chunky salsa
1 can Campbell's tomato soup
1 can corn, drained
1 tsp salt.
Biscuit Topping
2 cups flour
1 Tbsp baking powder
2 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp cream of tartar
1/4 tsp salt
1/8 to 1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/2 cup cold butter (can use shortening or margarine)
1/2 to 1 cup finely shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
1 cup milk

Directions:
Brown ground turkey with the garlic powder, minced onion, and marjoram.
Add salsa, soup, corn, and salt and heat through.
While meat mixture is heating, in a separate bowl mix together flour, baking powder, sugar, cream of tartar, salt, and garlic powder.  Cut in butter.
Stir in cheddar cheese, until cheese is coated with flour mixture.  Stir in sour cream and milk (if omitting sour cream, use a bit more milk).
Place meat mixture in the bottom of a casserole dish.  Top with batter.  If batter is too thick to spread, add more milk.
Cover and bake at 375 until topping is cooked through, approximately 30 minutes.
