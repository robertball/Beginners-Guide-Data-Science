Ingredients:
*5 Cups of Vanilla Flavoured yogurt (choose organic if you can and be certain there is no gelatin added or the recipe won't work)
*2 Tbsp Sugar
*1 Tbsp Cornstarch
*1 Tbsp Lemonjuice
*1 tsp vanilla
*2 eggs (or one whole egg and 2 egg whites)

Directions:
DAY BEFORE MAKING CAKE:
1) Empty 5 Cups of yogurt into mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth, coffee filters OR clean peice of cotton fabric (Like a hankerchief fabric).  Place strainer into bowl so there is room in the bottom for the liquids to drain.
2) Empty liquids out of bowl a couple hours after starting yogurt cheese (most of the liquids drain in the first 2-3 hours).
3) Leave sit for about 24 hours (or until no more liquids are draining from the cheese)
CAKE:
*In a mixing bowl, fold together all ingredients except eggs.
*In seperate bowl, beat eggs.
*Fold eggs into rest of ingredients
*Pour batter into lightly greased 8" pie or cake plate
*Cook 45-50 mins at 350degree oven.  (dont worry if the centre of the cake does not look 'set', it will set while cooling).
