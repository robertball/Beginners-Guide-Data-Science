Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (15.25 ounce) package strawberry cake mix (such as Betty Crocker®)
2 cups white chocolate chips
3/4 cup sour cream
3/4 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1/2 cup warm water
1 (3.4 ounce) package cheesecake-flavored pudding mix (such as Jell-O®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans with cooking spray.
Combine strawberry cake mix, white chocolate chips, sour cream, vegetable oil, eggs, water, and pudding mix in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Divide batter between the prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Set pans on a wire rack and cool for 15 minutes.
