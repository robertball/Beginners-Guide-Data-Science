4 cups ripe peaches skinned, chopped and pitted
1/4 cup lemon juice
7 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon all spice
1 teaspoon Vanilla

Directions:
Peal and prepare peaches in a mixing bowl then add Vanilla.  Allow peaches and Vanilla to get aquainted for 15 minutes.
Combine all except Certo in large pan. Mix well and bring to a full rolling boil. Boil hard for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in 1 pouch of Certo immediately. Stir for 5 more minutes (skim if needed).
Put in jam jars and proceed with 10 - 15 minute boiling water "bath" to seal canning jars. Let cool and make sure the jars are properly sealed.

Description: 
A twist on an old favorite Jam. This takes Peach Jam up to a whole new level.  I've modified this recipe with great results: First Price over all in Jams and Jellies at the county fair.  It's delightful!
