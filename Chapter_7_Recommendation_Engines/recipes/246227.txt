Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can light coconut milk
1/4 cup peanut butter
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon sriracha sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground chile pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 carrots, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 (14 ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cut into 1-inch cubes
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
4 cups baby spinach
1 1/2 cups cooked brown rice

Directions:
Whisk coconut milk, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, sriracha sauce, and ground chile powder in a bowl until a smooth sauce forms.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrots and red bell pepper; saute until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tofu; saute until lightly browned, about 4 minutes per side. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Pour sauce into the skillet; stir to coat tofu, carrots, and bell pepper. Cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low; stir in spinach 1 cup at a time until wilted. Serve over brown rice.

This is a throwback recipe from when I was a hardcore vegan, but it's still one of my staples years later. It's healthy, filling, and full of flavor!
