Ingredients:
1/3 cup Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon finely minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoons oil
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
red coloring, (optional)
1 lb shrimp, tiger prawn preferred, shelled and deveined, tails on
bamboo skewers, soaked in water before using
oil for basting
1/2 tablespoon chopped cilantro for garnish
1 lime, cut into wedges for garnish

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients of the Marinade in a bowl (yogurt, garlic, garam masala, chili powder, lime juice, oil, salt, turmeric, red coloring).  Stir to combine well. Add the shrimp to the Marinade and marinate for at least 30 minutes, or best for two hours. Thread the shrimp onto the bamboo skewers, set aside.
Grill the shrimp on a grill on both sides, until they are cooked and slightly charred on the surface. Baste with oil while grilling. Remove from the grill, garnish with chopped cilantro and serve immediately with lime wedges.
(If you are baking with oven, line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper and arrange the shrimp skewers in a single layer. Using a small brush, baste both sides of the shrimp with the oil. Roast for 10 minutes or until the shrimps are cooked. Broil for 1 minute or until the top surface is slightly charred. Remove from the oven, garnish with chopped cilantro and serve immediately with lime wedges.)
