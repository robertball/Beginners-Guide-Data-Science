Ingredients:
1/2 cup margarine, softened
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 1/4 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup mashed bananas
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup Craisins
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Cream the butter or margarine and cream cheese together.  Gradually add the white sugar, and continue beating until light and fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in the mashed bananas and vanilla.  Add flour, baking powder, and soda; mix until batter is just moist.
In a small bowl, mix together Craisins, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and cinnamon.
Divide 1/2 batter into two greased and floured 8x4 inch loaf pans.  Sprinkle Craisin mixture over batter in pans, and top with remaining batter.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
