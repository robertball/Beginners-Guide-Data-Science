Ingredients:
½ cup small dried shrimp
2 chinese sausages (lap cheong)
200g jicama (yam bean), sliced into matchsticks
2 free-range eggs
1 garlic clove, minced
a bunch of thai basil
a bunch of vietnamese mint
oak lettuce
15cm (6?) round rice paper wrappers
1 cup hoisin sauce
½ cup coconut milk

Directions:
Place the dried shrimp in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave to soak for 30 minutes.
Place the chinese sausages in a steamer and steam for approximately 10 minutes.
Place the jicama into a small saucepan with two tablespoons of water on low heat for 15 minutes.
Beat the eggs into a small bowl and make one large omelet or two small omelets.
Drain the water from the shrimp. In a small frying pan on medium heat, gently fry the minced garlic and shrimp until golden and fragrant.
Cool the chinese sausages for a few minutes and slice them at an angle and as thin as possible.
Roll up the omelet and slice to matchstick thickness.
Place the hoisin sauce and coconut milk in a small saucepan over low heat. When the mixture starts to bubble turn the heat off and stir the mixture gently. Allow to cool completely.
Arrange the ingredients into a procession-like line along a table with a bowl of hot water at the beginning. Take a rice paper sheet and quickly dip it in the hot water. This shouldn’t take more than a second*. Lay it flat on a plate and place the chinese sausage, jicama, egg, shrimp, basil, vietnamese mint and lettuce a third of the way down. Tightly roll the sheet, when you have reached the half way up the sheet fold over the sides and keep rolling.
