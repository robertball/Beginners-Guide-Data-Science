Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
2/3 cup honey
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1/3 cup coconut oil
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 (8 ounce) package semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 (1.5 ounce) bar milk chocolate candy bar, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Puree black beans, honey, cocoa powder, coconut oil, eggs, baking powder, and salt in a food processor until smooth; pour into a baking dish. Stir chocolate chips into black bean mixture and sprinkle chopped chocolate over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 35 minutes. Let cool at least 10 minutes before cutting.
