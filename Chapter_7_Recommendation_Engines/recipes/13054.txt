Description: 
This is a veggie-soup-to-die-for! Our weekends are so busy, Friday night is soup night, and this is it! Wonderful with crackers or some herbed rolls. This may also be made with pasta, leaving out the potatoes. Just add 2 cups uncooked macaroni or soup ring pasta in the last 10-15 minutes of cook time. Stir occasionally to keep separate.
