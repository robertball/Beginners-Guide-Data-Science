Ingredients:
1 large cucumber, diced
1 large tomato, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley, to taste
1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped fresh mint, to taste
1/2 to 1 ounce fresh lime juice (1/2 to 1 lime)
minced fresh garlic to taste, one or two cloves
2 or 3 cups shredded cabbage
crumbled feta cheese for topping

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except feta. For best results, refrigerate overnight so the flavors can combine. Sprinkle feta cheese on individual portions, as desired. This is delicious with hummus and warm pita bread.

Description: 
This is a good use for garden veggies and herbs, but for simplicity's sake I buy the shredded cabbage that comes in a bag. Look in the bagged salad section at the store. Cole Slaw blend is good, too, and the green and red shredded cabbage with the shredded carrots looks pretty.
