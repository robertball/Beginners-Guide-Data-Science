Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Coating:
1/4 cup butter, melted, or more to taste
Dusting:
1/3 cup white sugar, or more to taste
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a mini muffin tin with cooking spray or line with paper cups.
Place flour, sugar, milk, vegetable oil, egg, baking powder, salt, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon in a bowl. Mix dough by hand until well combined but some lumps remain. Fill muffin tin with dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, but color is not yet golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Pour melted butter into a bowl. Mix 1/3 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon nutmeg together in a separate bowl. Dip muffins in the butter coating; immediately roll in the cinnamon dusting.
