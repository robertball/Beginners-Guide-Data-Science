Ingredients:
1/2 cup Italian salad dressing
1/2 cup barbecue sauce
2 teaspoons chili powder
4 (3/4 inch) thick bone-in pork chops

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the salad dressing, barbecue sauce and chili powder; mix well. Pour 1/2 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the pork chops. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade.
Drain and discard marinade from pork. In a large skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, brown chops on both sides over medium heat; drain. Add reserved marinade. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5-7 minutes or until a meat thermometer reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
In her West Monroe, Louisiana kitchen, Tonya Fitzgerald jazzes up store-bought Italian salad dressing with barbecue sauce and chili powder to make the easy marinade for these pork chops. They're simmered on the stove-top for just a few minutes, so they're on the table in no time.
