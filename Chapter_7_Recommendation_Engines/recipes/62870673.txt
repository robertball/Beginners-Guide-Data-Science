Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 pounds of cored and roughly chopped apples
4 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. ground cloves
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 c. brown sugar
1/4 c. apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Add all ingredients to a slow-cooker and cook, covered, at low temperature for 8-10 hours.
Using an immersion blender, blend the apples until smooth. Continue cooking, uncovered, until the butter is a deep rich brown and some of the liquids have cooked off (approximately 1 hour).
Taste the butter: adjust the spices to taste. If the butter tastes dull and muttled, add more vinegar a tablespoon or two at a time.
Allow to cool and enjoy vigorously.

Description: 
I was tired of finding apple butter recipes with more sugar than apples, so I adapted a few and perfected it. This recipe makes the house smell fantastic and tastes like fall. Enjoy!
