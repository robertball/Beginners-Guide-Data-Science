Ingredients:
2 cups cooked rice
1 1/2 cups milk
1/4 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (15 ounce) can sliced peaches, drained
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine rice, milk, sugar and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir a small amount of rice mixture into eggs; return all to the pan. Cook and stir for 2-3 minutes or until a thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla. Pour into a greased shallow 1-qt. baking pan. Top with peaches. Combine brown sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle 1 tablespoonful over peaches. Broil for 3-5 minutes or until browned. Let stand for 5-10 minutes.
Serve in bowls; sprinkle with remaining cinnamon-sugar. Top with sour cream if desired.
