Ingredients:
1 lb raw chicken, cut into 1 inch squares
1 med sweet onion, cut chuncky
1 cup of broccoli chopped
1 Tbsp Hot Chili Sesame Oil
2 Tbsp finely chopped garlic
3/4 cup of Orange Juice (I used 1/2 sugar)
1/2 cup of Tamari low sodium soy sauce
1 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp orange zest
1/4 cup of dark brown sugar
1/4 cup of honey
1/4 cup of Maggi Masala Spicy Chili Sauce
1 Tbsp hot chili flakes
1 tsp garlic salt
2 Tbsp Kikkoman Aji-Mirin (sweet cooking rice seasoning)
3 Tbsp corn starch (NEVER add in before cooking in IP, used to thicken after)
1/2 cup warm chicken broth (set aside - save for thickening, microwave to warm)

Directions:
Turn IP on saute
Add hot chili sesame oil, when hot, add onions, saute 2 minutes stirring occasionally
Add broccoli, chopped garlic, ginger, orange zest, hot chili flakes, and garlic salt and give it a stir.
Immediately after add orange juice, Tamari, honey, and spicy chili sauce.
Add chicken, stir, and set instant pot to pressure cook for 5 minutes, let release naturally or after 5 minutes.
While cooking dissolve cornstarch in warm chicken broth, whisk with fork until dissolved.
When IP is done, use a large slotted spoon and pull chicken and veggies out of the sauce into a bowl and set aside.
Put IP back on Saute, when sauce is bubbling add cornstarch mixture, wait a minute to stir in, turn IP off (it will continue to be hot for a while you may have to pull it out).
Stir in sweet cooking rice seasoning, and mix chicken and veggies back into the pot.
I serve over basmati rice and with steamed salted and buttered snow peas as a side.
