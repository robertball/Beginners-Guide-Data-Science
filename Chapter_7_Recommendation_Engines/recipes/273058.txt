Ingredients:
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup ground walnuts (optional)
6 tablespoons butter, softened
1/3 cup baking cocoa

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat flour, confectioners' sugar, walnuts, butter, and cocoa together in a large mixing bowl until a soft dough forms.
Press dough into the bottom and up the side of an ungreased 9- or 9 1/2-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom.
Bake crust in the preheated oven until puffed, 12 to 14 minutes.
Cool crust completely in the pan on a wire rack, about 1 hour.
