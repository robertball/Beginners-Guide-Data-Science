Ingredients:
½ 	pound smoked sausage, Polish sausage, smoked sausage or Polska Keilbasa sausage, cut into 1 inch pieces
½	small head cabbage, chopped into large pieces
1-1 ½	cups potatoes peeled, and cut into small bite size pieces
1	medium onion, thinly sliced, or chopped
8 	ounces tomato sauce, or 10 ounces diced tomatoes with the same seasonings.
½	cup Worcestershire sauce
2	large garlic cloves, minced (I like garlic most would use 1 clove garlic)
1	teaspoon chili sauce, or Sriracha (Asian) hot chili sauce, or to taste (Optional)
½ 	teaspoon pepper
1	teaspoon garlic powder
Salt to taste

Directions:
1.	Heat grill to medium heat.  Or heat the oven to 400 degrees.  Cut four 18 X 12 inch pieces of heavy duty foil.  Divide sausage, cabbage, onions, and potatoes evenly onto each piece of foil.
2.	In a 2 cup measuring cup, combine tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, chili sauce, and pepper; mix well.  Spoon evenly over sausage and vegetables. (I use about ¼ to ½ cup sauce per packet)  Wrap each packet securely with double fold seals, allowing room for heat expansion.
3.	When ready to grill, place packets on grill over medium heat or in the oven at 375.  Cook 30 to 40 minutes or until cabbage and potatoes are tender.  Open packets carefully to allow hot steam to escape.
