Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1/2 small white onion, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/2 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1/2 tablespoon lemon pepper seasoning
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine crushed tomatoes, onion, vinegar, and cumin in a small bowl.
Place chicken breasts in a baking dish. Season with Italian seasoning, lemon pepper, and garlic salt. Pour the tomato mixture on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
