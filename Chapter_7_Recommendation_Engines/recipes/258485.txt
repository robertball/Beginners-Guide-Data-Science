Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) bottle Caesar salad dressing
Â¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
3 pounds chicken wings, cut apart at joints, wing tips discarded
1 tablespoon lemon pepper

Directions:
Combine Caesar dressing and Parmesan cheese in a bowl.
Place wings in a large resealable plastic bag; pour in dressing-cheese marinade. Seal bag; toss to coat and refrigerate at least 4 hours.
Preheat grill for medium heat (300 to 350 degrees F, 150 to 175 degrees C), and lightly oil the grate.
Remove wings from bag; discard marinade. Heavily sprinkle all sides of wings with lemon pepper.
Place wings on grill. Cook, covered, turning several times, until cooked through and internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (75 degrees C); 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer wings to a platter.
