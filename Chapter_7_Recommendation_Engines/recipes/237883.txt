Ingredients:
1 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 large baking potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 large sweet onion, sliced
4 12x12-inch squares aluminum foil
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Stir mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, garlic, red pepper flakes, paprika, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Add potatoes and onion; stir to coat completely.
Arrange aluminum foil squares on a work surface and spray each with cooking spray. Divide potato mixture between the four squares. Fold aluminum foil over potato mixture and crimp edges together to form a secure pouch.
Cook on the preheated grill until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
My family loves these tasty potatoes. There are never leftovers. Once the potatoes are all tucked in their foil packets, they can wait overnight to be grilled the next day. Great for camping. Check foil packets at 15 and 30 minutes to ensure they are not burning. May require a few more minutes to ensure all is cooked through.
