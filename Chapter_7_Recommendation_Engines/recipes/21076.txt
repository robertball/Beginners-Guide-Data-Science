Ingredients:
16 ounces uncooked lasagna noodles
1 (26 ounce) can spaghetti sauce
1 pound cottage cheese
8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In a blender or with an electric mixer, blend tomato sauce and cottage cheese together until smooth.  Spoon a little of the sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish.  Place a layer of cooked noodles over the sauce, and sprinkle a portion of the mozzarella, the cheddar and the parmesan over the noodles.  Repeat layering of sauce, noodles and cheese; finish with a cheese layer.
Bake in preheated oven 30 to 45 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and golden.
