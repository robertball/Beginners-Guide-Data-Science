Ingredients:
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed French onion soup
1 1/2 pounds ground beef (90% lean or better)
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tsp. Beef boullion granules
1 1/2 cups water
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup Johnny's French Dip Au Jus concentrate

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together 1/3 cup condensed French onion soup with ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, garlic powder and black pepper. Shape into 8 oval patties.
Place patties in a single layer in the bottom of a shallow roaster.  Broil 5 min. on each side.
In a small bowl, blend flour and remaining soup until smooth. Mix in water, Worcestershire sauce and Johnny's concentrate. Pour over meat in roaster. Bake uncovered at 350 for 40-50 minutes turning the meat every so often to keep from drying out.  Covering will not allow gravy to thicken.
