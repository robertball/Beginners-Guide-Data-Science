Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
20  chicken wings, tips removed and sections separated
2 ½ cups coarsely chopped onions
¼ cup coarsely chopped garlic
¼ cup chopped peeled ginger
2 cups long-grain white rice
1 ½ tablespoons ground cumin
2 ½ cups water
2 cups chopped cilantro stems, divided
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
2 ½ teaspoons salt

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a pot large enough to hold chicken wings in a single layer. Add chicken wings; cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Turn wings with tongs; cook until second side is browned, about 8 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl using tongs.
Stir onions, garlic, and ginger into the drippings in the pot; cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in rice and cumin. Add water, 1 1/2 cup cilantro stems, tomatoes, sriracha sauce, and salt.
Return wings to the pot. Bring broth to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice and wings are tender, about 30 minutes. Garnish with remaining 1/2 cup cilantro stems.

Description: 
Chicken with rice, or arroz con pollo, is a staple at our house. This dish is highly
 seasoned with cumin, ginger, garlic, and a great deal of cilantro. We like it best when it 
is made with chicken wings.
