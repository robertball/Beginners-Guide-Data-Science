Description: 
My grandmother used to care for the Masons. Mr Mason was a pioneer in the roadside food industry. He owned cafes in Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas that served chili and apple pie. He kept his chili recipe secret for decades. He lived to be 107 years old, and my grandma finally got his recipe.
