Ingredients:
1 (1 1/4 pound) beef top sirloin steak boneless, cut 1 inch thick
1 medium yellow squash, sliced (1/2-inch)
1 medium zucchini, sliced (1/2-inch)
1 small red onion, cut into 1/2-inch thick wedges
8 medium mushrooms
1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
1 tablespoon olive oil
Mustard-Thyme Glaze:
2 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard
2 tablespoons apricot preserves
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Combine glaze ingredients in 1-cup glass measure. Microwave on HIGH 45 seconds, stirring once. Brush on beef steak.
Alternately thread vegetables onto four 12-inch metal skewers. Combine mustard and oil; brush on vegetables.
Place steak and skewers on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill steak, covered, 11 to 15 minutes (over medium heat on preheated gas grill, 13 to 16 minutes) for medium rare (145 degrees F) to medium (160 degrees F) doneness, turning occasionally. Grill vegetables 6 to 10 minutes or until tender, turning occasionally.
Carve steak; season with salt. Serve with vegetables.
