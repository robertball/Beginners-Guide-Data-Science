Ingredients:
1 pound pork sausage, casings removed
1 pound spicy Italian sausage, casings removed
1 cup crushed pork rinds
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine pork sausage, Italian sausage, pork rinds, and mozzarella cheese in a bowl. Mix well and form into about 48 equal-sized meatballs. Arrange meatballs in a shallow baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven meatballs are nicely browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 20 minutes.
