cooked pasta or rice
Parmesan cheese

In a food processor chop onion and garlic into fairly small pieces. Spray a saute pan with spray; add butter or margarine. Melt over medium heat and add chopped veggies. Saute til tender about 3-5 min. Add wine and continue to cook on simmer for 3 min. uncovered.  Add salsa, chiles and lime juice. Cook and stir til heated; a couple of min. Add shrimp; cook about 5 min. until the shrimp turn pink. Serve over pasta or rice whichever you prefer. (Note: if using frozen shrimp, defrost and drain well. Otherwise the sauce will be too soupy.)
