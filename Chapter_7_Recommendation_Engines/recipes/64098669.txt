Ingredients:
1 tall can (50 oz.) Del Monte Green Beans
2 Tablespoons unsalted butter
Black pepper

Directions:
Open can of beans and drain off all the water.
Then put the drained beans into a large pot (I use my 5 qt Dutch oven).
COVER beans with fresh water.
Add the butter and sprinkle generously with black pepper.
Boil, uncovered, until water evaporates. This can take 20-30 minutes depending on heat of stove.
Once water evaporates I watch closely so beans do not burn on the bottom (although a very slight "burnt" can add a tasty flavor).  I shake the pan to mix the beans or use a wide spatula to lift the bottom layer of beans to the top.
Turn to lowest temp and COVER until ready to serve.  I like to let them sit at this low temp another 15-20 minutes. Watch carefully should you need to stir again to avoid burnt beans on the bottom.
