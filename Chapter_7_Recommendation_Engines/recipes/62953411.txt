Ingredients:
3 tablespoons canola or other vegetable oil
1 medium yellow onion
1 (14 ounce) bag frozen green beans
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Peel and slice onion in half, then into very thin, almost see-through, half-circle slices.
Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add onions and cook until deep brown, about 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently. Spread onions on paper towels to drain.
Cook beans according to package directions. Toss with onions and serve.

Description: 
Sweet caramelized onions elevate frozen green beans to a guest-worthy side dish that couldn't be simpler to make. You may never make green bean casserole again.
