Ingredients:
4 Tilapia filets

6 Tbsp softened butter
2 cloves minced garlic
1 Tbsp fresh minced basil

Directions:
Place tilapia filets in a Ziploc bag with 1 1/2 cups orange juice.  Squeeze out any air; seal tightly.  Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, to overnight.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Mix together butter, garlic, 3 Tbsp orange juice, basil, and panko or bread crumbs.
Remove tilapia filets from bag, discard marinade. Place filets in a 9x13 baking dish.  Add 1/2 cup orange juice.  Top fish with bread crumb mixture, molding as necessary to make sure tops are covered.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until juice is bubbly and fish flakes easily with a fork.
