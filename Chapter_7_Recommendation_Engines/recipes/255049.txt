Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup honey
1 egg
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 cup mashed cooked sweet potato

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sift flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and salt into a bowl.
Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Mix in honey, egg, and lemon zest until well blended. Fold in sweet potato. Stir in flour mixture with a large spoon until dough is just blended.
Shape tablespoonfuls of dough into balls and place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to brown, about 8 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes; transfer to wire racks to cool completely, about 10 minutes.
