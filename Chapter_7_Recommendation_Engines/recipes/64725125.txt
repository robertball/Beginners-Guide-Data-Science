Ingredients:
1.5 tsp multi-colored peppercorns
1.5 pounds salsify roots
2 tbsp ghee
1/4 tsp sea salt
1 tsp dried dill

Directions:
Roughly crush the peppercorns in a mortar. Set aside.
Use rubber gloves at all times during the preparation of the salsify. Rinse and scrub the salsify root under running water to eliminate the dirt. Keep your gloves on. Peel the salsify with a vegetable peeler. Rinse under running water. Cut into 3‚Äù pieces. Cut lengthwise in half or even in quarters, to have 3 inch long and 1/4 inch thick pieces.
In a large skillet, melt the ghee over medium-high heat. Add the sea salt and crushed peppercorns. Add the salsify pieces and cover. Cook until browned, flipping the pieces as needed to brown all sides. About 15 minutes
Place on a serving plate and top with dill before serving.

Description: 
Salsify root is pan-roasted in ghee to give you an elegant dish to accompany your meal. Salsify may be grungy looking, but that dirty exterior hides a delightful flavor. The mix of black, green, white, and red peppercorns give the dish a unique dimension of flavor. Use gloves when handling salsify to avoid the sticky latex getting on your skin.
