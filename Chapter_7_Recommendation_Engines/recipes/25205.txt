Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup uncooked rolled oats
2/3 cup evaporated milk
2 tablespoons minced onion
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons vinegar
4 teaspoons granulated sugar
2/3 cup ketchup
1/4 cup chopped onion
3 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix the ground beef, oats, milk, 2 tablespoons minced onion, salt, and pepper. Let stand for a few minutes until milk is absorbed, and shape into 8 patties.
In a small bowl, thoroughly mix the Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, sugar, ketchup, and 1/4 cup chopped onion; set aside.
Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, and fry the patties until brown on both sides. Pour the sauce in with the patties, and reduce heat. Continue cooking about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is an heirloom recipe from my grandmother. We used to beg my mom to make these.  Not intended to be placed on a grill, they are best served over rice with a nice green salad.
