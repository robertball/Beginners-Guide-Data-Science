Ingredients:
1 - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 corn tortillas
4 eggs
1 cup shredded cheddar (or mexican blend) cheese
1 cup salsa
1 avocado peeled and sliced
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
1. Heat oil in a non-stick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Place tortilla in oil and heat for about 30 - 60 seconds, then turn over and heat other side. While the second side is warming, sprinkle some of the shredded cheese onto the tortilla making a sort of 'nest' to hold the egg.
2. Crack your egg directly into the cheese nest on the tortilla. Cover with a lid to contain the heat and help cook the egg for about 1 - 1/2 minutes. While you are waiting, warm up the salsa in a separate bowl in the microwave. Once the egg white begins to become opaque in color, using a large spatula, flip the entire tortilla over and continue to fry the egg to your desired likeness.
3. Serve your tortilla egg side up on a plate. Now you may garnish with some extra shredded cheese. And to finish off, scoop a few spoonfuls of warmed salsa, a few dollops of sour cream and finally place a few slices of avocado. Salt and pepper to taste if desired.

Description: 
I had my first Huevos Rancheros about a year ago in a cool little restaurant we found in L.A. It was fantastic and after a few trials, I came up with this replication. It is best served with re-fried beans and rice. Enjoy!
