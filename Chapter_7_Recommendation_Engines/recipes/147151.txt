Ingredients:
1/4 cup bacon drippings
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups water
1/2 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat bacon drippings in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir the flour into the bacon drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned. Slowly pour the water into the flour mixture while whisking. Whisk in the tomato paste. Cook the mixture until it begins to thicken. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thick, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This dish is truly a taste of Louisiana Cajun Country. I mean where folks are already sitting at the table drinking coffee and eating breakfast by the time the rooster crows. Mama made countless batches of biscuits and tomato gravy in her lifetime. I'm sure she learned to make this from her mother: Carmen Inez Shirley. This is the dish that puts my feet back under my mama's table. Serve with love over hot buttermilk biscuits along with bacon or sausage for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner.
