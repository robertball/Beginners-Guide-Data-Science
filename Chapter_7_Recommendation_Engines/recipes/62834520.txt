Ingredients:
4 large tomatoes
basil
salt
pepper
1/2 cup mushrooms
1 package of Volpi's bruschetta ham
1 medium onion
1 cup of rice

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. Then Cut the top of each tomato and start to scoop out the inside of the tomato. Be careful not to dig to deep and cut the surface of the tomato. You want them to be thick enough to stuff.
3. Get one cup of raw rice and cook according to directions.
4. Take the bruschetta ham and cut off most of the fat. Cut each slice into small pieces. Then chop the onion, mushrooms, and basil into small pieces. Take the onion and saute it with a little bit of butter. Then add the mushrooms and bruschetta ham. Add the rice and basil. Stir so that everything mixes.
5. Scoop the filling into the tomatoes. And put the lid of the tomato back on.
6. Place onto the top shelf and bake for 20 mins.
