Title:
Alta's Mini Lowfat Shepherds Pies Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1.25 lbs ground turkey
1/2 c egg whites
1/4 c dried plain breadcrumbs
2 tbsp minced dehydrated onions
1 tsp sweet or dill relish
1 tsp powdered chicken bouillon
1/4 tsp minced garlic
1 package 80 calorie instant Cheddar Sour Cream mashed potatoes
2 c hot water
Fat free shredded cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Mix the first 7 ingredients and press, evenly distributed, into the bottoms of a 12 serving muffin tin sprayed with olive oil non-stick cooking spray.
Combine the instant potatoes with the water and mix well.
Top meat mixture with the potato mixture - dividing evenly.
Bake in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes.
Take out and sprinkle with fat free cheddar cheese.
Return to oven and bake an additional 10 minutes or until cooked through.
Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
When ready to serve, run a clean knife around edges to loosen (if necessary); I find removal easier using a dinner fork scooping them out from the side.
