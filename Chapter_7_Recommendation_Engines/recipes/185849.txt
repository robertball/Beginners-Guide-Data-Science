Ingredients:
4 small avocados, peeled and mashed
3 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
1 large shallot, minced
1 jalapeno pepper, minced
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup corn oil
1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into thin strips
1 (4 ounce) package button mushrooms, sliced thin
1 teaspoon coriander seeds, crushed
1 teaspoon celery seed
1/4 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
2 tablespoons water
3 tablespoons corn oil
3 large shallots, sliced
4 cloves garlic, smashed
3 1/2 cups water
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 (6 ounce) beef tenderloin fillets, room temperature
1 (16 ounce) package corn chips

Directions:
Stir the avocado, roma tomatoes, minced shallot, jalapeno pepper, and lemon juice in a bowl. Chill in refrigerator to allow flavors to meld.
Place the chicken stock in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; simmer the stock until reduced to about 1/2 cup.
Heat 1/4 cup corn oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the mushrooms into the peppers; season with the coriander seeds, sea salt, and black pepper. Add the reduced chicken stock and the water; cook and stir until the moisture has been absorbed, another 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a plate lined with paper towels to allow the grease to drain.
Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir the sliced shallots in the hot oil until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the crushed garlic and cook another 3 minutes. Pour 3 1/2 cups water over the mixture and bring to a boil; cook at a boil until the liquid reduces to 1 cup. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer and return the strained liquid to the saucepan, keeping it over medium heat. Add the white wine vinegar and return to a boil; continue cooking at a boil until the liquid reduced to about 1/4 cup. Quickly whisk in the chilled butter until just melted, whisking constantly. Remove from the heat and keep warm while you prepare the steaks.
Place a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and allow get hot. Heat the oil in the skillet. Cook the steaks in the hot oil until they start to firm, and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Cover the meat with two layers of aluminum foil and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes.
Place a mound of the bell pepper mixture into the center of each serving plate. Slice the rested steaks in half and place atop each mound. Spoon a few spoonfuls of the butter mixture onto the plate to surround the stack. Serve with the chilled guacamole and corn chips.
