Description: 
I created this recipe as a quick fix for something sweet and protein-filled for post-gym workouts...eventually the kids started taking it away from me and eating it themselves!  Substitute what you like for a sweetener...I've used stevia, aspartame, and agave nectar, all with success. Greek yogurt takes some getting used to -- it's not for everyone!
