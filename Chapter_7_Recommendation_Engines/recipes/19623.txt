Ingredients:
6  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
⅓ cup olive oil
⅓ cup lemon juice
1 (.7 ounce) package Italian-style dressing mix

Directions:
Place the chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper and pound until thin. Remove breasts and place into a large resealable plastic bag.
In a medium mixing bowl, combine the oil, lemon juice, and Italian-style seasoning. Pour mixture into the plastic bag containing the chicken.
Seal the plastic bag and shake gently to ensure that all the chicken is in contact with the marinade. Refrigerate marinated chicken pieces overnight or up to two days.
When ready to cook, preheat grill and lightly oil grate. Place chicken breasts on the grill and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes per side.

I got this from a friend of mine when she made it at one of her picnics. It's so easy and delicious!  I recently made it at our cook-out and everyone asked me how I made it.
