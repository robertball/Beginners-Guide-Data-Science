Ingredients:
10 - 12 oz sushi grade tuna
4 T. light soy sauce
Ground black pepper, to taste
1/4 cup light sour cream
1 - 2 T. prepared wasabi (available in a tube)
1 cup finely shredded green cabbage
1/4 cup finely chopped green onion, white and green parts included
4 flour tortillas

Directions:
Slice the tuna into 1" thick slices.  Place slices in a pie plate and sprinkle with the soy sauce.  Turn pieces to coat.  Marinate 10 - 15 minutes.  Remove tuna from soy sauce and sprinkle with black pepper.  Set aside.
Meanwhile, combine the light sour cream and the wasabi in a small bowl.  Cover and refrigerate to blend flavors.
Assemble the shredded cabbage and chopped green onions in serving bowls.
In a heavy skillet, add a splash of high-heat tolerant oil (such as peanut oil), and heat over high heat.
While skillet is heating, warm the tortillas.
When the skillet is hot, add the tuna slices.  For true "black & blue" style tuna, sear each side for only 15 - 20 seconds.  Adjust the cooking time to your desired doneness.
Remove the slices from the skillet, and cut into smaller pieces.
Serve the tuna in the warm tortillas, topped with the cabbage, onions and wasabi sour cream.

Description: 
Fresh tuna, spicy sour cream and crunchy cabbage are wrapped in warm flour tortillas in this delicious twist on fish tacos.  If fresh sushi-grade tuna is not available try halibut, mahi-mahi or other firm fish.  Adjust the spiciness of the wasabi-sour cream to your personal taste.
