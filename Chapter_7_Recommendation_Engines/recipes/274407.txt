2 stalks celery, sliced
1 brown onion, diced

4 cloves garlic, diced
1/2 red chile pepper, sliced
1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed and quartered

1 bunch kale, stemmed and coarsely chopped
1 small zucchini, diced
4 cups vegetable broth
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon lemon zest, or to taste

Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function.
Pour olive oil into the hot cooker and add carrots, celery, onion, and salt. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Stir in garlic and red chile pepper; saute for 2 minutes. Add potatoes, tomatoes, kale, and zucchini. Pour in vegetable broth, add bay leaf, and stir to combine. Close and lock the lid.
