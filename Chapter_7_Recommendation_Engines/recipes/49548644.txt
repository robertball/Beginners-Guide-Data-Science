Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 beef bullion cubes crushed
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
2 pounds extra-lean ground beef
3 slices bread, toasted and crumbled
7 buttery round crackers, crushed
1 egg, lightly beaten
3 1/2 tablespoons sour cream
1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce, divided
1/4 cup milk (optional)
3 tablespoons ketchup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic 5 minutes, until onion is tender. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper.
In a large bowl, mix the onion and garlic, beef, crumbled bread, crushed crackers, egg, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, crushed bullion cubes and 1/2 can tomato sauce. Gradually stir in the milk 1 teaspoon at a time until mixture is moist, but not soggy. Transfer the mixture to a 5x9 inch loaf pan.
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and continue baking 15 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
In a small bowl, mix the remaining tomato sauce and ketchup. Pour over the top of the meatloaf, and continue baking 10 minutes.

Description: 
When I was growing up, my mom never ever made meatloaf and I always wanted to try it - I finally tried it at a restaurant and loved it. When I moved out on my own I started experimenting with different recipes and creating my own version. I finally came up with the best meatloaf I have ever made, and I wanted to share it.Modified from: The Best Meatloaf I've Ever Made
