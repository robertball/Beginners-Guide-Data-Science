Description: 
When you taste this yummy fudge you won't believe that it is low sugar and diabetic friendly. I have had several diabetic and non diabetic people (children and adults)who tested this out for me and they all told me the same thing - FANTASTIC !! This is just the fudge base, but you can add in anything you'd like - mini m&M;'s, crushed cookies, ect..Just remember whatever you add you have to account for the extra sugar.
