Ingredients:
8 large medium-ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped into 3/4 inch chunks
2 cups chopped firm apples
1 1/2 cups chopped peeled fresh peaches
1 1/2 cups chopped peeled pears
1 1/2 cups finely chopped onion
1 cup finely chopped celery
3 tablespoons whole pickling spices
2 1/2 cups lightly packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons pickling salt
1 1/2 cups apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Place the tomatoes, apples, peaches, pears, onion, and celery into a heavy pot. Stir in the pickling spices, brown sugar, pickling salt, and vinegar. Bring to a boil, while continuing to stir. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer until thick, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, or about 45 minutes.
Pour the fruit relish into hot jars, leaving 1/4 inch head space. Adjust caps. Process for 15 minutes in a boiling-water bath. Cool jars, and store in a cool, dry place.

Description: 
I found this recipe in the newspaper 25 years ago, and modified it to suit my family's tastes. I make it every year when the ripe tomatoes and fruit come in. My family loves it with both roast beef and as a condiment with tamales. You can vary the amount and types of fruit. I have sometimes added chopped plums.
