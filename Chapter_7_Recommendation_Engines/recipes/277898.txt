Ingredients:
4 large sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1-inch cubes
1 cup brown sugar, divided
1/2 stick butter, cut into pieces, divided
1/2 orange, zested and juiced
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground cloves
1 pinch ground nutmeg
2 large eggs
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
aluminum foil

Directions:
Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water. Add enough salt so that the water tastes like seawater. Bring to a boil and cook potatoes until fork tender and mashable, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a casserole dish.
Transfer potatoes to a large mixing bowl and mash with a potato masher. Add 1/2 the butter, 1/2 of the brown sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and vanilla extract; mix until well combined. Allow mixture to cool slightly, then add cream, cinnamon, salt, cloves, and nutmeg. Taste and adjust spices to your liking. Mix in eggs until well combined. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish.
Mix remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar with flour in a small bowl. Sprinkle pecans over the potato mixture, and then do the same with the brown sugar-flour mixture. Sprinkle remaining butter pieces on top of the casserole and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue to bake until topping is crispy, about 20 minutes longer. Serve once cooled.

Description: 
A sweet, creamy, but light-tasting take on sweet potato casserole. The orange adds a bit of zing that is needed and missing from most recipes, in my opinion.
