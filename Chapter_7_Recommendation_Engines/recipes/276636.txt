Ingredients:
Cake:
2 1/2 cups fresh blueberries
1 1/2 tablespoons cake flour
3 1/4 cups cake flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups white sugar
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 lemons, or more to taste, zested
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1/4 cup buttermilk
Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
1 lemon, zested and juiced
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
salt

Directions:
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Place blueberries in a bowl and sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoons flour; toss until berries are completely coated. Sift together 3 1/4 cups flour, baking soda, and salt into a separate bowl.
Combine sugar, softened butter, and lemon zest in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and lemon extract, beating well after each addition until smooth. Add flour mixture and buttermilk; mix until well combined. Gently fold in floured blueberries and pour batter into the prepared pan, smoothing it out with a spatula.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack.
While cake is cooling, combine powdered sugar and lemon zest in the bowl of a food processor; process until zest is finely processed and blended with sugar. Add lemon juice, melted butter, and salt and blend until smooth. Apply glaze to the warm cake with a pastry brush. Allow to cool before slicing.
