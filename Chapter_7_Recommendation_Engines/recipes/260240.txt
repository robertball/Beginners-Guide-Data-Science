Ingredients:
1/2 cup almond milk
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 cup rice flour
1/3 cup tapioca flour
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a pizza pan or baking sheet.
Beat almond milk, eggs, and oil together in a bowl.
Mix rice flour, tapioca flour, xanthan gum, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl. Add to the egg mixture and blend dough until smooth.
Spread dough onto the prepared pan, using a flat spoon to make a 12-inch circle with raised edges.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 15 minutes.
Remove from oven and add your choice of toppings. Return to the oven until crispy, about 15 minutes more.
