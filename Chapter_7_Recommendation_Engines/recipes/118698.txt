Ingredients:
1 pound large fresh mushrooms
3 tablespoons seasoned bread crumbs
3 tablespoons fat free sour cream
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons chopped chives
2 tablespoons reduced-fat mayonnaise
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
2 drops hot-pepper sauce (optional)

Directions:
Remove stems from mushrooms; set caps aside. Chop stems, reserving 1/3 cup (discard remaining stems or save for another use). In a bowl, combine the bread crumbs, sour cream, Parmesan cheese, chives, mayonnaise, vinegar, hot pepper sauce if desired and reserved mushroom stems; mix well.
Place mushroom caps on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray; stuff with crumb mixture. Boil 4-6 in. from the heat for 5-7 minutes or until lightly browned.
