3 1/2 cups diced chicken
1 cup finely diced celery
1/3 cup slivered almonds

Directions:
Combine lemon juice & mayonnaise, blend well. Toss with chicken, celery and almonds. Serve on bread or crisp lettuce surrounded by slices of apple, peaches, grapes, and pineapple chunks; or whatever fruit you like. I serve with buttery crackers, such as Waverly Wafers.

Description: 
A wonderfully light, yet filling main dish meal for those Girlfriend Luncheons or light summer dinners. I loved it from the first time I had it. A great dish. As Rachel Ray would say, Yum-O.
