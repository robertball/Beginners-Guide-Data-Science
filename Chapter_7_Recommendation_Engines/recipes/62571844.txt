Ingredients:
2 cups milk chocolate chips
2/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk
pinch salt
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 tbs vanilla
1/2 cup peanut butter chips
1/4 cup milk

Directions:
Line an 8 or 9 inch square pan with parchment paper, leaving two to three inches extra paper sticking out on either side. Set aside.
In a large microwave safe bowl, place milk chocolate chips, semi-sweet chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and salt.  Microwave on high for 2 minutes.  Stir (I suggest a soft spatula for this).  Add peanut butter to chocolate, microwave on high for 1 minute. Remove from heat, add vanilla, and stir smooth.
Pour mixture into prepared pan and smooth top. Set aside.
Mix peanut butter chips and milk in small microwave safe bowl.  Microwave on high for 1 minute, then stir.  Microwave in 30 second increments, stirring in between until mixture becomes smooth.  Pour on top of fudge mixture, and smooth with spatula.  Refrigerate for 2 hours.
Lift fudge out of pan and place onto cutting board; peel off paper and cut into squares. Store covered in a refrigerator.
