Ingredients:
Crust:
3 cups of all purpose sugar
1 1/3 cups butter
1 cup unsalted butter
2 eggs
Filling:
6-9 tart apples (or as much needed to fill you pie pan)
1/4 cups of each raisins or currents (optional)
1 lemon -peel grated
1 cup white sugar Or less depending on how sweet the apples are
2 tsp of ground cinnamon

Directions:
Combine the flour and sugar in a large mixing bowl.  Cut butter into small pieces and add to flour and sugar.  Add 1 beaten egg and mix all ingredients with your  hands until smooth and combined.  Refrigerate the dough while preparing the filling.
Prepare the apples by cutting and peeling the apples into small pieces.  Add the remaining ingredients and squeeze the lemon over the apples.  Let apples rest for 20-30 minutes to allow them to release juices (to avoid the pie going soggy or you can use a pie bird). Line a large greased spring form pan with a portion of the refrigerated dough to a depth of 1/8 of an inch on the bottom and a little bit thicker on the sides.  Place the filling into the dough shell leaving about 1/2-3/4 of a cup of topping to the side.
Top:
Use remaining topping/crust:
You can either crumble the topping by hand directly over the filling covering it evenly and then finish with a sprinkle of white sugar for browning OR you can roll out and cut into long strips to make a lattice top.  Brush the top with the remaining egg for browning.
