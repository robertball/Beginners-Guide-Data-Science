Ingredients:
PIE CRUST
- 2 1/2 cups of flour (measured loosely, don't pack it in)
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 sticks of butter - frozen and grated into the flour mixture
- 1/2 cup of ice cold water
APPLES
- 6-10 Fuji apples (experiment with different apples to find your favorite) - cored, peeled, thinly sliced
- sugar (to taste)
- cinnamon (to taste)
- nutmeg (to taste)
- flour (as much needed to lightly coat all the apples)

Directions:
PIE CRUST
1) Mix it all up. Make sure the water isn't all clumped up into one ball, so rub it between your hands to distribute the liquid.
2) Wrap it in halves in plastic and put in the fridge for about an hour to give the flour time to absorb the liquid.
APPLES
1) Core, peel, and cut them.
2) Mix the apples with some flour so that they are all lightly coated. Taste the apples and if you want them sweeter then add a little bit of sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg (all to taste). WARNING: Nutmeg is very strong, so be careful.
APPLE PIE
1) Roll the dough. Put in the apples. Add some dabs of butter on top of the apples. Fold or pace the dough on top.
2) Brush with an egg (1 egg with a little water mixed up and brushed on the top crust).
3) Bake at 350 F for about an hour, or until the crust looks golden and the apples are bubbling a bit.
4) Remove from the oven and let cool for about an hour.
