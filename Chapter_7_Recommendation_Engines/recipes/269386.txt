Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) tubes refrigerated crescent rolls
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
8 tablespoons jellied cranberry sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Unroll dough on a lightly floured surface. Press dough together at the seams so you have 2 rectangles.
Combine cream cheese and cranberry sauce in a bowl; mix together until completely blended. Spread cream cheese mixture over each rectangle, leaving a 1/4-inch border on all sides. Roll each rectangle into a log, starting at the shorter side, and cut into 6 slices. Place pinwheels cut-sides up on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let stand on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool.
