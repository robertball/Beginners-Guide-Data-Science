Ingredients:
1 pound sweet apples -- peeled, cored and thinly sliced
1/4 cup golden raisins
1/4 cup dried currants
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 slices brown bread, crumbled
1/2 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a bowl, combine apples, raisins, currants, cinnamon, sugar and bread crumbs.  Stir well.
Spread several sheets of pastry generously with melted butter and lay them on atop the other on a baking sheet.  Spread the fruit mixture evenly over the top sheet, then roll the sheets up to form a log shape.  Brush with melted butter again.
Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, until pastry is golden brown and fruit is tender.
