Ingredients:
4 cups chopped rhubarb
3/4 cup white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and 8 inch square baking dish.
Place the rhubarb into the baking dish and sprinkle 3/4 cup of sugar over it. Stir to coat completely. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and remaining 3/4 cup of sugar. Add the walnuts, egg and sour cream; stir until smooth. Pour over the rhubarb and spread evenly.
Bake in the preheated oven until rhubarb is tender and the top is browned, about 40 minutes.
