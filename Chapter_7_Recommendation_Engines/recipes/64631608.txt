Cut out the bread crusts if you prefer your sandwich toast without it. Then, spread softened butter in one side of each of the 4 slices.
Add the ham slices on top then the cheese and then the thinly sliced sausages. Add a little pepper on top then sandwich it with another slice of bread.
Preheat the sandwich maker. Once done, place the sandwiches inside then toast for 5 minutes or until it is crispy.
