Ingredients:
2 slices bacon
1 teaspoon butter
1/4 cup sliced mushrooms
1 cup chopped cooked spinach
1/3 cup cottage cheese
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package crescent roll dough

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crispy and evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and roughly chop.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Melt butter in small frying pan over medium heat. Add mushrooms and cook until tender and juicy, about 5 minutes.
Combine the bacon, mushrooms, spinach, cottage cheese, and Cheddar cheese in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
Press the edges of 2 crescent dough triangles together; roll out into a 6x5-inch rectangle. Place 1/4 of the spinach mixture on one end, leaving a 1/2-inch margin on the edges. Fold opposite end over filling, pressing down and crimping edges with a fork to seal. Repeat with remaining crescent dough and filling. Transfer to an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
