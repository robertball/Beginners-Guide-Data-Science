Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 lemon, juiced
1 pinch kosher salt
2 (8 ounce) salmon fillets
2 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed
1/2 red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch strips

Directions:
In a shallow dish, mix the olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, and salt. Pierce the salmon fillets on both sides with a fork, and place in the dish. Coat with the olive oil mixture, and marinate at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place each salmon fillet on a large sheet of aluminum foil. Fold the foil around the fillets to form packets. Pour the marinade mixture over the fillets, and top with capers and red bell pepper strips. Tightly seal packets, and place in a baking dish.
Cook salmon 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until easily flaked with a fork.

Description: 
This salmon is bursting with flavor and very tender. It's easy to make and clean up, and the capers add an extra zing! Be careful when opening foil, as the steam is hot!
