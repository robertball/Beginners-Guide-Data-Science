Ingredients:
8 medium chicken drumsticks, skin removed
olive oil (to keep it from sticking)
1 cup water
1 tbsp Sriracha hot sauce (more or less to taste)
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup soy sauce
4 tsp agave nectar (or sugar)
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tsp ginger, grated
2 tbsp chives or scallions, chopped
1 tsp sesame seeds

Directions:
In a heavy large saucepan, brown chicken on high for 3-4 minutes with a oil.
Add water, balsamic, soy sauce, agave, garlic, ginger, hot sauce and cook on high until liquid comes to a boil.
Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered for about 20 minutes.
Remove cover and bring heat to high, allowing sauce to reduce down, about 8-10 minutes, until it becomes a thick glaze, turning chicken occasionally.
(Keep an eye on glaze, you don't want it to burn when it start becoming thick)
Transfer chicken to a platter and pour glaze on top.
Top with chives and sesame seeds and serve.
