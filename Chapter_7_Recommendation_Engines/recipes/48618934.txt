Ingredients:
2 cups flour
3 Tbl. sugar
1 Tbl. baking powder
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. red chili flakes
1.5 tsp. ground cumin
1 Tbl coriander seed, crushed
1/2 cup olive oil
3/4 cup whole milk
2 eggs
1.5 cups pimento stuffed green olives, very, very well-drained

Directions:
Preheat over to 350 degrees. Butter and flour an 2.5 x 4.5 inch (6 cup) loaf pan, and reserve.
In mixing bowl with whip attachment, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and spices.
Add the olive oil and mix for 1 minute on medium speed.  Then add milk and eggs and mix for 1 more minute, or until well-combined.
Stir in the olives.  Spoon batter into prepared pan, tap on the counter to release any air bubbles, and bake for about 60 to 65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let cool in pan 10 minutes, then turn out and place right side up on a rack to cool.
