Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1  onion, sliced
1 teaspoon fennel seed
1 teaspoon celery seed
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
1 pint heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat and brown chicken breasts in the hot butter until lightly golden on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Chicken will still be slightly pink inside. Set chicken breasts aside.
Cook and stir onion in the same skillet until translucent, about 5 minutes; stir in fennel and celery seed along with black pepper until thoroughly combined. Pour in cream, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer, stirring often, until sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Place chicken breasts into the cream sauce and spoon sauce over chicken; cook until chicken breasts are no longer pink inside and the juices run clear, about 10 more minutes.
