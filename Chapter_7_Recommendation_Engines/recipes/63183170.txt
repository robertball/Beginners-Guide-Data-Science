Ingredients:
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup canned pure pumpkin (Libby's is the best!)
1 wedge The Laughing Cow Light Creamy Swiss cheese
2 dashes cayenne pepper, or more to taste
Dash black pepper
2 slices light bread
2 tsp. light whipped butter or light buttery spread (like Brummel & Brown), room temperature
1 slice fat-free cheddar cheese

Directions:
Bring a skillet sprayed with nonstick spray to medium heat on the stove. Add onion and, stirring occasionally, cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
To the bowl, add pumpkin, cheese wedge, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. Mix until smooth and set aside.
Lay bread slices flat and evenly spread the upward-facing sides with butter. Flip slices over. Evenly top one slice with pumpkin mixture, followed by the slice of cheese. Place the other bread slice on top, buttered side up. Set aside.
Re-spray skillet with nonstick spray and bring to medium-high heat on the stove. Gently place sandwich in the skillet and cook until lightly browned on the outside and hot on the inside, about 2 minutes per side, flipping carefully with a spatula.
