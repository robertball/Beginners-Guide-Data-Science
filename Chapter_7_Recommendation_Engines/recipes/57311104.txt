Ingredients:
2 cups cottage or ricotta cheese
1 large egg
1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese
1 jar marinara sauce
10 oz. package frozen spinach
9 lasagna noodles
1 cup water
black pepper and italian seasoning to taste

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix thawed and drained spinach, cottage cheese, 1 cup mozzarella, egg and seasonings.
Spray cooking spray on a lasagna tray or 13x9x2 baking dish.
Layer 1/2 cup sauce, 3 noodles and 1/2 cheese mixture. Repeat layer.
Top with remaining noodles then sauce and sprinkle with 1/2 cup of mozzarella.
Pour water around the edges and put a few toothpicks on top. This will prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil.
Cover with foil and bake at 350* for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, or until lasagna is bubbly. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.
