Ingredients:
3/4 cup gluten free oat flour
1 cup Gluten Free oats
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
1/2 cup honey
2 tbsp coconut oil, melted and cooled
1 tsp vanilla
1 large egg white, room temperature
1/8 cup frozen raspberries, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degree F and prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a small bowl, combine the oats, flour, salt, baking powder and cinnamon.
In a separate larger bowl, add egg white, vanilla and honey and combine fully.
Next fold the egg mixture into the flour mixture just to combine. Then add coconut oil stirring to incorporate.
Add the raspberries to the batter, breaking them into smaller pieces within the batter.
Scoop the batter onto the prepared baking sheet to make 10 cookies.
Bake 13-15 minutes until edges are slightly brown. Remove from the oven and cool 5 minutes on the baking sheet before removing and cooling fully on a wire rack.
Store cookies in the refrigerator up to a week or freezer for a month!
