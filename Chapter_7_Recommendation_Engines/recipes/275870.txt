Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3 cups vegetable broth
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast (optional)
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
Whisk together flour, oil, and garlic powder in a small pot over medium heat. Mix in vegetable broth, soy sauce, yeast, onion powder, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer, whisking constantly to avoid clumps, until fully thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.
