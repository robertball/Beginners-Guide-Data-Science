Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped almonds (optional)
cooking spray
1 (18.25 ounce) package brownie mix with fudge packet included
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/3 cup cold water
1/4 cup plain nonfat yogurt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread almonds in an 8-inch square baking pan.
Toast almonds in the preheating oven until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool.
Combine brownie mix, fudge packet, and oil in a large bowl.
Whisk water, yogurt, and vanilla extract together in a glass measuring cup using a fork. Pour over brownie mix in the bowl; stir until batter is well-blended, 40 to 50 strokes.
Line the baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on each side. Spray aluminum foil with cooking spray. Pour batter into the pan. Spread almonds on top.
Bake brownies in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes.
Let brownies stand until cooled, at least 15 minutes, before lifting out of the pan and cutting into squares.
