Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
1 teaspoon salt
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
vegetable oil cooking spray
2 ½ tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Mix flour, seafood seasoning, and salt in a large resealable plastic bag; place chicken breasts in bag, seal, and shake to coat chicken with seasoned flour. Place chicken into a roasting pan and spray with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 35 to 40 minutes.
Mix hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and unsalted butter in a large bowl. Toss baked chicken breasts in hot pepper mixture to coat; serve.
