Ingredients:
1 pound beef sirloin or tenderloin
1/2 cup coconut oil
3-4 teaspoons arrowroot powder
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon peeled and chopped ginger
2-3 green scallions, chopped
1/4 cup coconut aminos
1 head broccoli, cut into florets

Directions:
Thinly slice the steak, about 1/4-inch thick, across the grain. Cut the slices into 2-3-inch long strips.
Heat the oil large sauté pan over high heat. Toss the beef in the arrowroot powder and shake off excess. Fry the beef in 2 batches in the hot oil, turning once, until crispy and golden, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove the beef from the pan and set aside on paper towel lined plate.
In a medium bowl combine garlic, ginger, scallions and coconut aminos.
Add a little more oil to your pan over medium-high heat. Add in broccoli and let sauté for about 5 minutes. Add in coconut amino mixture and stir to coat the broccoli. Add in steak back in the pan and let  warm through. When the broccoli is done remove from heat.

Description: 
I love my one pot meals and this recipe is just super easy and I enjoyed over my Jícama chopped salad.  The sauce coated the vegetables but because they are all hearty they kept a great crunch.  

Enjoy!
