Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon lemon extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups oatmeal

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.
Cream together the butter and sugar in a large bowl. Blend in the eggs, lemon extract, and vanilla extract. Sift together the flour, salt, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Slowly add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, beating continually. Stir in the oatmeal.
Roll the dough out onto a lightly-floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut dough into shapes using cookie cutters and arrange them on the prepared sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool on a cooling rack before frosting.

Description: 
This is my great-grandmother's recipe. It has survived four generations and is still at the top of my cut-out recipe list. The secret is to roll the dough extra thin! Frost with buttercream frosting for best taste.
