Penne Alfredo with Vegetables Recipe

NA
Ingredients:
½ (1 pound) package whole wheat penne
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
2 large cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 ½ cups fat-free half-and-half
1 cup fat-free milk
1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Transfer pasta to a large bowl.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
Melt butter in another skillet over medium heat; cook and stir flour in melted butter until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Gradually whisk half-and-half and milk into flour mixture until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning into cream sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in tomatoes, spinach, and onion mixture; simmer until heated through.
Pour vegetable sauce over pasta and toss to coat.
