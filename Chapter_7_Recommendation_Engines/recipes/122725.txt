1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

1 medium zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 large sweet red pepper, cut into 1-1/2-inch pieces

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Pour half into a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container. Refrigerate the remaining marinade for basting. Add pork to bag or container and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1-4 hours. Drain and discard marinade. On four metal or soaked bamboo skewers, alternate pork, zucchini and red pepper. Grill, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 3 minutes on each side. Baste with reserved marinade. Continue basting and turning kabobs for 4-6 minutes or until meat juices run clear.
