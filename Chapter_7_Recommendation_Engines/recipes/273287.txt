Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch sea salt
1 cup coconut oil, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon molasses
2 eggs
2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 cup dark chocolate chips
3/4 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sift whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Set aside.
Combine coconut oil, sugars, and molasses in a medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat in eggs one at a time. Gradually stir in the sifted flour mixture until well blended. Mix in oats, chocolate chips, and cranberries.
Drop teaspoonfuls of dough onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 8 to 9 minutes. Let stand on the cookie sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
I have been searching for a healthier cookie treat for my girls. I experimented with other recipes and used whole wheat flour and coconut oil in place of white flour and butter or vegetable oils. The result is a yummy, chewy treat for your family!
