Ingredients:
1 1/2 c. cinnamon graham cracker crumbs
3/4 c. sugar, divided
1/4 c. butter melted
1 pkg. (14 oz.) caramels
2/3 c. evaporated milk
1/2 c. chopped pecans, divided
2 pkgs. (8 oz. each) cream cheese, softened
2 T. flour, divided
2 eggs, beaten
1 1/2 c. chopped peeled apples
1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon

Directions:
Place a grease 9-inch spring-form pan on a double thickness of heavy-duty foil.  Securely wrap foil around pan.
In a small bowl, combine cracker crumbs, 1/4 c. sugar and butter.  Press onto the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of prepared pan.  Place on a baking sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool on a wire rack.
In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, 1 T. flour and remaining sugar until smooth.  Add eggs; beat on low speed just until combined.  Combine apples, cinnamon and remaining flour; fold into cream cheese mixture.  Pour into crust.
Place spring-form pan in a large baking pan; add 1 inch of hot water to larger pan.  Bake for 40 minutes.  Reheat reserved caramel mixture if necessary; gently spoon over cheesecake.  Sprinkle with remaining pecans.
Bake 10-15 minutes longer or until center is just set.  Remove pan from the water bath.  Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.  Carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen; cool 1 hour longer.  Refrigerate overnight.
