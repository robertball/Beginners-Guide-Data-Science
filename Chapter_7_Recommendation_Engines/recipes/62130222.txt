Ingredients:
2 zuchinnis cut into thin roundlets
2 yellow squash cut into thin roundlets
3-4 tomatoes cubed
3-4 potatoes, peeled, and cut like fries
5-6 eggs
2 hot peppers (anaheim, habenero, etc...)
salt and pepper to taste
2-3 Tblsp. Tunisian Harissa (depends on how spicy you want it)

Directions:
Fry all the of the vegetables until tender.
Fry the eggs until cooked, but still have a runny yolk.
Place all the fried ingredients together in a bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Using two knives, cut into the ingredients until it is well blended and everything is cut up into really, really tiny pieces. It will look like a mushy mess.
Add a little bit of water to Tunisian Harissa in a separate bowl. Mix together until thick but runny.
Pour over the Kaftaji, and serve warm with bread.
