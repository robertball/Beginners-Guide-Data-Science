Ingredients:
1 cup raisins (optional)
1 1/2 cups milk
2 eggs
3 cups wheat bran cereal (such as Kellogg's® All-Bran™)
1 (15 ounce) can canned pumpkin
1 cup honey
2 apples, cored and grated
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons pumpkin spice
1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 muffin tins with paper liners.
Place raisins in a microwave-safe bowl; cover with water. Microwave on high until plump, about 70 seconds. Drain.
Beat milk and eggs together in a bowl; mix in bran cereal. Let stand until cereal softens, about 5 minutes.
Mix raisins, canned pumpkin, honey, apples, and butter gently into the cereal mixture. Add flour, baking soda, pumpkin spice, and baking powder; mix batter gently until combined.
Spoon batter into the lined muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer muffins to a cooling rack; let cool for 40 minutes.
