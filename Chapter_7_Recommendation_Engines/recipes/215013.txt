Ingredients:
1/2 fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and chopped
1/2 pound strawberries, quartered
3 kiwifruit, peeled and diced
1 large mango - peeled, seeded and diced
1/2 cup grape tomatoes
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 1/2 pounds tilapia fillets
1/2 teaspoon seasoned pepper blend

Directions:
In a bowl, toss together the pineapple, strawberries, kiwifruit, mango, tomatoes, cilantro, and balsamic vinegar.
Spray a skillet with cooking spray, and heat over medium-high heat. Sprinkle tilapia fillets with seasoned pepper blend, and pan-fry until fish turns white and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve fish topped with salsa.

Description: 
A delicious fruity salsa topping to serve over fish or chicken, from a friend in Florida.  I always use whatever that I have left in a mixed greens salad the next day. Use any kind of fish -- I use tilapia or salmon. The fish may also be grilled, which is what I prefer. If I can't find a good fresh pineapple, I will use canned pineapple tidbits.
