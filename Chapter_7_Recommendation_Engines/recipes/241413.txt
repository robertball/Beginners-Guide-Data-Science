Ingredients:
5 slices bacon, or more to taste, cut into bite-size pieces
1/2 Bosc pear, sliced
2 tablespoons basil pesto
1 12-inch pre-baked packaged pizza crust
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until completely browned, about 10 minutes; remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel to drain.
Spread pesto over the pizza crust to cover in a thin layer to within 1/2 inch of the edges. Sprinkle about 1/2 the mozzarella cheese over the pesto. Arrange bacon pieces and pear slices atop the cheese; dot with crumbled goat cheese and top with remaining mozzarella cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted, 9 to 10 minutes.
