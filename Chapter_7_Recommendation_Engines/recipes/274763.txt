Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 (3 ounce) package raspberry-flavored gelatin mix
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
10 ounces frozen black raspberries, thawed
4 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup milk
1 cup chocolate chunks
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
Frosting:
10 ounces frozen black raspberries, thawed
1 1/2 sticks butter, softened
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 (16 ounce) packages powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners.
Combine cake mix, gelatin powder, and baking powder in a large bowl. Add blackberries with their juices, eggs, oil, and milk. Beat using an electric mixer until well blended.
Dust chocolate chunks lightly with flour; fold into batter.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean and cakes spring back lightly when touched, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating pans once halfway through baking time.
Remove from the oven and let cool on wire racks for 10 minutes before removing from tins and letting cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes more.
Beat blackberries, butter, vanilla extract, and salt together using an electric mixer on medium speed in a mixing bowl until creamy. Add powdered sugar gradually, beating after each addition, until frosting has a nice stiff, but spreadable, texture. Frost cooled cupcakes.

Description: 
This is a recipe I created when I wanted to make cupcakes that tasted just like black raspberry ice cream! They turned out perfect, and the color is great, too. Be sure to frost them with the black raspberry buttercream to get the full effect!
