Ingredients:
3+1/2 to 5 oz prepared, hardened meringue
1+1/2 c	      fresh raspberries, divided
1/4 c	      Cointreau
2 c	      heavy cream
1 packet      Oetker Whip It whipped cream stabilizer
2 tsp	      granulated Splenda
20 oz	      lemon curd or lemon pie filling
2 small pkg   cooked coconut pudding, prepared &             chilled
12 oz	      flaked coconut, toasted, divided
16 oz	      raspberry jam

Directions:
Break meringue into pieces and chop with a knife to make coarse crumbs.
Drizzle all but 4 to 6 of the raspberries with Cointreau; let macerate for a few minutes.
In a large, chilled bowl, mix together the cream, Whip It and Splenda; beat with an electric mixer on high until stiff peaks form.
Stir about 2/3 of the coconut into the pudding; reserve remaining coconut for sprinkling.
Microwave the jam for about 10 seconds so it is runny but not too hot.
Place half of crumb mixture in bottom of a trifle bowl or other clear glass bowl, then:
half of the lemon curd
half of the raspberry jam
half of the cocoanut pudding
half of the whipped cream
half of the remaining coconut
Repeat layers, ending with reserved raspberries and coconut flakes.
Chill until ready to serve.
