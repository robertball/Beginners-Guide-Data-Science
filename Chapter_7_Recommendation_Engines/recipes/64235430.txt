Ingredients:
2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups chopped apple
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 8 1/2 x 11 inch pan.
In a large bowl, mix together melted butter, brown sugar, and white sugar with a wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon; slowly pour into wet mixture until just combined. Stir in the apples. Spread the mixture evenly into the prepared pan. In a cup or small bowl, stir together the remaining cinnamon and sugar; sprinkle over the top of the bars and press down.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in preheated oven; finished bars should spring back when lightly touched. Cool in the pan, and cut into squares.
