Ingredients:
3 chicken breasts, fresh or frozen
1 1/2 cups cooked rice
1 cup Wholly Salsa® dip
1 (14.5 ounce) can black beans
1 cup frozen corn (optional)
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
Wholly Guacamole dip
Sliced tomatoes
Salt to taste

Directions:
Put the chicken breasts, beans, salsa, lime juice, and corn into the crockpot. Also add salt and pepper to taste.
Cook on high for 4 hours (or until your chicken is done).
The last 30 minutes, add the cooked rice and stir into mixture so it can soak up the remaining juices.
Shred the chicken for the tacos, this is optional, but makes them much easier to eat!
Then add the cream cheese to the top and let it melt in.
Once the time is up stir it all together really well.
Scoop the filling into your taco shells, hard or soft, and then top with the Wholly Guacamole dip and tomato. Super yummy!
