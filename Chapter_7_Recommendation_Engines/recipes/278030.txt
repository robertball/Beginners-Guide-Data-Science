Ingredients:
Blueberry-Ginger Syrup:
1 pint blueberries
1 cup water
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1/4 cup crushed ice
2 tablespoons orange juice
1/4 cup club soda
1 slice orange (optional)

Directions:
Bring blueberries, water, sugar, and ginger to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, crushing the blueberries occasionally with a masher. Remove from heat and let cool, about 10 minutes. Pass the mixture through a food mill or fine mesh sieve to remove the skins of the blueberries. Set aside 1/4 cup syrup and store the remainder in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
Place crushed ice in a glass. Add reserved blueberry-ginger syrup and orange juice. Top off with club soda and stir to combine. Garnish with orange slice.
