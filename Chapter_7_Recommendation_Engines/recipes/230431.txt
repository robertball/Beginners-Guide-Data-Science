Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup red bell pepper, cut into thin matchsticks
1/2 cup chopped onion

1/2 cup milk
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1 cup chopped cooked ham
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir red pepper and onion in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes.
Beat eggs and milk together in a bowl until smooth; add spinach, ham, mozzarella cheese, feta cheese, salt, and black pepper. Gently stir to mix evenly; pour into the skillet.
Place a cover on the skillet and cook until the egg mixture is completely set in the center, 7 to 10 minutes. Cut into wedges to serve.
