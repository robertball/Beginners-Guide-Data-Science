Description: 
Fresh basil, Parmesan cheese, garlic, walnuts, and olive oil come together to make an easy and tasty pesto sauce! I recommend making several batches at a time and freezing the sauce for later use! A family favorite for the past 10 years! Use 1 cup pesto sauce with 1 pound cooked pasta, tossing well to mix. Great with chicken, chickpeas, and mushrooms, too!
