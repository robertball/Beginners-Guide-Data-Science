Ingredients:
2 (9 inch) unbaked pie shells
2 pounds lean ground pork
1 pound lean ground beef
1 1/2 cups mashed potatoes
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 egg white

Directions:
Brown ground beef and ground pork over medium heat until thoroughly cooked.  Drain off grease.
Mix together cooked meat, potatoes, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
Line a 9 inch pie dish with pastry.  Spoon pork mixture into pie crust, and top with second pie crust.  Brush top crust with egg white.  Shield crust edges with aluminum foil to prevent burning.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes.  Remove foil for final 15 minutes of baking to brown edges.

Description: 
Pork Pie is a standard Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve  treat in my predominantly French-Canadian hometown in Maine. It's served with catsup or mustard, tossed salad, and pickles. Simple but wonderful. Top individual servings with catsup or mustard before serving.
