Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon instant yeast
1/2 tablespoon Kosher salt
1 â€“ 1 1/4 cups lukewarm water

Directions:
First Step: Mixing and Storing the Dough
Measure the flour (with dry-ingredient measuring cups), using the scoop and sweep method. Basically, you just scoop up the flour, then sweep off the top with a knife.
Mix together the flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl.  Add the lukewarm water (about 100 degrees F.)  Use a wooden spoon or a Danish dough whisk to thoroughly mix the ingredients.
Cover the container with a lid that is not airtight. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for approximately 2 hours or until it begins to collapse.
Second Step: Baking
Sprinkle a little flour over the top of the dough and pull off a grapefruit-size ball. Then tightly shape the ball by stretching the surface around to the bottom on all sides.
Set the oven at 450F. Just slide the shaped and scored loaf (on the parchment paper) onto the preheated baking stone.  Then quickly pour hot water into your steam pan.  Close the oven door immediately to trap the steam.  Bake the bread for about 30 minutes, or until the crust is browned and firm to the touch.
Remove the loaf to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and serving.
