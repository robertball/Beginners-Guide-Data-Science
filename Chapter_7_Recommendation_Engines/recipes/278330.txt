Ingredients:
Fruit Salad:
1 cup mini farfalle pasta
2 mandarin oranges, peeled and segmented
2 kiwi fruits - peeled, sliced, and quartered
1 medium apple, diced
1 medium Bartlett pear, cored and diced
1/4 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as Ocean Spray® Craisins®)
2 tablespoons pomegranate arils
2 tablespoons minced celery
Dressing:
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon poppy seeds

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 7 minutes. Rinse under cold water and drain well.
Meanwhile, combine mandarin orange sections, kiwi, apple, pear, dried cranberries, pomegranate arils, and celery in a large bowl.
Add pasta to the fruit salad, mixing until well combined.
Whisk lime juice, honey, olive oil, and poppy seeds together in a small bowl. Pour over pasta salad and stir until combined. Place in the refrigerator until flavors have blended, about 30 minutes.
