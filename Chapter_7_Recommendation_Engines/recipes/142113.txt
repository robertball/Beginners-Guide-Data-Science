Ingredients:
8 ounces dried figs
8 ounces dried apricots
8 ounces pitted prunes
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/4 cup pine nuts
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Place the figs, apricots, prunes, cranberries, raisins, and golden raisins into a bowl. Pour in just enough water to cover. Cover the bowl and soak overnight, at least 8 hours.
Pour the fruit with the soaking water into a saucepan. Stir in the pine nuts and honey. Bring to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until the fruit is tender but still holds its shape, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat; return the fruit and liquid to the bowl, being careful not to break up the fruit. Cool to room temperature.

Description: 
A really, truly gorgeous dried fruit salad that i serve in the evenings to share with my mum and sisters over a good movie. I use organic pine nuts, and rain forest honey... of course, you don't have to, but sometimes these little touches help, I think. Add the pine nuts however much or little you like 'em, about 2 ounces is good for me. I serve this in sundae glasses, to show off the fruit, with plain yogurt and a sprinkling of Demerara sugar.
