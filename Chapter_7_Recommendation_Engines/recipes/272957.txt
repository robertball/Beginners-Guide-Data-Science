Ingredients:
8 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons tahini
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons Sriracha sauce
1/2 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
5 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 3/4-inch strips
8 green onions, diced
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
10 wooden skewers

Directions:
Place garlic, soy sauce, sugar, red wine vinegar, tahini, lemon juice, Sriracha sauce, and pepper in a food processor. Blend well until smooth.
Pour the marinade into a zip-top bag; add chicken, green onions, and toasted sesame seeds. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours to overnight.
Meanwhile, place wooden skewers in a container filled with water and soak at least 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Thread chicken onto skewers.
Grill chicken skewers until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side.
