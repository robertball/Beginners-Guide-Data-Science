Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups wholemeal spelt flour
1 package fast-acting dried yeast
1  teaspoon salt ( I use sea salt)
1 cup quick oats or rolled oats
1 1/2 cup millet flour
1/3 cup chia seeds
1/3 cup flax seeds (optional)
2 cups warm water
1 Tablespoon honey or molasses

Directions:
Preheat the oven 400 F.
Dissolve honey in water.
Combine all the ingredients, adding the water-honey mixture last.
Mix well and turn the dough into a greased loaf tin.
Put straight into the oven and bake for an hour.
Remove the loaf, turn it out of the tin and then return it to the oven without the tin for a further 5-10 minutes.
NOTE: If you keep your flour in the refrigerator be sure to warm it up before mixing. (I actually just heat it on the stove stirring and testing to make sure it's warm.)
