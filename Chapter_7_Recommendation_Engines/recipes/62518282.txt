Description: 
This is one of the recipes i grew up with. My cousin Lynn introduced the family to it.  We would have it at special family gatherings and holidays.  It would have to be hidden until everyone was about full of everything else so there wouldn't be a stampede.  This desert would be gone in less than 15 minutes!!! Hope you enjoy!!!
