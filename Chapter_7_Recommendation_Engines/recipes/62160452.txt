Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup shortening
16 ounces cream cheese, softened
3 1/2 pounds powdered sugar
1 tablespoon pure vanilla
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a large bowl cream together butter, shortening and cream cheese. Add sugar, vanilla and salt and mix until combined. Mix on medium speed for a couple of minutes or until light and fluffy. This will be a stiff frosting. You can add either 2 to 3 tablespoons water or cream to the recipe to thin it down a little.

Description: 
I have been decorating cakes for 12 years and this is the best cream cheese butter cream I have found. Works great with all borders and basket weave designs. This frosting will not have the taste and texture of a traditional cream cheese frosting. This frosting is a cream cheese butter cream that is stable for decorating cakes. This is the only recipe I use for cakes, cupcakes and cookies.
