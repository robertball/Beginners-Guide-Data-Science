1/4 cup worsteshire
1/8 cup red wine
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together garlic, soy sauce, oil, ketchup, oregano, and black pepper. Pierce meat with a fork on both sides. Place meat and marinade in a large resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat grill for medium-high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Place steak on the grill, and discard marinade. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes per side, depending on thickness. Do not overcook, as it is better on the rare side.

Description: 
The secret to making less expensive cuts of meat tender is a good marinade. This one fits the bill. Mix up soy sauce, vegetable oil, ketchup, oregano, and three cloves of garlic, and then marinate the meat overnight. Grill, and slice on the diagonal.Modified from: London Broil I
