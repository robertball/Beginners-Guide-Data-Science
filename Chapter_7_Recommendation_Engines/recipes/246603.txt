Ingredients:
2 cups Buffalo Wing Snack Factory® Pretzel Crisps®
1 pound chicken tenders
1 egg
1 1/2 cups buffalo wing sauce, divided
1/4 cup peanut oil
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon sour cream
1/4 cup blue cheese crumbles, or to taste
1 dash Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Using a rolling pin, crush Pretzel Crisps(R) until fine, but with some texture. Transfer to a clean plate. In a bowl, beat together the egg and one cup of the buffalo wing sauce, and set aside. Dip each chicken tender first in the egg mixture and roll to coat in the crushed pretzels.
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat until shimmering. Add chicken tenders and cook, turning often, until golden brown on all sides (about six minutes total). Transfer to paper towels to drain. In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, blue cheese, and Worcestershire sauce. Serve blue cheese sauce with chicken and remaining 1/2 cup or reserved wing sauce.
