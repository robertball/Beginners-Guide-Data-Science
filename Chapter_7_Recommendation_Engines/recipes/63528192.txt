Description: 
I love hollandaise sauce, but not all the high calories & fat it contains. I don't remember where I found this recipe, but it is a great substitute for a classic hollandaise sauce, cutting the fat & calories quite a bit. Another plus is that it does not separate like a classic sauce will. And leftovers can be refrigerated and reheated!
