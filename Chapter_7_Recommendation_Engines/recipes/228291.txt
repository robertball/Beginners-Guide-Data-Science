Description: 
A sweet, refreshing adult beverage. Great for those long summer nights relaxing poolside. I use the Luccio d'asti moscato from Cost Plus World Market. It's sweet and very refreshing. Also feel free to add any other fresh or frozen fruit such as raspberries, strawberries, cherries, blueberries, and blackberries. You could even mash up some of the fruit before adding to the pitcher.
