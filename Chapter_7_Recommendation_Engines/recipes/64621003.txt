GP-Friendly Green Monster Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
4 oz apple juice (about 2 small apples)
2 oz carrot juice (big handful of baby carrots)
1 oz cucumber juice (about 1/3 of a cucumber)
1 oz kale juice
1/2 banana, frozen (or 1/2 cup ice)
1 tsp NutraSea Plus D Omega-3 Fish Oil - Apple Flavor

Directions:
Peel and core the apples. Peel the carrots (if not using baby carrots) and cucumber. Wash the kale. Feed all fruits/veggies through an electric juicer. Tip: Collect the juice in a measuring cup so that you know when you have the appropriate amount of each juice. Add the kale first; the other fruits will push extra kale juice out of the machine.
Strain the juice really well to remove any pulp.  Tip: Put a small fine mesh strainer over the cup that you use to collect the juice. Then pour the juice through the strainer again when you add it to the blender.
Combine juice, fish oil and banana/ice in a blender and blend until smooth.

Description: 
This very healthy smoothie is based on Dr. Andrew Weil’s Green Monster smoothie. I tweaked the recipe a bit to make it a little more GP-friendly and added NutraSea fish oil for Omega 3 and vitamin D.
