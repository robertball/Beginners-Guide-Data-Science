Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 lbs ground chuck, browned and drained
1 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic minced
2 cans (15 oz) tomato sauce
1 package (16oz) dry spaghetti broken into 4 to 5 inch pieces  (I used Angel Hair I think it is the best for this recipe)
2 to 3 teaspoons Italian seasoning
2 cans (4oz) sliced mushrooms, drained
6 cups tomato juice.

Directions:
Combine all ingredients (except dry spaghetti) in stoneware; stir well.  Cover and cook on LOW 6 to 8 hours (high 3 to 5 hours).  Turn on HIGH during last hour and stir in dry spaghetti.
I cut the recipe in half (except the onion and garlic) and it yielded maybe 6 large helpings.  Also I had to let it cook almost 9 hours before the last hour on high with spaghetti.

Description: 
This is the old Morton House frozen spaghetti entrees we used to buy that you can't find anymore!!  Actually I found it in a little Rival Owner's guide with one of my crockpots.
