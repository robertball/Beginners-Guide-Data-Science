Ingredients:
1  cup  cream of coconut
2tablespoons  light corn syrup
4  large egg whites
2 teaspoons  vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon  table salt
3 cups  unsweetened, shredded, desiccated coconut (about 8 ounces)
3 cups  sweetened shredded coconut (or flaked), about 8 ounces

Directions:
1. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper and lightly spray parchment with nonstick vegetable cooking spray.
2. Whisk together cream of coconut, corn syrup, egg whites, vanilla, and salt in small bowl; set aside. Combine unsweetened and sweetened coconuts in large bowl; toss together, breaking up clumps with fingertips. Pour liquid ingredients into coconut and mix with rubber spatula until evenly moistened. Chill dough for 15 minutes.
3. Drop heaping tablespoons of batter onto parchment-lined cookie sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Form cookies into loose haystacks with fingertips (see illustration 1, below), moistening hands with water as necessary to prevent sticking. Bake until light golden brown, about 15 minutes, turning cookie sheets from front to back and switching from top to bottom racks halfway through baking.
4. Cool cookies on cookie sheets until slightly set, about 2 minutes; remove to wire rack with metal spatula.
