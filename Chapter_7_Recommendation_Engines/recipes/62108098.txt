Ingredients:
3 lbs. baking potatoes
2 lbs. red potatoes
2 lbs. papas criollas (small yellow potatoes)
3 whole chickens, cut into pieces, skin removed, seasoned with salt and pepper
3 green onions, chopped
1 large sprig fresh cilantro
5 quarts water
2 cubes chicken bouillon
20 guasca leaves - this is the most important item in the dish.  If you don't have this, it won't taste like Ajiaco
4 ears of corn, cleaned and cut into pieces or "wheels" two inches long
1 cup peas, shelled if fresh.  If frozen, rinse before putting into pot.
Prior to serving:
Cream
1 small jar capers, drained
4 avocados, cut into quarters just before serving

Directions:
Wash, peel, and cut potatoes into cubes.  The skin on the papas criollas can be left on or they can be omitted entirely if you cannot find them.
Cook chicken with green onion, cilantro, water, chicken bouillon, and corn for 20 minutes.  Add potatoes and peas; cook until thickened.
Add guasca leaves and boil another 5 minutes.
Remove cilantro stalk and guasca leaves and discard.
Chop chicken and return to soup.
Serve Ajiaco in individual soup dishes (cazuela) ensuring that each dish has a wheel of corn and chicken.  Top with capers and a spoon of sour cream along with avocado and bread on the side.
