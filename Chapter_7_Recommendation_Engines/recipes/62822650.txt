Ingredients:
1 large (our big ones were about 8 inches long!) cucumber
1/3 large (or 1 small) vidalia onion
Olive oil spray
about 2 Tbsp butter (optional)
fresh herbs, salt, and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Peel, wash, and de-seed the cucumber and slice it into spears â€“ about the size of pickle spears. Slice onion in half from top to bottom, then thinly slice as much as you want to add to the dish. Chop all fresh herbs finely (I used fresh basil, parsley, cilantro, and mint which I had growing in my garden when I invented this recipe).
Line a 9x13 inch baking dish with aluminum foil (for easy cleanup) and spray with oil and add chunks of butter (optional). Lay cucumber spears in a single layer on the bottom of pan, top with thin onion slices and herbs, salt, pepper, etc. to taste. Spray top with oil. Roast at 350 for 10 minutes and turn the cucumbers over. Return to oven for 15-20 minutes, or until cucumbers are fork tender.

Description: 
I invented this recipe out of a need for a way to use the surplus cucumbers from a friend's garden this summer. I had never heard of someone roasting cucumbers, and a quick internet search turned up nothing, so I thought it would make an interesting culinary experiment. As it turned out, though, I discovered a new family favorite!

This fast and easy recipe makes a great side dish for any occasion. Great with chicken or steak! I've even eaten it by itself for a light lunch. It's delicious, nutritious, and low calorie. What more could you ask for?
