Ingredients:
3 6 ounce pkgs. fresh raspberries, washed
3 1/4 cups whipping cream, divided
1/3 cup confectioners sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
20 whole Chocolate graham crackers
2 ounces dark chocolate, finely chopped

Directions:
Take out 32 of the best-looking Raspberries and set them aside for the garnish.
With a hand mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer, whip 3 cups of cream until it just holds stiff peaks. Add the confectioners sugar, vanilla and whip to combine.
Spread a heaping spoonful of whipped cream on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan, or a similarly-sized platter. Lay down 5 chocolate graham crackers. Lightly cover the top of the graham crackers with more whipped cream, and then a single layer of raspberries, I did 8 rows of four. Repeat three times, until you have four layers of graham crackers. Spread the last of the whipped cream over the top and swirl it lightly with a spoon. Top with remaining Raspberries.
To make the ganache, heat the cream until bubbles form around the edges, then pour over the chopped chocolate. Let it stand for a few minutes, then whisk until the mixture is thick and glossy. Drizzle this over the layered dessert with a spoon, or transfer to a squeeze bottle and use that to drizzle.
Refrigerate for at least four hours, or until the crackers have softened completely. Top with remaining 32 raspberries.
