Ingredients:
4 pork chops
4 potatoes, quartered
1 ear corn - husked, cleaned and quartered
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
3 tablespoons water
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/8 cup dried bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place pork chops on a lightly greased large square of aluminum foil. Place potatoes and corn around chops. Pour soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and water over all. Then distribute the onion and garlic amongst the chops and veggies; top by sprinkling bread crumbs and dry seasonings of your choice over all.
Close foil around all and seal tightly. Place foil pouch in a 9x13 inch baking dish lines with another sheet of aluminum foil, in case of spilling. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. The pouch provides 'self-basting', so you need only remove from the oven and serve!
