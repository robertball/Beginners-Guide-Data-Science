1 1/2 cup brandy
2 oranges
2 lemons
2 limes

1 1/2 cups sparkling water
sliced oranges, lemon and limes for garnish (optional)

Directions:
In a 2 quart container, stir honey and triple sec together until honey is dissolved. Juice and strain the citrus fruits. Add the juice, brandy, wine and sparkling water. Adjust sweetness with more honey dissolved in triple sec. Dilute with sparkling water for a less potent beverage. Garnish with sliced fruits, if desired. Serve in tall glasses over ice.

Description: 
My husband, Randy, has perfected traditional sangria. I shared this tasty and potent summer cooler with my AR friends at MauiGirl's home, ergo, the title of the recipe. I hope that you enjoy it too. Be careful. This sangria can sneak up on you!
