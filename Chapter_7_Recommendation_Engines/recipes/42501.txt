Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
6 cups frozen cubed hash brown potatoes
3/4 cup chopped green pepper
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
6 eggs
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp. Remove bacon; crumble and set aside. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons of drippings.
Add potatoes, green pepper, onion, salt and pepper to drippings; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are browned and tender, about 15 minutes.
Make six wells in the potato mixture; break one egg into each well. Cover and cook on low heat for 8-10 minutes or until the eggs are completely set. Sprinkle with cheese and bacon.
