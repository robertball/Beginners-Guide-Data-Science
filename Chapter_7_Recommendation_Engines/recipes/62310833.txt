Description: 
This is a great work week recipe. It tastes even better the next day. I like to prepare it for cooking the night before, refrigerate overnight in the crock, and just pop it into the slow cooker in the morning. It's a nice healthy and hearty meal to come home to after a long day at work.Modified from: Laura's Quick Slow Cooker Turkey Chili
