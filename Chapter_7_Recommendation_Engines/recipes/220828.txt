Description: 
A wonderful and easy-as-ABC raw, vegan brownie that requires no baking or processed sugar.  Change up the sweet (raisins, dates, prunes, dried cherries) according to what your taste buds say, and experiment with the fat too (almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts, pine nuts). You can increase the cocoa powder to 1/3 or even 1/2 cup if darker chocolate taste is desired.
