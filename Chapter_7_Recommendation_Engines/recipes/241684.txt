Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
2 onions, or more to taste, chopped small
3/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper, divided
4 potatoes, sliced
3 tomatoes, sliced
1 1/2 cups water, divided
3/4 cup tahini
2/3 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix ground beef, onions, and parsley together in a large bowl. Mix allspice, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper together in a bowl; add to beef mixture and mix. Spread the meat mixture into a casserole dish in an even layer, but not all the way to the edges.
Arrange potato slices atop the beef mixture; season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Arrange tomato slices in a layer atop the potatoes; season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Pour 1/2 cup water around and over the layers of beef, potatoes, and tomatoes.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
Stir tahini and lemon juice together in a bowl until smooth. Slowly stream remaining 1 cup water into the tahini mixture until fully incorporated and smooth; pour over and around the layers of beef, potatoes, and tomatoes.
Continue baking until the beef is no longer pink in the center and the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes more.

Description: 
This is my comfort food. Quick dish and so tasty. Can't decide what my favorite is. The potatoes, the tomatoes, the onion, or beef! Old Middle Eastern dish my mom makes when she wants something quick. Tahini sauce is to taste. If you like it lemony, add more lemon juice. Or if you like tahini, add more tahini. Serve with white rice.
