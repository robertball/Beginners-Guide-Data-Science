4 cups fresh blueberries
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1 teaspoon fresh grated orange zest
3/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
Batter:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon freshly grated orange zest
