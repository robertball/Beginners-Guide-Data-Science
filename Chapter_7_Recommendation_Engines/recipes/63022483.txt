Ingredients:
1 Tbsp. Flaxseed Meal
1/2 cup pecans or pecan pieces
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tsp. orange zest, plus more for garnish if desired
1/4 tsp. salt
1 Tbsp. vanilla extract
1 stick (4 oz) butter or margarine, softened
2 Tbsp. fresh orange juice
1 cup confectioners sugar

Directions:
Combine flaxseed and 2 Tbsp. water in small bowl. Set Aside.
Grind Pecans into a fine meal in food processor.
Cream together sugar and butter with electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add in flaxseed mixture and vanilla, beat until smooth.
Beat in flour, orange zest, and salt until a smooth dough forms.
Divide dough in half. Transfer each dough half to a large sheet of wax paper. Use the paper to shape dough into 2 logs 1 1/2 in-x 1 in logs. (can use spatula to flatten sides to make square cookies) Wrap the logs tightly with plastic wrap and chill for 2 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350F. Slice dough logs into about 3/8 in clices, and transfer slices to a greased baking sheet. Bake about 15-17 minutes, or until cookies are brown on bottoms.
Whisk enough orange juice into confectioners sugar in bowl to make a thick glaze. Spread glaze onto each cookie with a pastry brush while hot. Cool on baking sheets before moving to cooling racks.
Can spread more glaze when first layer is cool. Sprinkle with orange zest to decorate.
Enjoy!
