Ingredients:
2 (9 inch)  refrigerated pie crusts
3 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted and sliced
1 pint fresh strawberries, sliced
1/2 pint fresh blueberries
4 tablespoons sugar, divided
4 tablespoons flour, divided
6 tablespoons turbinado sugar, divided

Directions:
Lay out one pie crust on a baking sheet lined with parchment or on a baking stone, leaving room for the second pie crust next to it.
Mix together the sliced peaches with half the blueberries, 2 tablespoons of the flour and 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a bowl.
Pour over one pie crust leaving a 1-inch border.
Fold up the uncovered border over the edge of the fruit and pinch into pleats. Sprinkle the crust and fruit filling with 3 tablespoons of turbinado (or raw) sugar.
Lay out the second pie crust on the baking sheet.
Mix together the sliced strawberries, the rest of the blueberries, 2 tablespoons of flour and 2 tablespoons of sugar in the bowl.
Pour over the second pie crust and form the galette the same as the first.
Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of turbinado sugar.
Bake at 450Â° until crust is lightly browned, 12 to 14 minutes.
Sprinkle with more sugar if desired.
Serve warm or at room temperature.

Description: 
Here's a quick and easy way to create a beautiful summer fruit dessert.  I love to use fresh peaches, strawberries and blueberries, but frozen fruits should also work. It will look like you spent hours making this fancy 30 minute dessert! Pairs great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.Modified from: Summer Fruit Galettes
