Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 1/2 cups dry bread crumbs
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 pinch Italian seasoning, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine beef, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and Italian seasoning in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Transfer mixture to a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
