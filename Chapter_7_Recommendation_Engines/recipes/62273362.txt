Ingredients:
*   1-3/4  pounds beef round, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
* 1/4  teaspoon salt
* 1/4  teaspoon black pepper
* 2  tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1  large onion, peeled and sliced
* 3/4  teaspoon ground cumin
* 3/4  teaspoon ground ginger
* 2  cinnamon sticks
* 1  can (14-1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes
* 1  can (14-1/2 ounces) reduced-sodium beef broth
* 1/2  pound green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 2  cups shredded carrots
* 3  cups cooked whole-wheat couscous

Directions:
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Season beef with 1/8 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large flame-proof covered casserole over medium-high heat. Brown beef for 3 minutes, turn and brown for 3 additional minutes. Remove to a plate and reserve. Add remaining tablespoon oil and the onion and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in cumin, ginger, cinnamon, tomatoes, broth and remaining 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over high heat and stir in the beef and any accumulated juices. With a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the casserole. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours.
3. Meanwhile, bring a medium-size pot of water to a boil. Add green beans and cook 3 minutes, until crisp-tender. Drain and rinse in cold water. Set aside.
4. After 1-1/2 hours, stir the green beans and shredded carrots into the casserole. Cover and bake an additional 30 minutes.
5. Serve with couscous.
