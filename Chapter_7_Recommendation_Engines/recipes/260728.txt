Ingredients:
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, finely chopped
1/2 pound peppered salami, finely diced
1 (8 ounce) container herb and garlic-flavored cream cheese
5 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
1 egg
1 teaspoon mild paprika, or to taste
1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed

Directions:
Heat butter in a skillet over medium-low heat and cook red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper until soft but not browned, about 5 minutes.
Mix bell peppers, salami, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, and egg in a bowl. Season with paprika.
Dust a flat work surface lightly with flour. Unroll both puff pastry sheets and roll out to 2 large rectangles. Spread bell pepper mixture over the puff pastry, leaving a 1-inch border. Roll puff pastry up tightly like a jelly roll and place in the freezer until filling hardens, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 or 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Remove puff pastry rolls from freezer and slice into 1/2-inch-thick slices; lay 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack until lightly browned and puffed up, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
These puff pastry pinwheels are my favorite party finger food and people love them. The chopping takes a bit of time as you want to make sure that the bell peppers and salami are very finely chopped. I sometimes use half peppered salami and half regular salami as well to cut down on the pepper. They are easily made in advance and then you only have to bake them when your guests arrive.
