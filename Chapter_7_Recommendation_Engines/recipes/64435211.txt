Ingredients:
1/4 cup flaxmeal
3/4 cup water
3 ripe bananas
15 ounces sweet potato puree
1/4 cup canola oil
1/2 cup applesauce
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup vanilla plant-based protein powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
2 tablespoons pecans or walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Lightly spray 2 9-inch loaf pans.
In a small bowl mix the flaxmeal and water together, and set aside.
In a large bowl, mash the bananas with a fork. Add the sweet potato, oil, and applesauce, and mix until combined.
In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, protein powder, sugar, baking soda, salt, and spices.
Stir the flaxmeal and water mixture into the bowl of wet ingredients. Then add the dry ingredients to the bowl of wet, and mix well.
Divide the batter evenly between the 2 loaf pans. Sprinkle each loaf with 1 tablespoon of the chopped nuts.
Bake for 50 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out dry.
Cool in pan for 15 minutes, and then transfer to a cooling rack. Enjoy!
