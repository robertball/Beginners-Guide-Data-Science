Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 large eggs
2 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.
Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next.  Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the oats and raisins; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.  Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
