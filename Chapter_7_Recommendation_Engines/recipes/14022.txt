Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed
1 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup minced red bell pepper
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Squeeze the water out of the spinach, and place the spinach into a mixing bowl. Stir in the onion, garlic, vegetables, sour cream, mayonnaise, and cumin. Season with salt and pepper. Let the dip stand at room temp for 1/2 hour for the flavors to mix, and stir again before serving. This dip keeps well in the fridge, covered, for up to 1 week.

Description: 
An unbaked spinach dip. Unlike many other spinach dips this one is served deliciously cold.  Enjoy! You can replace the red bell pepper with minced carrot or cucumber, or try using a combination of the three.
