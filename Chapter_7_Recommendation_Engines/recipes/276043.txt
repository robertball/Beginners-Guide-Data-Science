1 tablespoon butter
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined

1 cup chopped red bell pepper
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp and saute until they just turn pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove shrimp from the skillet and set aside.
Add onion and bell pepper to the skillet and cook until crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk in flour, curry powder, pepper, and salt. Cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in chicken broth and coconut milk; continue cooking over medium heat until mixture is thickened and bubbly. Stir in cooked shrimp and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until shrimp are thoroughly heated. Serve curry immediately over rice.
