5 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 2/3 tablespoons baking powder

Grease a 12-inch cast iron skillet.
Sift flour, sugar, and baking powder together in a large bowl.
Beat eggs with milk in a separate bowl.
Stir egg mixture into flour mixture until moistened; batter will be very thick.
Fold in raisins until thoroughly combined.
Spread batter into prepared cast iron skillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until bread has risen and is golden brown on top, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is my family's traditional St. Patrick's Day bread. My grandmother has had this recipe for longer than I've been alive. I was SHOCKED to find out this wasn't real Irish Soda Bread, but instead more commonly known as Spotted Dog. Whatever you call it, it is unbeatable topped with a bit of butter.
