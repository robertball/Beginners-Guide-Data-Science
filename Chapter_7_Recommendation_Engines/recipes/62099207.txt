Ingredients:
4 teaspoons butter
1 1/4 cups sweet onions, chopped
2 1/2 cups Courtland or Spy apples, chopped
4 cups butternut squash, cubed
3 cups chicken broth
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon minced fresh sage
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the onions and cook until golden.  Add the apples, squash and broth.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer covered until the squash is tender, about 20 minutes.  Put the squash mixture, coriander, sage and pepper in a food processor and run until smooth.  Return the mixture to the pan and stir in the milk.  Cook about 3 minutes to heat through.  Pour into bowls and sprinkle with a mixture of nutmeg and cloves.

Description: 
My good friend Eileen, a very busy professional, surprised me last Thanksgiving with this wonderful recipe.  I love it because it is so flavorful without being thickened with heavy cream or cheese.  A perfect appetizer or light lunch.
