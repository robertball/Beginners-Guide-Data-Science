Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat rotini pasta
1 (10.75 ounce) can low-sodium cream of mushroom soup
1/2 (8 ounce) container sour cream
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 cup thinly sliced carrots
1 cup 1-inch pieces fresh green beans
1/2 cup diced red onion
1 cup grated Colby-Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rotini until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Mix soup, sour cream, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, black pepper, and celery salt together in a bowl. Stir in rotini, tuna, mushrooms, carrots, green beans, and red onion.
Pour into a casserole dish and sprinkle top evenly with Colby-Monterey Jack cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
I wanted to give the classic tuna casserole recipe a little more pizzazz. The addition of spicy red pepper flakes and fresh vegetables gives this recipe the extra kick it needs to take tuna casserole from boring to exciting.
