Ingredients:
2 cups (280 g) gluten-free flour
1 teaspoon xantham gum (omit if your flour blend already contains it)
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar
3 tablespoons (22 g) confectioners' sugar
orange zest, from one orange
8 tablespoons (112 g) butter flavored shortening
1 1/2 tablespoons ground chia seeds + 4 tablespoons & 1/2 tablespoon warm water to form gel
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 350 F. Line rimmed baking shets with parchment paper or silpat.
In a large bowl, place the flour, xantham gum (if using) baking powder, salt, granulated sugar, confectioners' sugar and orange zest and whisk to combine well.
Add the shortening, chia seed gel, and vanilla and mix to combine. The dough will be relatively stiff and you may nee to squeeze it between your hands to bring it all together.
Roll the dough between two sheets of parchment paper to about 1/3-inch thick. Using cookie cutters, cut dough and place them about 1-inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Place the baking sheet in the center of the preheated oven and bake until just set, about 6-12 minutes (I cooked to 10 minutes). The edges of some may brown. Take them out before there is any significant browning. The longer they cook, the less soft they will be. Remove cookies from the oven and allow them to cool until set. Transfer to a wire rack and cool completely.
After they are cooled, cookies may be frosted.
