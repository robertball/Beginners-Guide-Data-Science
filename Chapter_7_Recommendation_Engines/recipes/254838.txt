Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) box Barilla® Spaghetti
1/4 cup Sriracha chile sauce
1/4 cup honey
1 lime, juiced
2 tablespoons neutral oil (such as coconut or canola)
2 cups thinly sliced mushrooms
2 medium carrots, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1 cup thinly sliced yellow or green bell pepper
1 cup sugar snap peas, halved lengthwise
1 (26 ounce) jar Barilla® Spicy Marinara Sauce
Sesame seeds (optional)
3 green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
In a small bowl combine the Sriracha, honey, and lime juice; set aside.
In a large pot bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil; add salt to taste and the Spaghetti; stir gently.
Cook pasta according to package directions; remove from heat and drain well.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet heat the oil over medium heat; add the mushrooms, carrots, bell pepper, and sugar snap peas.
Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 7 minutes or until tender; add the Spicy Marinara and stir; add the pasta and toss to combine.
Serve in bowls and top with a drizzle of the Sriracha-honey mixture, green onions, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds, if desired.
