Ingredients:
1 ball of pizza dough
1 cup low-moisture mozzarella
1/3 cup smoked Gouda
1/3 cup smoked Jarlsberg
1/3 cup shaved Parmesan
1 cup marinara sauce
1/2 cup shredded basil
Cornmeal for dusting

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 450 F with a pizza stone or inverted sheet tray on the middle rack.
Whether you've made the dough yourself from scratch or purchased premade dough from your local pizza parlor, start by allowing the dough to come to room temperature on the counter. I prefer to use a fermented dough myself, but choose whichever you like best. Cover with plastic wrap while it comes up to temp.
While your dough is warming up, shred your cheeses and combine in a mixing bowl.
Once the dough is at room temperature, roll it out to approximately 16 inches in diameter on a lightly cornmeal-dusted surface such as a pizza peel or inverted sheet tray. Top with the marinara, your smokey cheese blend, and the shredded basil. Transfer your pizza from your work surface to the preheated oven, directly onto the pre-heated stone.
Allow to bake for 14-16 minutes, until your preferred level of browning is attained.
Allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing into 6 even slices.
Enjoy!

Description: 
For when Buzz steals the last slice, make your own. Serve with a glass of milk, Kevin McAllister style. The smokey cheese blend provides a distinct flavor reminiscent of a wood-fired pie from a standard in-home oven and the pre-heated cooking surface doubles down on the difficult-to-attain-at-home crusty crunch.
