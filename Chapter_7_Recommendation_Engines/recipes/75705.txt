Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
1 pound mild Italian sausage links
1/3 cup water
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 large onion, sliced
1 medium green bell pepper, sliced
1 medium red bell pepper, sliced
1 tablespoon Marsala wine
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes, undrained
1 pinch dried oregano

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
Place whole sausages and 1/3 cup water in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cover, and cook 5 to 8 minutes. Drain and thinly slice.
Return sausage to skillet. Stir in garlic, onions, peppers, and Marsala wine. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until sausage is cooked through. Stir in diced tomatoes, black pepper, and oregano. Cook about 2 minutes more, then remove from heat. Serve over cooked pasta.
