Ingredients:
1 pound brats, cooked & cooled
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large sweet onion, halved, then sliced in julienne strips
8 ounces penne pasta
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons flour
2 bottles good craft beer, I used pale ale
4 ounces shredded sharp cheddar
2 ounces shredded Swiss cheese
Fresh ground pepper
1 tablespoon stone ground or spicy brown mustard
1/4 cup French fried onions

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for pasta.  Cook pasta until l dente, drain.
While cooking pasta, melt 1T butter & 1T olive oil together over medium high heat.  Add onions & a pinch of salt.  Caramelize until very golden & soft.  Add to large bowl.
Slice brats while onions carmelize, add to large bowl.
In same pan as onions, melt 3T butter, add flour to make a roux, cook 1 minutes.  Gently stir in 2 cups of beer, continue stirring until roux dissolves, bring to a simmer & cook 1-2 minutes until thickened & flour taste cooks out.  Recede heat, gradually add cheeses stirring until melted & smooth.  Add mustard & pepper to taste.   Stir in extra beer as needed to thin sauce, should be a medium consistency, thin enough to pour smoothly, not thick & gloppy.
Stir drained pasta in with brats & onions, add most of sauce & toss to coat.  Pour into a casserole dish, top with remaining sauce.  Can be refrigerated @ this point to bake off later.
If refrigerated, warm on counter for an hour before baking.
Bake in a preheated 375* F oven, covered 20 minutes, uncover, top with French fried onions & bake another 10-15 minutes until golden & bubbly

Description: 
My DH wanted brats but didn't want them in buns, or even done hash style with potatoes like we frequently do.  He asked can you pu them in a casserole with maybe a little cheese & onion.  Thi is what came out if that.  You get nice beer-cheese sauce on brats, onions, & pasta to hold it all together.
