Ingredients:
2  zucchini, cut into noodle-shape strands
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
½ cup chopped green bell pepper
⅓ cup chopped white onion
1 tablespoon seasoned salt (such as Spike(<sup>&reg;</sup>) seasoning)
1 pinch sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2  sweet pepper chicken sausages, sliced
1 cup lightly torn fresh spinach
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon garlic paste
1 large tomato, diced
¼ cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook zucchini noodles (zoodles) in the boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 3 minutes; drain.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir green bell pepper, onion, seasoned salt, and sea salt for 3 minutes. Add chicken sausage and cook until sausage is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add spinach, basil, garlic paste, and seasoned salt to taste; cook until spinach is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Place zoodles on a serving plate and toss with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and sea salt. Add sausage mixture and tomatoes and top with Parmesan cheese; season with salt and pepper.
