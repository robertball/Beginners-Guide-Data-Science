Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup blueberries
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups.
Stir the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Beat the egg, milk, and oil together in a separate bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; pour the egg mixture into the well, and stir until the flour mixture is just moistened. Be sure to not over-mix. Fold the blueberries and walnuts into the batter. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups to about 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
Muffins are a great part of a brunch or tea. These are not too sweet, which lends to the favor of the fruit in this muffin. Sprinkle sugar on top of muffins before baking for a sweeter top.
