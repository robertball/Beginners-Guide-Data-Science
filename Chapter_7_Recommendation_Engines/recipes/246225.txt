Ingredients:
5 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1 large onion, chopped
1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger
2 tablespoons curry powder
3 cups vegetable stock
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 large yam, cut into chunks
2 large carrots, cut into chunks
2 ribs celery, chopped
½ cup red lentils
¼ cup minced lemongrass
2 tablespoons white sugar
salt to taste
1 (12 ounce) package medium-firm tofu, cubed and patted dry

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and ginger; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add curry powder; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour vegetable stock and coconut milk into the pot. Add yam, carrots, celery, lentils, lemongrass, and sugar. Increase heat to medium-high; bring to a boil. Reduce heat slightly; simmer until vegetables soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Season soup with salt.
Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add tofu in a single layer; cook until lightly browned, about 4 minutes per side. Stir tofu into soup.
