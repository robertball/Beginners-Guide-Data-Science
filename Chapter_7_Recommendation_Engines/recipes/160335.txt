Ingredients:
5 tablespoons semolina flour
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 egg
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat.
Stir together the semolina flour, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning in a small bowl; set aside. Whisk together the egg, olive oil, and salt in a larger bowl until smooth. Slowly whisk in the semolina until a soft dough has formed.
Drop the dumpling dough by the teaspoonful into the boiling water. Boil until the dumplings float to the surface and have grown in size, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and serve immediately.
