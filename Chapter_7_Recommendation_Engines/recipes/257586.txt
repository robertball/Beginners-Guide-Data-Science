Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked glutinous (sushi) rice
3/4 cup water
1/4 cup minced red onion
2 limes, juiced
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
canola oil for frying
1 rice paper wrapper, quartered
4 ounces sashimi-grade ahi tuna, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 English cucumber, very thinly sliced
1 red Fresno chile pepper, very thinly sliced
1 green onion, thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon black sesame seeds
1 lime wedge

Directions:
Rinse rice in a strainer until water runs clear; drain well. Combine with water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat; let cool.
Place red onion in a dish. Stir in lime juice and salt. Let stand until pickled, about 20 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry rice paper quarters in the hot oil until crisp, 15 to 20 seconds. Drain crackers on paper towels.
Place tuna in a bowl. Add pickled red onions, olive oil, and soy sauce; stir to coat tuna.
Scoop rice into a serving bowl. Top with tuna mixture. Fan out cucumber slices on top of tuna. Garnish with chile pepper, green onion, and sesame seeds. Serve with rice paper crackers and  lime wedge.

Description: 
I first fell in love with yellow fin ahi when I lived in Hawaii. This is a recipe where I take my memories of living there for three years and have combined them into a nice burst of salty soy sauce,  fresh lemon juice, and bright fresh tuna.
