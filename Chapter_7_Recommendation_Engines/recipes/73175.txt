Ingredients:
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 (16 ounce) package cream cheese frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking pan with cooking spray.
In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add cream cheese, cinnamon, and vanilla to pan, and stir until smooth. Remove from heat, and cool for 5 minutes.
Spread cinnamon and cream cheese mixture over puff pastry. Roll puff pastry into a log, and pinch ends together to keep filling inside. Place roll in prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from oven, and spread cream cheese frosting over warm roll. Serve warm or at room temperature.
