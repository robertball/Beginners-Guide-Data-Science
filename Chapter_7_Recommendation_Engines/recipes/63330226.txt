Ingredients:
2 1/2 Quarts of chopped yellow tomatoes- remove stems and any discolored skins
1 Quart chopped peeled peaches
1 large sweet onion minced
1/2 cup minced roasted chilies, seeds and skins removed
1/2 cup white wine vinegar
1 cup sugar
1 Tbs canning salt
1 Tbs ground cumin
1 Tbs fruit preserver to prevent discoloration
1/2 cup chopped cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Stem & chop tomatoes first.  Prepare the chilies, onions, and other remaining ingredients, except the cilantro, in a large stock pot and combine them with the tomatoes before chopping peaches.  Peel, chop, and add peaches last to prevent discoloration, occasionally tossing them with the other ingredients while preparing them.
Cook the salsa at a high boil for 30 minutes and remove from the heat.  Use a fine mesh strainer to remove the salsa product to a separate bowl or pot.  Add only enough liquid back to this pot so that it covers the strained fruit.  Add the cilantro last.
To can, have 8 hot sterile pint jars and a hot water bath ready.  Fill cans up to 1/2 inch from the top, sealing with clean dry lids.  Can in hot water bath for 30 minutes.  Allow to cool and check lids for seal before labeling and storing.

Description: 
This golden sweet and mild salsa is a great solution for those heirloom yellow or orange tomatoes and combines well with peaches, which are being harvested at the same time.  It is a favorite of the kids who are not always fond of typical salsas and shy from spicy foods.  It also makes an excellent gift as a unique canned good.
