Ingredients:
3 eggs , well beaten
1 1/2 cup raisins,dried cranberries,or dried blueberries.
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 1/2 cups flour
1 teaspoon Kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 cups Old Fashioned oatmeal
1 1/2 cup chopped pecans, or walnuts.
I use pecans with cranberries and blueberries, or walnuts with raisons.  Mix and match for a different twist with every batch.

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 350 degrees (convection, or standard oven)
1. Cream together butter and sugars.
2. Add flour, salt, nutmeg and soda and mix well.
3. Blend in egg-raisin mixture, oatmeal, and chopped nuts.
4. Dough will be stiff. I like a wooden spoon as have broken several spatulas trying to use them.
5. Drop by heaping teaspoons, or a soup spoon onto ungreased cookie sheet, or roll into balls and flatten slightly.
6. Bake at 350 degrees for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned.
TIPS:  I love Silpat baking sheets for cookies.  If you don’t have these, line your pans with parchment paper.
My favorite version of this cookie is to use Walnuts and dried cranberries. Be sure you use “Old Fashioned” oats and not the “quick” oats;  “rolled oats” would be the same as Old Fashioned.

Description: 
This is a great tasting cookie high in fiber. The oatmeal, fruit and nuts makes it a healthy snack as far as a cookie goes.  I love to use walnuts and dehydrated cranberries for the fruit/nut combination.
