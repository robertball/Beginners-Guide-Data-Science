Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 large zucchini, sliced
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 cup white wine
4 ounces blue cheese, crumbled
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine
3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, for garnish

Directions:
Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the zucchini and garlic; cook until the zucchini is tender. Stir in wine, blue cheese, cream, and pepper; simmer 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to boil. Add fettuccini, and cook until tender, about 6 to 8 minutes. Drain, rinse under warm water, and drain again.
Return pasta to the pot, and toss with sauce over low heat. Serve with Parmesan and parsley sprinkled over the top.

Description: 
This is a delicious and simple vegetarian pasta dish. Use your favorite blue cheese -- I always use Danish blue as I'm a lover of strong flavors. Use spinach fettucine if you like!
