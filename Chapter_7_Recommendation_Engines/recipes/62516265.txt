Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
24 mushrooms, stems removed and chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (12 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend
3 tablespoons grated Asiago Pressato
1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the onions and mushroom stems in the hot oil until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl; add the artichoke hearts, cream cheese, sour cream, Italian cheese blend, and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Stir the mixture until ingredients are evenly distributed. Stuff the mushroom caps with the mixture. Arrange the stuffed mushrooms on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the filling begins to bubble, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I substituted mayo for sour cream because I wanted the stuffing to brown a bit more, yet stay moist.Modified from: Artichoke Stuffed Mushrooms
