Ingredients:
1 (12 pound) whole ham
8 ounces butter
2 cups honey
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup red wine
3 tablespoons ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut long, shallow lines around the surface of the ham in a crossing patter, scoring the ham to create a diamond pattern all over the outside of the ham. Place ham into a roasting pan.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium. Stir honey, brown sugar, red wine, and black pepper with the melted butter; cook and stir until ingredients blend into a glaze, about 10 minutes. Spread glaze in an even layer over the ham, reserving some of the glaze to apply while the ham roasts.
Cook ham in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), glazing every 10 minutes, 30 to 45 minutes.
