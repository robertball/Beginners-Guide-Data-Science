Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
3 tbsp butter
3 tbsp flour
1 clove garlic, peeled and smushed
2 bay leaves
3-4 cups milk
3/4 cup grated gruyere or swiss cheese
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
salt and pepper

Directions:
In a small pot, warm the milk, clove of garlic, bay leaves, and salt and pepper. Once heated, cover and remove from heat.
Blanch cauliflower florets in boiling salted water, about 3 minutes, drain.
In a medium sized pot, melt butter and add flour, whisking for 2 minutes until golden.  Remove garlic and bay leaves from milk, and pour into the roux.  Whisk frequently, cooking over medium heat, until mixture thickens, then add the grated gruyere or swiss.
Place cauliflower into a casserole dish, cover with sauce, then top with grated parmesan.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 20-30 minutes, or until bubbly.  Turn on the broiler for about a minute, to let the top brown.  Enjoy!
