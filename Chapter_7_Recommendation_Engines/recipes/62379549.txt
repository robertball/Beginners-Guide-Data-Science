Ingredients:
Cookies:
-------------------------
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon lemon extract
1 tsp. dried orange peel
3 ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup sesame seeds
Citrus glaze
------------------
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice
1/2 tsp. lemon extract
1/2 tsp. dried lemon peel

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease or line baking sheets with parchment paper.
For the cookies:
Combine all the wet ingredients first, then add the spices, and finally the dry. Add the sesame seeds last.
Drop the dough by spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.
For the glaze:
Whisk all ingredients together. Add small amounts of powdered sugar till the consistency is right.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 to 17 minutes. When the cookies are done, they will be golden around the edges, dry in appearance, and slightly cracked on top. Transfer to wire racks to cool for 20 minutes. Drizzle lightly with the glaze and cool completely.
