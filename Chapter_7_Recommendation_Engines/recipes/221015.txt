Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple in juice, drained and juice reserved
1 cup brown sugar
1 (8 ounce) carton egg substitute (such as Egg BeatersÂ®)
2/3 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups shredded carrots
1 cup shredded zucchini
1 cup raisins
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Combine flour, white sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and ginger in a large bowl.
Whisk drained pineapple, brown sugar, egg substitute, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until smooth.
Stir pineapple mixture, carrots, zucchini, and raisins into flour mixture just until flour is moistened.
Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes.
Cool in the pan for 10 minutes; remove cake from pan and cool completely on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.
Whisk reserved pineapple juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, with confectioners' sugar until a spreadable glaze forms. Drizzle over cooled cake.

Description: 
Very dense, moist carrot cake, full of fruit. In a taste test against a more traditional butter-based carrot cake, my co-workers thought mine must be the more sinful! But no, it's practically VIRTUOUS!
