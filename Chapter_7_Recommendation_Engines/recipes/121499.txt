Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), melted
1/2 cup chunky peanut butter
3 3/4 cups confectioners' sugar
3 3/4 cups flaked coconut
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons shortening

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Chill for 1 hour or until firm enough to shape. Shape into 2-in. logs; place on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet. In a microwave or double boiler, melt chocolate chips and shortening. Dip one end of each log into chocolate or drizzle chocolate over logs. Return to waxed paper-lined sheet; chill until chocolate is set.

Description: 
Nibbling on my nutty confections has long been a Christmas tradition. Even after our seven children moved away, they'd still ask me to send batches to them each December.
