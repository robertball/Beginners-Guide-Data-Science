Ingredients:
4 cups water
¼ teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter
3  dried red chiles, broken into several pieces
2 cups uncooked white rice
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2  garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
1  skinless, boneless chicken breast half, diced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon ground white pepper
½ teaspoon dry ground mustard
1 pinch ground tumeric
1 tablespoon butter
1 ½ cups broccoli florets
1 cup diced green bell pepper
1 cup diced red bell pepper
½ cup diced onion
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Combine water, salt, 2 tablespoons butter, and red chili peppers in a pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil.
Stir in rice, cover, and lower heat to medium. Cook until rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Heat sesame oil in a skillet or wok over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute; pour in half the soy sauce.
Cook and stir chicken, basil, white pepper, dry mustard, and turmeric with garlic until chicken is browned, no longer pink in the center, and juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes.
Mix remaining soy sauce into chicken mixture.
Cook and stir 1 tablespoon butter with broccoli, green pepper, red pepper, and onion in a separate skillet until tender, about 10 minutes.  Stir lemon juice into vegetables.
Toss vegetables with chicken.
