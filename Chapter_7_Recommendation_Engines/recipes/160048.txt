Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can sliced beets, drained with liquid reserved
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
6 whole cloves
1 pinch ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the liquid from the beets, vinegar, sugar, cloves, cinnamon and salt. Stir to dissolve the sugar and bring to a boil. Simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add the beets and simmer for 5 more minutes. Use tongs to transfer the beets to a jar. Pour the liquid over them to cover. Cover and cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until serving.

Description: 
These are quick and easy to make. You'll want to snack on them right out of the jar. They're much more flavorful than those bland sliced beets you see on salad bars.
