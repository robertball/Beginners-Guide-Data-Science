Ingredients:
1 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup vegetable or canola oil
5 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
4 teaspoons hot pepper sauce

10 bone-in chicken breast halves

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients; mix well. Pour 1 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the chicken. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Cover and refrigerate the remaining marinade for basting.
Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Drain and discard marinade from chicken. Grill bone side down, covered, over indirect medium heat for 20 minutes. Turn; grill 20-30 minutes longer or until juices run clear, basting occasionally with reserved marinade.

Description: 
This chicken is perfect for an outdoor summer meal, and my family thinks it's fantastic. It takes about an hour on the grill but is worth the wait. I use a new paintbrush to 'mop' on the basting sauce. -Jill Evely, Wilmore, Kentucky
