Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2) pound boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 red onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
2 (4 ounce) cans diced green chiles
1 teaspoon chili powder
water as needed

Directions:
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute pork in the hot pot until no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper. Stir in pinto beans, diced tomatoes, and green chiles. Add chili powder and mix well. Pour in enough water to make a thin gravy.
Cover and cook, stirring often, until meat is fork tender, at least 2 hours.
