Ingredients:
4 egg whites
1 tsp salt
1/2 c coconut sugar
1 tsp alcohol-free vanilla extract
2 c unsweetened shredded coconut
4 tbsp coconut flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 F.
Crack eggs, making sure you only have the egg whites in the bowl. Add salt. Whisk until stiff.
Add coconut sugar & vanilla extract. Whisk thoroughly.
Add shredded coconut. Use wooden spoon to mix together.
Add coconut flour until it has a doughy consistency. It has to be wet, but not runny.
Lay out parchment paper on a cookie sheet. Use a small ice cream scooper to scoop out the batter on the sheet.
Put in oven and let it cook for 20 minutes until golden on top.
After 20 minutes, check with toothpick to make sure it's not wet. Once done, take out of oven and cool for at least 10 minutes.
Once cool, serve and enjoy. Warning: these are very addicting. :)

Description: 
I love this recipe because it's allergy friendly for the most part (unless you are allergic to coconut--stay away). It's a delicious paleo treat that I came up with when I wasn't satisfied with most of the macaroons I was buying in the store. I was inspired by the Bob's Red Mill recipe, but wanted to make this recipe cane sugar free. Figured out that coconut sugar was a better, more energizing alternative. I realized how quick it was to make, and now I always have this delicious, healthy snack on hand. Best served with coffee or tea, or just on-the-go.
