Kickin' Jumbo Prawns Recipe

Ingredients:
12 JUMBO prawns - washed, peeled and deveined with tail left on
2-3 tablespoons olive oil (enough to coat the pan)
3 cloves minced garlic
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 cup white wine

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high and add the garlic. Mix around but don't let garlic turn brown. Add in cayenne pepper and mix thoroughly. Throw in the prawns and give it a quick mix to get the garlic and pepper to coat it all. Let one side of the prawns turn a beautiful red colour and then flip them over. You can lower your heat if needed. Just as the other side is almost done, pour in the white wine. This adds a bit of a sauce that can be poured over the prawns when you plate them. Once both sides have turned red, you can take them off the stove. Best made immediately before serving but also great if reheated (as long as the prawns don't turn 'rubbery')

Description: 
Fast and Easy! This recipe is best with the extra large prawns. You can serve it as a side to a piece of fish or as a meal on it's own with veggies and rice. It was given to me by a coworker and was a HUGE hit at my last dinner party.
