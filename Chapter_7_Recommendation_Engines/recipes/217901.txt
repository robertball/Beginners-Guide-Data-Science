Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 (7 inch) flour tortillas
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (10.5 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the ground beef with the onion in the hot skillet until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes; drain any excess fat. Stir the black beans, chili powder, cumin, and salt to the beef mixture; cook and stir until hot, about 5 minutes. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Arrange the tortillas atop the beef mixture.
Mix the tomatoes with green chile peppers and cream of mushroom soup together in a bowl; spread over the tortillas. Top with the Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and the cheese is melted completely, 25 to 30 minutes.
