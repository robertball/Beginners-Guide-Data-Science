Ingredients:
1 onion
1 red pepper
1 green pepper
1 bunch of Cilantro
5-6 cloves of garlic
1 tomato (average size)
2-3 Green onions

Directions:
Blend or food process the onion, peppers, cilantro, garlic, tomato and green onions. You may need to add a drizzle of olive oil to help the blending. This makes a puree mixture, you can make it a little chunkier if you prefer.  It smells vibrant and is colorful. Store in your fridge if you use often, or in the freezer if not. You can portion it out in ice-cube trays or small plastic containers.
