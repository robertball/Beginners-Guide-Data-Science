3 dried negro (pasilla) chile peppers, stemmed and seeded
3/4 pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed
1/4 white onion
1 clove garlic, peeled
water to cover
3/4 pound Roma tomatoes, halved lengthwise
1/2 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules, or to taste

Directions:
Place chile peppers in the bottom of a small saucepan. Add tomatillos, onion, and garlic. Pour in enough water to almost cover tomatillos. Arrange tomatoes over tomatillos.
Cover saucepan and bring water to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tomatoes soften, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and let cool, about 10 minutes.
Pour off most of the water and transfer mixture to a blender; puree until smooth. Season with chicken bouillon to taste.
