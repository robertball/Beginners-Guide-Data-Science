Ingredients:
Salmon:
1 tablespoon coconut sugar
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 (3 ounce) salmon fillets
Caesar Salad:
1 head lettuce, chopped, or as needed
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
5 teaspoons spicy brown mustard
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup croutons, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil.
Mix coconut sugar, paprika, orange zest, oregano, cinnamon, and sea salt together in a small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and mix well. Rub salmon evenly with the mixture; place fish on the prepared baking pan.
Roast in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
Place lettuce in a bowl. Mix vinegar, 1 tablespoon olive oil, mustard, garlic, and salt together in a small bowl. Pour dressing over the lettuce and mix well. Add croutons and place the salmon on top.
