Ingredients:
4 to 6 medium tomatoes, cut in half length wise
1 large carrot, chopped
2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 tbsp minced garlic
½ onion, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
3 c low sodium veggie broth
1 15 oz can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
4-5 dashes of hot salt
Sea Salt & freshly ground pepper to taste
Cilantro for garnish, optional

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
In medium bowl, add the tomatoes, carrots, garlic and 1 Tbsp olive oil. Toss to coat.
Place the tomato/carrot mixture in a roasting pan (or cookie sheet lined with foil) and roast for about 45 minutes or until the tomatoes are almost blackened and very soft.
When the tomatoes are close to being done, heat the remaining tbsp olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat and add the onion and remaining garlic. Saute for 5 minutes stirring frequently.
Add the celery and continue sautéing for 8-10 minutes.
Add the broth, beans, tomatoes, carrots plus salt and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil. Cover, decrease the heat, and simmer over low heat for 1 hour.
Remove from heat and pour only half the soup mixture in a blender and puree.
Return puree to pan and serve immediately. Adjust seasoning as needed and top with cilantro if desired.
