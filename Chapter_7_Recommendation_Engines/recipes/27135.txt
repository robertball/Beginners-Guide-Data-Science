Description: 
This is a recipe my family loves! it is simple and does NOT require a candy thermometer like most fudges. It's pretty simple and does not take an expert to make it; because of this many people make variations to this recipe!! You can use any kind of chips and/or nuts. I hope you enjoy my recipe!
