Ingredients:
1 box of rotini noodles
2 pounds ground beef or turkey
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 sweet onion, chopped
1 or 2 jalapeno peppers (depends on your liking)
3 cloves garlic
3 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons cumin
2 tablespoons cayenne pepper sauce (depends on your liking)
Sea salt
1 cup beer or beef broth
1 can (28 oz) diced tomatoes
1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes
Scallions

Directions:
Boil pasta until done. In a large, deep pot brown beef or turkey in oil over medium to high heat.  Add onion, peppers and garlic. Season the meat with the chili powder, cumin, cayenne, and salt.  Cook together for 5 minutes, stir in beer or broth.  You may have too much liquid at this point - if so, discard about half.  Stir in tomatoes and simmer for about 10 minutes.  Add hot pasta to the chili pot and mix together.  Garnish with the scallions.
