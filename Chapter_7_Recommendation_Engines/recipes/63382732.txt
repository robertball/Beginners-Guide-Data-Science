Description: 
In Greek: ??t?p???? s???d?t?, pronounced koh-TOH-poo-loh skor-THAH-toh

This is one of the easiest recipes to make, and one of the most tempting to eat. Adjust the garlic down if it's not a favorite, and the classic tastes of lemon and oregano will still make this dish uniquely Greek.
