Ingredients:
2 Tbsp. coconut flour

1/2 cup shredded zucchini
1/2 Tbsp. pure maple syrup or honey
1/8 tsp. pure vanilla extract
Toppings*
1/4 cup greek or coconut yogurt
fruit (I used sliced strawberries, grapes and bananas)
orange zest (optional)
drizzle of maple syrup (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Combine coconut flour and cinnamon in a bowl. Add remaining ingredients (excluding toppings) and mix well to combine.
Spread mixture into a pizza crust on a cooking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until done. Let cool and spread on yogurt and top with fruit.
Enjoy!
*feel free to top it off with whatever your little heart desires!

Description: 
I had this idea for a sweet breakfast pizza topped with fruit and yogurt, but I really wanted to do something more “cool” with the idea.  I incorporated zucchini into the sweet crust and it tastes exactly like zucchini bread only in a different form!  With the sweet toppings, this pizza is the perfect alternative to your morning slice of quick bread!
