Ingredients:
water to cover
1 1/2 pounds beef oxtail, or to taste
2 Spanish onions, peeled, divided
1 tablespoon fish sauce, or to taste
1 tablespoon whole star anise pods
1 cinnamon stick
salt to taste
3 tablespoons beef pho flavor paste
2 bunches scallions, chopped
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
1 (16 ounce) package dried rice noodles, or to taste
1 (12 ounce) package beef pho meatballs, halved, or to taste
1/2 pound sirloin steak, thinly sliced, or to taste
1 lime, cut into 8 wedges
4 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste
1 (8 ounce) package bean sprouts
1 bunch Thai basil leaves, torn into bite-size pieces
1 (2.8 ounce) can crispy fried shallots, or to taste

Directions:
Bring water and oxtail to a boil in a pot. Skim the foam and oil off the surface. Add 1 onion, fish sauce, star anise, cinnamon, and salt. Stir in pho flavor paste; cover loosely with a lid. Reduce heat and simmer broth for at least 6 hours.
Cut the remaining onion in half and slice very thinly. Place in a bowl with scallions and cilantro.
Place noodles in a large bowl and rinse. Cover with warm water and let soak for 1 hour.
Drop meatballs into the soup 20 minutes before broth is done.
Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Drain noodles and dip into the boiling water for 30 seconds. Transfer noodles into 8 large bowls.
Top each bowl with sliced sirloin. Ladle in broth, meatballs, and oxtail. Taste and season as needed. Squeeze 1 or 2 lime wedges into each bowl and mix in 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Top with the cilantro-onion mixture, bean sprouts, basil, and shallots.

Description: 
This oxtail pho recipe is authentic. This is the way my husband's family has always made it and it is delicious. My kids have grown up on this comforting noodle soup, which is especially good on a cold rainy day. Garnish with hoisin sauce and sriracha as desired.
