Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
2/3 cup salted sweet cream butter, softened
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 eggs
2 teaspoons lemon extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cream sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Whisk flour and baking powder together in a separate bowl; gradually beat into creamed butter mixture until just combined. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into butter-flour mixture until dough is thoroughly mixed; stir in lemon extract. Drop small scoops of dough onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies spring back when touched, 10 to 12 minutes.
