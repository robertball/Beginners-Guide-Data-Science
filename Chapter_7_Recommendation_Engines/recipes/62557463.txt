Ingredients:
15 oz can of pumpkin puree
4 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup melted butter
1/4 cup applesauce
2/3 cup water
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 1/2 cups all purpose flour
2 tsp baking soda
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp cloves
1/4 tsp ginger
1/2 raisins
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F
In a large mixing bowl, on low setting, mix together pumpkin puree, eggs, vanilla, oil, butter, applesauce, water and both kinds of sugar until well blended.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.  Stir the dry ingredients into the pumpkin mixture until just blended.  Fold in the raisins and chocolate chips.
Fill 24 cupcake lined muffins tins with the batter using a large cookie scoop.  You can fill them almost to the top.
Bake for 20 minutes or until toothpick come outs clean when checked.
Once cooled, you can freeze in freezer baggies or plastic container and defrost as needed.

Description: 
My daughter begs me to make these year round.  Richly spiced and healthy too with less sugar and fat than traditional recipes.  Baking as muffins instead of bread helps them cook more evenly.  These also freeze beautifully and can be thawed as needed.
