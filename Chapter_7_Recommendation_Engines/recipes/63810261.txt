Ingredients:
2 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons unsalted butter (cold)
Salt and ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat 8- or 9-inch heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over lowest heat for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, crack open 1 egg into cup or small bowl; crack remaining egg into second cup or small bowl.
Add butter to skillet; let it melt and foam. When foam subsides (this process should take about 1 minute; if butter browns in 1 minute, pan is too hot), swirl to coat pan.
Working quickly, pour one egg on one side of pan and second egg on other side. Season eggs with salt and pepper; cover and cook about 2 minutes for runny yolks, 2 1/2 minutes for soft but set yolks, and 3 minutes for firmly set yolks. Slide eggs onto plate; serve.
