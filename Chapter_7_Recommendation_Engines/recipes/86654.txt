Ingredients:
6 eggs
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons tomato-based chili sauce

Directions:
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs until well blended. When the pan is hot, pour the eggs in. Cook, stirring frequently, until the eggs are scrambled. Nice scrambled eggs should have a soft texture, not hard and leathery.
Remove the eggs from the heat, and stir in the mayonnaise and chili sauce. Serve immediately.

Description: 
My sister-in-law used to make this for breakfast, it has taste and zing, not bland like your regular scrambled eggs, and easy to prepare too.  Suitable for those who likes a bit of spice in their breakfast! Serve with toast and baked beans.
