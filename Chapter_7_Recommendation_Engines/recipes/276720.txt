Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons peanut oil, divided
2 cups diced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes with juices
1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1/2 bunch collard greens, tough ribs removed and leaves chopped
2 red bell peppers, seeded and chopped
1/3 cup natural peanut butter
6 tablespoons chopped peanuts

Directions:
Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and the black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add half the chicken; cook until no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a plate. Repeat with 1 tablespoon oil and remaining chicken.
Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pot and reduce heat to medium. Add onion; cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring, 30 seconds.
Stir in broth, tomatoes, sweet potato, collard greens, and red bell peppers; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, partially covered, until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
Return chicken and accumulated juices to the pot. Return to a boil, then stir in peanut butter; simmer until incorporated and chicken is cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Garnish with chopped peanuts.
