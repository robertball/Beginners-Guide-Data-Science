Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
1 onion, cut into chunks
3 cloves garlic, halved
5 cups vegetable stock
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 tablespoon curry paste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the cauliflower, onion, and garlic on a baking sheet, and bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
Bring vegetable stock, coconut milk, and curry paste to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the roasted vegetables, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Carefully puree the soup in a blender until it has reached your desired consistency, serve, and enjoy!
