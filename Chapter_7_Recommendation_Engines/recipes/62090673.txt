Ingredients:
6 to 8 yellow or red potatoes
4-5 hard boiled eggs, chopped
4 - 5 sweet pickles, chopped
4 green onions, sliced
3/4 cup mayonnaise (approximate)
1 Tb. yellow mustard
juice from the sweet pickles
salt and pepper to taste
paprika (optional)

Directions:
Pierce each potatoe with a knife to break skin. Place in large pot, cover with cold water and bring to a gentle boil. Cook just until you can insert a knife into the potato. The key is to not overcook the potatoes or the salad will be mushy. Cool potatoes and cube in 1" pieces, and place in bowl. Add chopped hard boiled eggs, chopped sweet pickle, and chopped green onion. Add remaining ingredients. Add about 2 Tb. juice from sweet pickle jar. Mix all ingredients together and let sit covered in refrigerator for several hours to let flavors blend. Before serving, stir again and add more mayonnaise and/or pickle juice if salad is not creamy enough. Top with paprika for color if desired.
