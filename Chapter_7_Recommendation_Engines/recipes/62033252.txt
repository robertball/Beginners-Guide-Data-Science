Ingredients:
3 lbs. chicken pieces
3 T lemon juice
1 T Adolph's meat tenderizer
1/2 c plus 1 1/2 c plain yogurt
3 T ground cumin
2 T ground coriander
1/3 c fresh cilantro
2 t paprika
1/2 t turmeric
2 t salt
1 t pepper
6 cloves garlic

Directions:
Remove the skin from the chicken, except for the wings.  Cut the breasts into quarters.  Make crosswise slits in the meat of breast, legs and thighs.  Mix lemon juice and Adolph's meat tenderizer together.  Rub this mixture into the meat of the chicken, making sure it is rubbed into the slits.
Put 1/2 c yogurt with all of the spices and garlic in a blender or food processor.  Blend until it is all liquefied.  In a large bowl, put the 1 1/2 c of yogurt and add the yogurt & spice mixture to this and blend with a spoon.  After it is well blended, put all the chicken pieces in the yogurt.  Make sure all the pieces are coated in yogurt.  Cover and marinate 8 hours or overnight.  Cook on a grill for 30-45 minutes or until the pieces are done.
