Description: 
This is about as primitive as it gets. Take some garlic, capers, anchovy, and parsley, and smash it up in a molcajete. Add a little oil and vinegar, possibly a pinch of salt and pepper, and you have maybe the world's greatest grilled meat condiment. 
I guessed at these amounts as this is not a recipe that requires precise measurements; do everything to taste.
