Savory cheese scones Recipe

Ingredients:
1 3/4 Cups all purpose flour
4 Teaspoons baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried chives
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (further pinch for topping)
5 Tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup sour cream
1 1/4 cup of grated mature cheddar
2 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Sift the flour, baking powder, Chives, cayenne pepper and salt into a large bowl. Cut in butter using a pastry blender or rubbing between your fingers until it is in pea sized lumps. Stir in 1 cup of grated cheese. Mix together 1/2 cup milk and sour cream in a measuring cup. Pour all at once into the dry ingredients, and stir gently until well blended. Overworking the dough results in terrible scones.
With floured hands, pat the scone dough into balls 2 to 3 inches across, depending on what size you want. Place onto a greased baking sheet, and flatten lightly. Let the scones barely touch each other.  Brush the tops of the scones with the 1 tablespoon of milk, sprinkle with the remaining cheese and top with a pinch of Cayenne pepper. Let them rest for about 10 minutes
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the tops are golden brown, not deep brown. Break each scone apart, or slice in half. Serve with butter or one of your favorite chutneys.
