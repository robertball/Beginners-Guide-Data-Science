Ingredients:
¼ cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon salt
¾ teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon ground mustard
¼ teaspoon black pepper
1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut in bite-sized pieces
6 cups popped popcorn
2  eggs, beaten
butter flavored cooking spray

Directions:
Combine cornstarch, salt, paprika, ground mustard, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Drop half of the chicken pieces into the bag, seal the bag, shake, and let sit 5 minutes while your air fryer is pre-heating.
Set the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and preheat for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, place the popped popcorn in a food processor and pulse to a crumb-like consistency. Place crumbs in a separate resealable plastic bag.
Dip seasoned chicken pieces first in beaten egg, then drop them into the bag of popcorn crumbs. Shake to coat.
Place chicken in the basket of the air fryer. Lightly spray with butter flavored cooking spray. Cook, in batches if needed, for 8 minutes. Flip, mist with spray again, and cook 6 additional minutes.
Using tongs, transfer chicken to a paper towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce.
