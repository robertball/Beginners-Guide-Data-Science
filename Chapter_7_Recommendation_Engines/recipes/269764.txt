Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup canola oil
1 egg
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large very ripe bananas, mashed
3/4 mini semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Combine flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.
Whisk sugar, oil, egg, milk, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir into flour mixture until just moistened. Fold in bananas and chocolate chips.
Divide batter among the muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
These muffins are so moist and full of flavor! I have looked at dozens of recipes and most had too much sugar for my liking. There is absolutely no need for a lot of sugar to make these muffins delicious. Because they have bananas and chocolate chips, I just added 1/2 cup of sugar, which turned out perfect!
