Ingredients:
1 cup butter, room temperature
3 cups white sugar
6 eggs, room temperature
3 cups cake flour
1 cup heavy cream, room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract (optional)
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, for dusting (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.
In a large bowl, cream butter for 2 minutes. Add sugar and continue beating for 5 minutes, scraping down bowl occasionally. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition.
Add flour alternately with whipping cream, beginning and ending with flour. Stir in vanilla and almond extract.
Spread batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Allow to cool in pan for 15 minutes.
Turn cake out onto a cotton dish towel and place on cooling rack covered with cotton towel. When cake is cool, top with confectioners' sugar and serve with fruit or by itself.
