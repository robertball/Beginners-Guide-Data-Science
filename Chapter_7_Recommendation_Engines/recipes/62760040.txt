Ingredients:
Ingredients
•	6 2-ounce chicken breast cutlets, pounded to 1/8-inch thick
•	Salt and pepper
•	12 very thin slices prosciutto di Parma
•	12 sage leaves
•	12 toothpicks
•	Flour, for dredging
•	4 tablespoons EVOO  Extra Virgin Olive Oil, divided
•	6 tablespoons butter, divided
•	1/2 pound egg tagliatelle or egg noodles
•	2 garlic cloves, sliced
•	1/2 cup Marsala wine
•	1 cup chicken stock
•	A small handful flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
•	Grated Pecorino Romano cheese

Directions:
Place a pot of water over high heat and bring to a boil for the pasta.
Warm a platter in low oven.
Season chicken pieces very lightly with salt and evenly with finely ground pepper on both sides. Cover chicken carefully with prosciutto and set 2 leaves of sage on each piece of chicken. Stitch sage leaves in place with the toothpicks.
Lightly dredge the cutlets in flour then heat 2 tablespoons EVOO in a large pan over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add 1 tablespoon of butter and cook 4 cutlets a couple of minutes on each side to light golden. Place cutlets on the warm platter and cover loosely with foil. Wipe pan, add remaining 2 tablespoons EVOO and another tablespoon of butter and cook remaining chicken.
Drop pasta and cook to al dente after the first batch of chicken is removed.
Remove second batch of chicken to the platter and remove toothpicks. Wipe excess oil from pan and return to stove with garlic and Marsala. Reduce by half over medium-high heat and add chicken stock. Heat to a bubble then whisk in remaining 4 tablespoons butter and parsley.
Drain pasta, reserving half a cup of starchy cooking water.
Spoon half the sauce over the chicken and add starchy water to remaining sauce. Add pasta to the pan and toss 1-2 minutes for flavors to absorb. Garnish with cheese. Serve 2 to 3 pieces of chicken with pasta alongside.
