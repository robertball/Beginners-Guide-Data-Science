Description: 
We've borrowed the best Mexican flavors and ingredients for this quick scramble. Poblano peppers can vary widely, but in general they have a medium level of spiciness. If you can't find them, green bell peppers can be substituted; to replace the heat of the poblanos, add a minced jalapeno pepper. Make it a Meal: For supper, serve with a side of black beans; for brunch, with eggs and corn tortillas.
