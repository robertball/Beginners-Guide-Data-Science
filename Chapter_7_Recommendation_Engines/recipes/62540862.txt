Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato (2 lbs)
Zest from 1 large Orange
2/3 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
3 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 cup each granulated sugar and light brown sugar
1 cup room temperature butter

Brown Sugar Icing
1 cup powdered sugar
3/4 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
1/2 cup whipping cream
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
1/4 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Steam peeled and cubed sweet potato until fork tender. Cool. Add 1/2 up to 2/3 cup orange juice and puree until canned pumpkin pie puree consistency.
Cream together butter, sugars and eggs; add vanilla, orange zest and sweet potato puree.
Sift together flour, salt, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder and baking soda.
Add dry ingredients 1 cup at a time to wet mixture until blended. Do not overmix. Batter will be thick.
Bake in lined cupcake tins at 350 degree for 18 minutes or until toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Cool cupcakes on rack
FOR ICING:
Sift powdered sugar into a bowl.
In a medium saucepan over medium to low heat, mix together brown sugar, whipping cream and butter until sugar dissolves.
Increase heat to medium high, bring to boil and boil, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes.
Remove from heat, stir in vanilla.
Pour brown sugar mixture into the powdered sugar and whisk until smooth, about 1 or 2 minutes.
Cool and stir icing long enough to thicken up for icing cupcakes
