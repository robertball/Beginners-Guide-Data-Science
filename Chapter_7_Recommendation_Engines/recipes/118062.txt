Ingredients:
4 egg whites
1 1/4 cups sugar
1/3 cup chopped walnuts
1/3 cup chopped pitted dates
1/3 cup chopped candied cherries

Directions:
Place egg whites in a mixing bowl; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Beat on medium speed until soft peaks form.
Gradually beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, on high until stiff glossy peaks form and the sugar is dissolved. Fold in the walnuts, dates and cherries.
Drop by teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto lightly greased baking sheets. Bake at 300 degrees F for 20-30 minutes or until lightly browned and firm to the touch. Remove to wire racks to cool. Store in an airtight container.
