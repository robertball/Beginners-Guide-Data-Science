Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 (4 pound) whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces
1/2 (2 pound) rabbit or sausage, cleaned and cut into pieces
1 head garlic
1 tomato, finely chopped
1 (15.5 ounce) can butter beans
1/2 (10 ounce) package frozen green beans
salt to taste
1 teaspoon mild paprika, or to taste
1 pinch saffron threads
dried thyme to taste (optional)
dried rosemary to taste (optional)
4 cups uncooked white rice, or as needed
Hard boiled egg
Roasted Red Peppers
Lemon

Directions:
Heat a paella pan over medium-high heat, and coat with olive oil. Add the chicken, rabbit; cook and stir until nicely browned. Move the browned meat to the sides of the pan, and add the tomato, butter beans, peas, and green beans. Season with paprika, and mix well.
Fill the paella pan almost to the top with water, measuring the water as you put it in. This is to help you to determine how much rice to add, as paella pans come in different sizes. Bring to a boil. Simmer for about 1 hour to make a nice broth.
Season with garlic, a generous amount of salt, and just enough saffron to make a nice yellow color. Season with thyme and rosemary if desired. The goal is to make a rich tasting broth that will soak into the rice to make it delicious. Stir in half as much rice as the amount of water in the pan. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until all of the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Serve with slices of roasted red pepper and slice of hard boiled egg.

Description: 
I lived in Spain for two years where I was taught the art of making the Paella which originated in Valencia. I haven't found anything on here which is even close to authentic, so I thought I would add this recipe for those who would like to try a taste of Spain.Modified from: Authentic Paella Valenciana
