Ingredients:
3 roma (plum) tomatoes, halved lengthwise
1 zucchini, cut into cubes
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
3 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package rotini pasta
3/4 cup prepared pesto sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Spread roma tomatoes, zucchini, green bell pepper, and onion onto a large baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Toss vegetables to coat evenly with oil; season with salt and black pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender and starting to brown, about 30 minutes. Let vegetables cool.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and set aside to cool.
Peel and discard skins from roma tomatoes. Combine the roasted vegetables, rotini, and pesto in a large bowl. Serve slightly warm or chill if desired.
