Ingredients:
Ground Round 1 lb, browned with diced onion
onion (diced and browned with hamburger above)
2 cans corn
2 cans kidney beans (15 oz)

Shredded Cheese
Tortilla chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 or put crockpot on high
Dice onions and brown in skillet with hamburger
Pour this in a casserole pot with lid (for oven), or crockpot on high setting
Add the rest of the ingredients:
(I usually drain the kidney beans and corn, but you don't have to; just depends on how soupy you want this)
Bake in oven 30-40 mins at 350 or in crock pot low or high depending on how fast you need it done.
Low: several hours; High: 1 hour
Serve with tortilla chips that are spoon shaped,
added shredded cheese on top and eat as a main course.
