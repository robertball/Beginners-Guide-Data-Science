Ingredients:
2 tablespoons low-fat milk
1/2 cup finely shredded carrot
1/4 cup finely sliced green onions
1/4 cup soft whole wheat bread crumbs
1/4 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning, crushed
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
Dash pepper
3/4 pound lean ground turkey or chicken
1/4 cup Dijon-style mustard
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
Lettuce leaves (optional)
Shredded or thinly sliced zucchini (optional)
Sliced tomato (optional)
Curry mustard (optional)

Directions:
Stir together milk, carrot, green onion, bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic salt, and pepper in a medium mixing bowl. Add ground turkey; mix well. Shape the mixture into four 1/2-inch-thick patties. Lightly grease the grill rack.
For a charcoal grill, place patties on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium coals. Grill for about 12 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the side of a patty registers 165  degrees F, turning once.
For a gas grill, preheat grill. Reduce heat to medium-hot. Place patties on grill rack; cover and grill patties as directed in step 2.
Meanwhile, stir together mustard and curry powder.
Serve patties topped with lettuce leaves, zucchini, sliced tomato, and curry mustard mixture.
