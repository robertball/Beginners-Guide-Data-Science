1/12 - 2 Tbsp. Italian Seasoning
Salt & pepper to taste
Shredded Cheddar (optional)

Directions:
On medium heat, brown the burger in 4 or 5 qt. dutch oven.
When 1/2 the way browned, throw in peppers & onion & finish browning with lid on.Salt & pepper to taste.
Now add the stewed tomatoes, corn, water, macaroni & Italian Seasoning.
Place the lid on & on medium heat, bring to a boil. Reduce heat & continue to cook for another 12 minutes or until most of the liquid is absorbed.
Turn heat off & let rest for another 5 minutes until macaroni is fork-tender, (not mushy).
