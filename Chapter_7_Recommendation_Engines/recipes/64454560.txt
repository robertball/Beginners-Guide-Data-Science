Ingredients:
Crust:
3/4 cups finely shredded dried coconut
3/4 cup sprouted buckwheat groats (or additional shredded coconut)
1/2 cup soft medjool dates, pitted
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp himalayan salt
2 Tbsp ground flaxseed
Brownies:
1 1/4 cups all purpose gluten free flour*
2/3 cup raw cacao powder or unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup coconut sugar
1/4 tsp sea salt
1/2 cup coconut oil, warmed to liquid
1 cup aquafaba*
2 tsp pure vanilla extract
Marshmallows:
1/2 cup aquafaba**
1 1/2 tsp xanthin gum or guar gum
1/2 tsp cream of tartar
1/2 cup powdered xylitol, maple sugar or coconut sugar***
1/4 tsp sea salt (if your chickpea liquid has no salt)
1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract

Directions:
For the crust, combine all ingredients in the food processor and process until small crumbs and starting to hold together.
Press into an 8x8 inch square baking pan lined with foil or parchment and oiled with coconut oil (for easy removal).
Preheat the oven to 350F degrees.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cacao powder, sugar and salt until well combined.  Add the coconut oil, aquafaba, and vanilla and whisk until smooth and well combined.  Pour the batter into the baking pan over the crust layer and place in the oven.  Bake  for 20-25 minutes until just set (you do not want to over bake). Let cool.
Meanwhile, In a food processor (which is what I used, or you may use a stand mixer with a whisk attachment), whip up the chickpea liquid until it has reached pretty stiff peaks. This will take about 2 minutes in the food processor.  Add the guar gum and cream of tartar and process until incorporated.  Add the sea salt and sugar and with the motor running, a little at a time through the feed tube (so you do not deflate it), then allow to process until the sugar is completely dissolved and the meringue is smooth, shiny and thick.  Add the vanilla, and blend until uniform in color.
Spread the marshmallows over the brownies, then place them under the broiler for about 2 minutes until the meringue is toasted and starting to brown on top (watch it closely, it could easily burn fast).  Let cool completely before cutting
