Return all to saucepan. Cook and stir over low heat 1 minute. Remove from heat; stir in butter until melted. Stir in food coloring, if desired. Pour mixture into baked pie shell.
Beat 3 egg whites in medium bowl until foamy. Add cream of tartar and beat to soft peaks. Gradually beat in 2/3 cup Equal(r) Spoonful**, beating to stiff peaks. Spread meringue over hot lemon filling, carefully sealing to edge of crust to prevent shrinking or weeping.
