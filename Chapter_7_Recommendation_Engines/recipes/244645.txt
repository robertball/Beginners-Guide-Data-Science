Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1 (11 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat shortening and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add brown sugar and white sugar and beat until smooth. Add eggs, vanilla extract, and baking soda; beat until well mixed.
Slowly mix enough flour into butter mixture until a thick dough forms; fold in chocolate chips. Spoon small mounds of dough onto a baking sheet, about 1-inch apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 8 to 9 minutes.
