Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
5 cloves Garlic, Finely Minced
1 pint Red Grape Tomatoes, Halved Lengthwise
1 pint Yellow Grape Tomatoes, Halved Lengthwise
1 Tablespoon Balsamic Vinegar
16 whole Basil Leaves (chiffonade)
Salt And Black Pepper To Taste (don't Oversalt)
8 whole Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts, Cut In Half To Create Two Thin Breasts
Salt And Pepper, to taste
Freshly Grated Or Shaved Parmesan

Directions:
In a small skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic and stir, lightly frying for about a minute, removing before the garlic gets too brown (it can be golden.) Pour into a mixing bowl and allow to cool slightly.
Add tomatoes, balsamic, basil, and salt and pepper to the bowl. Toss to combine, then taste and add more basil if needed, and more salt if needed (donâ€™t oversalt, though!) Cover and refrigerate for an hour or two if you have the time.
Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper, then grill or saute them until done in the middle.
To serve, give the tomato mixture a final stir. Arrange chicken breasts on a plate (2 at a time) then spoon a generous amount of bruschetta topping over the top.
Use extra topping on slices of grilled baguette!
