Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package bow-tie pasta
1 cup frozen peas
2 (6 ounce) cans flaked tuna, drained
1 cup diced celery
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1/3 cup chopped fresh dill
1/4 cup grated carrot
1 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until almost tender, about 10 minutes. Add peas and continue cooking for 2 minutes. Drain pasta and peas and chill quickly by rinsing with cold water.
Transfer pasta and peas to a large bowl. Mix in tuna, celery, green onion, dill, and carrot until well blended.
Mix mayonnaise, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Blend into macaroni mixture.

Description: 
This tuna and macaroni salad is a family favorite throughout the year. I like to make this the night before, refrigerate, and let the flavors blend together. Serve over lettuce or as a side dish.
