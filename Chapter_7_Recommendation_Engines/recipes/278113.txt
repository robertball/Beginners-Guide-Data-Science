Description: 
I've loved instant ramen noodles since I was a kid, but as an adult I wanted to incorporate some nutrition into them and also more flavor. Sure, you can make this on the stovetop but the beauty of using the Instant Pot® is that you throw it all in, walk away, and the veggies all get evenly cooked. No more mushy peas and underdone carrots. I like to make a batch and separate it into to go containers for weekday lunches.
