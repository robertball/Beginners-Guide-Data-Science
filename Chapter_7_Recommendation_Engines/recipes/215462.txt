Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Goya Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1/2 cup yellow onion, chopped
1 tablespoon Goya Minced Garlic
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 cup white wine
1 packet Goya Powdered Chicken Bouillon
1 teaspoon sugar
1 (15.5 ounce) can Goya Cannellini Beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15.5 ounce) can Goya Red Kidney Beans, drained and rinsed
1 (10 ounce) box spinach fettuccine, cooked according to package directions
Fresh thyme leaves (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and cook until translucent, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, oregano and thyme; cook until garlic is light golden brown, about 1 minute. Using a whisk, mix cornstarch with 1/2 cup water until dissolved. Add cornstarch mixture, wine, chicken bouillon and sugar to skillet. Bring wine mixture to a boil and cook until the sauce is reduced by half, 2 - 5 minutes. Stir beans into sauce and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes more.
Add cooked, hot pasta to skillet; stir to coat completely with sauce. Divide pasta evenly among serving bowls. Garnish with fresh thyme, if desired.

Description: 
Whether you're tossing in roasted chicken, grilled seafood, or herbed beans (as shown here), any pasta creation can be enhanced with the bold, intense flavor of GOYAÂ® Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The secret to its great taste: fresh-pressed olives, grown on a sun-soaked Spanish plateau. Just drizzle it on, take a bite and wonder how you've lived without it.
