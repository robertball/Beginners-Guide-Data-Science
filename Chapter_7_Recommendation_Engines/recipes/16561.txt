Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite size pieces
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups cooked white rice
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
3 slices soft white bread, cubed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
To Cook Chicken: Season chicken with salt and pepper to taste, place in a microwave-safe dish, cover and cook in microwave for 5 to 6 minutes. Turn and cook another 2 to 3 minutes or until cooked through and no longer pink inside. Let cool.
In a 9x13 inch baking dish, combine chicken, rice and soup and mix well. Top with cheese, then with bread cubes.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly and bread is crunchy.

Just chicken, rice, creamy soup, Cheddar cheese and soft bread cubes, mixed together and baked. This is a quick and easy dish that even the kids like! Note: If you are in a big hurry, use cooked chicken and minute rice.  Can be made ahead of time and refrigerated - just add the bread topping the night before cooking.
