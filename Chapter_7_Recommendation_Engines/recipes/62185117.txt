Ingredients:
5 cups turkey stock
2 Bayleaves
1 TSP Peppercorn
1 onion
1 Carrot
1 Celery Stock
Parsley
1 cup water
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon celery salt
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
To make your own turkey broth, simmer the neck, giblets and gizzards--omitting the liver--for 1 hour in a quart of water.  (The liver can impart a bitter taste.) You may add aromatics such as a bay leaf, peppercorns, quartered unpeeled onion, coarsely chopped carrot and celery and parsley stems. Strain broth and skim off fat. Turkey broth can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to three days.
In a medium saucepan, bring the turkey stock to a boil.
Gradually dissolve flour in water.  Slowly stir the flour mixture into the turkey stock.  Stir in poultry seasoning, pepper, celery, and salt.  Boil to desired consistency.
