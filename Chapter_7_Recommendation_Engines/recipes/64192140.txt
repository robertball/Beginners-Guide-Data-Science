Ingredients:
For the cake:
1 cup all purpose gf flour
1/2 cup almond meal
1/2 cup light buckwheat flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
2  cups pumpkin puree
2 eggs
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup coconut milk
1/4 cup applesauce
For the glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
2 Tbsp coconut milk (approximation)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 18 muffin cups.
Whisk flours, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Mix pumpkin, eggs, brown sugar, coconut milk, and 1/4 cup melted applesauce in a separate bowl; beat for 2 minutes. Gradually mix dry ingredients into pumpkin mixture to make a smooth batter; scoop batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool muffins on wire racks.
Put the powdered sugar in a bowl. Stir the coconut milk into the glaze, about 1 teaspoon at a time until a thick glaze has formed.  It should be thick enough to spread.
