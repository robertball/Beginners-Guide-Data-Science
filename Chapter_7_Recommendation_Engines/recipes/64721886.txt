Ingredients:
4 - 1 1/2” boneless pork chops
1 1/2 cups puréed roasted butternut squash
1/2 cup chicken stock
2 shallots, thinly sliced
1/2 cup mushrooms, roughly chopped
2 tbsp butter
2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 cup cream or half/half
1/2 lb dried linguini
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp sage
1 tsp dried parsley
1/8 tsp cayenne
1/2 tsp ginger
1/2 tsp turmeric
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
Season room temperature pork with thyme, salt, and pepper. Add 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp olive oil to sauté pan. When oil is ready, add chops and sear on each side for about 4-5 mins until juices run clear. Set aside and cover with foil to rest.
Start boiling salted water for linguini. Add shallots, mushrooms and remaining oil and butter into same sauté pan. Season veggies with salt and pepper. After a few minutes, add broth to deglaze pan. Add linguini to boiling water and boil as directed.
Add puréed squash to sautéed vegetables. Add sage, parsley, cayenne, ginger, and turmeric. Salt and pepper to taste. Slowly stir until blended. Add about 1/2 - 3/4 cup pasta water to thin. Add cream and simmer for about 5 more minutes.
Drain linguini and mix pasta together with sauce. Slice pork on a diagonal and add remaining juices back into sauce. Serve pork over the pasta, with a bit of the sauce drizzled over the top. A crunchy broccoli slaw or brussel sprouts make a great bitter side to offset this rich warming dish.
