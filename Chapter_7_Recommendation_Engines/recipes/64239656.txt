Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breast
1 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 package of crackers (ritz or saltienes)
2-4 cups shredded mozerella cheese
1 jar spaghetti sauce
4 tsp minced garlic
3 Tbsp butter
2 eggs beaten
Â¼ cup olive oil
Italian seasoning to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees
Pour beaten eggs into a shallow dish or bowl. In another shallow dish or bowl, mix together the grated Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning and cracker crumbs. Dip chicken breasts into beaten egg, then into cracker crumb mixture to coat.
In a large skillet, heat oil, butter and garlic over medium high heat. Add coated chicken and saute for 8-10 minutes on each side, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
Pour spaghetti sauce into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Add chicken, then add shredded cheese over each breast, and bake for 20 minutes or until cheese is completely melted.
Serve alone, over noodles or cheese tortellini
