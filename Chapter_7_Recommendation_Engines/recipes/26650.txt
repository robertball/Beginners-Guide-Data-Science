Ingredients:
2 quarts water
3 pounds boneless beef shoulder clod or chuck roast
1 small onion, quartered
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 cup ORTEGA® Green Chile Picante Sauce
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon ORTEGA® Diced Jalapenos

Directions:
COMBINE water, beef and quartered onion in large stockpot.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, covered, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until meat is very tender.  Remove beef.  Strain broth; reserve 1 cup for meat filling (remaining broth may be refrigerated or frozen for future use).  Shred beef.
HEAT vegetable oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chopped onion and bell pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes or until vegetables are tender.  Add shredded meat, reserved broth, picante sauce, cilantro and jalapenos.  Cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes or until heated through.
USE filling in burritos, tacos, tamales or tostadas.

Description: 
Though most Americans are accustomed to ground meat in Mexican foods, traditional preparation actually calls for shredded meat. This all-purpose shredded beef is great to have on hand for those nights when you are short on time. Just double this recipe and freeze half!
