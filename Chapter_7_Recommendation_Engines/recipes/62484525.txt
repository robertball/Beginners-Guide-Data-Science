Ingredients:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil
5 Eggs
3 to 4 Potatoes - sliced about 1cm thick
½ Onion - chopped
Salt and freshly ground Black Pepper

Directions:
In a large frying pan, fry the potatoes in plenty of extra virgin olive oil (60ml plus);
Fry over a low heat in a covered pan for some 10 minutes;
It is very important that the potatoes are soft and not crunchy;
In a large bowl, beat the eggs with some salt and freshly ground black pepper;
When the potatoes are soft, remove from the pan and drain the oil;
Mix them well with the beaten eggs and let stand for 5 or so minutes;
While the mixture of eggs and potatoes are resting, chop half an onion into small pieces and fry with a little oil for 5 or so minutes until softened;
When ready, pour into the egg/potato mixture and stir to mix;
Pour 2 tbsp of oil back into the frying pan and heat until hot;                                       Pour in the egg mixture and fry over medium heat;
After a couple of minutes in the pan turn the tortilla over (be careful here but using a plate is probably the easiest and most secure way);           When turning you add another tbsp oil to ensure the tortilla doesn’t burn or stick;                  When done on both sides serve hot whole or in slices or can leave to cool and serve cold;
