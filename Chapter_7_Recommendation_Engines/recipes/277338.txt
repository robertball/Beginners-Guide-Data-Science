Ingredients:
2 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick®)
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup white sugar
1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling
2 cups sweetened dried cranberries (such as Craisins®)
1/4 cup apple juice
Topping:
3 cups large-flake oats
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups butter, cubed, at room temperature

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Mix baking mix, milk, and white sugar together in a bowl until it reaches a cake batter-like consistency. Set aside.
Mix apple pie filling, sweetened dried cranberries, and apple juice together in another bowl.
Combine oats, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Mix in butter to a crumbly texture with some unmixed butter chunks. Set topping aside.
Pour baking mix mixture into the prepared pan until half full. Add fruit mixture and spread out from the center.
Bake in the preheated oven until starting to brown, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle topping over cobbler while hot. Return to the oven and bake until browned, about 15 minutes more. Serve hot or cold.
