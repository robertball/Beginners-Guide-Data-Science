Ingredients:
1 c. very warm water (about 120 - 130 degrees farenheit)
2 c. unbleached flour
1 t. salt
3 T. honey
1 package rapid rise yeast
1 c. whole wheat flour
3 T. canola oil

Directions:
Heat the water.
Mix together unbleached flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl.  Add oil, then honey, then water, then stir well.
Add whole wheat flour and stir until well-mixed.  Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead until it is no longer sticky.
Form the dough into a loaf and place in a greased bread pan.  Allow to rise until the top reaches just above the top of the pan (about 30-45 minutes). (Hint: preheat the oven to 350 degrees while it is rising)
Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and turn onto a towel to cool.  Brush top with melted butter, and allow it to cool for 15 minutes before cutting.

This bread is delicious and moist... and you don't need a bread machine! It's my mom's recipe, so if you like it, I can't take the credit.
