Ingredients:
1 tablespoon oil (canola or vegetable)
3 (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups green bell pepper strips (about 1 large)
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons red curry paste
1 teaspoon sugar
1 (14-ounce) can light coconut milk
3 cups hot cooked long-grain rice
Lime wedges (optional)

Directions:
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add oil to pan; swirl to coat.  Sprinkle chicken evenly with salt.  Add chicken to pan; cook 6 minutes or until browned, turning once.  Add bell pepper to pan; saute 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove chicken mixture from pan.  Combine juice, soy sauce, curry paste, and sugar in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk.  Add juice mixture and coconut milk to pan; bring to a boil.  Cook 12 minutes or until slightly thick.  Return chicken mixture to pan; cook 2 minutes or until thoroughly heated.  Serve over rice.  Garnish with lime wedges, if desired.
