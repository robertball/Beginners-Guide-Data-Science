Ingredients:
3 eggs
3/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon honey, or to taste
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon green tea powder (matcha)
1/4 cup cold water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until volume doubles or triples, about 7 minutes. In the following order, add sugar, honey, flour, baking powder, green tea powder, and water to eggs, beating 15 to 30 seconds before each addition. Pour batter into a 9-inch cake pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
Soft and spongy green tea cake - full of flavor, and not too sweet. This recipe has been widely enjoyed by family and friends, and I reap the side benefit of having the whole kitchen filled with the blissful aroma of green tea every time I make this. This can also be made into 12 cupcakes.
