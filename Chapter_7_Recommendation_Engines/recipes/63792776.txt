Ingredients:
4-6 cocktail tomatoes
1/2 cup plain panko breadcrumbs
1 roasted garlic pod
2 scallions, chopped
1 1/2 tbs of grated parmesan cheese
1 1/2 tbs olive oil
dash of salt
dash of freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Cut garlic pod in half. Sprinkle salt, pepper and 1/2 tbs olive oil. Wrap in aluminum foil and put into 350 degrees oven for 15-20 minutes. Garlic should be able to be squeezed out smoothly, when ready.
Make stuffing: Add panko breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, scallions, remaining olive oil, salt, pepper and roasted garlic into a small mixing bowl and mix well.
Cut tops off of tomatoes and scoop out insides until you are left with tomato "cups." Fill tomatoes with stuffing and place tops back on. You can add extra shredded parmesan cheese if you'd like. You can also drizzle olive oil onto the tomatoes but it is not necessary. Place into a non-stick baking dish and put into a 350 degrees oven for 20-25 minutes. When tomatoes look a bit wrinkly and cheese has melted, they are ready. Serve immediately.
