Ingredients:
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
5 pounds meaty beef back ribs or pork loin back ribs
6 hickory wood chunks, or more as needed
Kansas City Barbecue Sauce or your favorite bottled sauce
Kansas City Barbecue Sauce:
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
3/4 cup apple juice
1/3 cup tomato paste
1/4 cup cider vinegar
2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons molasses
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon prepared horseradish

Directions:
For rub: In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, paprika, salt, garlic powder, dry mustard, celery salt, and cayenne pepper. Sprinkle rub evenly over ribs; rub in with your fingers.
In a smoker arrange preheated coals, wood chunks, and water pan according to manufacturer's directions. Pour water into pan. Place ribs, bone side down, on grill rack over water pan. (Or place ribs in a rib rack and place on grill rack.) Cover and smoke for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until ribs are tender, brushing once with the Kansas City Barbecue Sauce during the last 15 minutes of smoking. (If ribs get too dark, wrap in foil during the last part of grilling.) Add additional coals and water as needed to maintain temperature and moisture.
Serve ribs with remaining sauce.

Simmer, uncovered, about 30 minutes or until sauce is desired consistency, stirring occasionally. Stir in horseradish.
