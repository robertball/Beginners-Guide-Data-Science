Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package cavatappi (corkscrew) pasta
1 pound ground beef
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (6 ounce) container crumbled feta cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons onion salt
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatappi in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 to 9 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large casserole dish.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, feta cheese, black pepper, onion salt, garlic powder, basil, oregano, parsley, and thyme into ground beef. Simmer until flavors blend, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour ground beef mixture over cavatappi.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 20 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I came up with this on the fly when I did not want to take the time for full-blown lasagna. My kids are all picky eaters and all asked for seconds! Measurements for spices and herbs are approximate. I do not measure when I cook.
