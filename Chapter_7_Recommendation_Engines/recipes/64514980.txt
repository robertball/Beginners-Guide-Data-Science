Ingredients:
3/4 box of penne rigate pasta
1 package of medium cooked shrimp (tail on)
2 Tbsp. of olive oil
1 cup chopped/diced green pepper
1 cup chopped/diced baby bella mushrooms
1 can of diced tomatoes
1 jar of Alfredo sauce (or make your own, approximately 12 oz. needed)
1/2  jar of sun-dried tomato pesto sauce
2 cup Italian shredded cheese
1 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup seasoned breadcrumbs

Directions:
Boil the penne pasta in a large pot of lightly salted water, 8-10 minutes or until al dente.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Thaw and de-tail the shrimp, and lightly dry. In a pan, lightly sautee the shrimp, mushrooms and green peppers in olive oil, about 10 minutes.
In a separate (larger) bowl, mix together Alfredo sauce, 1 cup of Parmesan cheese, Italian shredded cheese and diced tomatoes. When shrimp and vegetables are finished sauteeing, add to bowl and mix thoroughly. Add pesto sauce to mixture and mix again.
When pasta is done cooking, drain water and let pasta dry. Add to large bowl with cheese and Alfredo mixture. Mix again.
Move pasta/shrimp/cheese mixture to casserole dish (or multiple dishes to save for later!)
Bake in oven at 350 for 25-30 minutes, until bubbling.
NOTE: Can be served alone, or with garlic bread or breadsticks. Can be frozen for up to 3 months.
