Ingredients:
8 slices bread, crusts removed, bread lightly toasted and cubed
1 1/2 cups milk
1/4 cup unsalted butter

1 1/2 cups white sugar
4 large eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup packed brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish. Spread toasted bread into the bottom the baking dish.
Heat milk in a saucepan over medium-low heat until bubbles form around the sides. Remove from heat, add butter, and stir until butter melts. Pour milk mixture over the bread into the prepared baking dish. Stir until all bread is touching milk mixture; let stand 15 minutes.
Stir rhubarb, sugar, eggs, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; pour rhubarb mixture into bread mixture and stir. Sprinkle brown sugar over the top of the rhubarb mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, 45 to 50 minutes.

Description: 
I don't like rhubarb. But oh, how I have tried to like it. I have a patch of it growing in my yard and I wanted to find a way to use it. I've tried it in cakes, pies, cobblers, crisps, etc. This recipe was rhubarb's last stand. If I didn't like this I was giving up on rhubarb for good. And oh, boy! It is amazing. I can't wait for my rhubarb patch to ripen up this spring so I can make it again.
