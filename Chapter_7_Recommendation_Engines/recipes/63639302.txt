Ingredients:
2 c water
1.5 c whole milk
3/4 tsp WHOLE fennel seed
1 1/2 tsp WHOLE hulled cardamom
4 WHOLE cloves
3 T Indian mamri style (granulated, CTC) loose tea, such as Brooke Bond Red Label, or 4 cheap unflavored black tea bags
Sugar to taste - palm sugar is especially good.

Directions:
Pour 2 c of water into a microwave safe bowl that will hold at least 1.5 quarts (6 cups).  Heat for 1 min on high.
add the WHOLE spices and heat on high for 3 mins longer.  Some of the water will evaporate off; that's ok.
Add the whole milk and the mamri-style loose tea or tea bags.  Heat on high an additional 3 minutes, until the chai is a light brown, almost a nutmeg sort of color.
Strain out the spices and tea immediately or it will get bitter.
Sweeten to taste (I use about 2 T of palm sugar) and serve.

Description: 
A quick microwave version of Masala Chai. It took me over 20 years to finally figure out how to make masala chai - the problem was that I kept trying to use good loose leaf teas, which are easily overwhelmed by the spices. I tried making it in the microwave a couple of times but it made such a mess I just quit trying it that way.  Recently I tried it again - the problem was caused by trying to make it one cup at a time, in a coffee mug, which would always boil over.  Switching to making it in a large glass bowl solved the problem and now I have Masala Chai much more often.
