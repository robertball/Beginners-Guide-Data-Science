Ingredients:
1 medium eggplant, peeled and cubed
2 small zucchini, cubed
1/2 small yellow onion, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, sliced
1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup water
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place eggplant, zucchini, onion and mushrooms in a 2 quart casserole dish.  In a small bowl combine the tomato paste with the water, and stir in garlic, basil, salt and pepper.  Pour over the vegetables and mix well.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until eggplant is tender, stirring occasionally.  Add water as necessary if vegetables begin to stick; however, vegetables should be fairly dry, with slightly browned edges.
