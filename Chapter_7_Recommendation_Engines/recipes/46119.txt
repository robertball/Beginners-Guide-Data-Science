Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1  onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
½ (16 ounce) package broccoli coleslaw mix
1 cup shredded cabbage
¾ cup cooked chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces
salt and pepper to taste
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, undrained
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon ground cumin
4 cloves garlic, minced
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon lemon pepper
salt and pepper to taste
4 (10 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium high heat. Saute onion and 2 cloves crushed garlic until onions are soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the broccoli coleslaw mix, and cook until tender. Add the cabbage and chicken and toss for a minute or two. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.
In a blender, combine garbanzo beans, mayonnaise, mustard, cumin, garlic, onion powder, lemon pepper, salt and pepper. Blend until smooth and creamy.
Heat tortillas for a few seconds in the microwave for easier folding. Spread each tortilla with sauce, then put a large heap of the slaw mixture on top. Wrap like you would a burrito.
