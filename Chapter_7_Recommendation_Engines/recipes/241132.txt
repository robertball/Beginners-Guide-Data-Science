Ingredients:
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
1 (24 ounce) jar garlic and herb pasta sauce
1 (12 ounce) package Hillshire FarmÂ® Smoked Sausage
1 (9 ounce) package refrigerated three-cheese tortellini
1 (6 ounce) package fresh baby spinach, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Stir together chicken stock and pasta sauce in large sauce pan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Add sausage and tortellini; stir. Reduce heat to medium-low.
Simmer until pasta is tender, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent tortellini from sticking to bottom of pot.
Gently stir chopped spinach into soup; stir gently. Continue cooking until spinach wilts, about 3 more minutes. Serve immediately.
