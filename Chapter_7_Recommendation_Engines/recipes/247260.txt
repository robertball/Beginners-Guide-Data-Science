Description: 
A delicious lemon bar with a flaky buttery crust, in style of a shortbread cookie. A tart lemony filling, with the right amount of sweet and tart. I made this recipe up after years and years of trying to find the perfect lemon bar, and believe this to be the best. I hope you enjoy with your favorite cup of tea or coffee!
