Ingredients:
16 butter lettuce leaves (rinsed and pat dried)
1lb ground beef
1 tablespoon oil (for frying)
1 large onion (chopped)
2 garlic cloves (minced)
1 tablespoon soy sauce
Â¼ cup hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
Asian chili pepper sauce (optional, to taste)
1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts (drained and chopped)
1 bunch green onions (chopped)
2 tablespoons dark sesame oil

Directions:
Step 1: Heat a medium skillet to high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add ground beef. Break beef up into very small pieces with a metal spatula and reduce heat to medium. Cook until beef is fully cooked. Drain, remove from pan and allow beef to cool.
Step 2: In the same pan add onions and stir fry for 1 minute. Add garlic, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, vinegar and chili pepper sauce to the onions. Stir to mix well. Stir in water chestnuts, green onions and sesame oil.  Continue cooking for about 2 minutes. Add sauce mixture to ground beef and mix well in a bowl.
Step 3: Pile the meat mixture into the center of each lettuce leaf. Wrap the lettuce around the meat like a burrito.

Description: 
The lettuce gives a nice crunch and the filling is just delicious with all the Asian flavors. The filling gets its flavor from ingredients such as soy sauce, garlic, sesame oil, and hoisin sauce. I used butter lettuce but you could use other types of lettuce as well. There is a little prep work required but this dish only takes about 30 minutes to prepare. Enjoy.
