Ingredients:
1 Tbs. olive oil
1/2 medium onion, sliced into rings
1 medium zucchini, sliced into 1/4" slices
1 medium summer squash, sliced into 1/4" slices
kernels from one ear of corn
1 garlic clove, minced
4 Roma tomatoes, peeled and diced
1 tsp. cumin
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
1/2 lime

Directions:
In a large non-stick skillet, over med. to med-high heat, heat olive oil and add onion, and saute till it begins to be tender.  Add zucchini and summer squash and saute about 3 minutes.  Add corn, and continue to cook for another minute.  Add garlic and tomatoes, stirring and cooking, about 3 minutes.  Add cumin, salt and pepper.  When vegetables are done to your liking (I like mine crunchy), sprinkle on cilantro and stir in until it wilts.  Remove from heat, and squeeze 1/2 of a lime over the dish, right before serving.

This vegetable side dish is a great alternative to beans when the main dish has a South-of-the-border flair!
