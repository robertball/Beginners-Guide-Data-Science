Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup corn flour
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups milk, or as needed
1 cup vegetable oil for frying
2 chilled full-size chocolate-covered, nougat-filled candy bars (such as Snickers®)

Directions:
Mix all-purpose flour, corn flour, and baking soda in a shallow bowl. Stir enough milk into the flour mixture to make a somewhat-thin batter that will stick to the candy bars, but not drip off.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Dip the candy bars in the batter to coat.
Carefully put coated candy bar into hot oil and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
