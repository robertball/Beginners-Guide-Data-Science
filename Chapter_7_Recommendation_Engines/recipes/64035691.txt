Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup espresso
1 cup milk
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 (10 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, 8 whole cherries reserved for the top, drained and slightly chopped or processed
1.5 cups miniature semisweet or dark chocolate chips
coconut pecan icing
chocolate ganache/quick pour fondant
chopped toasted pecan pieces

Directions:
Preheat  oven  to  350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a bundt pan.
In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, soda and salt.
Add eggs, coffee, milk, applesauce and vanilla. Beat until smooth (batter will be thin).
Fold in cherries and chocolate chips. Pour batter into pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 minutes or until toothpick inserted into middle comes out clean. It's best to leave it in the pan, because the chips and the cherries sort of sink to the bottom and solidify and will stick big time! Frost with chocolate ganache or coconut pecan icing, then follow with the quick pour chocolate fondant.  Top immediately with cherries and a sprinkling of toasted pecan pieces.
