Ingredients:
2 small packages of mixed fruit Jello
10 Lipton tea bags
8 cups boiling water
pinch of baking soda
1 cup sugar
2 litre bottle Lipton Lemon ice tea
1 litre bottle Lemon Lime soda
sliced lemons for garnish

Directions:
Pour boiling water over tea bags and the pinch of soda in large pitcher and steep for 15 minutes.
Remove and discard bags.
Add sugar and jello to tea and stir until dissolved
Pour this mixture into either gallon size ziploc bags or use quart size for smaller portions and freeze
Thaw frozen mixture one hour or so before use. If the mixture is still too hard you can defrost in a microwave for a few minutes. Place in a punch bowl and pour the tea and soda over the frozen mixture to taste and to desired consistency. Stir until slushy and garnish with fresh lemons. I serve in a tall glass with a straw and lemon garnish.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe while living in Poland where we do not have ice on hand. The tea stays slushy in a punch bowl for hours or you can freeze small portions in ziploc bags for individual use! Not too sweet and very refreshing.
