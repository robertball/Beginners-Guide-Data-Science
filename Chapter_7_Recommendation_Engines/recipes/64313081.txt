Ingredients:
2 teaspoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
1/2 pounds turkey, cutlets, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips
1/2 teaspoon cumin, ground
1/8 teaspoon pepper, cayenne
1/4 pounds jicama peeled and cut into thin matchsticks
1/2 medium onion(s), sweet, cut into very thin half-rings
salt to taste
1 cup(s) tomato(es), cherry halved
1/4 cup(s) cilantro, fresh chopped

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the turkey and sprinkle with the cumin and cayenne. Cook, stirring, until the spices are fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in the j√≠cama, onion, and salt to taste. Cover and cook for 3 minutes to slightly wilt the onion. Stir in the cherry tomatoes, cover, and cook for 2 minutes longer.
Uncover, stir, and cook for another 2 minutes to concentrate the liquid in the bottom of the pan. Stir in the cilantro and serve hot.
