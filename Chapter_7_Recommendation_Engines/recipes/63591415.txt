Ingredients:
3 large sweet potatoes, cubed
6 cloves garlic
3-4 Tbsp olive oil
salt and pepper, as needed
3/4 cups Greek Yogurt
5 tablespoons coconut oil (Optional)
1 tablespoon fresh chopped rosemary

Directions:
Toss the potatoes and garlic with the oil, salt, and pepper. Spread into an even layer on a baking sheet and roast in a 375 degree oven until tender and caramelized, about 30-45 minutes. Transfer the potatoes and garlic to a large bowl, and use a handheld mixer to whip them with the Greek yogurt until smooth. Melt the coconut oil in a small saucepan, and add the rosemary. Let the coconut oil rest until it is set. Top the warm potatoes with the butter.
