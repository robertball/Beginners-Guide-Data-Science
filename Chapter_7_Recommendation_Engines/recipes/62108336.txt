Directions:
Preheat oven to 325F.
In a bowl, mix graham cracker and butter until thoroughly moist.  Transfer to the bottom of a lightly greased large glass baking dish and press to flatten evenly. Pour condensed milk over top, leaving about a 1/4 inch border all around.
Mix all remaining ingredients together in a bowl and pour over top of condensed milk all the way to edge.
Bake 20-25 minutes.
Remove from oven and allow to cool completely before cutting into 1 ½” squares to serve.
