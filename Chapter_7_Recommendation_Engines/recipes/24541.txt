2 bunches beets
2 tablespoons water
1/4 cup white vinegar
2 tablespoons caraway seeds

2 tablespoons minced onion
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Wash beets and trim off greens.  Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil, add beets and cook, covered, until beets are tender.  Remove from heat, drain, and peel and slice when cool.
In a large bowl, whisk together the water, vinegar, caraway seeds, sugar, onion, horseradish, cloves, salt, pepper and oil.  Add beets and toss to coat.  Let stand for several hours, stirring occasionally.  Serve at room temperature or chilled, as desired.
