Ingredients:
1 daikon radish, peeled and cut into 2-inch sticks
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons sake (Japanese rice wine)
1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)
11 ounces pork fillet, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, thinly sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine daikon radish, soy sauce, sake, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and mirin in a large bowl. Add sliced pork; let marinate for 5 minutes.
Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove pork from marinade and add to the wok; cook and stir until evenly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in remaining marinade; cover and cook until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.

Description: 
If you can't find daikon radishes, use a bunch of small red radishes when in season. I love this stir-fry because you can add any veggies you like, including spring onions, savoy, or Chinese cabbage... whatever you have handy.
