Ingredients:
1 teaspoon bacon drippings
2 corn tortillas
2 slices Manchego cheese
6 zucchini blossoms

Directions:
Melt bacon grease in a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Place tortillas in the skillet. Top each tortilla with 1 slice of Manchego cheese and 3 zucchini blossoms. Fold tortillas in half.
Cook until tortillas are lightly browned and cheese starts to melt, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and cook until the other side is crispy, lightly browned, and the cheese has melted, 1 more minute.
