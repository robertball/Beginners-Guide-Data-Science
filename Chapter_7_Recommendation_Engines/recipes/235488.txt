Ingredients:
1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza crust dough
6 strips turkey bacon or lean deli ham slices
1 cup Contadina® Pizza Sauce or Pizza Squeeze
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (20 ounce) can Del Monte® Pineapple Chunks in 100% Juice, well drained
1/2 cup thinly sliced green or red bell pepper strips
1/4 cup sliced green onion or diced red onion
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Spray a large baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray.  Press dough into a 15x10-inch rectangle, and decoratively pinch the edges, if desired.  Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until edges begin to turn light golden brown.
Meanwhile, cook bacon or deli ham until crisp in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat; crumble and set aside.
Spread pizza sauce evenly over crust.  Sprinkle with cheese and remaining toppings.  Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown.
