Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
2 large sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons canola oil
3 tablespoons diced onion
3 tablespoons diced red bell pepper
1 cup diced smoked ham
2/3 cup crushed pineapple, divided
1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake sweet potatoes in the preheated oven until softened, about 1 hour.
Heat canola oil in a skillet over medium heat; saute onion and red bell pepper until just softened, about 5 minutes. Add ham, 1/2 the pineapple, and chipotle powder; saute over low heat until heated through, about 5 more minutes.
Cut sweet potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out the insides, leaving a thin shell. Blend sweet potatoes in a blender or mash in a bowl with a potato masher. Stir the remaining pineapple, nutmeg, and cinnamon into mashed sweet potatoes.
Return mashed sweet potato mixture to the shells and top each with ham mixture.

Description: 
Hearty enough for an entree or a full-bodied side dish. My own creation trying to blend sweet and savory. Hope you enjoy and let me know all your adaptations for the under-used sweet potato! Lots of variations are possible with this. The chipotle and salty ham were a great kick with the sweetness of the potato and pineapple. No other sugars were needed. Hope you like it!
