Ingredients:
Â½ cup butter
2 pounds venison stew meat
3 cups chopped cabbage
3 large potatoes, cubed
2 (15 ounce) cans peas, drained
2 (15 ounce) cans carrots, drained
2 (15 ounce) cans green beans, drained
2 (15.25 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained
2 (15 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with juice
1 cup butter
1 (64 fluid ounce) bottle tomato juice
1 (32 fluid ounce) container beef broth
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons beef bouillon granules
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 pinch ground cumin
1 pinch ground mustard
1 pinch curry powder
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 pinch dried parsley
1 pinch Italian seasoning
1 pinch garlic powder

Directions:
Melt 1/2 cup of butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Brown the cubed venison in the hot butter, stirring frequently. Add the cabbage, potatoes, peas, carrots, green beans, corn, diced tomatoes, and remaining 1 cup of butter. Pour in the tomato juice and beef broth, then sprinkle in the sugar, beef bouillon granules, salt, black pepper, cumin, mustard, curry powder, cayenne pepper, parsley, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the venison is tender, and the soup slightly thickened, about 1 1/2 hours.
