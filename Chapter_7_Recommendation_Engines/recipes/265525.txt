Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen shelled edamame (green soybeans)
5 tablespoons cashews, or more to taste
3 teaspoons salt, or as needed
1 cup green garlic (garlic scapes), cut into pieces
1 teaspoon coriander
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 small lemon, finely zested and juiced
3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed

Directions:
Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan. Add edamame and cook until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and refrigerate for 10 minutes.
Combine cashews and 1/8 teaspoon salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until blended, scraping sides multiple times until mixture has a firm, dough-like consistency. Add cooked edamame, garlic scapes, coriander, pepper, lemon juice, lemon zest, and 2 teaspoons salt and pulse to desired consistency. Pour olive oil in slowly, with the processor running, until hummus is smooth. Season with more olive oil, salt, and pepper to taste.

Description: 
Glorious garlic-and-edamame-flavored hummus. I think this is my new favorite and a great way to use up garlic scapes from your CSA box.
