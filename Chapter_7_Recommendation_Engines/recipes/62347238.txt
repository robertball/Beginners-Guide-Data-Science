Ingredients:
1 1/2 C uncooked lentils
bouquet garni
10 - 12 oz. smoked salmon
1/2 large red onion
1 T chopped chives
1/4 C olive oil
1 T red wine vinegar
1 t Dijon mustard
salt
pepper

Directions:
Bring the lentils to a boil in twice their volume of water with the bouquet garni. Reduce heat and cook approximately 20 minutes. (The age of the lentils and their water content will make cooking times vary, up to one hour could be necessary.) Lentils should be firm but tender. There should be little excess cooking liquid. Let lentils cool in the pot off of the heat.
Cut the smoked salmon into small pieces (strips, then pi√®ces no longer than 1/2 inch). Reserve in a large bowl.
Mince the onion and use scissors to snip the chives into bowl.
When cool, add lentils.
Whisk olive oil, vinegar, mustard salt and pepper in a small bowl. Add to lentil mixture, stir well. May be served immediately. For best results, refridgerate for 2-3 hours for flavors to blend.
