5 slices bacon, cut into 1/2" pieces
1 medium onion, diced
1 large chicken breast, cut into bite sized pieces (about 1 1/2 cups)

1/2 cup chicken stock
2 tsp coarse grain mustard

Sea salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Cook bacon in large skillet over medium heat until brown and crisp; remove bacon to drain on paper towels.  Drain most of the bacon drippings, if desired.
Add chicken and onion to skillet, and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is nearly cooked through and onion is golden. (about 10 minutes)
Whisk together chicken broth, mustard and honey.  Pour into skillet and add Brussels sprouts and carrots.  Stir, then cover and cook about 5 to 10 minutes until sprouts and carrots are tender-crisp and chicken is cooked through.
Remove cover and stir in bacon.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
