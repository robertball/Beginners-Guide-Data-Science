Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
3/4 cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
3/4 cup cornstarch
2/3 cup lukewarm water
2 tablespoons nonfat dry milk powder
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin powder
1/2 teaspoon agave nectar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line pizza pan with aluminum foil; grease with vegetable oil.
Combine flour, cornstarch, water, dry milk powder, yeast, vinegar, salt, gelatin, and agave nectar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; mix on medium speed until combined and dough is very runny, about 3 minutes.
Spread dough over lined pizza pan with wet fingers.
Bake in the preheated oven until the underside of the crust is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven; flip it on the pizza pan. Remove aluminum foil.

Description: 
After going gluten free, I was craving pizza and couldn't find a crust that tasted good. This one tastes great! It's the result of many experiments. Even my 6-year-old daughter who usually won't touch gluten-free foods, asks me to make it.
