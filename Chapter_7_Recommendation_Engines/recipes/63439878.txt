Ingredients:
1/2 c. butter, softened
1/2 c. shortening
1 c. sugar
1 c. brown sugar, lightly packed
2 eggs
1 tsp. vanilla
1 3/4 c. flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
3 c. rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 F.
Cream shortening, butter and sugars until light and fluffy.
Add in eggs and vanilla, stir until well combined.
In a separate bowl, mix flour, baking soda, and salt. Add dry ingredients to moist ingredients about 1/4 c. at a time, mixing well with each addition.
Add rolled oats to mixture about a cup at a time, mixing gently.
Form 1" balls and place 2" apart on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake 10-12 minutes at 375.
Cool a few minutes on the cookie sheet until the cookies firm up enough to remove with a spatula without breaking apart. Continue cooling on a cooling rack.

Description: 
This recipe is the one my father-in-law has used for years. My husband fondly remembers these cookies as a part of family vacations and hunting trips. When we married, he made a point to make sure I got the recipe from the master himself!
