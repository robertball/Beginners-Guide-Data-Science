3 cups of Chicken or Shrimp Stock

5 cups of Water

Directions:
For Grits:
Bring water with a few tablespoons of salt to a boil. Add 2 tbls of butter, and when melted in the water, add grits stirring when pouring in to prevent clumping. Please lid on the pot and cook for 1 hour or until grits are tender and not "al dente." Add water as necessary. Take off of heat and add Heavy Cream. Let sit for 5 minutes then stir completely. Serve.
For Gravy:
In a cast iron skillet or pot set on medium heat, Melt the remaining butter and add diced ham and onions. Let brown for 2 minutes and add sausage. Cook this for 2 more minutes or until onions are translucent. Remove meat from skillet and set aside for later, leaving as much grease in skillet as possible. Add Flour to the grease and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until rue turns a golden brown color. Add stock the mixture and whisk until smooth. Let this thicken and reduce on low heat, adding in the ham, onion and sausage mixture. Add shrimp and let cook for 2 minutes or until shrimp is almost cooked through.
Pour a few spoonfuls of grits in the bottom of a bowl and spoon the gravy mixture on top. Enjoy.
