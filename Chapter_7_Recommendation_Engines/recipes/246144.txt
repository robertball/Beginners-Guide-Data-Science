Ingredients:
4 shallots, peeled and halved
1 large onion, quartered, divided
1 (2 inch) piece ginger, peeled and thinly sliced across the grain
5 cloves garlic, peeled
3 tablespoons canola oil
6 whole cloves (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 pounds meaty oxtail pieces, at room temperature
2 large carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces
3 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces
water to cover
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 waxy potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
3 large carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons fish sauce
3 ripe roma tomatoes, sliced horizontally into 1/2-inch wedges
1 (2.8 ounce) can French-fried onions

Directions:
Combine shallots, 2 onion quarters, ginger, and garlic in a food processor; pulse into a paste.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add shallot paste and fry until fragrant and slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add oxtails; stir until completely covered with spices and paste and browned, about 5 minutes.
Stir remaining onion quarters, 2 carrots, and celery into the pot. Pour in enough water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until oxtail is tender, about 5 hours.
Stir salt, black pepper, potatoes, and 3 carrots into the pot. Increase heat and simmer soup until potatoes and carrots are tender, about 15 minutes. Add sugar and fish sauce; stir well to combine.
Ladle soup into large serving bowls and top with tomato wedges and French-fried onions.

Description: 
This is my version of Indonesian Sop Buntot, which is a deeply comforting oxtail and vegetable soup. Rich in collagen and filled with complex flavors, I always serve this with steamed rice and extra sliced tomatoes, fish sauce, shallot flakes (or French-fried onions), and lime wedges on the side.
