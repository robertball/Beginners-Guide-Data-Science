Ingredients:
2 pounds scrubbed Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 (900 ml) carton CAMPBELL’S® 30% Less Sodium Ready to Use Chicken Broth
3 green onions, finely chopped, light and dark green parts divided
1/2 tablespoon salt
1 1/2 pounds lean ground chicken
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 cups sliced mushrooms
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups frozen peas and carrots
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Cook potatoes in saucepan of boiling water for 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain and mash with 2/3 cup (165 mL) of the broth, green parts of onions, and salt. Keep warm.
While the potatoes boil, cook chicken in ovenproof skillet over high heat, breaking up with spoon until no longer pink, about 6 minutes.
Add butter, mushrooms, light parts of onions, minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and poultry seasoning to skillet; cook, stirring for 5 minutes, or until tender. Sprinkle in flour; cook for 1 minute.
Gradually stir remaining broth into pan; stir in peas and carrots. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, or until thickened.
Preheat broiler.
Spoon potatoes over chicken mixture; sprinkle with cheese. Broil until cheese is melted, about 4 minutes.
