Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
6 pork chops
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup sour cream
salt and pepper to taste
1 (20 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups French-fried onions, divided

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add pork chops and saute until browned. Remove from skillet and drain on paper toweling.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl mix together soup, milk, sour cream and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in potatoes, 1/2 cup cheese and 1/2 cup onions. Mix together and spread mixture in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange pork chops over potato mixture.
Cover dish and bake in the preheated oven for about 40 minutes, or until internal temperature of pork has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove cover; top with remaining cheese and onions and bake uncovered for 5 more minutes.

Description: 
Chops browned, then baked with hashbrowns, onion rings and Cheddar cheese in a sour cream sauce. Very tasty and easy. I've even made it an 'all-in-one' dinner by adding a can of drained green beans to the potato mixture before pouring it into the baking dish. Hooray for spuds 'n' chops!
