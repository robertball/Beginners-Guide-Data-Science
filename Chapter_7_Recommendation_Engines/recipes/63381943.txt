Ingredients:
1 1/2 Cup Chillula hot sauce
1 Cup butter
1 Tsp garlic
1 Tsp fresh ground black pepper
1 Tsp cayenne pepper (+/- depending on how hot you like them)
3 lbs chicken wings, whole or drumetes (I use fresh, but, you can substitute frozen thawed)
1 1/2 cup flour
1 Tblspn paprika
1 1/2 Tsp cayenne pepper
1 Tsp black pepper
1 Tsp garlic
Enough oil to cover the wings in a large dutch oven

Directions:
Mix flour, paprika, 1 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp black pepper and 1 tsp garlic in a large bowl, rinse and dry the wings.  Place the wings in the flour mixture and make sure to toss them and cover them evenly.  Leave in the bowl and place in the refrig. for 2-2 1/2 hours.  In a large dutch oven, place enough oil to cover the wings, you may have to cook them in two batches.  Heat the oil to about 375 degrees, fry the wings until golden brown, turning over once or twice, about 18-20 minutes total time.
In a sauce pan, on low heat, mix the butter, hot sauce, garlic, pepper and cayenne pepper.  Heat until well blended, taste for hotness, and, add additional cayenne if you so choose.
Place the wings in a large serving platter or bowl, making sure to cover all sides equally with the hot sauce.  Serve with Ranch dressing or that other stuff if you choose!!
