Description: 
This tastes remarkably similar to the maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal varieties you buy in little packets.  Save money by making your own! For each batch of oatmeal, combine 2/3 cup quick-cooking oats with 1 to 2 tablespoons of mix; add boiling water until desired consistency is reached.
