Ingredients:
1 T cocoa powder
1 tsp raw sugar
1/4 tsp cinnamon
pinch of ginger
1/3 cup powdered milk
1 cup boiling water
2 tsp chocolate wine any flavor

Directions:
Mix all the dry ingredients together in a heat resistant bowl you can easily pour from.  I use my Anchor 2 C measuring cup.  Heat the cup of water by your preferred method and then slowly add to the dry ingredients.  Whisk the contents together and add the 2 tsp of chocolate wine.  Pour into your favorite mug and enjoy!
