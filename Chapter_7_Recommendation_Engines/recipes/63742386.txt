Ingredients:
3/4 C Cocoa
1 C Sugar
1 C Heavy Cream
1 Tsp Vanilla
1/2 Tsp Salt
1 T Butter

Directions:
Begin heating a double boiler. Add all ingredients, then stir with a whisk (preferable) until done. A rubber or wooden spoon also work, but with a bit more effort.
The sauce is done when all ingredients are mixed and it appears shinny.
Serve immediately, or refrigerate, then gently rewarm (possibly in the double boiler, or place the storage container in a hot water bath) for later.
You can rewarm the sauce in a microwave, but heat for short periods (say 30 seconds), then stir and repeat until done.
