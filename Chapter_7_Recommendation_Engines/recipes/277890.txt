Ingredients:
1/4 stick butter
1 small onion, finely diced
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (5 ounce) cans albacore tuna packed in water, drained
1/2 cup mayonnaise
3 English muffins, split
1 large vine-ripened tomato, cut into 6 slices
6 slices American cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Melt butter in a small frying pan over low heat. Add onion and garlic and saute over low heat until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in seafood seasoning, cilantro, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat.
Combine tuna and mayonnaise in a bowl. Add the sauteed mixture from the frying pan and blend well with a fork.
Place all 6 halved English muffins on a cookie sheet. Spoon on tuna mixture, dividing it evenly between each muffin. Top each with a slice of tomato; add a slice of American cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
