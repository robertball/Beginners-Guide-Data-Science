Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole milk
1 1/2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin
1 1/2 pints strawberries, halved
2 tablespoons SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pint strawberries, sliced

Directions:
Sprinkle gelatin over milk in a small saucepan; let stand 1 minute. Cook over low heat, stirring until gelatin dissolves (do not boil). Set aside to cool.
Process 1 1/2 pints strawberries in a food processor, or until pureed, stopping to scrape down sides. Press strawberries through a fine wire-mesh strainer into a bowl, discarding solids. Stir cooled milk mixture into strawberry puree. Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and vanilla, stirring until SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener dissolves.
Coat 4 (6-ounce) ramekins with cooking spray. Divide strawberry mixture evenly among ramekins. Cover each ramekin with plastic wrap; refrigerate 4 hours or overnight until panna cottas are set.
Run a knife around the edge of each panna cotta and unmold onto serving plates. Serve with sliced strawberries.
