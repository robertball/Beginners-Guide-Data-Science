Ingredients:
~2 lbs ground beef
4 15oz cans of tomato sauce
1 10 1/2oz can of condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup diced bell pepper
1/2 cup diced onion
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp minced garlic
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tbsp onion powder
2 tsp white sugar
1/4 tsp ground oregano
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Pour olive oil in a 4-quart saucepan, add minced garlic, onions, and peppers.
Sautee on medium-high until onions are slightly caramelized.
Add ground beef and reduce heat to medium-low. Stir occasionally and cook until meat is browned. Cooking at a lower heat for a shorter amount of time creates more tender meat.
Stir in 1 can mushroom soup into the meat mixture mix well.
Add tomato sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, and sugar. Stir well.
Simmer on medium low until heated through. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Serve over your favorite pasta and enjoy!
