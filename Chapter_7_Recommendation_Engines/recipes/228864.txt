Ingredients:
1/2 pound bulk spicy pork sausage
1/2 pound ground beef
1 onion, diced
1 (2 pound) loaf processed cheese food (such as Velveeta®), cubed
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble sausage and ground beef into the skillet; add the onion. Cook and stir the beef mixture until the meat is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Pour into a slow cooker.
Layer cheese food cubes atop meat mixture.
Blend diced tomatoes with green chile peppers in a blender until smooth; pour over the cheese cubes along with the cream of mushroom soup. Stir the mixture.
Cook on High, stirring occasionally until the cheese is completely melted, about 90 minutes.

Description: 
This dip has all the best ingredients I've found from various other recipes and it's my favorite by far! Serve as a dip at a party or with sour cream and jalapenos to make nachos and use it as a main course!
