Ingredients:
6 cups peeled, sliced fresh peaches
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons gluten-free all purpose baking flour (such as Pillsbury™)
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest
Topping:
1 cup gluten-free all purpose baking flour (such as Pillsbury™)
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup melted coconut butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a shallow 11x7-inch baking dish.
Place sliced peaches in the prepared baking dish. Mix together brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a small bowl; sprinkle over peaches.
Mix together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in a medium bowl for the topping. Stir in egg until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; sprinkle topping over peaches. Drizzle melted coconut butter evenly over topping.
Bake in the preheated oven until peach juices are bubbling and topping is golden brown, about 38 minutes.
