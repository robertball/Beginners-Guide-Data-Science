Ingredients:
1 boneless pork loin, about 5 to 6 pounds
4 to 6 slices bacon
Rub Mixture:
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Glaze:
1 cup light brown sugar, packed
2 tablespoons flour
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°.
Place pork loin in a roasting pan. Combine the rub ingredients and rub over the pork. Cut each strip of bacon in half crosswise and lay them over the pork loin. Roast for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the pork registers about 130°.
In the meantime, combine the brown sugar, flour, cider vinegar, and dry mustard in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer and simmer for about 1 minute. Spoon over the pork and return to the oven. Roast for about 15 to 20 minutes longer, or until pork registers 140°.
Serves 6 to 8.
