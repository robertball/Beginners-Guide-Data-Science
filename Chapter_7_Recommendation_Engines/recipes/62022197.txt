Ingredients:
2 box pineapple cake mix
1 cream cheese, softened
1 box vanilla instand pudding
1 can crushed pineapple - drained
1 cool whip

Directions:
Mix and bake cake as on the package.  Cool completely.  Follow directions on pudding package, mix in cream cheese.  After cake has cooled add the cream cheese mixture on top, spread crushed pineapple on top of that add the other layer of cake and then spread with cool whip.
I use 2 boxes of cake mix and divide it evenly between 2 8 x 10 baking pans. If you want to make a round cake you only need 1 box of cake mix and divide it evenly between 2 round cake pans.
