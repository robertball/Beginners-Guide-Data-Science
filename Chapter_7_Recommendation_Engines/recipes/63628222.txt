Ingredients:
6 chicken breast (thawed and cut into 1 inch cubes)
1 tsp Black pepper
2 tsp Seasoned salt (I use Johnny's)
1 large sweet onion
1 pkg frozen chopped spinach (thawed)
6 cups shredded cheese (either just cheddar or Mexican blend)
4 tbs butter
1/2 cup flour
2, 14.5 oz cans of Chicken broth
3, 4 oz cans of green chilies
2 tsp cumin
1 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp honey
12 corn tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
1. In a skillet cook the cut up chicken in a couple tablespoons of olive oil until done.
2. Spread the chicken to the edges of the skillet and add the chopped onion, cook until translucent.
3. Place the chicken and onion in a large bowl to cool. Add thawed chopped spinach.
4. While the chicken is cooling make up the green chili sauce.
5. In a skillet melt the butter. Once the butter is melted add the flour and stir continuously until browned.
6. Slowly, while whisking, add the chicken broth. Keep stirring until blended and slightly thickened.
7. In a blender/food processor add the green chilies, cumin, salt, black pepper, honey, and chicken gravy. Blend well.
8. Shred the chicken well.
9. In a 9x13 pan spread a thin layer of the sauce on the bottom of the pan.
10. Cut 4 corn tortillas in half. Arrange the half tortillas with flat side against the wall of the pan.
11. Layer 1/3 of the chicken mixture over the tortillas, 2 cups of shredded cheese and 1/4 of the sauce. Repeat ending with tortillas, sauce and cheese.
12. Bake for 30 minutes. You may want to place a cookie sheet under the pan to catch any drips.
