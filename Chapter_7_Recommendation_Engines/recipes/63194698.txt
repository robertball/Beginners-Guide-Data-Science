Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups pre-cooked white rice
3 tablespoons sesame oil
2 small onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
2 1/2 cup chopped cooked chicken breast (or other meat/s)if desired
2 stalks celery, chopped (optional)
1 1/2 cups tiny carrots
1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1/2 cup frozen green peas
1-2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup Low sodium soy sauce
1 can water chestnuts
1 can beansprouts or 1/2 cup fresh.

Directions:
Cook rice according to package directions and allow to completely cool (even made the day before is great).
Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.  Pour in sesame oil and stir in onion. Fry until golden, then add garlic.  When garlic is lightly browned, mix in fully cooked meat if desired.
Lower heat to medium and stir in celery (optional), carrot, green pepper, and peas.  Fry until vegetables are crisp-tender.   Add rice to heat up.
Push mixture around outside of wok/skillet and pour beaten eggs into the center of wok and cook just until egg is scrambled firm.
Stir in soy sauce.   Adjust seasoning to your preference.  Add water chestnuts and beansprouts. Toss everything together  just long enough for water chestnuts and beansprouts heat (a minute or so) and serve immediately.  Serving suggestion:  Frozen eggrolls (prepared according to mfg directions), Lemon Sherbet and/or a fortune cookie.
