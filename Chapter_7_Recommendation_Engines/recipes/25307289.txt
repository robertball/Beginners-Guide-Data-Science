Ingredients:
1 cup fine dry breadcrumbs
3/4 cup dry white wine
2.5 pounds lean ground beef (or equal mixture of beef, pork and veal)
4 ox. prosciutto, cut to a 1/4 inch dice
1 cup tomato sauce, divided
2 large eggs
1 medium onion, cut to a 1/4 inch dice
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 Tbl. dried oregano
1 Tbl. dried basil
2 tsp. dried thyme
Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and wine and let soak until soft, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl combine the beef, prosciutto, half the tomato sauce, eggs, onion, garlic, oregano, basil , thyme, salt and pepper.  Add the breadcrumbs and any wine in the bowl, then use your hands or a wooden spoon to mix well.
Transfer the mixture to a roasting pan and shape it into a loaf.  Or, transfer the mixture to an ovenproof glass or ceramic loaf pan.  Top the meatloaf with the remaining tomato sauce and bake until browned and a metal skewer inserted into the center comes out hot, about 1 to 1.5 hours.
Transfer the meatloaf to a platter and let it rest for 5 minutes before cutting into thick slices.
