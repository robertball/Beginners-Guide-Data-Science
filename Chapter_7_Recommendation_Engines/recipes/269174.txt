Ingredients:
4 1/2 tablespoons butter, divided
1 (1 pound) loaf day-old sourdough bread
4 leeks, chopped, or more to taste
5 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 pound portobello mushrooms, chopped
1 pound cremini mushrooms, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 cups heavy cream
8 eggs
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese
1 teaspoon dried thyme, or to taste
1 teaspoon dried parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Grease 2 baking dishes with 1/2 tablespoon butter. Cut sourdough loaf into 1-inch cubes and divide cubes between the dishes.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook leeks in the melted butter until they begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining butter, mushrooms, salt, and pepper; cook until mushrooms have softened, about 10 minutes.
Spoon mushroom mixture over the bread. Mix cream, eggs, 2/3 of the cheeses, thyme, and parsley together in a large bowl. Pour over the bread and mushrooms. Cover and let stand for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Uncover puddings and sprinkle remaining cheeses on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops begin to brown, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
This savory bread pudding was inspired by a lunch I had at a food cart in Portland long ago.

 It works well as a vegetarian main dish or as a substantial side dish.
