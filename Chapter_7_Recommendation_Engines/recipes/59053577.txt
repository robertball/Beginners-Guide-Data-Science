Ingredients:
1 cup margarine
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine, brown sugar, white sugar.  Add eggs one at a time, and vanilla, mix until smooth. Combine the flour, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, and salt; stir into the sugar mixture. Stir in the oats and raisins. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes until light and golden. Do not overbake. Let them cool for 2 minutes before removing from cookie sheets to cool completely. Store in airtight container. Make sure you get some, because they don't last long!

Description: 
I substituted margarine for all of the butter and shortening in this recipe and gave these cookies a stronger spice flavor by using pumpkin pie spice.  If you don' have any raisins on hand any dried fruit or nut you may have laying around makes a perfect substitution.Modified from: Beth's Spicy Oatmeal Raisin Cookies
