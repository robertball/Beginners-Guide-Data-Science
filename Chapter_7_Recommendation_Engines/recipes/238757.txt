Ingredients:
1 Reynolds® Oven Bag, large size
Reynolds® Parchment Paper
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 (1 pound) eggplant, quartered and sliced 1/4 inch thick
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
4 whole wheat Italian-style rolls, split
4 ounces reduced-fat feta cheese, crumbled
2 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese
1/2 cup sliced roasted red pepper
1 cup baby romaine lettuce or mixed greens

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Do not exceed 400 degrees F. Add flour to a Reynolds(R) Large Oven Bag. Shake.  Place bag in a roasting pan at least 2 inches deep.
Drizzle eggplant with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Place eggplant and red onion in bag. Close bag with tie (found inside package). Cut six 1/2 -inch slits in top of bag to allow steam to escape. Tuck ends of bag in pan.
Place pan in oven, allowing room for bag to expand during cooking without touching heating elements, wall, or racks. Bag should not hang over pan.
Roast about 20 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
Line a baking sheet with Reynolds(R) Parchment Paper. Place rolls on the prepared baking sheet with cut sides up. In a small bowl, mix feta and cream cheese together. Spread cheese mixture on cut sides of roll tops. Bake in the oven for the last 5 minutes of roasting.
Remove rolls and eggplant from oven. To serve, carefully cut open top of oven bag. Remember: Always support bag with pan. Place eggplant and onion on roll bottoms. Top with red peppers and romaine. Close sandwiches with the cheese-topped halves.
