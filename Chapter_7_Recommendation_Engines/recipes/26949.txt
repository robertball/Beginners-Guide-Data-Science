Ingredients:
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced
2 banana peppers, seeded and diced
1 Anaheim pepper, seeded and diced
6 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
1/4 onion, diced
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables
1/4 cup water
1 cube vegetable broth
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce
1 (8 ounce) can refrigerated crescent roll dough

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, cook and stir jalapeno peppers, banana peppers, Anaheim pepper, garlic and onion in oil until soft, about 3 minutes.
Mix in the frozen mixed vegetables, water, vegetable broth, lemon juice and hot pepper sauce. Raise heat to high and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until thick and darkened, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Separate crescent roll dough into triangles, and arrange on a large baking sheet. Place a generous amount of the vegetable mixture on each triangle. Roll triangles around the mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven 20 minutes, or until lightly browned.

Description: 
Delightfully spicy finger food. It's a great appetizer for parties. I actually won a chili pepper cooking contest with this. A food processor is useful for chopping the peppers, onion and garlic. For the frozen mixed vegetables, I prefer a bag containing corn, beans and red peppers. Bon appetit!
