Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup of wheat germ
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 Tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 tablespoon active dry yeast

Directions:
Mix the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, wheat germ, aAnd salt. Then add honey and olive oil and mix together. Add water to bread maker, and then pour flour mixture on top. Make a small indent in the flour and then place yeast in indent. Set bread machine on dough. Tip dough out onto a floured and form into a ball. Place dough in an oiled bowl, and turn to coat the surface. ( alternatively you can place the dough back into the warm bread maker to rise.) Cover loosely with a towel, and let stand in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45minutes.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Split the dough in half and with a rolling pin roll until it will not stretch any further. Then, drape it over both of your fists, and gently pull the edges outward, while rotating the crust. When the circle has reached the desired size, place on a well oiled pizza pan. Top pizza with your favorite toppings, such as sauce, cheese, meats, or vegetables.
Bake for 16 to 20 minutes (depending on thickness) in the preheated oven, until the crust is crisp and golden at the edges, and cheese is melted on the top.
