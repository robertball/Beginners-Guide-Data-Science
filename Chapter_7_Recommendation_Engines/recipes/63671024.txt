Ingredients:
1 salmon fillet with skin (1 lb)
1 lb fresh mushrooms, sliced
1/2 lb fresh spinach
2 medium firm tomatoes
Dressing:
2 Tbs apple cider vinegar
2-3 Tbs soy sauce
1 Tbs sesame oil (optional) plus extra virgin olive oil to make 1/2 cup
2 tsp sesame seeds, toasted*
2 cloves garlic
1/4 tsp ginger

Directions:
Heat grill to medium heat.
Whisk apple cider vinegar, olive oil, optional sesame oil and soy sauce.
Whiz the garlic and toasted sesame seeds in a mini-food processor until garlic is in small pieces. Set aside for later.
Cut fillet into 4 pieces; place each piece, skin side down, on a piece of heavy duty foil sprayed with cooking oil.  Spoon vegetables over fish.
Bring up foil sides. Double fold top and ends to seal each packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside.
Grill 8 to 10 min. or until fish flakes easily with fork and vegetables are crisp-tender. Cut slits in foil to release steam before opening packets. Drizzle with dressing.
