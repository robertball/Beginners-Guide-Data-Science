Ingredients:
6 ounces chevre (soft goat cheese)
2 tablespoons skim milk
1 tablespoon honey
4 fresh peaches, halved and pitted
8 mint leaves

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Combine chevre cheese, milk, and honey in a small bowl.
Grill the peaches cut sides down until peaches begin to caramelize and show grill marks, 5 to 7 minutes. Fill each peach half with 1 tablespoon of the cheese mixture. Garnish with a mint leaf, and serve warm.

Description: 
The sweetness of the warmed peach goes so well with the creaminess of the goat cheese with a hint of honey. It's like getting cheesecake in a peach crust.
