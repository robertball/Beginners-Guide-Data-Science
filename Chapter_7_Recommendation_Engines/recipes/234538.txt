Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2  eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch pieces
Â¼ cup hot sauce
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 teaspoon butter

Directions:
Whisk flour, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs together in a separate bowl. Dip chicken pieces in the egg; transfer chicken to flour mixture and coat completely.
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat.
Fry coated chicken pieces in the hot oil, working in batches, until no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side; drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
Combine hot sauce, garlic, and butter in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave until butter is melted and sauce is warm, about 1 minute. Serve hot sauce mixture as a dipping sauce or pour over buffalo chicken bites.

Description: 
This is always in demand at any football get together. You can make the bites and use any type of sauce you want. Me personally, I like to take a quarter cup of Sweet Baby <sup>&reg;</sup>ay's(<sup>&reg;</sup>) barbecue sauce and a quarter cup of Franks <sup>&reg;</sup>ed Hot(<sup>&reg;</sup>) sauce and mix it together.
