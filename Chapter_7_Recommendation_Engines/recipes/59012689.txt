Ingredients:
1/2 cup fresh blueberries
1 5/8 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup quick cooking oats
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup mashed bananas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a medium bowl, dredge blueberries in 2 tablespoons flour.  Gently stir blueberries together with oats, nuts, 1  1/2 cups flour, soda, and salt.
In a large bowl, cream shortening.  Gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in mashed banana.  Add blueberry mixture to creamed mixture, and stir just until moistened.  Spoon batter into the prepared pan.
Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the center of the loaf.  Cool in pan for 10 minutes.  Remove from pan, and cool completely on a wire rack.
ery moist! I used the applesauce in place of the shortening and decreased the sugar as suggested previously. I also used 1 cup frozen blueberries. I omitted the nuts and added some more oatmeal. My husband and I really like it especially since it is so healthy and delicious at the same time.

Description: 
This is so good and reminds me of a real moist kind of a sweet quick bread.  Everybody asks for the recipe: this bread is moist, and easy to make too.  Note: If you are using frozen blueberries, you can thaw them in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  However, you need to increase the amount of blueberries to 3/4 cup.Modified from: Favorite Banana Blueberry Quick Bread
