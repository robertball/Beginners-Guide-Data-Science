Ingredients:
1/2 (12 ounce) package milk chocolate candy wafers, divided
1/2 (12 ounce) package dark chocolate candy wafers, divided
1 (12 ounce) bag square-shaped pretzels, divided, or as needed
1/2 (16 ounce) jar peanut butter, divided
1/2 cup roasted slivered almonds, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Combine 1/4 of the milk chocolate wafers and 1/4 of the dark chocolate wafers in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl. Melt chocolate in a microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, until chocolate is completely melted and creamy, 1 to 3 minutes.
Crumble enough pretzels into melted chocolate until mixture is lumpy but not thick. Spread chocolate mixture into the bottom of a baking dish. Refrigerate or freeze until firm, 10 to 15 minutes.
Place peanut butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Soften peanut butter in microwave until easily spreadable, 30 to 60 seconds. Spread peanut butter over hardened chocolate layer. Refrigerate or freeze until firm, 10 to 15 minutes.
Combine remaining milk chocolate and dark chocolate wafers in the same microwave-safe bowl. Melt chocolate in a microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, until chocolate is completely melted and creamy, 1 to 3 minutes.
Crumble enough pretzels into melted chocolate until mixture is lumpy but not thick. Spread chocolate mixture over peanut butter layer and top with almonds. Refrigerate or freeze until firm. Break bark into pieces.

Description: 
If you like chocolate, peanut butter, and pretzels, you can't go wrong with this bark; it has just the right amount of salty and sweet. This is my own creation, a modification of a mini-pretzel and peanut butter sandwich dipped in chocolate, created by my daughter. I hope you enjoy! This makes a great gift in holiday bags for Christmas and Easter.
