Ingredients:
cooking spray
2/3 cup almond milk
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup vegan margarine (such as Earth BalanceÂ®), softened
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
6 cups fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch square baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.
Combine almond milk and vinegar in a small bowl. Set aside for 5 minutes.
Beat margarine and 2 tablespoons white sugar together using an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Add flour and baking powder and combine using a fork or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in milk mixture and vanilla extract until just combined. Set biscuit batter aside.
Combine peaches, brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon in a bowl until peaches are coated. Place peaches into the bottom of the prepared pan. Top and cover with biscuit batter mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops of the biscuits are lightly browned, 40 to 45 minutes. Serve warm.
