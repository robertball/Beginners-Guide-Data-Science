Ingredients:
MARINADE-
1/3 cup olive oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 clove garlic (minced)
1/2 tsp lemon peel
1/2 tsp oregano
CHICKEN MIXTURE-
1 lb boneless chicken breasts (diced or strips)
1 tbs olive oil
1 red pepper (diced)
1 yellow squash (shredded)
1 cup black olives (sliced)
1/2 cup chicken broth
2 tsp. corn starch
1 tsp. salt
1 lb spaghetti noodles

Directions:
Cook marinade until just bubbly then remove and cool.  Marinade diced or strips of chicken for 1-2 hours. (Marinade is suggested for better flavor, but not necessary.  When in a hurry, I have made this many times cutting the amount of olive oil in half and browning chicken in the marinade.)
Brown chicken in skillet.  Add red peppers, yellow squash, and black olives.  In small bowl blend chicken broth, cornstarch, and salt.  Add to chicken skillet and stir until thickened.  Serve over 1 lb of spaghetti noodles.
