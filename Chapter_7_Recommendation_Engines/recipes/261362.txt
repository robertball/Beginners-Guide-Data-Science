Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 cup long-grain rice, rinsed and drained
1 onion, diced
1 dried pasilla chile pepper, chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon chicken soup base (such as Better than BouillonÂ®)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir rice in the hot oil until toasted, 6 to 7 minutes. Add onion; cook, stirring often, until soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in pasilla chile and cumin; toast for 2 minutes. Add water, chicken soup base, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil. Stir one last time, cover, and cook for 7 minutes on medium heat. Reduce heat to low and cook for 7 minutes more.
Remove saucepan from heat and let rice sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork.

Description: 
For years I have had the trouble of my rice coming out too wet and soft and all stuck together. By reducing the ratio of water to rice from 2:1 to 1.5:1 and reducing the cooking time from 20 minutes to 15 minutes, as well as rinsing the starch off the rice and toasting it, I've found a consistency I really enjoy. Don't be surprised if the bottom burns a little; I like to scrape up the crunchy bits at the bottom into the rice for some texture, but this is optional.
