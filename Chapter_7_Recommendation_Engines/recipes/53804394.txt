Ingredients:
3 large ripe tomatoes, chopped
2 cucumbers, peeled and chopped
1 small red onion, chopped
1/4 cup olive oil
4 teaspoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup crumbled feta cheese
6 black Greek olives, pitted and sliced

Directions:
In shallow salad bowl, or on serving platter, combine tomatoes, cucumber, and onion. Sprinkle with oil,  lemon juice, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle feta cheese and olives over salad. Serve.
This was really great with a few minor tweaks. I looked over other greek salad recipes on this site and came up with the best dressing. Instead of 4 tsp. of lemon juice, add 3 and 1 tsp of red wine vinegar. For the salt and pepper, add 1/4 tsp of each. Also, add half a green pepper chopped and it comes out amazing!
