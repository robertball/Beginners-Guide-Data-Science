Ingredients:
1/4 cup pine nuts
1 cup quinoa
2 cups water
sea salt to taste
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 stalks celery, chopped
1/4 red onion, chopped
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped

Directions:
Toast the pine nuts briefly in a dry skillet over medium heat. This will take about 5 minutes, and stir constantly as they will burn easily. Set aside to cool.
In a saucepan, combine the quinoa, water and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Cool slightly, then fluff with a fork.
Transfer the quinoa to a serving bowl and stir in the pine nuts, lemon juice, celery, onion, cayenne pepper, cumin and parsley. Adjust salt and pepper if needed before serving.
