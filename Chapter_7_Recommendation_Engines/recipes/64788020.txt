Description: 
YES FINALLY a HOUM THAT IS FOOL PROOF! This is an emulsified garlic spread. It is delicious and flavorful.  Serve this with Kafta, Kabobs, Pita- we love this!!  Don’t use olive oil.

There will be a little hole to drizzle oil for emulsions. It’s fool proof!  The recipe calls for 2 heads of garlic. Depending on the size of your garlic cloves you’ll be looking for 15-25- enough to cover the bottom of your processor.  You may not need 2 fu
