Ingredients:
3 cups chopped pepperoni
1 pound extra lean ground beef
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
3/4 cup cracker crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 eggs
3 tablespoons dried minced onion
2 tablespoons French-fried onions
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
1/4 cup sliced pepperoni, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine chopped pepperoni, ground beef, tomato sauce, cracker crumbs, Parmesan cheese, eggs, minced onion, French-fried onions, garlic powder, oregano, and tarragon in a large bowl; form into a loaf in a loaf pan.
Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Place a layer of sliced pepperoni on the top of meatloaf and bake for 5 minutes more.

Description: 
This is a kid-friendly spin on the old-fashioned meatloaf mom used to make. The addition of pepperoni adds flavor and excitement. I use extra lean beef to account for the added fat of the pepperoni. If desired, top with tomato sauce or pizza sauce and extra Parmesan.
