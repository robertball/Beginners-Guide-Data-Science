Ingredients:
8 oz. Meifun or rice noodles
Vegetable Oil (about 3 tablespoons, added a little at a time)
4 cloves of garlic minced
1 medium onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 large boneless skinless chicken breast cut into small bite-sized pieces
garlic powder
onion powder
fresh-ground black pepper
soy sauce (about 1/4-1/3 cup)
teriyaki sauce (less than soy sauces about 1/8 cup to 1/ cup)
white cooking wine (about 1/2 cup, maybe a little less)
6 oz. baby sweet corn (chinese baby corn)
3 stalks of green onion, diced

Directions:
After cutting chicken, sprinkle with black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.
Soak the noodles in hot water as per package directions.
Heat half of oil in wok over medium-high heat, adding more during the process as needed.  Add minced garlic, stirring constantly for 1 minute.  Add onion and green pepper.  Continue stirring.  When veggies are soft, add chicken.
When chicken no longer pink, add soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and white wine while stirring.  Simmer for about 3 minutes.  Add baby corn and green onions.
After noodles are soft, drain, cut in half with scissors, and add to wok.  Mix well to evenly distribute sauce.  Stir fry about 2 minutes.
Serve immediately (but its also good leftover).

I've been experimenting with my new wok and think this meal came out pretty good and is relatively easy.  Sorry for not providing exact measurements, I just eyeballed everything, adding a dash of this and a little of that...
