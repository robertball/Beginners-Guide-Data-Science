Grilled Zucchini and Mushrooms Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 medium zucchini (I use ones that are about 2 1/2" diameter, about 8-10" long)
8 oz. baby bella mushrooms, cleaned and halved
1 Tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp Italian Truffle-infused Sea Salt
3/4 tsp dried Greek Oregano*
3/4 tsp dried marjoram*
1 clove minced garlic
1 tsp balsamic vinegar*
*Sub 1 tsp Herbes de Provence for oregano and marjoram, and squeeze of lemon juice for the balsamic
2 Tbsp feta, goat cheese or fresh parmesan

Directions:
Slice ends off zucchini, then slice lengthwise into slices about 1/3" thick (you know, between 1/4" and 1/2"!)  I also tend to cut them in half for easy handling.
Add zucchini, mushrooms and garlic to a bowl and drizzle with olive oil.  Season with salt, pepper and your herbs of choice.  Let sit for a few minutes while you preheat your grill or grill pan over medium to medium-high heat.
Grill about 4 minutes for each side of zucchini, stirring mushrooms around a bit to cook evenly.
Remove to serving dish and sprinkle with either the balsamic or lemon juice.
Sprinkle with your choice of cheese.

Description: 
This is one dish I actually prefer to use a stove-top grill pan for, but I also do this on the grill, placing the mushrooms on a sheet of foil (grill basket would be nice, if I had one!)  I actually have two different versions - one with Greek herbs and balsamic vinegar, and one with herbes de Provence and a squeeze of lemon juice.
