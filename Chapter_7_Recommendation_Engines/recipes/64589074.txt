Description: 
My husband was in India a few months back and our friends sent him home with a suitcase full of spices.  I decided to make a dish with some of my favorite ingredients chickpeas and peas.  Traditionally this dish is not prepared with green peas but I love them so they were added and I loved every bite!  

I have to admit that these spices are not used often in my kitchen and the combination was a little hot  spicy hot for me but I still enjoyed it very much.  I will defiantly make it again.

I also made a batch of my Paleo Naan Bread to dip in the sauce and what a super yummy dish!
