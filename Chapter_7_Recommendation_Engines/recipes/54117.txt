Description: 
A very easy idea with a minimum of fuss or muss for any number of people.  Individual Baked Eggs surrounded by a strip of bacon, and topped with a square of cheese. These eggs take on a very pleasing flavor just by baking instead of cooking them in the more conventional manner. Great not having splatters all over, and being able to do 12 or more eggs at one time.
