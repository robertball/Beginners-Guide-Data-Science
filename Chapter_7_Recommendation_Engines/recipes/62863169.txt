Preheat oven to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
If you're using the frozen veggies - microwave them.
In a large bowl, combine chicken, soups, and vegetables. Mix well and pour into crust. Cover with the other pie shell (this always takes more skill than i have!) Seal edges and cut steam vents in top.
