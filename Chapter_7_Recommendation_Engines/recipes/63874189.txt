Ingredients:
1	pork butt 5 to 8 pounds, bone in or out fat cap trimmed to 1/8 inch thick
3	tablespoons minced fresh garlic
20	garlic cloves, peeled and cut in half
½	teaspoon ground sage (if using fresh then use only 2 teaspoons)
1       teaspoon fresh thyme
1	tablespoon fresh tarragon,  roughly chopped
1	tablespoon kosher salt
1 ¼	teaspoons black pepper
2	tablespoons dry white wine
2	tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1	large onion, sliced

Directions:
1.	If bone in then fillet the roast, you don’t have to remove the bone.  Let rest and come closer to room temp.
2.	In the bowl of a food processor blend together the garlic and the herbs.  With the motor running, add wine and oil and blend until it comes together into a dry paste.
3.	 Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
4.	 Smear half of the herb mixture on the inside of the pork butt;  fold back or roll together and tie with kitchen twine every 2 inches; then smear the remaining herb mixture over the top.
5.	Lay the onions in the bottom of the roasting pan, and set the pork butt on top of the onions.  Bake uncovered for 4 to 6 hours or until the internal temperature is 190. Let rest for 15 minutes covered.  Slice and serve.
