Ingredients:
4 ears corn on the cob, husks and silk removed
1/4 cup mayonnaise (such as Hellmann's®/Best Foods®), or to taste - divided
1/4 cup margarine in a squeezable container, or to taste - divided
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste - divided
1 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste - divided

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and gently place ears of corn into the boiling water. Reduce heat to low and simmer until corn is very tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove an ear of corn with tongs and spread about 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise all over the kernels. Squeeze about 1 tablespoon of margarine over the ear of corn in a zig-zag line, turning the ear as you squeeze. Generously sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the ear and dust with chili powder. Repeat with remaining ears of corn.

Description: 
On the streets of Santa Maria, California, street vendors (think an ice cream man with a 'trash can' full of hot corn on the cob instead of ice cream) roam the sidewalks selling corn on the cob for a dollar an ear! They slide a wooden skewer in one end for you to hold the corn. We crave it often and it's become a regular on our Saturday grill nights! Give it a try. You'll be surprised!
