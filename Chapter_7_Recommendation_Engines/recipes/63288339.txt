Ingredients:
4 each of boneless, skinless chicken breast and boneless skinless chicken thighs(I purchase both of these in quanity at our local warehouse club)
2-6oz boxes of chicken stovetop stuffing
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of celery soup
1.5 cups water
1 12oz can of evaporated milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lay the chicken pieces in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a large bowl mix together the soups, water and evaporated milk. Stir well.
Fold the stovetop stuffing into the soup mixture.
Pour the stuffing, soup mixture right over top the chicken. Smooth the Stovetop with the back of a spoon.
Bake for 45-60 minutes at 350 degrees. The dish is ready when the meat thermometer reads 165. This step is important depending on the thickness of your breast!
