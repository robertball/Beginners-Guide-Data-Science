Ingredients:
•	10 African birds eye chilis
•	2 garlic cloves
•	2 tbsp vegetable oil
•	2 tsp white vinegar
•	2 limes, juiced
•	1 tsp salt, or to taste
•	1 tsp fresh ground black pepper, or to taste
•	1 bunch cilantro
•	1 whole chicken breast cut in half
•	2 chicken leg quarters, skin on

Directions:
1.	Using rubber gloves, mince the chilis and garlic cloves. Put into a mixing bowl. Add the vegetable oil, vinegar, lime juice, salt, pepper, and cilantro. Mix well.
2.	Put the chicken pieces into a two-gallon zip top food safe bag. Pour the piri piri sauce into the bag covering the chicken. Secure the seal of the bag. Shake the bag to completely cover the chicken. Put the bag into the refrigerator to marinate for at least four hours.
3.	Bring the chicken still in the bag to room temperature before cooking.
4.	Heat a grill. Remove the chicken from the bag, discard the bag and the cilantro. Cook the chicken on the grill, rotating as necessary to evenly cook. About 25 minutes. When a meat thermometer reads 74°C, the chicken is ready.

Description: 
Chicken is marinated in a spicy piri piri pepper sauce then grilled for this simple but flavorful African inspired recipe. I like to serve this with a cool yogurt sauce and fonio pilaf.
