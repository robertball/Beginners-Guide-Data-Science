1 (8 ounce) package seitan
1/3 cup nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons tamari
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine nutritional yeast, garlic powder, coriander, cumin, and black pepper.  Dip seitan in tamari, then in the yeast and spice mixture.  Set aside.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry seitan in batches until browned on all sides.

Description: 
Seitan has a firm, meat-like texture, and can be cooked the same way.  It tastes great prepared any way, but I love it most when breaded and seasoned. Can be served with rice and veggies, mashed potatoes, or with a side of pasta.
