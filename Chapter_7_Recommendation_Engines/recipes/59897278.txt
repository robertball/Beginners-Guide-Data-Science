Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package Mexican pork chorizo
1 cup uncooked long grain white rice
1 1/2 cup water
4  bell peppers
1 small onion, diced
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
1/3 cup pepper-jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the rice and water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and cook 20 minutes. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the chorizo and diced onions until evenly browned.  Add cooked rice to the skillet, season with garlic powder, salt and pepper.
Remove and discard the tops, seeds, and membranes of the bell peppers. Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward. (Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary so that they will stand upright.)
Stuff the peppers with the rice and chorizo mixture.  Sprinkle the tops with the cheese.  Pour just enough water in the baking dish to cover the bottom, approximately 1-2 cups.
Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven.  Serve hot.

Description: 
I gave the original recipe for stuffed peppers a bit of a Spanish twist.  I used pork chorizo in place of the ground beef, and left out the tomato sauce and Italian seasoning.  I think you will enjoy the results and the savings!Modified from: Stuffed Peppers
