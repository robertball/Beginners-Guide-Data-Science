Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
2 cups sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
3 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup baking cocoa

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugars. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in vanilla. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Divide dough in half; add cocoa to one portion. Divide each portion in half. On a baking sheet, roll out each portion between waxed paper into a 12-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Remove waxed paper. Place one chocolate rectangle over a plain rectangle. Roll up tightly, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; wrap in plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining dough. Refrigerate for 2 hours or until firm. Unwrap and cut into 1/4-in. slices. Place 2 in. apart on lightly greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until set. Remove to wire racks to cool.
