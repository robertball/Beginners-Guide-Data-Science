Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
2 (4 ounce) fillets salmon
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons capers
ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring water and lemon juice to a boil in medium-sized skillet.  Stir in chicken bouillon granules.  Reduce heat to a simmer and place salmon fillets in pan.  Cover and simmer over low heat, 10 minutes per inch of thickness, measured at thickest part; or until fish flakes when tested with a fork. Remove salmon from pan; keep salmon warm.
Boil remaining liquid in the skillet until it is reduced to approximately 1/4 cup.  Whisk in butter and stir in capers.  Spoon sauce over fish. Season with pepper and sprinkle with parsley.

Description: 
This is a delicious, creative way to serve salmon. You can serve the salmon on a bed of cooked noodles (I enjoy fettuccine) or on its own with a side of vegetables.
