Ingredients:
non-stick spray or 1 Tbsp vegetable oil
2-4 thin cut, boneless pork chops
1 onion, sliced thick
1 green bell pepper, sliced thick (remove seeds for less spice)
1 can Rotel Original, aka diced tomatoes & green chilis (choose mild for less spice), undrained

Directions:
Sear pork chops in non-stick spray or vegetable oil.  Place seared pork chops in baking dish in single layer.  Top with slices of onion & green bell pepper.  Pour can of Rotel over the top.  Check liquid level - it should be halfway up the thickness of your pork chops.  Add water until it's right.  Cover baking dish with tinfoil.  Bake in 350 degree oven for 1 hour, checking chops at 45 minutes for desired doneness and every 10-15 minutes thereafter until done.
