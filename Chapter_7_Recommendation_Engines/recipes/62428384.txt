Summer Cabbage & Chicken Salad Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 head of cabbage shredded
2 boneless/skinless chicken breast - Preferably barbecued for extra flavor, but baked is ok too.
Dressing
2 packets of Chicken Top Ramen seasoning
1 cup of olive oil
6 Tb Balsamic Vinegar
4 Tb Sugar
6 Chopped green onions
Almond Topping:
Almond slices and sesame seeds, toasted

Directions:
Barbecue the chicken breasts, wait until they cool then cut them into small squares.  (barbecued is optional, baked would work fine as well)
Shred the cabbage. Mix together the cabbage and chicken, set aside.
Mix together all of the salad dressing ingredients.  Let stand for at least one hour to let flavors meld.  Re-mix the dressing just before serving to blend the oil and vinegar (best to have guests self serve the dressing to keep the salad from getting soggy).  I also often double this recipe and make 3 times the dressing and there is always great lunch leftovers remaining.  :)  People also love the dressing so more typically goes onto the salad when you let thems self serve than would normally, and that's ok, it makes it very flavorful.
Top with the toasted almond/sesame seed mixture to taste just before serving.  You can also crush up the top ramen not used when making the dressing, and top the salad with these as well.  I prefer it without.
