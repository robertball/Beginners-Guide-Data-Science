Ingredients:
1/2 cup JIF® Creamy Peanut Butter
1/2 cup hoisin sauce
1/2 cup finely chopped onions
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
1/2 cup water
2 cloves minced garlic
4 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
CRISCO® Cooking Spray
Salt and pepper
1/2 cup chopped scallions

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a saucepan. Stirring constantly, bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring often. Sauce can be made several days ahead of time and refrigerated. If it is too thick, just add a little water when heating it before serving.
Spray the salmon filets with CRISCO(R) Cooking Spray on both sides, and season with salt and pepper.
Grill until done to your liking. Top each grilled salmon filet with warm Peanut Hoisin Sauce and sprinkle with chopped scallions, just before serving. Enjoy!
