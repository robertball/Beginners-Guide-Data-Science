Ingredients:
2 - 12.5 oz cans Tyson Premium Chunk Chicken, drained
1 cup dry white wine
1 - 19 oz can Progresso Seasoned Black Beans
2 cups chicken broth
16 oz Francesco Rinaldi Traditional pasta sauce
1/2 Tbsp ground chipotle pepper
Sriracha hot chili sauce, to taste
2 Tbsp fresh Cilantro, divided
1 Tbsp Lime Juice
1/2 cup Oikos Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt
9.7 oz Archer Farms Cilantro Lime Rice
Green Onions, sliced (optional garnish)
Serve with Tostito's Hint of Lime Chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken, wine, beans, broth, pasta sauce, chipotle & sriracha. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and allow to simmer until sauce is slightly thickened. (About 30 minutes - longer if preferred.)
Meanwhile, mix 1 Tbsp cilantro, lime juice, and yogurt. Set aside. Prepare Cilantro Lime Rice as directed on box.
Just before serving, stir remaining cilantro into sauce. Serve in bowls with rice on bottom, sauce poured on top. Add a dollop of yogurt mixture and garnish with green onions. Serve with Tostito's Hint of Lime chips.

I love the Mexican Gumbo at Qdoba and was inspired to create this dish. I think it's even better, and easy too!
