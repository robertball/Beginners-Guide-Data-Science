Ingredients:
1 pkg. (4 oz) wild rice
2 1/2 cups water
1/2 tsp salt
8 oz sliced  white mushrooms
8 oz sliced baby bella mushrooms
2 cups chicken stock
2 oz bacon bits
3 Tbsp. butter
1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp. flour
4 cups milk
1/4 tsp garlic powder
salt, to taste
white pepper, to taste
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, plus garnish

Directions:
Rinse the rice thoroughly in cold water; drain. Add the rice, water and salt to a medium saucepan; bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover. Simmer about 45 minutes. Drain off any remaining water; set aside.
Roughly chop the mushrooms. In a large soup pot, combine the mushrooms and stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Add rice.
In a medium saucepan melt butter over medium-low heat. Add flour and whisk to combine. Stirring constantly, cook the mixture (roux) until it turns golden brown and smells toasty, about 2 minutes. Add milk and stir constantly until thickened. Add garlic powder, salt and pepper; cook 5 minutes more.
Add the milk mixture to the mushrooms and broth. Bring to a simmer; stir in the bacon bits, parsley and Parmesan cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into bowls; garnish with cheese and  parsley. serve immediately refrigerating any leftovers.
