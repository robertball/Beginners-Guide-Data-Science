Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked short-grain white rice
2 1/4 cups water
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 teaspoons honey
1 teaspoon minced garlic
3 ounces firm tofu, cut into 1/2 inch strips
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
4 sheets nori seaweed sheets
1/2 cucumber, julienned
1/2 avocado, julienned
1 small carrot, julienned

Directions:
In a large saucepan cover rice with water and let stand for 30 minutes.
In a shallow dish combine soy sauce, honey and garlic.  In this mixture marinate tofu for at least 30 minutes.
Bring water and rice to a boil and then reduce heat; simmer for about 20 minutes, or until thick and sticky.  In a large glass bowl combine cooked rice with rice vinegar.
Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo mat.  Working with wet hands, spread 1/4 of the rice evenly over the nori; leave about 1/2 inch on the top edge of the nori.  Place 2 strips of marinated tofu end to end about 1 inch from the bottom.  Place 2 strips of cucumber next to the tofu, then avocado and carrot.
Roll nori tightly from the bottom, using the mat to help make a tight roll.  Seal by moistening with water the 1/2 inch at the top.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.  Slice with a serrated knife into 1 inch thick slices.
