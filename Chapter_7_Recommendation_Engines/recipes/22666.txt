Description: 
Having worked in two donut shops in Massachusetts, I now know the reason why filled donuts are often referred to as creme filled is because the closest they've come to real cream is what's in the coffee they're eaten with.  Fillings made with real cream are highly perishable and have the potential for causing food poisoning.  In a nice restaurant where desserts are made-to-order, you would probably get a real cream filling, but not in a donut shop or run-of-the-mill bakery, especially a chain.  This is what we put in the cream filled donuts, and people just raved about them.
