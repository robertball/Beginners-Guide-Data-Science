2 cloves garlic, peeled
2 1/4 teaspoons olive or canola oil

Directions:

Fold foil around garlic and seal tightly. Place corn and garlic directly on oven rack. Remove at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes. Remove corn; bake garlic 5-10 minutes longer or until softened.
Remove garlic from foil and place in a small bowl; cool. Mash with a fork. When corn is cool enough to handle, remove corn from cobs with a sharp knife.
In a saucepan over medium heat, heat remaining oil. add rice; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Gradually add broth, bay leaf, salt, pepper and roasted garlic. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 13 minutes. Stir in roasted corn; cover and cook 7-10 minutes longer or until rice is tender. Discard bay leaf.

Description: 
'I usually roast quite a few ears of corn when they are on sale and freeze what I don't use at that time,' writes Marilyn Rodriguez of Fairbanks, Alaska. 'This is a wonderful side dish to go with a fish fry, barbecue or almost any summer meal. It's a constant at my house.'
