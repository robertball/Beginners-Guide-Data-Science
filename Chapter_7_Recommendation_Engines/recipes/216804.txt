Description: 
A sweet yet mildly spicy Caribbean rendition of an old vegetable staple makes what sometimes is a bitter-tasting veggie, liked by few, into an exciting side dish. After snowblowing a traditional Michigan winter evening, Charlie yearned for the island taste. He blended this up and it was requested again three nights in a row.
