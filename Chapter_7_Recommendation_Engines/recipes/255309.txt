Ingredients:
1 apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
2 bananas, sliced
1/2 cup granola
1/3 cup ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 teaspoon white sugar (optional)
1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder (optional)
1 teaspoon butter (optional)
1 tablespoon almond milk, or to taste

Directions:
Place apple, bananas, granola, cinnamon, sugar, and cocoa powder in a container with a lid. Cover and shake until combined.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add apple mixture; increase heat slightly and cook, stirring constantly, until cinnamon starts to darken and turn into a paste, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in milk.
Reduce heat to medium; cook, covered, until flavors combine, about 1 minute. Uncover and stir. Cover and simmer for 1 minute more. Remove from heat and stir.
