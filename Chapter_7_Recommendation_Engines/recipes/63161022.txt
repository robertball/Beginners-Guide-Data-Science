3 cloves Garlic minced
2 sprigs Thyme leaves only
Salt and Pepper to taste
1/4 cup Apple Cider Vinegar

Directions:
To make the chutney, preheat a skillet to medium-high and fry bacon. Once cooked, remove the bacon, leaving the fat, and add onion. Cook until transparent and then fold the bacon back in, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook an additional 12-15 minutes. Add garlic and thyme, cook an additional 2 minutes, and then add the apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, salt, pepper and mustard seed. Cook three to four minutes, and add the beer or water, then cook an additional 4 minutes.
