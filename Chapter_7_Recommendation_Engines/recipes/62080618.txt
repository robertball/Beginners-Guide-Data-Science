Ingredients:
1 lb. beef stew meat
2 T. flour
1 t. salt
1/2 t. black pepper
2-3 T. oil
1 large onion, sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
Water to cover
4 cubes beef boullion
4 garlic knackwurst or plain knackwurst
1 jar oysters with liquor
2-3 T. file powder (or more to taste)
white cooked rice

Directions:
Mix flour, salt and pepper in zip-lock bag. Shake beef stew pieces in flour. Set aside. In stockpot or dutch oven, heat oil and add onions and minced garlic, cooking and occasionally stirring over medium heat until onions are tender and just beginning to brown a little bit. Add beef stew meat and brown well but not until beef is cooked through. Add water to cover. Add boullion cubes and 1 T. file powder. Allow the mixture to come to a boil and then reduce heat, cover and simmer until beef is very tender (an hour or more). When beef is tender, taste broth and gradually add more file powder to taste (be careful not to add too much or it will get "goopy" and dark) add knackwurst and simmer until knackwurst "split". Add oysters and heat through. Taste and adjust seasonings. Serve over rice.

Description: 
This is the only file gumbo I knew of while growing up. Since then I've seen many but this one is still unique and my favorite! I have no idea where it originated but my grandpa would make this whenever we visited.
