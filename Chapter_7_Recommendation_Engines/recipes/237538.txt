Ingredients:
Cake:
1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix (such as PillsburyÂ® Classic White)
1 cup water
3 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons lime zest
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
3 drops green food coloring (optional)
Frosting:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons lime zest
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
2 tablespoons pearlized sprinkles, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners or spray with cooking spray.
Mix cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons lime zest, lime juice, and food coloring; mix well. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Cool cupcakes on a wire rack.
Beat butter and cream cheese together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add 2 tablespoons lime zest and vanilla extract to creamed butter mixture; mix well. Mix confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, into creamed butter mixture until frosting is smooth; chill in refrigerator until frosting is thickened, about 30 minutes.
Spread frosting onto each cupcake and top with sprinkles.
