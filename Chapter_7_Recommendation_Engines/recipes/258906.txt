Ingredients:
Patties:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 1/2 cups stemmed and chopped kale
1 1/4 cups cooked quinoa
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs
1/4 cup cooked lentils
2 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Sauce:
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
6 fresh basil leaves, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
1 teaspoon lemon juice
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add kale; cook until wilted, 4 to 5 minutes.
Place quinoa, feta cheese, bread crumbs, lentils, eggs, 1 tablespoon parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix to fully combine. Mix in the kale mixture. Form into patties by hand.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the patties, covered, until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Transfer the skillet to the oven; broil the patties until top is crispy, 3 to 5 minutes.
Combine mayonnaise, basil, 1 tablespoon parsley, dill, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in bowl to make the sauce. Dollop onto the patties and serve.
