Ingredients:
Mini Pretzel Twists
Rollo Candies
Whole Pecans
*The amount of each ingredient you need depends on how many you want to make, for instance, 50 Rollos, 50 pecans, and 50 pretzels will make 50 turtles. Extras are recommended in case of mistakes.;D

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or foil. For each turtle, place a pretzel on a lined cookie sheet, place a Rollo on top of the pretzel, and place a pecan on top of the Rollo. Carefully place cookie sheet in oven, making sure the stacks don't fall over. Bake 5 minutes until candies are soft. Remove from oven. Carefully press down on the pecan to make your turtle, and let cool until chocolate is firm.
