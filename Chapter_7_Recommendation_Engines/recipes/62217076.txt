Ingredients:
1 lbs. skinless, boneless, chicken breast, cut into 1-inch chunks
5 Tbsp. dry sherry
1 Tbsp. + 2 tsp. cornstarch
1 Tbsp. oyster sauce
2 tbsp water
2 tbsp reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tbsp honey
1 Tbsp rice vinegar
1 tsp asian (dark) sesame oil
2 tsp canola oil
1 tbsp minced peeled fresh ginger
2 garlic cloves minced
3 scallions chopped
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper
2 celery stalks, chopped
1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped.

Directions:
1. Combine the chicken, 2 Tbsp of the sherry, 1 Tbsp of the cornstarch, and the oyster sauce in a medium bowl; set aside to marinate for 5 min.
2. Combine the remaining 3 Tbsp sherry, the water, soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and the remaining 2 tsp cornstarch in a small bowl; set aside.
3. Heat a nonstick wok or a large, deep skillet over medium hing heat until a drop of water sizzles. Swirl in the canola oil, then add the chicken mixture. Stif-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the celery and bell pepper; stir-fry until crisp-tender, 2-3 min. Stir in the sherry mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens, and the chicken is just cooked through, 1-2 min.
