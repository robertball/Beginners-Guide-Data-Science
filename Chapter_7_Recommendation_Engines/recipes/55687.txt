Ingredients:
8 ounces dried linguine
12 ounces kale
1 (8 ounce) red bell pepper
1 (6 ounce) onion
2 cloves garlic
8 ounces linguisa (Portuguese) or kielbasa (Polish) sausages
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon hot chili flakes
1 cup fat-skimmed chicken broth
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper

Directions:
In a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring 3 quarts water to a boil. Add linguine and stir occasionally until barely tender to bite, 8 to 11 minutes.
Meanwhile, rinse kale; trim off and discard tough stems. Cut leaves crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Rinse, stem, and seed bell pepper; cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-wide slivers 2 inches long. Peel and thinly slice onion. Peel garlic and mince. Slice sausages diagonally 1/4 inch thick.
In a 12-inch nonstick frying pan or 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, stir sausages in olive oil until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add bell pepper, onion, garlic, and chili flakes; stir until onion begins to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add kale and stir until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add broth and stir until boiling.
Drain pasta and return to pan. Add sausage mixture, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. (If pasta has cooled down, stir over medium heat until hot.) Pour into a wide serving bowl or distribute evenly among plates.
