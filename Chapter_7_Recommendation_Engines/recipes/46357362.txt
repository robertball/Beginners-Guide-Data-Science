Directions
Put ingredients for "cereal mix" in a very large pan or bowl (I use my tamale pan and spray it with Pam).
Put ingredients for "syrup" in a 5 quart pan on medium high heat and stir constantly until it comes to a rolling boil.
Boil for 2 to 3 minutes and no longer!
Remove syrup from heat and cool for 2 to 3 minutes.
Pour syrup over cereal mix and stir with long-handled spoon until all cereal is well coated.
While cooling completely, stir every 5 to 10 minutes to prevent clumping.
Eat immediately or store in ziplock bags or similar containers. To me, it actually tastes better the next day.
