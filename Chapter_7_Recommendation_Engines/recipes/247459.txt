Ingredients:
4 ounces fettuccine pasta
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 onions, coarsely chopped, or to taste
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 cup coconut milk, divided
1/2 cup fresh oyster mushrooms, diced small
1/3 cup thinly sliced red bell pepper
1/3 cup thinly sliced green bell pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 spring onions, sliced, or more to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until slightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Add 1/2 cup coconut milk, oyster mushrooms, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper. Cook and stir until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir fettuccine and remaining 1/2 cup coconut milk into the saucepan. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in spring onions and basil. Cook uncovered until sauce is creamy and coats fettuccine, 2 to 3 minutes more.
