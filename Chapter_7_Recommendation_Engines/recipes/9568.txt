Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup butter
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a medium bowl cream together the sugar and butter until smooth. Stir in the egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt, gradually stir into the creamed mixture until all flour is absorbed. Shape dough into rolls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Wrap in waxed paper; refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours or up to 1 week.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Unwrap chilled rolls and cut into 1/4 inch thick slices. Place cookies 1 inch apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are lightly browned. Remove from baking sheets immediately to cool on wire racks.
