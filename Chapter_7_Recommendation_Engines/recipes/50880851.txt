Ingredients:
1 cup long grain white rice
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, finely chopped
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, chopped
1 tomato, seeded and chopped
1 cube chicken bouillon
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 clove garlic, halved

Directions:
brown the rice along with the onion and garlic for best flavor, and squeeze in the juice of 1/2 fresh lime just before covering. THE SECRET TO GETTING THE RICE TO &#34;FLUFF UP&#34; is 1) use long grain white rice, 2) make sure whatever liquid you use is HOT when you add it, 3) ALWAYS use twice as much liquid as rice (1 cup rice, 2 cups chicken broth or water) and 4) once you cover your pot and turn your burner to low, DON'T TOUCH the rice, DON'T LIFT the lid, don't stir it, let it do it's thing. After 20 minutes turn burner off but let the pot sit for at least another 5 - 10 minutes before removing the lid. You will have perfect rice, every time.

Description: 
This is an excellent authentic Mexican rice recipe (not to be confused with Spanish rice) that I make as a side dish with all of my Mexican dishes. The key is cooking the rice properly and using good quality chicken broth or stock.Modified from: Mexican Rice III
