Ingredients:
2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 pound cooked pulled pork
1 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables with lima beans
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 medium russet potatoes, cubed
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, pulled pork, mixed vegetables, tomatoes, potatoes, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce in a 4-quart slow cooker.
Cook until flavors are well combined, about 2 hours on High or 4 hours on Low; the longer the stew cooks, the better the ingredients blend together.
