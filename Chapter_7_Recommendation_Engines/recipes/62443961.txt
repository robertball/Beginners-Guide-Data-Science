Ingredients:
2 Cups of Zucchini (Drained well)
2 eggs
4 Green Onions
2 Cloves of Garlic
30 Finely Crushed Saltine Crackers
2 TBS Flour
½ tsp Red Pepper Flakes
1 Cup Shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.
Grate zucchini and drain well in a kitchen towel or salad spinner.
Add in both eggs.
Chop the green onions and finely grate or mince the garlic (I use a microplane).
Add onions and garlic and stir well to incorporate.
Using your hands, finely crush the saltines over the bowl.
Add flour, Red Pepper Flakes and Cheddar. Stir to combine.
Mixture will still be “wet”. Drop onto a parchment or non-stick foil lined baking sheet.
Bake at 400 degrees for 24 minutes and flip after 15 minutes.

Description: 
Taking the same concept I use for my Salmon Patties, I used Saltines to make delicious Zucchini Cakes. Great served with a little Mexican Sour Cream Dip or Marinara Sauce.
