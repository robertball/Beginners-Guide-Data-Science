Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups All Purpose Flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon Cream of Tartar
1/2 teaspoon Kosher Salt
1/2 cup Unsalted Butter, softened
1/2 cup Crisco Shortening
1 cup White Sugar
1 cup Brown Sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
2 cups Ghirardelli Semi Sweet Chocolate Chips
1 cup Raw Sliced Almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cream of tartar and kosher salt. Set aside.
In another medium mixing bowl, cream the softened butter, shortening and both sugars. Mix in the eggs and vanilla.
Add the flour mixture and mix just until blended.
Stir in the chips and almonds with a wooden spooon until well combined.
Drop the dough by approx. 1 1/2 TBS (I used a small/med ice cream scoop) onto the lined baking sheets.
Bake approx 14 - 15 min until edges are light golden brown. Do not overbake.
Allow to cool on baking sheets 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
My kids do not care for any type of nuts added to their baked goods except almonds. We were tired of plain chocolate chip cookies so I combined a few recipes and came up with this one. It has become everyone's favorite.
