Ingredients:
1 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloin, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
2 tablespoons sweet sherry
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 cup beef broth
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon ground ginger
2 tablespoons cornstarch
6 cups broccoli florets
1 cup water
2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
3 large cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
In a medium bowl, toss pork slices with sherry and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce until coated. Set aside. In a separate bowl, stir together the beef broth, sugar,  remaining soy sauce, ginger and cornstarch.
Place broccoli in a large skillet over high heat and pour in 1 cup of water. Cover and steam until tender but still crisp and bright green, about 4 minutes. Drain and transfer broccoli to a plate; set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the same skillet over high heat until it begins to send up wisps of smoke. Add half of the pork slices; stir-fry until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to the plate with the broccoli. Repeat the process with remaining pork and oil.
Return the broccoli and pork to the skillet and add the garlic. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until garlic is fragrant. Pour in the broth mixture and cook, stirring gently, for 1 minute or until thickened. Serve immediately.
