Ingredients:
1 large mango, peeled and chopped
1 large tomato, seeded and chopped
1 small cucumber, seeded and chopped
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 green onion, thinly sliced
1 jalapeno pepper*
1 tablespoon lime juice
8 (6 inch) whole wheat flour tortillas
1 pound fresh or frozen swordfish or halibut steaks, cut 1 inch thick
1/2 teaspoon Jamaican jerk seasoning
2 cups shredded fresh spinach or lettuce
Fresh spinach leaves (optional)

Directions:
For the Tropical Fruit Salsa, combine the mango, tomato, cucumber, cilantro, green onion, jalapeno pepper and lime juice in a large mixing bowl. Cover and refrigerate until serving time. Serve with slotted spoon.
Wrap tortillas in foil. Place at the edge of the grill. Heat for 10 minutes over medium-hot coals, turning occasionally. Meanwhile, cut fish into 3/4-inch slices; sprinkle with Jamaican jerk seasoning. Place strips in a light greased grill basket. Grill directly over medium-hot coals for 8 to 10 minutes or until fish flakes easily, turning the basket once. Fill each tortilla with spinach or lettuce, fish, and Tropical Fruit Salsa. If desired, serve on spinach leaves.
