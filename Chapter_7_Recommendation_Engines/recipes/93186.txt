Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) cans Pillsbury® refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
1/2 cup chive-and-onion cream cheese spread
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper (cayenne)
1/2 cup shredded carrot
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped seeded cucumber
1/4 cup chopped salted peanuts
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Unroll both cans of dough and separate into 4 long rectangles. Place rectangles in ungreased 15x10x1-inch pan; press in bottom and up sides to form crust.
Bake 13 to 17 minutes or until golden brown. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Stir together cream cheese spread, peanut butter, ginger and ground red pepper. Spread over cooled crust. Top with carrot, bell pepper, cucumber and peanuts. Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate up to 2 hours before serving.
Just before serving, sprinkle with cilantro. Cut into squares.
