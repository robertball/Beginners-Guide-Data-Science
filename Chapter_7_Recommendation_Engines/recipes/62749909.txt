Mix in the olives, green chile peppers, tomatoes, salsa and corn (drained). Stir mixture thoroughly, reduce heat to low, and let simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
Spread a thin layer of the meat mixture in the bottom of a 4 quart casserole dish.

Repeat layering meat, refried beans,cheese (between 2 tortillas each) pattern until all the tortillas are used, topping off with a layer of meat mixture and cheese.
Bake for 20 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is slightly brown and bubbly.
Serve with an iceberg lettuce wedge, sour cream and guacamole.
Depending on the size of your baking dish, this recipe may be divided to your liking.  Make one spicy and one mild.  It freezes well also.
