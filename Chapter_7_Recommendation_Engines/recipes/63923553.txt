Description: 
I live about 1 hour from my favorite pizza joint so I decided to make my own sauce recipe for the days that I can't have the real thing. (Cause let's face it, NOTHING beats the real thing). After many attempts (10 full batches to be exact) at adjusting my recipe, this is what my taste buds came up with. I hope you will give it a try and enjoy it as much as my family and I do.
