1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large sweet onion, peeled and chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed
1 cup cooked ham, diced
8 eggs, beaten
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Heat olive oil in a skillet or frying pan. Add onion and saute until clear. Stir in green pepper; cook until soft. Add the cooked pasta and chopped ham; toss well to combine. Pour in the eggs and season with salt and pepper.
Cook until firm on one side; flip and cook until firm on the other side. You may split the frittata with a spatula to make the flipping easier.
