Description: 
This was my favorite growing up. I was amazed when I was older and asked my mom for the recipe how EASY it is! A small amount of prep. time, a day in the slow cooker, and you'll be amazed! It sounds too simple to be good... TRUST me! This gets RAVE reviews when we make it! The amount of vegetables is only an estimate. Use as many or as few as you choose. When it's done, you will have a yummy gravy, and will have to carefully dig for the steak pieces.
