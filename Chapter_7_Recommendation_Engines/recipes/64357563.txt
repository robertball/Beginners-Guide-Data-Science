Ingredients:
½ cup raw cashews
2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 ½ tsp red wine vinegar (gives more flavor, but can use more lemon juice or apple cider vinegar)
1 tbsp raw tahini
¼ cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped
2 tsp fresh chives, chopped (optional, and can use more onion powder)
1/8 tsp garlic powder (see note)
1/8 tsp onion powder (see note)
¼ tsp Dijon mustard (omit for raw version)
1/2 tsp (scant) sea salt
1/8 tsp freshly black pepper to taste
1/2 tsp sugar (adjust to taste)
1/2 cup water or non-dairy milk (or more to thin as desired)

Directions:
Puree all the ingredients until very smooth (it will take a couple of minutes).
This dressing will thicken some after refrigeration. You can thin it out by stirring in a few teaspoons of water, or keep it thick and use it as a dip for raw veggies.
