Ingredients:
3 Tbsp. unsalted butter
3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour
2 cups chicken broth
1 shallot, minced
1 tsp. salt
½ tsp. ground black pepper
1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
½ cup sour cream
2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
3 cups frozen broccoli florets, thawed
1 ½ lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breast, cooked and shredded
1 cup cracker crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325F. In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat, and add the flour. Cook for about 3 minutes. Add the broth and shallot, and increase the heat to bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, stirring occasionally until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Add the salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Remove from heat, and stir in the sour cream and ¼ cup of the Parmesan.
Arrange the broccoli in a 2-quart gratin dish, and pour half the sauce over it. Arrange the chicken on top of the broccoli, and pour on the remaining sauce. Top with cracker crumbs and remaining cheese. Bake for 20 minutes. Then put the dish under the broiler until the cracker crumbs are golden brown, about 1 minute.
