Ingredients:
3 russet potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds
3 tablespoons canola oil, divided
1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 green bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 yellow onion, diced
3 mushrooms, diced
1 pound pork sausage
1 (7 ounce) can canned chipotle peppers, minced
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place potatoes in a bowl and drizzle 1 tablespoon canola oil over potatoes; toss to coat. Spread potatoes onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; flip potatoes and continue baking until tender and lightly browned, about 15 minutes more.
Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir red bell pepper and green bell pepper until softened, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Pour 1 tablespoon canola oil into the same skillet over medium-high heat; add onion and mushrooms. Cook and stir until onions are translucent and mushrooms are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer onion mixture to bowl with peppers.
Cook and stir sausage in the same skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add chipotle peppers and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
Layer potato rounds in a serving dish; top with sausage, pepper and onion mixture, Monterey Jack cheese, and cilantro.
