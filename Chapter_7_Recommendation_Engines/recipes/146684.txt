Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
4 slices OSCAR MAYER Bacon, chopped
1/2 cup chopped onions
1/2 pound VELVEETA Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza crust

Directions:
PREHEAT oven to 400 degrees F. Cook ground beef, bacon and onions in large skillet on medium-high heat until ground beef is evenly browned, stirring occasionally. Drain; return meat mixture to skillet. Add VELVEETA; cook until completely melted, stirring frequently. Cool 10 min.
UNROLL pizza dough onto baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray. Press into 15x8-inch rectangle. Top evenly with meat mixture. Roll up dough, starting at one of the long sides. Rearrange, if necessary, so roll is seam-side down on baking sheet.
BAKE 20 to 25 min. or until golden brown. Cut diagonally into six slices to serve.
