Ingredients:
1/2 pound almond paste
1 cup white sugar
2 egg whites
1/4 cup pine nuts

Directions:
Use a pastry chopper (or food processor) to break up the almond paste into a granulated form.  Put in mixing bowl and gradually add the sugar.
In another small bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff.  Fold the egg whites into the sugar/almond paste mixture gently.
On a greased and floured cookie sheet, drop a spoonful of the mixture.  Press pine nuts into the top of the cookie (you want to cover the top with nuts).
Bake at 325 degrees F (170 degrees C) for 10-12 minutes.  Cool on wire rack.

Description: 
Also called pine nut cookies.  I make them and my family eats them so quickly I have to hide a few so I get some.
