Ingredients:
2 cups Bisquick -or similar- baking mix (or combine 2 cups flour, 1 Tbsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. salt and 1/3 cup butter - if making your own biscuit mix the additional butter in the body of the recipe isn't needed)
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, cold (if using commercial baking mix)
2/3 cup milk
Combine and melt together in small skillet:
2-3 Tablespoons melted butter
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
Salt to "season"

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.
Combine baking mix, sharp cheese, parsley and garlic powder. Cut in additional butter, if using. Stir in milk. Do not overmix. Drop batter by heaping spoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheet.
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove and brush biscuits with melted butter mixture. Bake for 5 more minutes or until lightly browned on the bottom.

Very close to Red Lobster's bisquits.  Hubby said they're better - could just be the easy access to our kitchen.Modified from: Cheddar Biscuits
