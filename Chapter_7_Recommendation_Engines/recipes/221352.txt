Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup honey
6 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 cup water
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in sugar and honey. Bring to a boil; let cool, about 10 minutes.
Whisk flour, cinnamon, and cloves together in a bowl.
Mix baking soda and water together in a bowl; stir into butter mixture. Mix in eggs. Add flour-spice mixture; stir until dough is combined. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Roll dough out; cut into cookies and place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This is a family recipe that I received from my mother-in-law. They were German-Polish farmers in the early 1900s on the eastern Germany-Poland border. This is a chewy, honey-based Christmas cookie. Melt dark chocolate and apply a thin coat to the cookie (as an extra treat)!
