Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/2 cup powered sugar
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
3 tablespoons melted butter
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
1- 1 1/2 milk
some yellow food coloring if you like

Directions:
melt butter and mix in everything else with a fork or spoon until smooth, drizzle over top of cake or other
if you make it too far in advance and it hardens pop in the microwave for app. 30-45 seconds to make it easy to drizzle, it will harden again on your cake in a couple of minutes
feel free to omit the granulated sugar if you don't want a slight crunch in the glaze (I added it to be like the glaze on lemon bundt cake from Sam's club)
enjoy
