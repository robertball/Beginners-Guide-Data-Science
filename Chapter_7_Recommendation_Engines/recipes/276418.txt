Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup rolled oats
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1/2 cup Greek yogurt
1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups finely shredded carrots
1 cup shredded apple
1/2 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 16 muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners.
Stir together flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ground ginger, salt, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Whisk together maple syrup, Greek yogurt, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla extract in a second bowl until thoroughly combined. Add maple syrup mixture to flour mixture and stir until just combined. Fold in carrots, apple, crystallized ginger, raisins, and walnuts.
Divide batter evenly between 16 prepared muffin cups, filling each to the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the muffins comes out clean, 18 to 22 minutes. Cool in the tins for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
