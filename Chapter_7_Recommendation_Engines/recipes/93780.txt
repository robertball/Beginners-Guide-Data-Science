Ingredients:
4 tablespoons bacon drippings
1/4 cup flour
Salt and pepper to taste
2 1/2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 inch cubes
5 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, thinly sliced
6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 pound carrots, peeled and sliced
1 pound celery, sliced
1/4 cup rice vinegar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
4 cups beef broth
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles ale
1 parsnip, peeled and sliced
1 turnip, peeled and chopped
1 pound baby red potatoes, washed
3/4 cup parsley, chopped
4 whole bay leaves

Directions:
Heat bacon grease in a large pot over medium heat.
Combine flour with salt and pepper. Coat beef cubes.
Brown meat in the bacon grease until nicely browned. Remove to a paper towel, and set aside.
Heat olive oil in the same pot. Cook onions, garlic, carrots, and celery over low heat. Add the vinegar and sugar. Pour in the broth and bring to a boil. Deglaze the pan by scraping off the food stuck on the bottom of the pot.
Return meat to pot. Pour in beer, then stir in parsnips, turnips, red potatoes, parsley, and bay leaves. Reduce heat to medium low. Cover and simmer for 90 minutes, stirring occasionally.
