Ingredients:
4 salmon steaks
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon mayonnaise, or more to taste
2 teaspoons honey
1 (1.7 ounce) container nori fumi furikake (seaweed and sesame rice seasoning)
1/4 cup oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Season salmon with garlic salt and black pepper. Combine mayonnaise and honey in a small bowl and spread on top side of salmon steaks.
Place furikake in a shallow bowl. Dip top side of each salmon steak in furikake; press down lightly for coating to stick.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place salmon coated-side down and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn over and continue cooking until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes more.
