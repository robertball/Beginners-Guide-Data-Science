Ingredients:
2	sticks unsalted butter, softened
1	head of garlic, cloves coarsely chopped
1	cup prepared horseradish
1/4	cup plus 2 tablespoons chopped thyme
3	tablespoons chopped rosemary
3	tablespoons chopped sage
One 16-pound rib roast of beef
Salt and freshly ground pepper

Directions:
1)  Preheat the oven to 325°.
2)  In a food processor, combine the butter with the garlic, horseradish, thyme, rosemary and sage and process to a paste.
3)  Stand the roast in a very large roasting pan. Season generously all over with salt and pepper and set it fatty side up.
4) Spread the horseradish-herb butter all over the top.
5) Bake for about 3 1/2 hours, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 125° for medium rare.
6) Transfer the roast to a carving board to rest for at least 20 minutes or for up to 1 hour before serving.
MAKE AHEAD The horseradish-herb butter can be refrigerated overnight. Let the butter soften before using.
