Ingredients:
7 onions, each cut into 6 wedges
3 cloves garlic, peeled
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
7 ripe tomatoes, each cut into quarters
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried sweet basil
18 ounces hake prime steaks
2 tablespoons dry white wine
1/4 cup soft brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place onion wedges and garlic in a roasting pan; drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over mixture. Turn onions a few times to evenly coat with oil. Add tomatoes to onion mixture and drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over tomatoes. Season mixture with salt and basil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Add hake steaks and wine to onion mixture; sprinkle brown sugar over the onion mixture.
Bake in the oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes more.
