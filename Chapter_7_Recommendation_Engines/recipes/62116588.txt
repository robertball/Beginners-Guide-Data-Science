Ingredients:
1 lb chicken breasts, cut into small pieces
2 tbsp virgin olive oil
1 package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and thoroughly drained
1 8 oz package of plain feta, chopped
1 large yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons mayonaise
1/4 cup ricotta cheese
1 tsp salt
2 tsp pepper
1 tbsp greek oregano
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 eggs
1 lb package frozen phyllo dough, thawed
1/2 stick of butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and grease a baking sheet.
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat.
Add the onion and saute until it begins to soften - 5-8 minutes.
Add the chicken and saute until golden brown, breaking it up further with your spoon.
Add the spinach, oregano and garlic and cook for about 2-3 minutes.
Remove chicken mixture from heat and allow to cool.
In a large bowl, mix feta, eggs, ricotta, mayo, lemon juice, salt and pepper together.
Add the cooled chicken mixture to the cheese mixture.
Roll out the phyllo dough on a clean surface.
Brush the top layer with butter.
Spoon the chicken mixture on the phyllo in a log shape.
Working with two sheets of the phyllo, tuck the ends up over the chicken filling and roll it, burrito style.
Brush the phyllo with more butter and place on a greased cookie sheet.
Continue process until you have used up all of the filling.
Bake at 375 degrees for 45 minutes or until browned.
