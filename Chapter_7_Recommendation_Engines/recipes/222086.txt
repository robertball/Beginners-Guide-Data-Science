Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease muffin cups or line with muffin liners.
Mix together 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/4 cup butter, cinnamon in a small bowl with a fork until mixture resembles a coarse crumb.
Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 3/4 cup sugar, and baking powder in a bowl.  Place applesauce into a 1 cup measuring cup; add egg and enough milk to fill cup; mix into flour mixture. Fold in blueberries.  Fill muffin cups to the top, and sprinkle with crumb topping mixture.
