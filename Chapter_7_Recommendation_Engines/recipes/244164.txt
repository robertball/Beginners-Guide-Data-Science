Description: 
I have this sauce in the refrigerator at all times! Perfect for marinating chicken, beef, or fish; or use as a vegetable dipping sauce or salad dressing. This sauce freezes really easily and is perfect for those on a paleo diet. I use a Vitamix®, but it can also be made with a blender or food processor. My family loves the taste and it is so easy to make.
