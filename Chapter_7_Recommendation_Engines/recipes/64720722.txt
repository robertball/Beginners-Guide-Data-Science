Ingredients:
3 cups chicken or vegetable broth
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 cups dry whole-grain rotini pasta
1/4 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped (I used roasted garden tomatoes)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
Salt and black pepper, to taste
1 small red bell pepper, thinly sliced
2 small boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 cups baby spinach, chopped
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, shredded

Directions:
In the pot of an electric pressure cooker, whisk together the broth and tomato paste until the tomato paste is dissolved. Add the pasta, sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil, rosemary, 1/4 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper. Stir to combine. Place the bell peppers on top of the pasta. Season the chicken with the garlic seasoning and place on top of the pasta mixture, do not stir.
Lock on the lid, select the Manual/Pressure Cook function. Adjust  to high pressure and set timer for 4 minutes. Make sure the steam valve is in the “sealing” position.
When the cooking time is up, carefully quick-release the pressure.
Unlock the lid and transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board. Slice the meat into bite-size pieces and return them to the pot. Add the spinach and cheese and stir to wilt the spinach. Serve immediately.
