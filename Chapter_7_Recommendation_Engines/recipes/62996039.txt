Ingredients:
4 oz margarine or butter spread (such as Promise Fat Free Spread)
3 cups corn kernels

1 cup light sour cream
9 oz Pepper Jack cheese, cut into 1/2 cubes
1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
1 can (4 oz) diced green chilis, drained and pat dry
1/4 cup diced jalapeño peppers
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup grated parmesan

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F
Spray 2 quart rectangular casserole dish with cooking spray.
Using a food processor or blender, puree 1 cup corn kernels with the melted margarine and eggs.
In a large bowl, combine all remaining ingredients, except parmesan.  Add pureed corn and mix well.  Pour in casserole dish, sprinkle with Parmesan, and bake for 30 minutes, until puffy and golden.  If the top isn't browned but pudding looks set, place under broiler for a few minutes until golden spots appear.
