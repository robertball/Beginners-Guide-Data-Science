Ingredients:
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1/2 cup rice milk
1 tablespoon frozen orange juice concentrate
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 (10 ounce) package silken tofu
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust

Directions:
In heavy pan over medium-high heat, toast coconut until lightly browned. Remove 1 tablespoon of the coconut for garnish. Add rice milk and orange juice concentrate. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then stir in chocolate chips. Remove from heat, and continue stirring until the chips are melted and the mixture is smooth.
Pour maple syrup, vanilla extract, almond extract and tofu into an electric blender or food processor; blend until the mixture is creamy. Add chocolate mixture to the blender, and blend until the mixture is combined. Pour the filling into the pie crust. Cover, and chill for 2 or more hours. Garnish with the reserved coconut before serving.

Description: 
Don't let the tofu in this pie fool you - but it will anyway! Tastes like a cream pie, but without all the dairy and fat. Delicious, decadent.
