Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
6 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
1 (15 ounce) jar light mayonnaise (such as Hellmann's Light®)
1/2 (15 ounce) jar creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip®)
3 1/2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard
1 tablespoon dry ground mustard
1 tablespoon chopped fresh marjoram
6 large ripe tomatoes, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water until pasta is chilled.
Mix elbow macaroni, hard-cooked eggs, light mayonnaise, creamy salad dressing, spicy brown mustard, dry mustard, and marjoram in a large salad bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir in tomatoes. Be sure to include the juice from your cutting board. Season with salt and black pepper.
