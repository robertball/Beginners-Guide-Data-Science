Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/2 cup raisins, divided (optional)
2 (1 pound) loaves frozen bread dough, thawed
1/2 cup butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 (4.6 ounce) package cook-and-serve vanilla pudding mix
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle walnuts into the bottom of the baking dish. Sprinkle about half the raisins with the walnuts.
Tear one bread dough loaf into pieces; add to baking dish and top with remaining raisins.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir brown sugar, pudding mix, milk, and cinnamon with the butter; cook, stirring frequently, until the dry ingredients dissolve completely and the mixture thickens into a caramel-like sauce. Drizzle the sauce over the bread in the baking dish.
Tear remaining dough loaf into pieces and arrange into he pan, filling any empty spots with dough pieces.
Let the dough raise for 2 1/2 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven until no longer doughy in the center, about 30 minutes. Cool rolls in pan for 15 minutes.
Turn the rolls out onto a serving platter large enough to contain the sauce that will run off the rolls.

Description: 
This is a simple cinnamon recipe that my mom likes to call 'Helter Skelter.' She got this from a coworker in Norfolk, NE in 1976. It's called 'Helter Skelter' because you tear two loaves of frozen bread dough and place it 'helter skelter' in the baking pan.
