Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces
2 stalks celery, washed and cut into bite-sized pieces
2 carrots, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces
2 cloves garlic, peeled and pressed
1 cup cremini or white button mushrooms, sliced
1 1/3 cup water
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon sage
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 bay leaf
1 pinch cayenne
black pepper to taste
1/2 to 3/4 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
salt to taste
1 teaspoon cornstarch

Directions:
Saute onion, celery, carrots, and garlic in olive oil medium-low until onion is translucent, stirring occasionally.
Add the mushrooms and cook about 5 minutes more.  Stir occasionally.
Mix tomato paste with a little bit of the water, then add it along with the rest of the water, herbs and spices.
Add chicken, and heat to boiling.  Lower heat to simmer.  Cover and cook until chicken and vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes.
Combine corn starch with a little cold water.  Then add it along with the salt to the stew.  Heat to boiling again.  Continue cooking until stew has thickened.

Description: 
This is a really versatile recipe.  I vary it depending on what I have in the fridge.  I think the most important ingredients are the onion, garlic, and mushroom.  You could probably even do a vegetarian version.  This is also a good recipe for people with allergies.
