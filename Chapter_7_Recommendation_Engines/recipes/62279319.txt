Ingredients:
For the green chile paste:
1/2 c. coarsely chopped hot green chiles
2 Tbsp. coarsely chopped garlic
1/4 cup peeled, coarsely chopped ginger
2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. turmeric
1.5 Tbsp. vegetable oil
For the noodles:
1 lb. potatoes, peeled
3.5 cups chickpea flour
2.5 tsp salt
1 tsp. turmeric
2 Tbsp. mustard oil
Oil for deep frying

Directions:
Combine the chiles, garlic, ginger, salt, turmeric, and oil in a food processor or mortar and pestle and process into a fine paste. (Add a tablespoon of water if you need more liquid.) Reserve 1 to 2 tablespoons for the potato noodles; use the remainder in another recipe or freeze for future use.
Cook the potatoes in three cups of water until soft, reserving the cooking water. Mash the potatoes while they're still warm, using some of the cooking water to get a smooth consistency.
Mix in 1 Tbsp. green chile paste, chickpea flour, salt, turmeric, and mustard oil. Add enough reserved potato-cooking water as needed to make a soft dough.
Heat the cooking oil in a deep pan over medium-high heat. Use a potato ricer (or sev machine, if you have one) to press noodles into the oil. Fry until golden brown and crisp, about two minutes. Use a skimmer or slotted spoon to transfer the noodles to a paper towel-lined bowl. Repeat until all noodles are fried.
Store in an airtight container for up to two weeks.

Description: 
I've been obsessed with this crispy fried snack since my friend brought the recipe back from South Africa in 1987. This is adapted from a recipe she learned in a cooking class taught by a renowned Indian food authority in Cape Town, Ramola Parbhoo.
