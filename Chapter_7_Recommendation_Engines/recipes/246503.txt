Ingredients:
6 scallions, chopped
1/2 cup coarsely grated pear
3 tablespoons dark soy sauce
3 tablespoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
1 tablespoon brown sugar, or more to taste
4 cloves garlic, grated
1 teaspoon lime juice
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 pound beef top sirloin, thinly sliced
Sauce:
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean chile paste)
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)

Directions:
Whisk scallions, pear, dark soy sauce, sesame oil, 1 tablespoon mirin, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, garlic, lime juice, ginger, black pepper, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add beef; coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Transfer beef slices from marinade to preheated grill, reserving marinade; cook until no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side. Place beef in a serving dish.
Place marinade in a saucepan with soy sauce, water, gochujang, 1 teaspoon brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon mirin. Bring to a boil and cook until thickened to sauce consistency, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour sauce over beef.
