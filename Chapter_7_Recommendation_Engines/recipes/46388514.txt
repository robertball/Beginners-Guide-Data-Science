Description: 
A healthy and tasty chicken salad with a fruity twist - great on a croissant or in a honey pita. Note: This salad is best if eaten the DAY AFTER preparation. This allows the ingredients time to mingle, giving a fuller flavor. If desired, use nonfat mayonnaise.Modified from: Fruity Curry Chicken Salad
