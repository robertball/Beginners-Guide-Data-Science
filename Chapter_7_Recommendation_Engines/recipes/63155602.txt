Ingredients:
12 Chicken Wings (Any style)
1/8 tsp. Ground Cinnamon
1/8 tsp. Sugar
1/8 tsp. Black Pepper
1/2 tsp. of Salt
1/2 tsp. of Ground Oregano
1 Tablespoon of Ground Cayenne Pepper
1 Tablespoon of Ground Jalapeno Pepper
1 Tablespoon of Ground Habenero Pepper

Directions:
Step 1: Prepare Chicken, make sure whatever kind of chicken you are using that it is thawed out.
Step 2: Combine all dry rub Ingredients which would be everything but the chicken wings. Mix all ingredients very well.
NOTE: You may want to wear gloves, if the rub gets into your eyes or any open surface it will hurt.  I would not recommend letting children play with these spices.
Step 3: Make sure chicken if fairly dry (not soaking wet or anything), but they do need to be moist, and put wings into a plastic bag or container.
Step 4: Dump all seasoning into container/bag with wings.
Step 5: Shake container/bag until all wings are coated evenly.
Note: Depending on taste and size of your wings you may want to make more rub mix or less depending on your taste.  Feel free to experiment!
Step 6: Grill wings, bake wings at 350 degrees for 60 min. or deep fry wings.  To your taste.
