Ingredients:
4 large potatoes
6 cloves garlic, crushed, or more to taste
1 teaspoon black pepper
4 dried basil leaves, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 dried red chile pepper
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon bottled orange sauce, or to taste (optional)
2 teaspoons sesame seeds

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add potatoes, cover, and steam until easily pierced with a knife, 30 to 35 minutes. Drain and cool until easily handled, about 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Peel and dice potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Spread on baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
Grind garlic, black pepper, basil leaves, and cumin seeds into a paste with a mortar and pestle.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic paste and red chile pepper; cook and stir until garlic begins to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in potatoes and lemon juice. Cover and cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Stir in orange sauce and sesame seeds.
