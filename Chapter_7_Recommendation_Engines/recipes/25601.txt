Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) can mango slices, with juice
1 2/3 cups candied mixed fruit peel
2 tablespoons rum
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine mango slices and juice, mixed fruit and rum. Add cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir gently on medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand until completely cool. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8x4 inch loaf pan. Mix together the flour and baking powder; set aside.
In a large bowl, combine fruit mixture with egg and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture. Pour into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
