Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package ground breakfast sausage
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped onion
3 cups water
1/2 cup butter
2 (6 ounce) packages dry bread stuffing mix

Directions:
Combine sausage, celery, and onion in a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until sausage is browned and crumbled, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer cooked mixture to a plate lined with paper towels to soak up excess oil.
Pour water into a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Stir in butter until melted. Add stuffing mix, cover, and remove from heat. Let stand 5 minutes. Add cooked sausage mixture and stir to combine.

Description: 
This hack on boxed stuffing is so easy but so good that your guests will think you made it from scratch! Ground sausage with sage adds an especially nice flavor, but you can make this with any mild ground breakfast sausage.
