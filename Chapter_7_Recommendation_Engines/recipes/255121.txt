Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/4 white onion, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic salt
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 zucchini
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 tablespoon oil, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine ground beef, onion, garlic salt, salt, and pepper in a bowl; mix well. Shape into 1 1/2-inch balls. Arrange meatballs in a glass baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are browned, about 20 minutes.
Cut zucchini into noodle shapes with a spiralizer.
Heat tomato sauce in a saucepan over medium heat; add meatballs. Reduce heat to low. Cook, covered, until sauce and meatballs are evenly warmed, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; keep covered.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until tender but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Transfer zucchini to a serving plate; top with tomato sauce and meatballs.
