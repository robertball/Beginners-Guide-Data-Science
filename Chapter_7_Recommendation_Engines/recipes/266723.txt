Ingredients:
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
2 cups water
2 cubes vegetable bouillon
2 cups soy milk
2 cups diced potatoes
1 medium onion, chopped
2 (19 ounce) cans cream-style corn
1 (12 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon paprika
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add celery and garlic; saute until slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Add water and bouillon cubes; stir until bouillon dissolves. Add soy milk, potatoes, and onion. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Add all corn, parsley, paprika, and pepper. Simmer until potatoes are soft and flavors have blended, 30 to 40 minutes more.
