Ingredients:
1 pound blood oranges
1 cup sugar
3 eggs, whisked
1 dash salt
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Zest 2 blood oranges and set aside. Juice enough blood oranges to make 3/4 cup juice after straining out pulp and seeds.
Whisk blood orange juice, sugar, eggs, and salt together in a medium-sized pot. Warm slowly over low heat. Add butter and reserved zest. Cook, stirring constantly, until curd has thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.
Pour curd into a bowl and cool on the counter for 15 minutes. Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on top of curd and refrigerate until ready to use.
