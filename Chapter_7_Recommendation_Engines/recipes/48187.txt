Ingredients:
2  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 ½ cups apple juice
¼ teaspoon ground cloves
⅓ teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch garlic powder
½ cup golden raisins

Directions:
Place the chicken in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Pour in the apple juice. Blend in cloves, curry powder, cinnamon, and garlic powder. Mix in the raisins.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. The juice will form a glaze over the chicken. Drizzle with the remaining apple juice mixture to serve.

Description: 
This super easy, super delicious chicken recipe is something I came up with for the girls I babysit -- but the grownups love it too! It's one of the few things the kids beg to eat, and is a great break from the traditional mac and cheese dinner. I get clean plates every time!
