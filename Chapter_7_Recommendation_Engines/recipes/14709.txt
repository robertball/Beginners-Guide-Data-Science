Ingredients:
3 pounds bone-in pork roast
1 dash hot pepper sauce
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 (5 ounce) jar stuffed green olives
3 ounces sliced pepperoni sausage
4 cloves garlic, sliced
salt and pepper to taste
3/4 cup water

Directions:
Rub the roast all over with salt and pepper, hot pepper sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Let marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Using a small boning knife, carefully poke holes about 1 inch deep and 1 inch apart all over the roast. While making each cut twist the knife and insert a drop of hot sauce, wedge of pepperoni, garlic sliver and one olive into each cut.
Place roast in a roasting pan and pour in the water. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 30 minutes per pound or until an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) is met. Remove from oven, tent with foil and let roast stand for 10 minutes before carving.
