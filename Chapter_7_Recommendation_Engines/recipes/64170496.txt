Ingredients:
2 cups flour - unbleached or whole wheat
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 - 3 tablespoons sugar depending on desired sweetness
6 tablespoons fat - butter, margarine, coconut oil, a combination, or other solid fat of your choice
3/4 cup liquid - buttermilk, almond milk, cream, or other liquid of your choice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
Put first 3 ingredients in mixing bowl, and stir to combine
Add the fat, and with either a fork, your fingers, or a pastry blender, cut the fat into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
Add the liquid and stir until the mixture starts to stick together.
Turn out onto a floured surface, then shape and pat into a circle approximately 1/2 inch thick.
Using a sharp knife, cut into fourths, then eights, like a pie.
Place wedges onto a greased baking sheet.
Bake as is or brush the tops with milk.
