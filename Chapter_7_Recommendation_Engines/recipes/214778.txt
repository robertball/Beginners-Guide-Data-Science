Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 cup tzatziki sauce
Â½ cup chopped red onion
1 tablespoon cumin
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Arrange the chicken breasts into the bottom of a baking dish. Stir the tzatziki sauce, red onion, cumin, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour evenly over the chicken. Allow to marinate at least 30 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake the marinated chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
Transplant yourself to the ocean breeze coastline of Greece if only for a meal. This is a moist, quick, and easy dish. Pair it with a Greek salad. I baked these in two different dishes, one as is, the other with a dash of red pepper and paprika. Some people just don't like the heat.
