Stuffed Jalepnos Recipe

Ingredients:
2 fresh jalape単o peppers
8 ounces cream cheese, softened to room temperature
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese*
1 clove garlic, chopped
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
12 slices bacon, cut in half
24 toothpicks

Directions:
reheat oven to 400F degrees. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper (best for clean-up) or a silicone baking mat. Place a baking rack on top of the baking sheet. Set aside.
Cut the jalape単o peppers in half lengthwise; remove seeds and center membrane. Set aside.
Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese, cheddar cheese, garlic, and paprika together until combined. You could also do this by hand using a rubber spatula. Salt to taste - I add just a pinch. Spoon filling equally among all 24 jalape単o halves.
Wrap each stuffed jalape単o with a half slice of bacon and stick a toothpick through the center to assure the bacon stays in place. Place each on the baking rack and bake for 25-28 minutes or until the bacon is crisp to your liking. I like to turn the oven to broil for the last minute or two to get things extra crispy.  Serve immediately. Cover leftovers and keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
