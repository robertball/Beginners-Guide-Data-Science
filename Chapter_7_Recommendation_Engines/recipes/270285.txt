https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1/2 cup garbanzo bean flour
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 eggs
1/2 cup almond flour
4 large green tomatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick
1 quart olive oil for frying

Directions:
Mix garbanzo bean flour with salt and pepper on a plate. Whisk eggs in a bowl. Scoop almond flour onto another plate. Cover tomatoes with garbanzo bean mixture to coat, then dip them in the eggs. Dredge in almond flour to coat completely.
Pour about 1/2 inch oil into a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Place tomatoes into the hot oil in batches of 4 or 5 so that they do not touch. Cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and fry the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batches.

Description: 
I figured out this grain-free alternative when I found that I had a great surplus of tomatoes from my garden. I was worried that the tomatoes would not cook, but they do well so long as they are cut thinly.
