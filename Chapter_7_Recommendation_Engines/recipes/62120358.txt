Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 - Boboli Bread Shell
1/2 cup - Mayo
2 T. - Grated Parmesan Cheese
1/4 t. - Dry Mustard
2 - Egg Whites
6 - Medium Asparagus Spears, cooked & cut into 1/2" to 1" pieces

Directions:
Cook asparagus until bright green, still crisp.
Rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process, drain and pat dry with towel.
Blend; mayo, cheese and dry mustard.
Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form.
Fold egg whites into mayo mixture.
Arrange cut asparagus on the Boboli, spoon may mixture over top.
Bake on ungreased sheet at 450 degrees about 8-10 minutes (dependant on elevation...lol...) or until lightly brown.
NOTE:  I have a few variations on my recipe.
*  I will put the Boboli in the oven to crisp the top lightly so it does not get soggy.
*  Also, sometimes I will top the whole thing with cheddar cheese if I want a cheesier product.
