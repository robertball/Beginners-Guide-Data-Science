Ingredients:
For the dough:
100 ml (2/5 cup OR 7 tbsp) whole milk, warm (38 C / 100 F)
250 g (2 cups) all-purpose flour
6 g (3/5 tbsp) cake yeast
2.5 tbsp granulated sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1 egg yolk
1/2 tbsp butter
For the filling:
200 g (7 oz) (2% fat) cottage cheese, well drained
1.5 tbsp (10%) sour cream
4.5 tbsp granulated sugar
1 egg yolk
3 tbsp raisins (optional)
Also:
2 tbsp flour for shaping the buns
1 tbsp egg white, lightly whisked

Directions:
In a glass, combine 3 tbsp milk, 1 tsp flour and 1/2 tsp sugar. Add the yeast and set aside for 10 minutes or until foaming at the top.
Sift 1/2 of the flour into a large (2L/2 quart) bowl. Add 4 tbsp milk and the yeast mixture, mix with a spoon into a sticky lump. Cover the bowl, wrap in a thick towel and leave in a warm (25..30 C / 75..85 F) place for 1 hour.
Wrap cottage cheese in a muslin square and twist to drain any excess liquid. For a fluffier texture it is usually enough to squeeze until the liquid stops trickling and starts dripping.
With the back of a spoon, rub the drained cottage cheese through a fine mesh sieve into a mixing bowl. Add sour cream, sugar and egg yolk, mix well until smooth. Fold in raisins, if using. Cover and set aside.
After the dough has risen, add sugar, salt, butter and egg yolk. Sift about 2/3 of the remaining flour into the bowl, mix well, gradually adding flour until it's no longer sticky. Save any leftover flour for shaping the buns. Knead the dough.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 8 equal parts; roll each one into a ball and place on the parchment paper, spacing them widely and well away from the edge of the sheet. Place two tall glasses in the middle of the sheet, cover the whole thing with a large thick towel, and leave in a warm place for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 180 C (350 F). Remove the towel. Dip a (1.5 - 2 inch wide) bottom of a glass or bottle in flour and press in the middle of each bun to form a hollow. Fill the hollows densely with cottage cheese mixture, slightly heaping. Recover with the towel and leave for 15 minutes.
Remove the towel and glasses. Brush the tops (dough and filling) with egg white. Bake on upper-middle position for 20 minutes or until golden brown.
