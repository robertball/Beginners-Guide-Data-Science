Ingredients:
2 tomatoes, halved
1 small peach, halved and pitted
1/2 white onion, halved
1/2 red bell pepper, halved
1/2 yellow bell pepper, halved
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Arrange tomatoes, peach, onion, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and garlic on a baking sheet.
Broil in the preheated oven until vegetables and peach are browned and tender and tomato skins can be peeled off, 10 to 15 minutes.
Dice the roasted vegetable and peach and transfer to a bowl. Add lemon juice, sugar, salt, and parsley; toss to coat. Refrigerate at least 1 hour for flavors to blend.

Description: 
This recipe is a little different, in a good way! I was experimenting in my kitchen and thought it was good enough to share! It's super easy to make and is just as easy to modify. 

I purposely omitted the broiler temperature, as broiling is done to taste.
