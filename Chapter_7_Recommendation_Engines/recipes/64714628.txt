Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup butter (melted)
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups chopped Snickers candy bars (approx. 30 Snickers Minis), divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Mix sugar, cocoa powder, flour, salt and baking powder in a mixing bowl.
Mix butter, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl, then add wet ingredients to the bowl of dry ingredients and stir until well mixed.
Pour half the brownie batter into a greased 9"x9" baking pan, then top with half of the chopped Snickers.  Spread remaining brownie batter over the top of the Snickers, covering the candy completely.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until edges are brown and center is set.
Remove brownies from the oven, and spread the remaining Snickers chunks over the top, lightly pressing them into the top of the brownie while it's still hot.
Let brownie cool completely before cutting.

Description: 
These brownies are a great way to use up some of that leftover Halloween candy!  These are made with Snickers bars, but you can substitute Milky Way candy bars for a different variation.
