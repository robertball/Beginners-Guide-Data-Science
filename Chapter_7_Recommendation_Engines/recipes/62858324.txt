Ingredients:
1 midsized zucchini
1-2 tomatoes
2-3 tablespoons mayo
½ cup of finely chopped dill
1 clove of garlic (optional)
1 egg
2 tablespoons of flour
1 tablespoon of water
1 pinch of salt
1 pinch of black pepper
5 tablespoons cooking oil

Directions:
Wash zucchini, cut it in full round slices (they shouldn’t be thick- about ¼ inches) and rub in salt and pepper, let it stand for 5 minutes. Take an egg, mix it with some water and pour the flour on a separate dish. Set a frying pan on medium gas and add some cooking oil, then: cover zucchini slice in flour then put it in egg-water mixture and put frying. Repeat with all the slices. Fry zucchini from both sides until soft inside and has golden brown crust.
Meanwhile: wash your tomato, dill. Cut tomato in slices or half round slices (depending on how big the tomato is). Mix mayo with finely chopped dill and add a little bit of salt.( you may add pressed garlic to the sauce, if you wish). Put the fried zucchini on the plate, cover it with mayo dill sauce and put the tomato slice on top. Repeat with all the zucchini slices. You may put zucchini in layers , as I did.
The dish should be served warm and may be served cold; is good with mashed potato and meat, or with salad, also the dish is very good when cold; in sandwiches.
Enjoy!
