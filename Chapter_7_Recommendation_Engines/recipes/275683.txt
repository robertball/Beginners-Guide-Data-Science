Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups white sugar
1 cup canola oil
4 large eggs
2 cups canned pumpkin
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup baking cocoa
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 10x15-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Combine sugar, oil, and eggs in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until combined. Mix in pumpkin.
Sift together flour, cocoa, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add to the pumpkin mixture until just combined; do not overmix. Stir in chocolate chips. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool completely.
