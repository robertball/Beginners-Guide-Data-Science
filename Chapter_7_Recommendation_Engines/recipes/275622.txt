Ingredients:
cooking spray (such as Baker's JoyÂ®)
3 1/4 cups white whole wheat flour
2 cups lightly packed dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups pumpkin puree
1 1/8 cups unsweetened applesauce
1 cup chilled apple cider
4 large eggs, slightly beaten
3/4 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 24 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Combine flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl. Add pumpkin, applesauce, apple cider, eggs, raisins, and walnuts. Stir until thoroughly combined. Divide batter evenly between the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, or the center springs back when touched, 22 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I enjoy tweaking my old recipes by substituting more wholesome ingredients and reducing the amount of sugar. I think you'll enjoy this apple cider version of pumpkin muffins as much as I do. Serve with cream cheese, if desired.
