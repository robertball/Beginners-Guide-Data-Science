Ingredients:
2 10" flour tortillas
2 TBSP cream cheese
6 Fresh Jalapenos
1/2 cup shredded mexican blend cheese
1 TBSP butter
3-4 tortilla chips, crushed (optional)

Directions:
1.  Wearing gloves, slice the tops off of the jalapenos, and discard tops. Slice jalapenos in half lengthwise, remove ribs and seeds, rinse, and place cut-side down on foil-lined baking sheet.
2. Place under broiler for 10-15 mins, until skins are bubbly and black. Remove from oven and immediately place peppers in ziploc bag on counter. Allow peppers to steam in bag on counter for about 20 mins, this will loosen the skins. After 20 mins, remove from bag--skins should pull right off. Set peeled roasted jalapenos aside.
3. Lightly butter one side of each tortilla, and spread other side with about 1 TBSP cream cheese. Chop roasted jalapenos, and sprinkle half on each tortilla, on top of cream cheese. Add half of the shredded cheese to each tortilla, and top with crushed tortilla chips if desired. Fold each tortilla in half, so butter is on outside.
4. Heat a skillet over medium-low, and add one quesadilla. Heat until golden brown on outside, flipping once.

Description: 
This is a great  alternative to deep fried jalapeno poppers that's much easier to make, and healthier too. 
It's a perfect light meatless monday dinner for one.
