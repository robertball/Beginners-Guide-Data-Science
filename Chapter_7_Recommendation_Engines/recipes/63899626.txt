Ingredients:
1 lb. sausage
2 c. Bisquick
12 ox. grated cheddar

Directions:
It is easier to do this if the sausage is at room temperature and with your hands.  Mix all ingredients in a large bowl until they are completely incorporated into a dough.  There should be no dry bisquick areas when done.  Form into golf ball sized balls.  Place on a foil liked cookie sheet for easier clean up.  Bake for 20 min at 350.
