Ingredients:
1/2 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries in syrup, slightly thawed
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 fresh peaches, peeled and halved
5 teaspoons brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon butter or margarine

Directions:
In a blender or food processor, process raspberries and lemon juice until pureed. Strain and discard seeds. Cover and chill. Place the peach halves, cut side up, on a large piece of heavy-duty foil (about 18 in. x 12 in). Combine brown sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle into peach centers. Sprinkle with vanilla; dot with butter. Fold foil over peaches and seal. Grill over medium-hot coals for 15 minutes or until heated through. To serve, spoon the raspberry sauce over peaches.

Description: 
This unusual dessert is as pretty as it is delicious. Topped with brown sugar and cinnamon, the peaches come off the grill sweet and spicy. The raspberry sauce adds a refreshing touch. -Nancy Johnson, Connersville, Indiana
