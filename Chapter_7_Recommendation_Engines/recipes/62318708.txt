Ingredients:
1 (28 oz) pkg potatoes O'Brien, thawed
1 cup sour cream
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 can cream of celery soup, undiluted
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack & Colby cheese
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
3 Tbs margarine, melted
1 cup dry bread crumbs, plain

Directions:
Preheate oven to 350 F.
In a large bowl, mix all ingredients, except the potatoes.  Mix very well.
Add potatoes, mixing gently so as not to mash them.
Turn mixture into a lightly greased 9X9 baking dish.(Refrigerate at this step, if you are making this ahead of time.)
In a small bowl (or the saucepan you used to melt the margarine), toss the bread crumbs in the melted butter to coat them.  Set aside.
Bake at 350 F for about 15 minutes, then add buttered bread crumbs evenly over the top, and return to the oven.
Continue baking about 20 minutes, or until crumb topping is golden brown and potatoes are done.
Allow to rest at least 5 minutes before serving.
