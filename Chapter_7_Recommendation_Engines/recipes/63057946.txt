Ingredients:
16 oz cooked, shredded chicken breast
2 cups marinara sauce, plus more for serving (see my favorite recipe here)
12 egg roll wrappers (each 7 inches squared)
2 cups baby spinach leaves
1 cup mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lay the egg roll wrappers on a clean work surface. Layer each with a few leaves of spinach, then chicken, followed by sauce, mozzarella and parmesan.
Lightly brush two adjacent sides of the wrapper with water and fold the upper left corner downward, covering the filling, and press to seal on the bottom right corner. Press to seal each of the sides. Repeat with remaining wraps.
Place all 6 filled wraps on a greased wire rack set over a cookie sheet, coat each in cooking spray or a light brushing of olive oil, and bake for about 12 minutes, or until the edges begin to turn a golden brown.
Serve with warmed marinara sauce for dipping.
