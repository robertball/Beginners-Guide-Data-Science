Ingredients:
2 cups white whole wheat flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
2 tablespoons ground flax meal
17 fluid ounces orange juice
1 teaspoon orange extract

Directions:
Whisk flour, baking powder, and flax meal together in a bowl; stir orange juice and orange extract into flour mixture until batter is well-combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat, or an electric griddle to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
Oh the things I was out of when I created this dish: no milk and no eggs, but we wanted pancakes, dangit! I used flax meal to make up for the protein in the egg (a vegan trick) and substituted orange juice for milk. The result was pancakes bursting with citrus flavor. It's a new favorite in our house! Serve with butter and/or maple syrup.
