Description: 
this recipe has way less fat than traditional recipes, by just editing some of the main ingredients. I use light brown sugar to make the to make this an albino cookie. THIS RECIPE TASTE THE SAME AS THE REGULAR, OR EVEN BETTER. Don't let the liquid butter spray fool you, it tastes just like butter
