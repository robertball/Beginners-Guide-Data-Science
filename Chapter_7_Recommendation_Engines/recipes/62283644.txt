Ingredients:
* 4 salmon fillets, 4-5 oz each
* Salt and pepper
* 5 tablespoons packed brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard
* 2 tablespoons smooth Dijon mustard
* 4 slices apple wood smoked bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Remove any pin bones from four salmon fillets. Pat fillets dry and season on both sides with salt and pepper. Spray a baking sheet with non stick spray and lay out salmon skin side down.
In a small bowl mix brown sugar and mustards to form a paste. Smear paste on the top side of the salmon fillets.
Cut bacon in half crosswise. Lay bacon strips on the length of the salmon fillets over the brown sugar paste, overlapping if necessary. Place salmon in oven and cook for about 10 minutes until salmon has cooked through and bacon is crispy. Serve immediately.
