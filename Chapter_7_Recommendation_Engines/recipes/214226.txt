Description: 
Real chicken stock is made over a period of 3 to 4 hours to develop the flavor, so here it goes. You can buy chicken bones from your local butcher (mine charges a mere 49 cents a pound) or you can buy whole chickens and cut them up yourself, freeze the edible parts, and use the carcasses for the stock.
