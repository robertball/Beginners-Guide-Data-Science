Ingredients:
8 lb Pork Butt
1/2 cup Tim's Best Dry Rub Ever (All Recipes)
2 - 12 oz stout/amber/wheat beer
2 - 12 oz hard cider

Directions:
Trim Pork Butt , but leave a layer of fat on one side
Rub entire Butt with Tim's Rub
Cover with clear wrap and sit in fridge for 3 days
Prepare Smoker with favorite wood chips or pellets at 230 degrees
Place Butt on middle rack with fat side facing  up
Put 12 oz beer and 12 oz of cider in drip pan
I use a Meater.com meat thermometer to monitor temp... Works great!
At 4 hours add another 12 oz beer and 12 oz of cider in drip pan
At 4 hours add more pellets or wood chips
At 7 hours remove drip pan and pour dripping into a bowl (Save)
When Butt reaches 196, remove Butt from smoker and cover with with foil
This will take 8 to 10 hours
Let rest for one hour
Pull pork . I use Bear Paws (Acehardware.com)
Pour as much of the drippings over pulled pork that you'd prefer
Enjoy!!
