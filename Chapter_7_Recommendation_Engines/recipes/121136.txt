Description: 
'My mother had surgery a few years back in spring, so my two sisters and I were challenged to prepare dishes like this that would keep well and still taste great as leftovers,' recalls Nicole LeCroy of Nashville, Tennessee.    'Mom got her appetite back when she tried this cool and crunch asparagus that gets a flavor boost from soy sauce. It's a nice accompaniment to chicken, roast beef or ham.'
