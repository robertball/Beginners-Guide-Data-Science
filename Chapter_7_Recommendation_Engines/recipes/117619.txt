Description: 
'My newly married daughter didn't want to ask her mother-in-law for the recipe to her husband's favorite meal,' writes Donna Moyer of Grants Pass, Oregon. 'Instead, she asked me to help her figure out a recipe. Together, we cam up with this delicious stick-to-the-ribs casserole. It's so easy, today my 4-year-old granddaughter stuffs the pasta shells herself!'
