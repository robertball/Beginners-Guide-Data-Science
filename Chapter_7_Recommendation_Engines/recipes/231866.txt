Description: 
My mother-in-law, Sathiabama Sriharan, came from London to the Upper East Side of New York City to help me take care of my first child when she was 2.5 months old. Not only did she teach me about what to expect each week in raising a growing baby, she helped me shed the baby weight and eat healthy as a nursing mother by preparing healthy, quick, and easy meals. Hope you try it and like it. Enjoy and bon appetite!
