Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups chicken broth or 2 1/2 cups water
salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil or 2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 cups white rice , preferably medium-grain
1 small white onion , chopped
2 garlic cloves , peeled and finely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
3 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley , for garnish

Directions:
In small saucepan or microwave oven, heat broth or water until steaming.
Stir in about 3/4 teaspoon salt if using salted broth, 1 1/2 teaspoons if using unsalted broth or water.
Cover and keep warm.
In medium (3-quart) saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, heat the oil over medium heat.
When hot, add raw rice and onion and stir regularly until grains have turned from translucent to milky-white, 4-5 minutes.
Add garlic and stir for a few seconds, until fragrant. Do not let grains brown.
Add the warm liquid and lime juice, stir thoroughly, scraping down any grains that are clinging to the side of the pan.
Cover and cook over the lowest heat for 15 minutes--temperature should be low enough that only the slightest hint of steam escapes lid.
Remove pan from heat and let stand covered for 5 minutes.
Uncover and test a grain of rice: if still a little hard, re-cover pan and set over low heat for about 5 min.; if rice has absorbed all liquid and is completely dry, sprinkle on 2 tablespoons water before returning to heat.
When rice is done, sprinkle on parsley and gently fluff with fork to release steam and stop the cooking.
