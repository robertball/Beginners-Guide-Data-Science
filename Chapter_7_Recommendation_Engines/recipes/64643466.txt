Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 large eggs
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
1 large yellow onion
4 cloves garlic minced
3/4 cup raw corn kernels
3 cups broccoli florets cup sliced
2/3 sliced roasted bell peppers
1 1/2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
4 cups cooked jasmine rice
3 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari

Directions:
Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat. Season the beaten eggs with salt and pepper, then pour the eggs into the hot oil. Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to move the eggs around the skillet until they're cooked through but still soft, about 30 seconds. Transfer the cooked eggs to a plate and set aside.
Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is starting to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds more. Add the corn, broccoli, and bell pepper, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the vegetables are warmed through, about 2 minutes more. Add the rice vinegar and stir, scraping off anything stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the cooked egg and stir it around to break it into bite-sized pieces. Add the rice and soy sauce and cook, stirring often, until thoroughly mixed and heated through, about 3 minutes more. Serve immediately.
