This Texas-style chili uses chunks of jackfruit mixed with beans and veggies to create a hearty meal even meat lovers will enjoy. Using bitters, liquid smoke, and dark soy sauce creates a smooth flavor similar to Worcestershire sauce; while stout beer and coffee lend a depth of flavor and body associated with traditional chili con carne. This recipe makes a full 7 quarts, good for your get-together or freeze some. Serve with cheese, sour cream, and avocado if desired.
