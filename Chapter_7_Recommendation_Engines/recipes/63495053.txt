Ingredients:
1 15oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 cup vinegar
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp salt

Directions:
Place chickpeas and vinegar in saucepan. Bring to a boil. Turn off heat and let sit for 30 mins.
Preheat over to 400F.
Drain chickpeas well. Line roasting pan with tin foil. Place chickpeas on pan and drizzle with oil, then sprinkle with salt. Toss to coat.
Roast chickpeas for 30 minutes, giving the pan a shake every 8-10 minutes for even browning.
Remove from oven and place chickpeas on plate lined with paper towel to absorb excess oil. Serve warm or at room temp.
