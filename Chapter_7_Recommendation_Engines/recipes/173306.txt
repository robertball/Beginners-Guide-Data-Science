Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 envelope Fleischmann's® RapidRise Yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoons Spice Islands® Minced Onion
1 tablespoon Spice Islands® Parsley
1 1/2 teaspoons Spice Islands Poultry Seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups water
1 tablespoon butter OR margarine
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon Spice Islands® Minced Onion
1/2 teaspoon Spice Islands® Celery Seed

Directions:
Combine 1 cup all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, undissolved yeast, sugar, 2 tablespoons onions, parsley, poultry seasoning and salt in a large bowl. Heat water and butter until very warm (120 to 130 degrees F). Stir into flour mixture.
Beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in remaining all-purpose flour to make stiff batter.

Let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Brush beaten egg on loaf. Sprinkle with remaining onion and celery seed.
