Description: 
This is a CRAZY yet really good cake I made one night because I had some leftover butter cream cream cheese frosting and extra baking chips. I mixed chocolate and butterscotch chips into a lemon cake mix with 3 eggs and applesauce (instead of the oil). Man was it good. Light, fruity, and so so delicious.
