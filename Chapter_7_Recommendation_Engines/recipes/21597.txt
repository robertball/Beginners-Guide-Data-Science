Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 2 quart baking dish.
Spoon about one heaping quarter cup of pie filling evenly down the center of each tortilla.  Sprinkle with cinnamon; roll up, tucking in edges; and place seam side down in prepared dish.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar and water.  Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; reduce heat and simmer 3 minutes.  Pour sauce over enchiladas and let stand 30 minutes.
