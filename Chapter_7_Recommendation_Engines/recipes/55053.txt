Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 (4 ounce) fillets salmon
4 ounces Brie cheese, sliced
1 teaspoon butter
2 mangos - peeled, seeded, and diced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the olive oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium high heat, and sear the salmon about 4 minutes on each side.
Top salmon with Brie cheese. Cover skillet, and place in the preheated oven. Bake 15 minutes, or until the salmon is easily flaked with a fork.
In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and simmer the mangos 15 minutes, or until soft and smooth. Serve over the cooked salmon.

Description: 
Delicate salmon is topped with a wonderful combination of mango and Brie cheese. The best part is that the Brie bakes with the salmon. Wonderful with a spinach salad and fresh bread.
