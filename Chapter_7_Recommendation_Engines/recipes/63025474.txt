Description: 
We have made this every Christmas morning since I found it about 16 years ago in the local newspaper.  (I wish I knew who to give credit to for it.)  It is a make the night before recipe, then set it out to rise the next morning, and bake. Easy to adapt with the amount of spices or adding nuts.  Very easy for a busy Christmas morning.
