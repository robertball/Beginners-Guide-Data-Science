Description: 
We tried a couple of recipes; this was voted the best!  The Gruyere gives a very sweet and nutty flavour to the fondue, the sharp Cheddar makes it tangy, and the Emmentaler blends it all.  Cooking the flour first helps the mixture not to be so pasty and powdery.Modified from: Best Formula Three-Cheese Fondue
