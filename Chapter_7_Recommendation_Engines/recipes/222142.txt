Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup non-fat plain yogurt
1 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3 cups quick cooking oats
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup carrots, shredded
1/4 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Beat butter, yogurt, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs one at a time. Beat in vanilla extract. Mix in flour and baking soda until just incorporated. Fold in quick oats, walnuts, chocolate chips, carrots, and cranberries. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Carrots are not normally found in cookies, but they act as a great natural sweetener while adding moisture. I also replaced half the chocolate chips with dried cranberries. These cookies are tasty and a good source of fiber.
