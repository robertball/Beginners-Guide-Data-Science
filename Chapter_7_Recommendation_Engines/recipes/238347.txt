Ingredients:
1 cup pecan halves
1 cup almonds
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons flax seeds
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup quick-cooking oats
1 cup pitted and quartered dates
5 tablespoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread pecans and almonds onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until nuts are toasted and fragrant, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven and decrease oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Combine flour, flax seeds, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a food processor; pulse a few times. Add pecans and almonds to flour mixture; pulse until nuts are coarsely chopped. Add oats and dates to flour-nut mixture; pulse just until combined.
Whisk maple syrup and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; pour over oat mixture and pulse just until combined. Spread oat mixture into an 8-inch square pan.
Bake in the preheated oven lightly browned, about 25 minutes; cool to room temperature.

Description: 
I needed something perfect for skiing and hiking; something compact, healthy, and most of all, delicious. This is it! I brought this along to a hike with my friends, and everyone asked for the recipe. It's perfect for air travel or any sport. You can use other nuts and you can add other dried fruits, but always use at least a full cup of dates. When cool, cut into 18 little squares.
