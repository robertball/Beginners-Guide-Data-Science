Mom's Brownie Mix Recipe with Variations
This mix makes great brownies. But that’s not allI use it for a brownie base in several different cheesecake recipes as well as for cookies. The flavors of brownies that can be made with this mix are limited only by your imagination! The Basic Mix makes four 8 x 8” or 9 x 9” size batches of brownies.
4 cups sugar
1 1/4 cups cocoa
2 teaspoons salt
2 cups flour
1 1/4 cups shortening

Directions:
Mix sugar, cocoa, salt, and flour in bowl; cut in shortening until the size of small peas. Store in an airtight container in a cool dry place. Keeps 4-6 months.
Basic Brownies
If you like cake-like brownies, use a little more mix; if you like gooey brownies, use a little less. Both ways, the mix makes great brownies Quick!
In a bowl mix 2 1/2 cups brownie mix, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 1/3 cup chopped nuts (optional). Spread in an 8 x 8 inch square pan (or 9 x 9 inch square pan if you like your brownies thinner). Bake at 350° for about 20 minutes, or until set. Do not overcook. - above if making regular BROWNIES ONLY
Mix the brownie mix, chili powder, and cinnamon; stir in the vanilla, eggs, and walnuts. Pour the batter into a greased and floured or parchment-lined 9” square baking pan. Bake in a preheated 350° oven 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted halfway from the edge to the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven to a cooling rack.
Mix the powdered sugar and chili powder. Sprinkle over the brownies. Cut into squares and serve warm or cool.
