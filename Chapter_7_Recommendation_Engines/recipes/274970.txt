Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 pounds cubed beef stew meat
1 onion, diced
4 cups beef broth
4 russet potatoes, peeled and diced
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained (such as Hatch®)
2 teaspoons Mexican oregano
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon dried chipotle chile powder
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Heat olive oil and sear beef cubes until browned on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove browned beef from the pot and set aside. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Turn off Saute function.
Return beef to the pot with onions. Mix in beef broth, potatoes, diced tomatoes, green chiles, oregano, garlic, cumin, chipotle chile powder, chili powder, and pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 45 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes.
