Description: 
Here is a family favorite recipe that while it sounds strange is very tasty and has won over everyone who has tried it. It was born out of wartime in the Philippines we believe.  Typically served for breakfast with butter or margarine.  Not a sweet waffle.  Best in a standard waffle iron (not Belgian).
