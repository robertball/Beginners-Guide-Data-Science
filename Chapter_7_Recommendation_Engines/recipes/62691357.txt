1 egg
1/2 cup vanilla yogurt

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a muffin tin or line with paper liners.
In a medium bowl whisk together flours, sugar, baking powder and salt.
In a small bowl whisk together the egg, yogurt, oil and extracts.
Pour wet ingredients into dry, add in nuts and cherries, and mix just until combined.
