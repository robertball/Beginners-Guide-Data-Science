Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts, trimmed and quartered
1/4 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter in skillet over medium-high heat. Add the Brussels sprouts and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sprouts are browned in spots, about 5 minutes.
Pour in the cream, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the sprouts are tender and easily pierced with a fork, 30 to 35 minutes. The cream will have reduced in volume, and will have taken on a creamy beige color. Remove the lid, and stir in the lemon juice. Allow the sprouts to simmer a few minutes more until the cream thickens and coats the sprouts. Season to taste with additional salt and lemon juice before serving.

Description: 
Brussels sprouts tend to turn people off. This way of cooking them brings out their nutty flavor and has made the most passionate haters at my last Thanksgiving say, at the very least, that this is the best brussels sprouts have tasted. The first time I made this, it ended up being dinner - not a side dish!
