Ingredients:
6-8 chicken thighs, bone in, skin on
2 onions, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
2  tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling
1 Tablespoon Herbes de Provence
1 ½  teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed
½  teaspoon ground black pepper, more as needed
Cooking sherry or sherry vinegar, to taste
4  thyme sprigs

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together Herbes de Provence, garlic, oil, salt and pepper. Add chicken thighs and toss to coat. Cover  and chill for at least 2 hours, and up to overnight.
Heat oven to 425 degrees. Spread onions out on a rimmed baking sheet, drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss well. Clear spaces on the baking pan, then place chicken pieces in the cleared spaces so the onions surround the chicken. Place thyme  sprigs over onions and chicken.
Roast, tossing the onions after 15 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and the onions tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Place pan under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes at the end of cooking to brown.
Place chicken on a platter. Spoon onions around the chicken, drizzle with sherry wine or vinegar, and more salt and pepper if needed, and serve.
