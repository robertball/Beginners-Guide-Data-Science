Chicken, Sweet Potato, and Black Bean Stew Recipe

Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, diced
4 cups chicken broth
1 14-oz. can fire roasted diced tomatoes
1 15-oz. can black beans, or 1.5 cups cooked black beans, drained and rinsed
1 heaping teaspoon smoked paprika
salt and pepper, to taste
2 small-medium sweet potatoes, diced (about 3-4 cups total)
2 cups cooked shredded chicken (such as rotisserie or spatchcocked chicken)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish

Directions:
Saute the onion in olive oil in a large pot over medium high heat until soft (2-3 minutes)
Add the chicken broth, tomatoes, beans, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil.
Turn the heat to low and add the sweet potatoes. Simmer until sweet potatoes are cooked through, approximately 15 minutes (depending on how small you cut them).
Use a potato masher (or immersion blender) to mash the soup a few times to thicken it up a bit.
Turn the heat off and add the chicken and parsley. Stir and allow to sit for a minute or so to make sure the chicken gets warmed through.
Serve hot, garnished with extra fresh parsley.
Freezes well, and can be served over brown rice if you want it to go further.
