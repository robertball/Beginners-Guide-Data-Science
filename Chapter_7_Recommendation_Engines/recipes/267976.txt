Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
1 cup margarine
1 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon butter-flavored extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup butterscotch chips
1 cup crispy rice cereal (such as Rice KrispiesÂ®)
1/2 cup candied fruit, cut into small pieces
1/2 cup shredded coconut

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine brown sugar, white sugar, margarine, and oil in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add egg, salt, baking soda, cream of tartar, vanilla extract, and butter flavor; mix well. Add flour and mix well. Stir in oats, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, rice cereal, candied fruit, and coconut; cookie dough will be difficult to stir.
Drop cookie dough onto baking sheets using spoons or a small ice cream scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and lightly golden, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
This is my grandmother's cookie recipe, which we lovingly call kitchen sink cookies because they have everything but the kitchen sink in them. They are a delicious holiday treat, and do very well when frozen.
