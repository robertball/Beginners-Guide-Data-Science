Brown sausage, drain off grease.  Mix together all ingredients except tomato sauce, the 1/4 t. oregano, basil and pie crust.  Pour into pie crust.  Bake at 450 for 7 minutes; reduce to 325 for another 20 minutes.  Mix tomato sauce, oregano, and basil.  Spread over top, return to oven 5 minutes to heat sauce.  Let stand 5 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
This is basically a cross between pizza and quiche.  My husband, who thinks real men don't eat quiche, loves it.  Even the grandkids who think pizza should be a seperate food group ask for it over and over.
