Ingredients:
4 cups chicken broth, divided
1 1/2 tbsp cornstarch
2 tbsp chopped chives
1/8 tsp ground ginger
2 tsp instant granulated chicken bouillon
1/4 tsp salt
2 tsp soy sauce
1 1/2 tsp crushed garlic
2 eggs
1 egg yolk

Directions:
In a small bowl combine 3/4 cup of chicken broth and cornstarch. Blend well, leaving no lumps. Set aside.
In a saucepan, pour the rest of the chicken broth. Stir in chives, ground ginger, bouillon, salt, soy sauce and crushed garlic. Bring to a rolling boil.
In a small bowl whisk together eggs and egg yolk.
Using a skimmer(for Halloween appearance only) remove anything floating before adding your egg mixture to the broth. This is for cosmetic looks only for the Halloween Theme, otherwise skip this step.
Using a fork, whisk it around in a circular motion in the broth and drizzle the egg mixture in slowly. Egg mixture will cook as it is whisked in.
Whisk in cornstarch mixture to broth until desired consistentcy.
Serve immediately. Enjoy.
