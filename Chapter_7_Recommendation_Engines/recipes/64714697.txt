Ingredients:
1 box Spice Cake (prepare batter according to directions on  the box)
1 med carrot - finely grated
2 oz raisins - finely chopped
1/4 cup pecans - finely chopped
1/4 cup well drained crushed pineapple
8 oz softened cream cheese
1/4 stick softened butter (salted or unsalted, use real butter)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cup powered sugar (adjust to desired sweetness)
1 cup cool whip
1 small box pineapple flavored jello (prepared according to pkg directions)
Additional chopped nuts (toasted/sugared) if desired

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Prepare two pans with cupcake paper (16)
Prepare cake mix in a large bowl according to directions on the box.
Add carrot, nuts, raisins and crushed pineapple, beat well to combine.
Fill cupcakes to 3/4 full and bake 12 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
Prepare Jello - Using a large meat fork, poke cupcake, drizzling each with 1 TBL Jello so it is absorbed into the middle.
Place cupcakes in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to cool.
Prepare frosting - Beat cream cheese and softened butter until fluffy, add vanilla extract and powdered sugar, beat until smooth and creamy.
Gently beat in cool whip until combined.
Frost chilled cupcakes and top with additional sugared or plain chopped pecans.
Frosting will firm up nicely after cupcakes are frosted and chilled.   Store in the fridge and serve cupcakes cold.
