Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package queso fresco
1 (16 ounce) jar salsa
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
2 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)

Directions:
Slice queso fresco in half horizontally, creating 2 rounds. Transfer to a shallow microwave-safe baking dish.
Spread salsa evenly over queso fresco and pour any residual juices around the dish for the queso fresco to marinate in. Top with cilantro, jalapeno, and hot sauce. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate, at least 2 hours, preferably longer.
Heat queso fresco in the microwave until slightly softened, about 3 minutes.

Description: 
On a recent trip to the local Costco®, I ended up purchasing a huge thing of queso fresco, or Mexican white cheese. Not sure what to do with it, I created this modified dip that goes perfectly with any Mexican-themed meal! It's so ridiculously easy, and looks much more refined than classic chile con queso. Serve with tortilla chips and enjoy! Reheat as needed.
