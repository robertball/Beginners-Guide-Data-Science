Ingredients:
5 boneless pork chops, cut into cubes
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 pound bacon, diced
1 large onion, diced
3 tablespoons paprika
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
1 (14.5 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Toss pork and flour together in a bowl to coat.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat until enough fat renders to coat the bottom of the pan; add pork and onion. Cook and stir the mixture until completely browned, about 10 minutes. Drain about half the grease from the skillet and return to heat.
Season mixture with paprika; stir. Pour beer over the pork mixture, bring to a simmer, and cook 5 minutes.
Spread sauerkraut into the bottom of a casserole dish. Pour pork mixture over the sauerkraut. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.
