Ingredients:
1 Taco Seasoning Mix package
1/2 cup of cream cheese
1/2 cup of sour cream
1 cup of chopped iceberg lettuce
1/2 cup of chopped tomatoes
Salsa
Guacamole
Dab of sour cream
1/4 cup of shredded cheese
About 40-70 Tortilla chips (depending on plate size)

Directions:
Mix one package of taco seasoning mix with the cream cheese and the sour cream until blended.
Spread the mixture onto a large flat plate, coating the bottom entirely.
Add chopped lettuce and chopped tomatoes to make a small mound on the plate in the center.
Add some salsa to one side of the pile, however much you'd like.
Add some guacamole to the other side, however much you'd like.
Add dab of sour cream in remaining spot at center.
Sprinkle shredded cheese over top of center mound.
Ring the plate with the tortilla chips, so that the chips wind up encircling the veggie mound in the center - typically about 70 chips, depending on plate size. Overlap the chips as you place them so there's plenty to scoop up the yummy on the plate.
Then dig in and enjoy!

Description: 
This originates from Malibu Jacks -- an Ottawa, Ontario restaurant that was extremely popular during the 1980s. The dish was ordered so frequently that I bugged the chef for the recipe. It's so simple and yet so amazingly good. Your guests will gobble it up, and it takes little to no effort on your part.
