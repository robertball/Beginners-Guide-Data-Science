Description: 
This is a traditional Hungarian vegetable and meat dish that has been 'Americanized' into a thick stew. My grandmother used to make this for me.  This is the easiest recipe to make, even if you're not a good cook! It has quick preparation time and it is liked by everyone who tries it!
