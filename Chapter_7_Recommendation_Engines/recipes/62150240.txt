Ingredients:
1 lb box of ziti
1 lb ground beef
1 bag shredded mozerella cheese
1 jar of pasta sauce
2-3 cloves of garlic, smashed
2 Tsp Italian Seasoning
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat over to 350 degrees and grease large oval corningware (if you don't have corningware you can use a 9x13 pan)
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil then add ziti for 8-10 minutes until pasta is al dente. Drain well when done cooking.
While pasta is cooking take a large skillet and brown ground beef with crushed garlic, Italian Seasoning, and salt and pepper.  Cook until beef is no longer pink.
In the corningware combine pasta, sauce, and beef, sprinkling cheese throughout.  Top with remaining chese.
Cover and bake for 20 minutes.  Uncover and continue to bake to let cheese get crispy for about another 5-10 minutes.
