Snicker bar pie Recipe

Ingredients:
Okay, stick with us for a minute: instead of unwrapping a Snickers bar and shoving it in your face (no judgement, sometimes we’re pretty sure we’ve just inhaled it…), set it aside, along with five other bars and chop them up into small pieces. It’s fine if you sneak a bite or two at this point. Cream cheese, peanut butter, powdered sugar and cool whip make up the body of the pie, and let us tell you, this stuff is dangerously good. If you can make it this far, pour your filling into a graham cracker crust and pop it in the fridge to let it set. The finished result is seriously addictive and you’ll be so happy you waited it out to enjoy a slice or three!
