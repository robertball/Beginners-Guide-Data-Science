Ingredients:
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder
1 pinch salt
1 large egg
3/4 cup whole milk
1/4 cup Baileys Original Irish Cream
2 teaspoons Irish whiskey
1 tablespoon butter
36 doughnut holes, halved
1/2 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate
6 tablespoons Baileys Original Irish Cream
Confectioners' sugar, for dusting

Directions:
Set a fine-mesh strainer over a medium bowl. In a medium saucepan, whisk the granulated sugar, cornstarch, espresso, and salt. Whisk in the egg, then the milk and 1/4 cup Baileys. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, about 4 minutes. Boil 1 minute, whisking constantly. Remove from heat.
Whisk in the whiskey and butter. Pour into the prepared strainer and, using a heat-proof silicone spatula, press on the custard to strain. Scrape down the bottom of the strainer into the custard. Press a sheet of plastic wrap directly on top of the custard. Refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours.
Transfer the custard to a pastry bag or a resealable freezer bag. If using a freezer bag, snip off the tip of 1 corner. Pipe a large dollop of custard onto half of the doughnut holes; top with the remaining halves.
In a small bowl, microwave the chocolate in 15-second bursts until melted and smooth, about 1 minute. Whisk in the remaining 6 tablespoons Baileys for the chocolate sauce. Divide the doughnuts among 8 plates. Drizzle with the chocolate sauce. Dust with confectioners' sugar.

Description: 
This super-easy sweet uses store-bought doughnut holes instead of homemade cream puffs. Stuff them with a Baileys-infused pastry cream, then wait for the compliments to roll in! PS â€“ they taste really great frozen!
