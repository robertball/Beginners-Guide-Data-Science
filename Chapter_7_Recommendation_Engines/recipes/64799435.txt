Ingredients:
2  tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1  tablespoon soy sauce
1  tablespoon dark brown sugar
½  teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
½  clove garlic, cut into paper-thin slices
1  teaspoon freshly grated ginger
2  tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for the carrots
10  medium carrots, peeled, trimmed and cut in half lengthwise
Salt
1  green onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, rosemary, garlic and ginger until combined. Whisk in 2 tablespoons oil so dressing emulsifies; set aside.
Heat grill to low.
Coat carrots with oil and season with salt.
Grill carrots, covered, turning as needed to prevent burning, until nicely charred and fork tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
When carrots come off the grill, toss them immediately in the prepared dressing. Once they're coated, use tongs to transfer the carrots to a serving platter and garnish with green onion. Drizzle a few spoonfuls of the remaining dressing over the top.

Description: 
These glazed carrots are caramelized and sweetened from a quick hot turn on the grill, then tossed in a salty dressing of soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, garlic and ginger. Turning the carrots often and moving them around on the grill keeps them from burning. If your carrots are starting to burn but aren't yet cooked through, transfer them to a baking sheet and finish cooking in a 400-degree oven.
