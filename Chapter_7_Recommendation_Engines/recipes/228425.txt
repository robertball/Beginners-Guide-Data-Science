Ingredients:
1 ½ pounds ground chicken
3 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
1 tablespoon Kalamata-olive tapenade
2 ounces crumbled feta cheese
1 ½ tablespoons crushed garlic
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
⅛ tablespoon coarse-ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix chicken, oregano, tapenade, feta cheese, and garlic together in a bowl; form into 4 patties. Season burgers with salt and pepper.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate with olive oil.
Cook patties until charred on bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip the burgers and finish cooking, refraining from flattening with your spatula until no longer pink in the middle, about 5 minutes more. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels before serving.

Description: 
These Mediterranean-inspired chicken patties are a light contrast to your beef burgers and complement any backyard get-together. If you use all-breast meat, add some olive oil to the meat mixture so they don't dry out. You could also use 2 tablespoons chopped Kalamata olives instead of the tapenade. Use tzatziki sauce on top to stay with the Mediterranean flavors or use a sesame dressing with shredded lettuce for an Asian taste.
