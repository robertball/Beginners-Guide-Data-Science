Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1  onion, chopped
1 cup white wine
1 quart almond milk
2 teaspoons vegetarian chicken-flavored bouillon granules
1 small head broccoli, chopped
½ cup coarsely chopped walnuts
1 tablespoon honey
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons cornstarch
¼ cup cold water
3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, stir in the garlic and onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the wine, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook for 3 minutes, then add the almond milk, and return to a simmer.
Once the almond milk is simmering, stir in the bouillon and broccoli. Cook until the broccoli is very tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the walnuts, honey, and soy sauce. Dissolve the cornstarch in the water, then stir into the simmering soup until thickened. Serve sprinkled with sesame seeds.
