Ingredients:
1 recipe natural pizza dough (purchased or homemade & ready to bake)
1 cup Newman's Own All-Natural Alfredo Sauce
1 pkg. organic garlic-herb vinagrette mix or ranch mix
3 Cups shredded mozzeralla cheese
3/4 Cups (or more to taste) fresh grated parmesan cheese
Favorite Toppings: ex. pepperoni, ham, tomatoes, etc.

Directions:
Bring dough to room temperature.  Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.  Stretch dough with hands into a large circle (14 inch diameter) and place on a pizza stone or large round pizza pan.  Mix alfredo sauce with dressing mix and spread on pizza dough.  Top with toppings.  Shred the two cheeses and sprinkle over the top of the toppings and sauce.  Bake for 15 - 20 minutes, or until the cheese begins to turn slightly golden and the crust is browning.  Check after 10 minutes for bubbles in the crust and pop with a fork if necessary.
