Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups evaporated milk
2/3 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup fine dry bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon allspice
Dash pepper
1 pound ground round
2 teaspoons butter
2 beef bouillon cubes
1 cup boiling water
1/2 cup cold water
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup evaporated milk
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Combine 2/3 cup evaporated milk, onion, crumbs, salt, allspice and pepper. Add meat; mix well, chill. Shape meat mixture into 1-in. balls. In large skillet, brown meatballs in butter. Dissolve bouillon cubes in boiling water; pour over meatballs and bring to boil over medium heat. Cover; simmer for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, blend together cold water and flour. Remove meatballs from skillet, skim fat from pan juices and reserve juices. Stir 1 cup evaporated milk and flour/water mixture into pan juices in skillet; cook, uncovered, over low heat, stirring until sauce thickens. Return meatballs to skillet. Stir in lemon juice. Serve with cooked noodles that have been tossed with poppy seeds and butter.

Description: 
I'm a 'Svenska flicka' (Swedish girl) from northwest Iowa, where many Swedes settled at the turn of the century.     This recipe was given to me by a Swedish friend. It's obviously a 20th century version of a 19th century favorite, since back then they didn't have bouillon cubes or evaporated milk!    I think you'll agree that these modern-day 'Kottbullar' are very tasty.
