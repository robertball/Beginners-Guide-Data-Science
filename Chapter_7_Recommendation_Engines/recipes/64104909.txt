Ingredients:
For the shrimp:
1 1/2 pound of large shrimp peeled and deveined with tails left on.
2 teaspoons of Old Bay Seasoning
1 teaspoon of dried Marjoram or Parsley flakes
1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon of black ground pepper
For the basting sauce:
1/3 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons of Sweet Chili sauce such as Mae Ploy
2 minced scallions (green part)
1 to 2 teaspoons of Sriracha sauce to taste
1 teaspoon of fresh squeezed lime juice

Directions:
Place peeled and deveined shrimp in a bowl, add the Old Bay, garlic powder, Parsley or Marjoram, and ground pepper.
Mix well to coat shrimp, cover and place in refrigerator for at least 20 minutes.
For the sauce mix in small bowl, mayonnaise, Sweet chili sauce, scallions, Sriracha sauce, and lime juice well, set aside.
If using wood skewers it is best to soak in water for at least 20 minutes.
Mix half the basting sauce into the shrimp coating well, skewer shrimp onto skewers.
Heat grill to medium heat, spray well with cooking spray before placing shrimp on the grill.
Cook shrimp skewers over direct medium heat turning about 2- 3 minutes, Shrimp is done as soon as skin turns pink and no longer shows any of the original color. Smaller shrimp will cook faster and all shrimp continues to cook after you remove it. Remove and immediately apply the rest of the basting sauce. Serve over green salad or pasta or as an appetizer.
