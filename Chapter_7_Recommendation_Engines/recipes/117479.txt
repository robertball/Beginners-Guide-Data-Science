Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, melted and cooled

4 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, oil, chocolate and vanilla. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to chocolate mixture and beat until smooth. Stir in chocolate chips. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or until easy to handle.
Working with 1 cup of dough at a time, shape into 1-in. balls. Roll in confectioners' sugar. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until set. Remove to wire racks to cool.

Ever sine I was a teen, I've been surprising my family with my baking experiments. These fudgy cookies are among my successes. I make several batches for friends around Christmastime.
