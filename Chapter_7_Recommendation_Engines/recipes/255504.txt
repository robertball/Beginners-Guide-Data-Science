Ingredients:
1 Red Delicious apple
3 tablespoons peanut butter
15 mini marshmallows, or more as needed

Directions:
Slice apple into 4 sections and cut away stem and seeds. Etch the skin of each section with a paring knife to form "lips." Carve out some of the skin to form a "mouth" between the "lips."
Spread peanut butter into the "mouth." Arrange the mini marshmallows on top of the peanut butter to form the "teeth." Bite into the fleshly part of the apple so the "teeth" are facing outward.

Description: 
A goofy snack for you or your little ones. These apples look like wax teeth! Many of the ingredients can be substituted for allergies or preference. Great snack for Halloween or April Fool's Day!
