Ingredients:
30 dandelion flowers
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/2 cup lager-style beer, or more if needed
2 cups canola oil for frying

Directions:
Wash dandelions under cool running water and dry on paper towels. Remove the green tendrils behind each flower.
Mix flour, curry powder, and salt together in a bowl or measuring cup. Beat egg in a bowl; stir in flour mixture until smooth. Add beer to mixture until batter is similar to runny pancake batter. Add more beer if batter is too thick.
Heat oil in a small saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). If you don't have a thermometer, heat the oil until it begins to shimmer.
Dip dandelion flowers in the batter and gently drop in the hot oil, working in batches. Fry flowers until golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer cooked flowers to crumpled paper towels or on a wire rack; serve warm.
