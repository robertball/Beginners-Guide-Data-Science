Ingredients:
8 cups shortening for frying
4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons shortening
1 cup water
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Heat 8 cups shortening in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in 2 tablespoons shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually stir in water just until dough pulls together. Divide dough into 4 pieces and form each piece into a ball. Roll the balls into 8 inch diameter circles. Cut each one into 8 wedges. In a large bowl, mix together the cinnamon and sugar. Set aside.
Fry the wedges until they puff up and turn light brown. Drain briefly, roll in the cinnamon sugar and serve hot.
