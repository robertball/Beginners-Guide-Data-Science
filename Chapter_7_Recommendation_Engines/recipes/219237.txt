Ingredients:
PAM® Olive Oil No-Stick Cooking Spray
1 pound frozen bread dough
1 (28 ounce) can Hunt's® Whole Peeled Plum Tomatoes, drained
2 tablespoons yellow cornmeal
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced, patted dry with paper towels
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Fresh cracked black pepper
1 (2/3 ounce) package fresh basil, leaves torn

Directions:
Spray medium bowl with cooking spray; add frozen dough. Spray dough with cooking spray. Loosely cover bowl with plastic wrap. Place on counter for 4 to 5 hours or until dough doubles in size. (Time will vary depending on temperature of kitchen). Punch down dough.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place tomatoes in large strainer or colander placed in sink. Break tomatoes into bite-size chunks by hand. Continue draining tomatoes while working with dough.
Spray two 12-inch pizza pans with cooking spray. Lightly sprinkle each with cornmeal; set aside. Cut dough in half. Dust work surface lightly with flour. Roll each piece into a 10-inch circle. Place each on a prepared pizza pan.
Place tomato pieces evenly over both pieces of dough leaving about 1/2-inch of edge clear. Top each pizza equally with sliced mozzarella. Drizzle lightly with olive oil then season with fresh pepper.
Place each pan on separate racks in oven. Bake 15 minutes; remove from oven. Quickly sprinkle each evenly with torn basil leaves. Rotate position of pizzas in oven. Bake another 5 to 10 minutes or until crust is golden brown on top AND bottom. Cut each pizza into 8 slices.
