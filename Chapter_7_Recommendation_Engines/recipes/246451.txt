Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup ground flax seeds
1/2 cup hemp seeds
1/3 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 over-ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup blue agave nectar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine oats, flax seeds, hemp seeds, whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix bananas, butter, brown sugar, agave nectar, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir into oats mixture until batter is just mixed. Fold chocolate chips into batter. Drop batter by the spoonful onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are beginning to crisp, 8 to 10 minutes.
