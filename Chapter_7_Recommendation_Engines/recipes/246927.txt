Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package extra-firm tofu
1  onion, chopped
1  egg
½ cup bread crumbs
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 ¼ teaspoons chopped fresh basil
1 ¼ teaspoons chopped fresh marjoram
1 ¼ teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 ¼ teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
1 ¼ teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon hot sauce
½ teaspoon minced garlic
¼ cup olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for 15 minutes to drain excess water. Break tofu into small pieces and squeeze again to remove as much water as possible.
Place tofu in a large bowl. Add onion, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, Worcestershire sauce, basil, marjoram, rosemary, oregano, thyme, red pepper flakes, salt, hot sauce, and garlic; mix well with your hands until thoroughly combined.
Drizzle some olive oil on the lined baking sheet. Form tablespoonfuls of tofu mixture into balls and arrange in rows on the baking sheet. Drizzle remaining olive oil over meatballs.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and firm to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
They're the same as Italian meatballs but with tofu. I had to go through many recipes and cobble pieces together to get something that tasted normal. Olive oil helps them crisp up in the oven. I ate these with basic marinara and they were delicious.
