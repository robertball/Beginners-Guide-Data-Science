Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 (8 ounce) package squid ink tagliatelle
10 unshelled prawns, heads intact
1 onion, chopped, divided
4 cloves garlic, crushed, divided
2 slices fresh ginger
2 1/4 cups water
5 ounces clams
3 large dried chile peppers, chopped
1/2 cup white wine
2 large squid, sliced into rings
1/2 lemon
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup chopped fresh parsley
3 fresh chile peppers, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Cook tagliatelle at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
Peel and devein prawns, reserving heads for broth.
Combine prawn heads, half of the onion, 2 cloves garlic, and ginger in a pot; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in water; bring to a boil. Simmer until broth is reduced, about 15 minutes.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add remaining onion and 2 cloves garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in broth, clams, and dried chile peppers; simmer until most of the clams open. Add white wine and squid; cook until squid is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Stir cooked tagliatelle and prawns into the skillet. Cook until prawns are opaque, 1 to 2 minutes. Squeeze in lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Toss tagliatelle well and transfer to a serving dish. Garnish with parsley and fresh chile peppers.

Description: 
The squid ink tagliatelle is made from the ink of the squid which adds a strong flavor and black glow to the pasta. It works really well with seafood. Hence, in this recipe I have chosen to use squid, clams, and prawns and lots of chiles to spice up this dish.
