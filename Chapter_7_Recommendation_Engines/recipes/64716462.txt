Ingredients:
2 sheets frozen pastry dough (Lead Betters, French Picnic Gluten Free) thawed
5 Bartlett pears (ripe but firm), peeled, halved and cored
4 tbsp unsalted butter (room temperature), cubed
¼ cup granulated sugar
½ cup light brown sugar
2 tbsp finely chopped crystallized ginger
½ tsp ground cinnamon
¼ tsp pumpkin pie spice
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
Canola oil spray (for the tart pan)
2 tbsp butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 400°F.
Thinly slice the pears and add to a large bowl.
Spray your tart pan with the Canola Spray - this helps with sticking to the pan
Add the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, crystallized ginger, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and lemon juice. Toss until well combined.
Fill the pan with the pear mixture.
Place the other pastry sheet on top and crimp around the edges using a fork. Remove any excess dough from around the edges.
Use a fork to make small vent holes.
Place the tart on a cookie sheet and bake for 40 minutes.
Remove the tart from the oven, brush with the melted butter, and return to the oven for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown.
Remove from the oven and let stand for 10-15 minutes.
Pull the Tart out and let sit for 10 - 15 minutes
Slice and serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
Enjoy!
