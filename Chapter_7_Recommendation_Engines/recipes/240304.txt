Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup shortening

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Beat white sugar, shortening, and brown sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir pumpkin and eggs into creamed butter mixture; add flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and cloves and mix until dough is just combined. Fold oats into dough.
Drop dough by spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet.
