Ingredients:
1 cup of chopped nuts
1/2 cup of coconut
12 ounces of unsweetened chocolate chips
5 tablespoons of butter
3 eggs
1 cup of white sugar
1 teaspoon of cinnamon
2 teaspoons of baking powder
2 cups of all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat the oven at 350 degrees.   Spray a large cookie sheet (grease it).
In one bowl lightly mix around the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, 4 ounces of the chocolate chips, the coconut, and the nuts.
Place 3 ounces of chocolate chips and the butter into a microwave safe bowl and heat in 30 second incrememnts, stirring in between, until melted smooth.
In a large bowl beat the eggs and sugar lightly.
Stir chocolate/butter mix in a little at a time to the egg/sugar mixture.  When blended good add the dry ingredients, folding them in a cup at a time.
Divide the dough into half.  Shape into rectangle that is about 3 inches wide. Place on the cooking sheet and then do the same with the other.
Bake for 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven, but do not shut off the oven.  Allow the biscotti to cool for about 20 minutes, then cut with a sharp large knife diagonally into inch slices.
Place the slices on the sheet on their sides and bake for an additional 7 minutes on each side.
Remove from the oven and allow them to cool completely.
Melt remaining chocolate chips in the microwave in a shallow dish capable of dipping the biscotti into.  Place dipped biscotti slices onto wax paper until chocolate hardens.
