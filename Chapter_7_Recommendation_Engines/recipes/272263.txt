Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose einkorn flour
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar (optional)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
2 eggs
4 tablespoons melted butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed

Directions:
Sift einkorn flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together into a medium-sized bowl.
Whisk buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Slowly add flour mixture to buttermilk mixture and stir until just combined.
Heat a griddle over medium-high heat and grease with butter. Drop 1/4 cup batter onto the hot griddle and cook until bubbles form, the edges are dry, and pancake is brown on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
For that added boost einkorn flour contains higher levels of minerals and protein than typical wheat flours. Einkorn may be substituted cup-for-cup with regular whole wheat flour in some muffin, cake, and cookie recipes. Milk amount may need to be adjusted to the right consistency. Make extra pancakes to freeze for later. Feel free to add mix ins of your choice.
