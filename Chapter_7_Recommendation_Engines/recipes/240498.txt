Ingredients:
1 large whole-wheat tortilla
1 1/2 teaspoons coconut oil
1 cup chopped baby spinach leaves
1 oil-packed sun-dried tomato, chopped
2 eggs, beaten
1/3 cup feta cheese
1 tomato, diced

Directions:
Warm tortilla in a large skillet over medium heat.
Melt coconut oil in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Saute spinach and tomato in hot oil until spinach wilts, about 1 minute. Add eggs and scramble until almost set, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle feta cheese over eggs and continue cooking until cheese melts, about 1 minute more.
Transfer scrambled egg mixture to warm tortilla in the large skillet; top with diced tomato. Roll tortilla and leave in skillet long enough for wrap to hold its shape, about 30 seconds.

Description: 
This is my not-quite-as-healthy knock-off of a wrap at a popular coffee shop. Use butter instead of coconut oil if you want and try tomato- and basil-flavored feta cheese. To make it healthier use just egg whites and low-fat feta cheese.
