Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a 9x13 inch baking dish combine the soup, water, rice, okra, paprika and ground black pepper. Place the chicken on top of the rice mixture. Sprinkle with additional paprika and ground black pepper.

Description: 
The okra plant was brought to America's South by Ethiopian slaves. These green pods can be prepared in a variety of ways and, when cooked, give off a thick substance that thickens any liquid in which they are cooked. That makes this chicken rice casserole A-OKRAY!
