Ingredients:
2 pounds veal cutlets
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 pound fresh mushrooms, quartered
1/4 cup Marsala wine

Directions:
Place meat on a solid, level surface, or between sheets of waxed paper, and pound thinly with a mallet or moistened cleaver, using a glancing motion.
In shallow dish, combine flour and seasoning salt.  Dredge cutlets in flour mixture, and let rest 15 minutes on wire rack.
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt butter with oil.  Cook floured cutlets on both sides until brown.  Introduce mushrooms, reduce heat to low, cover and cook 10 minutes.
Pour in Marsala and simmer 5 minutes more, until veal is tender and sauce is hot.  Serve immediately.
