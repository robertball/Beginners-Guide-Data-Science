Ingredients:
1 cup water
2 1/2 cups bread flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons bread machine yeast
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Proof yeast by mixing sugar and 1 cup warm (100-115 degrees) water in bowl.  Add yeast, let stand in warm place for 5-10 minutes or until frothy.
For KitchenAid mixer, add bread flour and yeast mixture in mixing bowl.  Knead for 5-7 minutes in mixer.  Remove dough hook, cover work bowl and let sit 15 minutes.
Sprinkle salt evenly over the dough and knead until well incorporated.  Oil dough, set aside in warm place (85 degrees) until double in size.
Punch down dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll into a 16x12 inch rectangle.  Cut dough in half, creating two 8x12 inch rectangles. Roll up each half of dough tightly, beginning at 12 inch side, pounding out any air bubbles as you go. Roll gently back and forth to taper end. Place 3 inches apart on a greased cookie sheet. Make deep diagonal slashes across loaves every 2 inches, or make one lengthwise slash on each loaf. Cover, and let rise in a warm place for 30 to 40 minutes, or until doubled in bulk.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water; brush over tops of loaves.  For softer crust, use whole egg.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown.  For even more crunch on your crust, add 1/4 cup of water to the bottom of the stove at time of cooking.
