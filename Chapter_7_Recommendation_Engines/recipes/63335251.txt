Ingredients:
1 head garlic
Olive oil
2 pounds red potatoes, washed well and quartered
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
6 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup half and half

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Slice off the very top of the garlic head. Drizzle head with olive oil and wrap in foil. Place on a sheet tray and bake until tender and fragrant, roughly 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Squeeze out the cloves.  Place garlic and half and half in small blender and blend to break up the garlic.
Place potatoes in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Add lots of salt and bring to a boil. Cook until fork tender and drain. Mash the potatoes,  half and half and butter all together.  Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
