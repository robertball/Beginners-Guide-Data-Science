Ingredients:
1/2 lb bacon
1 lb loose breakfast sausage
3 cups of your favorite pancake batter (I use a mix)
2 cups milk
3 tbs flour
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
cook and drain meats, leave 1/2 of the sausage in frying pan.  mix together pancake batter to a slightly thicker consistency. Spray cooking spray to inside of 4 oven safe bowls pour batter evenly into bowls,  add bacon and sausage to batter stir it in a bit then bake at 350* 20-25 minutes until lightly browned. While the pancakes bake add 1 cup of the milk to the remaining sausage warm over a low heat until bubbly, add the flour to 1 cup of cold milk and whisk until smooth. when sausage and milk are bubbly add the milk/flour mix and stir until thickened. Tip pancakes out on a plate then top with sausage gravy.

I made these the other day and my family loved them! You can use fruits or meats as  a filler, it comes out great either way!
