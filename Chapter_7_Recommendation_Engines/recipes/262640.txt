Ingredients:
1/2 fresh pineapple
1 head cauliflower, broken into florets
1/2 cup broccoli florets, or to taste
1/4 cup cashews
1/4 red onion, roughly chopped
10 leaves Thai basil
1/2 lime
Himalayan pink salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon curry powder, or to taste
1/2 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced

Directions:
Cut pineapple flesh out of the shell. Dice flesh and transfer a bowl; add remaining juice. Reserve the empty pineapple shell.
Cut cauliflower florets into smaller pieces. Place 1/2 of the pieces into a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Transfer the 'caulirice' to the bowl with the pineapple. Repeat with remaining florets.
Pulse broccoli florets, cashews, onion, and basil in the food processor until finely chopped. Add to the pineapple-'caulirice' mixture. Squeeze in lime juice; add salt and curry and mix very well.
Spoon the 'caulirice' into the reserved pineapple shell. Top with avocado.

Description: 
Thai food is one of my favorites. The way they match all those amazing spices and flavors creates true masterpieces in the kitchen. I can barely contain my excitement when I walk into a Thai restaurant. The only downside? Well, many times when you leave the table, you can't help but feel a little heavy. 

But what if we could have a healthy pineapple fried rice that doesn't make us feel guilty or too full!?
 
This healthy recipe is completely raw, vegan, and gluten free.
