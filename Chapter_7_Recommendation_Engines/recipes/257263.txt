Ingredients:
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound ground chicken
1 egg
1 large avocado - halved, pitted, and peeled
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (8 ounce) container light sour cream
1 1/2 cups shredded cabbage
4 whole wheat Kaiser rolls
1 large tomato, sliced (optional)

Directions:
Mix chili powder, 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, cumin, minced garlic, and black pepper together in a small bowl.
Sprinkle 3/4 of the chili powder mixture over ground chicken in a large bowl. Add egg; mix well and shape into 4 patties.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill patties until browned and juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Mash avocado in a small bowl; season with garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
Mix remaining chili powder mixture, sour cream, and shredded cabbage together in a bowl to make coleslaw.
Toast Kaiser rolls lightly on the grill. Place chicken patties on the buns. Top each patty with mashed avocado, a large scoop of coleslaw, and sliced tomato.
