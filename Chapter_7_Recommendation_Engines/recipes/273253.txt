Ingredients:
1 pound mild sausage, removed from casings
1 medium onion, finely chopped
6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 (32 ounce) carton chicken broth
1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth
1 pound frozen cheese tortellini
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (10 ounce) package fresh spinach, coarsely chopped
10 leaves fresh basil, chopped
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or as needed

Directions:
Heat a large pot over medium-low heat. Cook sausage and onion until onion is soft and translucent, breaking up sausage as it cooks, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 to 2 minutes more.
Pour all chicken broth into the pot and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Add tortellini and cook 5 minutes more. Add tomatoes with juice and return to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer soup for 10 minutes.
Stir spinach into soup; it will look like too much, but it will wilt quickly. Add basil and red pepper flakes and simmer 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.
Pass Parmesan cheese at the table when you serve the soup.

Description: 
I got a similar recipe to this out of my local newspaper a long time ago. I've tweaked the recipe quite a bit over the years to suit our tastes. I hope this tortellini soup suits your family as well. Enjoy!
