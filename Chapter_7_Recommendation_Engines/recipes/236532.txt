Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 carrot, grated
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (28 ounce) can fire-roasted crushed tomatoes
2 cups tomato juice
1 (15 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, partially drained
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 bunch fresh basil, roughly chopped, or to taste

Directions:
Heat butter and olive oil together in a large pot over medium heat; saute onion and carrot until softened, 4 to 6 minutes. Add garlic, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Stir crushed tomatoes, tomato juice, and diced tomatoes into onion mixture; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat, stir sugar into tomato mixture, and simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes. Add cream and simmer until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add basil to soup and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Serve chunky or puree with an immersion blender.
