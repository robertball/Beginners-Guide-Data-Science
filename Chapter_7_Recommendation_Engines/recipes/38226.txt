Ingredients:
6 medium baking potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 cup chopped celery
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 cup mayonnaise, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon anise seed
salt and pepper to taste
4 hard-cooked eggs sliced, for garnish
1 dash ground paprika (optional)

Directions:
Place potatoes in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and cook until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat, drain, and run under cold water to cool. Drain well.
In a large bowl, mix together the potatoes, celery, onion, mayonnaise, and anise seed. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate until cold. Garnish with sliced hard-cooked eggs, and dust with paprika, if desired.

Description: 
This is the basic recipe my gram used to use to make her potato salad.  It sounds odd, but the anise is really good in this dish.
