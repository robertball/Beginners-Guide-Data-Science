Ingredients:
1/3 Cups light margarine (I prefer Country Crock Light)
2 Cup Fat Free Half and Half
1/2 Tsp cornstarch
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1 cup freshly grated parmesean cheese
1/2 cup prepared pesto

Directions:
1.) In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the half and half, and season with pepper.  Add 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch and mix well using a whisk. Cook 6 to 8 minutes, stirring often.
2.) Stir Parmesan cheese into cream sauce, stirring until thoroughly mixed. Blend in the pesto, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until thickened.  If adding fresh shrimp or any other meat, add now.
3.) Serve over your favorite pasta!

Description: 
This low fat version of a traditional cream sauce is a healthy alternative to high fat cream sauces.  It is creamy and full of flavor and compliments any pasta dish.  I usually add fresh shrimp to the sauce and serve with linguine to make a complete meal.  None of your guests will know that it's not a traditional heavy cream sauce!
