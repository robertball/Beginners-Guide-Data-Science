Ingredients:
1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon paprika
1 tsp. garlic powder  1/2 tsp seasoning salt
1-2 tsp Mrs. Dash
1 onion,chopped coarsely
3 carrots,chopped
3 potatoes, chopped
1/2 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Coarsely chop the onion, carrots, and potatoes and put them on the bottom of the crock pot.
Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Loosen the skin and season the chicken under the skin, with the spices. The paprika makes the chicken look better. Without it, the chicken stays pasty white. Pour the broth over the vegetables.
Set the slow cooker to High for 1 hour, then turn down to Low for about 4 to 5 hours, or until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear.
