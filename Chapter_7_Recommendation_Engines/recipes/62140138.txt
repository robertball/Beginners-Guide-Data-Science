Ingredients:
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper
2 large veal chops
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 onions, sliced lengthwise
1 Tbsp dried basil
1 tsp dried thyme
1 cup dry white wine
1 can artichokes, drained and halved
Black olives

Directions:
Season chops on both sides with salt and pepper. In skillet, heat half of the oil over medium/high heat. Brown one chop for about two minutes on each side. Transfer to a large shallow baking dish. Repeat with remaining oil and chop.
Add garlic, onions, basil and thyme to skillet and cook, stirring for about 10 minutes. Pour in wine and bring to a boil, scraping any brown bits from the pan. Spread mixture over chops.
Bake in 325 degree oven for 30 minutes. Sprinkle artichokes over top and baste with juices. Bake for 20-30 minutes longer or until veal is fork tender. Cut meat from bones and serve with vegetables and pan juices. Sprinkle with black olives.
