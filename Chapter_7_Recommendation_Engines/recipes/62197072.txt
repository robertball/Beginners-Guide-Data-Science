Description: 
This is a very old German Mennonite dish. The Mennonite faith is very close to the Amish faith, just not as strict. Keelki is a sauce and home made noodle dish. It is very adaptable to different tastes. Most Families took these old recipes and adapted them to suit their own tastes. Sometimes they would put ham, bacon or sausage and other times just the sauce and noodles. This was my MIL cookbook; she was born in 1896 in Henderson, Nebraska. The book is titled, Old Fashioned Recipes from the Ladies of the Mennnonite Brethern Church Missionary Scciety
