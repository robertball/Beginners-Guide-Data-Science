Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
1/2 (15 ounce) can cream of coconut
2 egg yolks
1 cinnamon stick
4 fluid ounces white rum (such as BacardiÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Combine coconut milk, condensed milk, evaporated milk, cream of coconut, egg yolks, and cinnamon stick in a blender; blend until cinnamon stick is broken into tiny bits.
Pour rum into a clean bottle. Add the milk and egg mixture and shake the bottle vigorously. Refrigerate; the coquito will thicken as it cools.

Description: 
Coquito is a Puerto Rican eggnog. I make mine with raw eggs, and, as for the rest of the ingredients, most come out of the pantry. I usually mix up a double batch of this to sip all through the holidays. Also, don't try to hide cheap rum in this drink. Cheap rum will curdle the milk.
