Ingredients:
5 cups all-purpose buttermilk baking mix
1 cup lemon-lime soda
1 cup sour cream
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread melted butter in a 13x9" baking pan to grease thoroughly.
Stir baking mix, lemon-lime soda, sour cream, and softened butter in a bowl until batter is well mixed then knead with hands until smooth. Batter will remain very sticky; you can add up to another cup of baking mix if desired.
Pinch off medium-size balls of dough (recipe should make 15 dough balls), roll into smooth balls and place in prepared baking pan, rolling to coat all sides with melted butter.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Let biscuits rest for about 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Incredibly simple yet outrageously tasty; sour cream makes them super moist and tender. Reminiscent of the original Kentucky Fried Chicken® biscuits - but much better! Great with all kinds of meals but they make an especially fantastic biscuits and gravy breakfast (or lunch or dinner...) :)Modified from: 7-Up® Soda Biscuits
