Ingredients:
1 large yam, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch thick slices
olive oil-flavored cooking spray
salt to taste
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Preheat a grill for high heat. When the grill is hot, lightly oil the grate. Coat the strips of yam with olive oil cooking spray and season with salt.
Arrange the yam strips on the grate crosswise so they don't fall through. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes per side, until tender and glazed. Serve with butter.

Description: 
My husband never liked yams until I served them to him this way.  The yams create their own glaze on the grill.  You can add more herbs and spices to suit your own taste.
