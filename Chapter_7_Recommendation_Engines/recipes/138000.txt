Description: 
My father believes in a condition called 'the gin meanies.' He invented this cocktail to satisfy his taste for gin, while allowing him to slightly dilute its effects with vodka. His passion for this concoction quickly spread to my friends, who have been known to throw parties solely to celebrate him and his martini.
