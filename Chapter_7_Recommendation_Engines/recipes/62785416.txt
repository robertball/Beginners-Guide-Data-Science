Season with Cajun seasoning, hot pepper sauce, salt and bay leaf.

About 30 minutes prior to sausage and beans being completed: Combine in a **saucepan or rice cooker(follow cooking instructions for rice cooker)**, rice, water and a pinch of salt.
**In a saucepan bring water to a full rolling boil for 2 minutes, then reduce heat to a simmer, and cook on low until water evaporates, depending of your stove around 15-18 minutes.
When rice is done, transfer rice to slow cooker and gently fold rice into sausage and bean mixture until well combined. Serve immediately.
