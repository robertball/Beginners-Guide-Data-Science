1 pint cherry tomatoes
2 yellow bell peppers, seeded and diced
1 cup unsalted sunflower seeds

Description: 
A fresh summer salad with lots of variety. You can substitute blue cheese for the goat's cheese, if you wish. I like to top this with a simple vinaigrette of fresh basil, apple cider vinegar and olive oil.
