Ingredients:
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup dry sherry
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons cornstarch
3/4 pound boneless pork loin, thinly sliced
3 cups SwansonÂ® Unsalted Chicken Broth
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 (10 ounce) package broccoli coleslaw mix
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
1 (6 ounce) package snow peas
2 cups hot steamed rice, or as needed
1 teaspoon sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, sherry, honey, and cornstarch together in a small bowl.  Add pork slices, coat evenly, and set aside.
Pour Swanson(R) Unsalted Chicken Broth into a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil, simmer until reduced to one and one half cups.  Set aside.
Heat oil in a large, non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Add ginger and garlic; stir until ginger and garlic are lightly browned and fragrant, 1 or 2 minutes.  Remove with slotted spoon and discard.
Transfer pork mixture to skillet over medium-high heat, constantly stirring and separating pork slices into a single layer, 3 or 4 minutes. Add reduced broth, stirring quickly to blend with the sauce, about 1 minute. Stir in chili garlic sauce and sesame oil. Add broccoli slaw, water chestnuts, and snow peas, stirring to coat with sauce. Cook to desired crispness, 1 or 2 more minutes.
Serve over hot steamed rice, and garnish with sesame seeds.
