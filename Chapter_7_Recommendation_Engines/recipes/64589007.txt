Ingredients:
4 boneless chicken thighs
1 head romaine lettuce, chopped
½ cup cherry or grape tomatoes, halved
½ red onion, thinly sliced
2 avocados, chopped
For the chicken marinade:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapeño pepper, minced
½ teaspoon chili powder
1 tablespoon honey
4 tablespoons lime juice
For the dressing:
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper
4 tablespoons lime juice

Directions:
1. In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients for the chicken marinade. Toss in the chicken thighs and marinate for at least one hour.
2. In a cast-iron skillet, cook chicken on high heat until there is a nice sear on the surface of the chicken, and the inside is no longer pink. Roughly four minutes each side. Set chicken aside.
3. Place chopped lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, and avocados in a large salad bowl. Slice cooked chicken thighs and add to the salad bowl.
4. In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients for the dressing.
5. Toss the salad with the dressing and serve immediately.
