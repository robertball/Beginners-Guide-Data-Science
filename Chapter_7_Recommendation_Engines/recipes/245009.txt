Ingredients:
6 beets, peeled
6 potatoes, peeled and diced
2 carrots, peeled and diced
1 parsley root with greens, peeled and diced, greens finely chopped
2 celery ribs, chopped
3 tablespoons white vinegar
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vegetable bouillon (such as Better Than BouillonÂ®) (optional)

Directions:
Place beets, potatoes, carrots, parsley root (greens reserved), celery, and vinegar in a large pot; season with salt and pepper. Pour enough water to cover vegetables into the pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.
Remove beets with a slotted spoon; set aside to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Grate beets when they are cool enough to handle.
Melt butter in a small saucepan, whisk in flour, and cook and stir until mixture is a light tan color, about 10 minutes; stir mixture into soup. Stir in grated beets and parsley root greens; bring to a simmer and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season soup with vegetable bouillon, salt, and pepper.

Description: 
This is my grandmother's recipe. We used to pick all the vegetables from her garden and make this, a nice soup for a cold winter's night. Serve with sour cream and snipped dill if desired.
