Ingredients:
2 medium thinly sliced onions
4 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped
1 green bellpepper, sliced or cubed
1 red bellpepper, sliced or cubed
1 can of crushed tomatoes + 100ml pureed tomato OR 4 chopped fresh tomatoes + 200ml pureed tomato
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup water
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground coriander
6 dashes of tobasco sauce, or to taste (optional)
4 eggs
chopped fresh parsley to garnish

Directions:
Heat oil in a heavy skillet.  Add onion and cook for 5 minutes or until soft on a medium-high heat - do not allow them to burn.  Add the bellpeppers, cover and cook for 8 minutes on a medium-low heat until the peppers are just tender.
Add garlic, tomatoes, pureed tomato and water, cover and cook for 8 - 10 minutes on a medium-low heat.  The sauce should be thickening by now.  Season with salt, pepper, cumin, coriander and tobasco sauce (if using) and lower the heat.
Make 4 indentations in the sauce and carefully add an egg to each one.  Cover and cook over a low heat for 8 minutes, or until the eggs have set.
If you would prefer your eggs scrambled,  mix the eggs with a fork before covering the pan.  Serve garnished with freshly chopped parsley.
