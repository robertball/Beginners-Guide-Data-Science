Ingredients:
3-4 pounds of cut-up chicken with skin
1 large bunch carrots, peeled
1 large head celery, trimmed
3 medium white onions, whole
1 parsnip (optional)
1 bag fine egg noodles
salt and pepper to taste
Add more whole veggies if you like, the more vegetables you add the better the final soup tastes!

Directions:
Put all ingredients except noodles, salt and pepper in a large pot.  Fill with water to cover, plus 2 inches.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 3 hours; skim off the fat that will float to the surface sometime in there.  Make noodles according to package directions.  Serve noodles, whole cooked veggies, and chicken pieces in the delicious home-made broth.
Try adding matzoh balls or won-tons for variation.
(This soup is very estimatory -- go with your gut feeling!  The only truly essential part is the long simmering of the chicken with the vegetables to make an amazing, rich broth... which is still low-fat if you remember to skim the soup.  Good, good food!)
