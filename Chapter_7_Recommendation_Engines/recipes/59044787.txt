Ingredients:
3 cups shredded roasted chicken
2 cups frozen vegetable medley
1 (4oz) can mushrooms
1/4 cup margarine
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 3/4 cups chicken broth (see footnote)
2/3 cup milk
2 (9 inch)  unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
In the saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and stir in flour, cook until the roux has a slightly nutty aroma to it.  Slowly whisk in chicken broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Stir in shredded chicken, vegetables and mushrooms.  Season with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Remove from heat and set aside.
Place the chicken mixture in bottom pie crust. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
By using leftover roasted chicken, it adds a richer chicken flavor to this recipe rather than just adding boiled chopped chicken breast.  You can also pick up a roasted chicken from your grocers deli if you don't have any leftovers on hand.Modified from: Chicken Pot Pie IX
