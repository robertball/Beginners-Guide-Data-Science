1/2 cup orange marmalade
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 tsp. ground ginger
4 oz. Italian salad dressing
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup water
1 Tbsp grated orange peel (I use the jar variety)
1/4 cup orange juice
Dash of garlic powder

Directions:
Remove flank steak from packaging and bang a fork over both sides making puncture holes
Combine the marinade ingredients
Place steak in large zip lock type plastic bag
Pour marinade mixture into bag (I like to cut back on dishes!)
Seal and marinade in fridge overnight; turn a couple of times
Grill on a high setting for about 15 minutes per side
Slice thinly against the grain

Description: 
This is my Big Daddy marinade for Flank Steak.  Marinade this overnight in an orange marmalade and soy sauce mixture and grill the next day.  Have pillows handy to protect heads when they faint!  Oh and it has about 5,000 calories!
