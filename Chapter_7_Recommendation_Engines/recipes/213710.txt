Ingredients:
1/2 cup Mexican crema, crema fresca
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
5 poblano peppers
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onions, thickly sliced
1 cup drained canned corn kernels

Directions:
Blend the crema, cream cheese, and chicken bouillon in a blender until smooth; set aside.
Place the peppers on a large griddle over medium-high heat. Roast until the skin blisters and turns black. Remove peppers from griddle and place in a plastic bag, allowing them to sweat for 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool. Peel and discard the outer skin of the peppers; halve length-wise and remove the seeds and veins. Slice into thick strips. Set aside.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook the onion in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir the corn into the onions, reduce the heat to medium, and cook another 5 minutes. Add the poblano strips to the saucepan. Pour the cream mixture over the vegetables and bring to a simmer; cook at a simmer until hot, about 5 minutes more.
