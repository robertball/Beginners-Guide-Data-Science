Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
1 teaspoon cornmeal
1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour
2/3 cup oat bran
1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1/2 cup steel-cut instant oats
1/3 cup wheat germ
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon brown sugar
2 cups buttermilk
2 eggs
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon molasses

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan with butter and dust with cornmeal.
Whisk whole wheat flour, oat bran, whole wheat pastry flour, oats, wheat germ, baking soda, salt, baking powder, and brown sugar together in a large bowl.
Whisk buttermilk, eggs, olive oil, and molasses together in a separate bowl. Add most of the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture; mix with a spoon. Continue adding buttermilk mixture until batter is the consistency of oatmeal.
Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Brush any of the remaining buttermilk mixture over the loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out mostly clean, about 1 hour. Invert onto a wire rack to cool.
