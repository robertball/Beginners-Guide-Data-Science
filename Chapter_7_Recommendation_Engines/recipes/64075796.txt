Ingredients:
8-10 chicken tenders, thawed
1/3 cup of "lemon pepper" marinade (Use your favorite, I use Walmarts own brand)
2 cups brown "Minute rice"
1 1/4 cup water

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees.
Brown the chicken tenders lightly in a hot oiled pan a few minutes per side and place them in 13"x9" baking dish.  ( you can skip this step but the chicken won't have color)
Pour the rice, "lemon pepper" marinade and water over the top.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until your rice is soft and chicken is cooked through.
