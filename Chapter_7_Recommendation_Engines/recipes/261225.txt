Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable broth
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 cup finely diced carrots
1/2 cup chopped green onions
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons light soy sauce
1 pinch sea salt, or to taste

Directions:
Stir vegetable broth and quinoa together in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until the liquid has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Refrigerate quinoa until cold, about 2 hours.
Heat olive oil and sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add carrots and green onions; cover and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add cooked quinoa and peas, and cook until heated through, 5 to 6 minutes. Push quinoa mixture to the sides of the skillet. Add eggs and stir until cooked, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir quinoa mixture back in. Pour in soy sauce and cook until just heated, about 1 minute. Add sea salt.
