Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups HERDEZ® Traditional Chipotle Mexican Cooking Sauce
1 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon vegetable oil or olive oil
1/2 onion, coarsely chopped
4 large cloves garlic
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and coarsely chopped
1 bunch coarsely chopped cilantro
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (2 pound) skirt steak or flank steak

Directions:
Place the Mexican Cooking Sauce, lime juice, vegetable oil, onion, garlic cloves, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, cumin, oregano, and salt in the container of a blender or food processor. Blend or pulse until mixture is smooth, and ingredients are finely incorporated into the sauce. Reserve 1/2 cup of the mixture for basting.
Trim steak of any visible fat. Place steak in a non-metallic baking dish or sealable plastic bag. Add marinade; turn meat to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight, turning meat one or more times while marinating.
Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Drain meat and discard marinade. Grill skirt steak about 7 minutes over direct heat with cover closed. Turn meat then baste meat with reserved sauce; grill with cover closed 3 minutes more or until cooked as desired. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare doneness.
Brush any remaining sauce on steak and serve with warm corn tortillas and salsa.

Description: 
Great for tacos or burritos, Herdez Cooking Sauce has made it so much easier for me to make my Chipotle Flank steak recipe. You can also use this marinade with chicken, pork or even shrimp.
