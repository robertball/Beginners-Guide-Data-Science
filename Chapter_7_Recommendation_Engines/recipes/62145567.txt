Ingredients:
3 lbs assorted pork chops, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/4 cup cooking oil
6 large tomatoes
3-6 jalepeno peppers
1 tsp salt
Flour tortillas

Directions:
Blend cored tomatoes, 2 jalepenos, and salt in food processor until slightly chunky.  Adjust peppers and salt to taste.  Mixture should be pretty spicy.  You've just made salsa.  Set aside.
Heat oil in large skillet over high heat.  When oil is hot add pork chops WITH BONES and cook uncovered until meat is crispy and caramel colored, until almost burned.  Remove bones and discard. (You may need to lower heat if necessary during cooking.)
Remove a little salsa for eating with chips.  Pour the remaining salsa over cooked pork chops and cook covered over low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
While meat is cooking, heat flour tortillas in skillet over medium-high heat, turning once.  Serve with pork chops and chile.
