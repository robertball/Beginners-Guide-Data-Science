Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter, divided
2 red potatoes, cut into cubes
2 red carrots, sliced
1 small yellow onion, chopped
6 Brussels sprouts, quartered, or to taste
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/4 cup fresh peas, shelled, or to taste
4 cloves garlic, halved
3 sprigs fresh thyme, chopped, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon sea salt, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste
1/4 cup water
2 cups fresh spinach

Directions:
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir potatoes and carrots in hot butter until browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir Brussels sprouts, bell pepper, peas, garlic, thyme, sea salt, and black pepper into the potato mixture; cook and stir until vegetables are slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
Pour water into the skillet; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
Stir remaining tablespoon butter and spinach into the vegetable mixture; toss to coat spinach in liquid. Cook until spinach wilts, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and adjust seasoning.
