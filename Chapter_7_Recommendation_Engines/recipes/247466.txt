Ingredients:
4  boneless chicken breasts, split and patted dry
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
3  yellow onions, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 ounces fresh porcini mushrooms, sliced
¾ cup chicken broth
¼ cup balsamic vinegar
3 tablespoons white wine

Directions:
Season chicken breasts with salt and black pepper.
Mix flour, salt, and black pepper together in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken in flour mixture, shaking off excess.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove chicken from the skillet. Add onions and garlic; saute until golden, about 3 minutes.
Return chicken to the skillet. Add porcini mushrooms; cook and stir until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, balsamic vinegar, and white wine. Cover and continue cooking over medium-low heat, turning chicken occasionally, until no longer pink in the center and coated with sauce, about 10 minutes.
