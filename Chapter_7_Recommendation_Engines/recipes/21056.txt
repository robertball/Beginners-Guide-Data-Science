Ingredients:
18 (1 ounce) slices white bread, cubed
8 ounces cooked ham, cubed
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups diced Swiss cheese
6 eggs
3 1/2 cups milk
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
2 cups crushed cornflakes cereal
1/2 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Line the bottom of the dish with half the bread cubes. Sprinkle with ham, Cheddar cheese, and Swiss cheese, and top with remaining bread. In a bowl, beat together the eggs, milk, and onion powder. Pour evenly over bread. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, blend the crushed cornflakes and melted butter. Spread evenly over the casserole.
Bake 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly and golden brown. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This ham and cheese casserole is very filling. It should be assembled and then refrigerated overnight. I usually make this Christmas Eve and serve it Christmas morning after we open our presents.
