Ingredients:
1 whole chicken
2 T lemon juice
2 T olive oil
1 t garlic powder
1 t oregano
1 t basil
1/2 t sweet paprika
1 t seasoned salt (e.g. Lawry's)

Directions:
Rub the chicken with the olive oil, then the lemon.
Season liberally with the garlic powder, oregano, basil, seasoned salt and paprika.
Place breast-side down into a dutch oven with a rack just big enough to fit the chicken, e.g. Le Creuset.
Add water to the pot so it comes up to just below the rack.
Cover, and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  Flip the chicken to breast-side up, and bake covered for another 40 minutes.
Uncover, and bake for another 30 minutes, until the skin is crispy.
Remove from the oven, and let cool for a few minutes.  Gravy can me made from the pan drippings and flour while the chicken rests.

I learned this from my husband, who used to work at a Greek restaurant.  Please note that the quantities are approximate - I've never measured, just season until it looks good!
