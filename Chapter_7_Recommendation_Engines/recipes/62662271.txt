Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups warm milk
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup (1/2 stick)butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups bread flour

Directions:
Pour milk into a large mixing bowl, and sprinkle yeast over the surface. Allow to rest for 5 minutes. Beat in the sugar, egg, 1/4 cup melted butter, and salt; blend thoroughly. Gradually stir in the bread flour to make a soft dough. Cover bowl, and set in a warm place until dough doubles in size, about 1 hour.
Punch down the dough, cover the bowl, and allow to rise again. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish, then break off 2 to 3 inch size pieces of dough, roll lightly into round shape, and place in prepared baking dish, edges touching. Repeat to make 18 dough balls. Cover and let rise until doubled in size.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake rolls in preheated oven until tops turn golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
