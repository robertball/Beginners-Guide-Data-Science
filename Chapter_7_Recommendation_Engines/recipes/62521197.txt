Ingredients:
1 Cup frozen cranberry juice cocktail concentrate, thawed
1/3 cup sugar
1 12-ounce package fresh or frozen cranberries, rinsed and drained. This recipe has not been tested using frozen cranberries.
1/2 cup dried cranberries (about 2 ounces)
3 Tablespoons orange marmalade
2 Tablespoon fresh orange juice
2 Teaspoons minced orange peel
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice (optional)

Directions:
Combine cranberry juice concentrate and sugar in heavy medium sauce pan. Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.
Add fresh and dried cranberries and cook until dried berries begin to soften and fresh berries begin to pop stirring often, about 7 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in orange marmalade, orange juice, orange peel.  And in the allspice if you are using it at this time as well.
Cool completely
Cover; chill until cold, about 2-4 hours. (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated). I always pour this into a beautiful glass dish after it has cooled before it goes into the refrigerator.  It has a beautiful look.
