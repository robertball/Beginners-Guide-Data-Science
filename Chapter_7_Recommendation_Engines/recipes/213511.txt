Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) filet mignon (beef tenderloin)
1 teaspoon olive oil
3 slices bacon, chopped
1 tablespoon butter
4 shallots, diced
1/4 cup half-and-half cream
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Brush the filets with olive oil, and cook on the preheated grill to desired doneness (about 4 minutes per side for medium rare). An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Set the steaks aside on a platter tented with aluminum foil to rest.
While the steaks are resting, prepare the sauce: cook and stir the chopped bacon in a small saucepan over medium heat until the bacon pieces are crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the butter and shallots, and cook and stir until the shallots are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes more.
Stir in the half-and-half, bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 8 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve over the steaks.
