Ingredients:
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 medium onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped
3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch strips
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon green curry paste
1 (15 ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup snow peas
1 cup chopped shiitake mushrooms
1 red bell pepper, cut into strips
1/2 cup bamboo shoots
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1/2 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Heat sesame oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet. Add onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; saute for 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir chicken into the hot skillet and season with salt and pepper. Mix in curry paste. Brown chicken on both sides, about 10 minutes total.
Pour in coconut milk, chicken broth, snow peas, mushrooms, red bell pepper, and bamboo shoots. Season with cinnamon and stir well. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low; let simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in basil and lemon juice.
