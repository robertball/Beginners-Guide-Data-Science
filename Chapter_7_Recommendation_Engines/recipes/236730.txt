Ingredients:
1 cup chopped pecans
4 teaspoons honey
1 cup brown sugar, divided
1 tablespoon white sugar
5 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
3 tablespoons butter, cut into cubes
2 tablespoons orange juice
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 (10.5 ounce) package miniature marshmallows

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Spread pecans out on a baking sheet and drizzle honey over pecans. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon brown sugar and white sugar over the top.
Cook pecans in the preheated oven until honey starts to bubble and nuts are fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove nuts from oven and reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Combine sweet potatoes, remaining brown sugar, cream, butter, orange juice, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Stir pecans into sweet potato mixture. Spread mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and top with marshmallows.
Bake casserole in the oven until marshmallows are golden brown, about 10 minutes.
