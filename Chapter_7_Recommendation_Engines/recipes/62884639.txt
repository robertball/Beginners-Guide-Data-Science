Ingredients:
Crust
2 cups graham crackers crumbs
3 tablespoons dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/16 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
Filling:
4 large egg yolks, room temperature
Finely grated rind of 1 lime
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 cup freshly squeezed lime juice

Directions:
Combine crumbs, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in a bowl. Stir in melted butter, or use your fingers to combine. Scrape mixture into a 9-inch glass pie plate. Press with fingers into the bottom and up the sides of pan. (Crust will be thick.) Refrigerate 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350F.
Combine egg yolks and lime rind in a mixing bowl. Beat with a mixer on high speed 8 minutes. (Don't skimp on the time—the eggs must be fluffy and well-aerated.) Gradually add condensed milk and continue beating until all the milk is added and the mixture is fluffy, 6 to 7 minutes. Reduce speed to low and slowly add lime juice, beating until evenly blended, about 2 minutes. Pour filling into chilled pie shell.
Bake about 12 minutes, until filling is set. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Refrigerate 3 hours before serving.
