Ingredients:
2 pounds red potatoes, cubed
Salt
1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar
5.3-ounce container fat-free plain Greek yogurt
1/4 cup low-fat sour cream
3 scallions, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons minced fresh dill
2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
Ground black pepper
4-ounce jar chopped pimentos
14-ounce can artichoke bottoms, drained
2 ribs celery, diced

Directions:
Place the potatoes in a large pot, then add enough cool water to cover by 1 inch. Add 1 teaspoon of salt, then bring to a boil and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until just tender when pierced with a fork. Drain the potatoes and spread out on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with the vinegar and set aside to cool.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the yogurt, sour cream, scallions, mustard, dill, thyme and garlic powder. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in the pimentos, artichoke bottoms and celery. Once the potatoes have cooled, gently stir in until thoroughly coated. Chill until ready to serve.
