Ingredients:
1/2 bunch asparagus, stemmed
2 roasted red pepper, diced
2 Tbsp. pesto (homemade or store-bought – either!)
1-2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
8 chicken breasts
4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
coarse salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the asparagus and boil for 1 minute. Immediately transfer to an ice bath to stop the cooking. Drain the water and dice the asparagus into small, bite-size, chunks.
In a medium bowl, combine the diced pepper, asparagus, pesto and mozzarella cheese. Toss in a pinch of salt and pepper and stir to combine.
Now, place the chicken breasts between two large pieces of plastic wrap. Pound them out thinly until they’re as even as possible.Divide the pepper mixture between the 8 chicken breasts, dollop at one end of the chicken, and then roll her up! Use a toothpick (or several) to keep them shut. Salt and pepper as desired.(For make-a-head directions either refrigerate or freeze at this point. Only freeze chicken that has not already been thawed and be sure to thaw before proceeding.)
Heat the oil on medium heat in a large skillet. Add the chicken rolls and gently sear on all sides until browned and lovely, about 7 minutes total.
Transfer the chicken to the oven and cook another 5 to 7 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. ~165 degrees F)
