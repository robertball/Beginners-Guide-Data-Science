Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked glutinous (sticky) white rice, rinsed
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk, divided
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon cornstarch
2 ripe mangoes, peeled and cubed

Directions:
Cover the rice with several inches of fresh water. Allow rice to stand for 30 minutes. Drain off water so that rice is covered by 1/4 inch of water.
Place the rice in a microwave oven, cover, and cook on High until the water has mostly absorbed but the rice is still wet, about 10 minutes; stir and cook until almost dry, an additional 4 minutes.
Mix half the coconut milk and 1 cup of sugar in a bowl, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Pour the mixture over the rice and stir to coat rice with the mixture. Cover and allow the rice to stand at room temperature for 20 minutes.
Pour the remaining 1/2 can of coconut milk into a saucepan and whisk in 1 tablespoon of sugar, salt, and cornstarch until smooth. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly, and simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
To serve, scoop the rice into individual serving bowls and top each serving with about 2 tablespoons of the coconut sauce and several pieces of mango.
