Ingredients:
One 2 to 2 1/2 lb boneless pork roast
3/4 cup dry red wine (I use burgundy wine)
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup catsup
1/4 cup vinegar
1/4 cup water
2 Tbps. olive oil
1 Tbsp. soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp dried basil
1/2 ground black pepper
1 1/2 Tbsp. cornstarch

Directions:
Place roast in a large plastic zip-lock bag set in a large, deep bowl.  For marinade, combine all ingredients except cornstarch.  Pour marinade over the roast in bowl.  Marinate in the refrigerator at least 8 hours or overnight.  Turn bag several times to distibute marinade evenly.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Take roast out of bag and place in a large, deep cassarole dish.  Pour marinade over roast.  Bake at 450 degrees for 10 minutes to sear the outside of the roast.  Turn oven down to 325 degrees.  Cook roast for an additional 1 1/2-2 hours, until meat thermometer reads 160 degrees.  Baste meat several times during cooking.  Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the roast.  When roast is done cooking, remove from oven and place on a separate dish and cover with foil to keep warm.  Meanwhile, pour marinade and drippings from roast in a medium saucepan.  Over medium-high heat, slowly whisk in cornstarch.  Cook and stir until gravy is bubbly and thick, about 5 minutes.  Slice roast and serve with hot gravy.

Description: 
This is my favorite company dish.  If I'm having a lot of people over, I'll either cook 2 roasts or double the recipe for a 5 lb roast.  Serve the roast with mashed potatoes, the roast drippings and marinade make an excellent gravy!  Thinly sliced, the leftovers are great for sandwiches the next day.
