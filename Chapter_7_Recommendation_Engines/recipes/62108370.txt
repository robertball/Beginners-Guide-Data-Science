Ingredients:
Green Sauce:
8-10 tomatillos (depending on their size)
1 pablano chile, peeled, seeds removed
1 jalapeno chile, seeds removed
4 cloves garlic
2 mint leaves
3/4 cup cilantro
1 medium white or mexican onion (roughly chopped)
salt to taste
Other ingredients:
oil, vegetable
12 white corn tortillas (cut into 3 strips)
3 cups chicken meat, cooked, shredded
3/4 cup Pepper Jack cheese (grated)
3/4 cup Monterey jack cheese (grated)

Directions:
Pre heat oven to 375.
Blend all sauce ingredients, until smooth. Transfer sauce to medium saucepan and bring to a light boil then turn heat down to a simmer stirring every few minutes until water has mostly evaporated from sauce. Once this is done add cooked chicken to the saucepan and cook for 5 minutes.
Heat vegetable oil in a large pan for deep frying and fry tortilla pieces until they begin to stiffen and lightly browned. Drain well on paper towels.
Add layer of tortilla pieces (now chips) to bottom of a 2 qt. casserole pan. Layer the sauce mixture then cheese mixture and repeat with tortillas until ingredients are gone or casserole pan is full.
Bake 375 for 30-35 minutes or until the top layer of cheese is golden and bubbly.
Let cool for 5 minutes and enjoy!
