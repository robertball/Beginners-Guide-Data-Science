Ingredients:
1 large pork butt or shoulder, about 7 to 9 pounds
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning or seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 medium onion, sliced
2 large bottles original bullseye bbq sauce

Directions:
Lay a large sheet of heavy duty foil in a roasting pan. Place pork roast on foil. Rub pork all over with garlic and seasonings. Arrange onion slices over top. Wrap foil around the pork roast. Bake at 350° for about 4 to 5 hours, to about 185° F. The meat should be falling apart. Let the roast cool a bit, then begin to shred with forks or chop, discarding as much of the excess fat as possible.
Transfer to a baking dish, coat with bbq sauce and warm in the oven. Serve.
