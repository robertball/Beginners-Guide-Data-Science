Ingredients:
Crust:
·	1 cup crushed chocolate crispy rice cereal
·	½ cup sweetened shredded coconut, toasted
·	6 tbs. chilled unsalted butter, cut into ½” pieces
·	¾ tsp. instant coffee crystals
Filling:
·	¼ cup sugar
·	5 tbs. instant coffee crystals
·	2 tbs. cornstarch
·	½ cup plus 2 tbs. whipping cream
·	6 tbs. cream of coconut
·	4 large egg yolks
Topping:
·	¾ cup chilled whipping cream
·	¼ cup cream of coconut
·	2 tbs. powdered sugar
·	Sweetened shredded coconut, toasted

Directions:
For crust, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine all crust ingredients in a food processor. Process until moist clumps form. Press dough into the bottom and up sides of a 9” diameter tart pan with a removable bottom. Freeze crust until firm, about 10 minutes. Place crust on a baking sheet. Bake crust for about 20 minutes, or until set. Cool completely.
Meanwhile, for filling, whisk sugar, coffee crystals, and cornstarch together until no cornstarch lumps remain. Gradually whisk in cream, then cream of coconut (coffee crystals will not dissolve completely). Mix in egg yolks. Whisk over medium heat until mixture thickens and boils, about 8 minutes. Cool in pan, whisking occasionally. Spread filling into prepared crust. Chill until cold, about 2 hours. Recipe can be made up to this point and refrigerated for 1 day.
For topping, beat whipping cream, cream of coconut, and powdered sugar in medium bowl until firm peaks form. Spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Pipe decoratively over filling. Sprinkle with toasted coconut. Refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.
