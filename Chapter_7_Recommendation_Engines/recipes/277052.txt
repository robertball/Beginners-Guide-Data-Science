Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, chopped
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1 pound pork sausage, diced (such as Winkler's Farmer Sausage)
1 cup diced cooked ham
1 cup diced onion
1 cup diced celery
1 cup diced red bell pepper
2 tablespoons crushed garlic
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon ground thyme
6 cups chicken broth
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
2 bay leaves
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHotÂ®)
1 cup uncooked white rice

Directions:
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chicken and saute until no longer pink and juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with Cajun seasoning. Set aside in a separate dish.
Cook and stir sausage in the same pot over medium-high heat until nicely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ham and saute 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer mixture to the chicken dish.
Heat remaining grease and olive oil as needed in the same pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, bell pepper, and garlic; saute until onion becomes translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining Cajun seasoning, paprika, oregano, basil, and thyme.
Pour in chicken broth and stir to mix. Add meat mixture. Add tomatoes, tomato soup, bay leaves, and hot sauce; mix thoroughly. Add rice slowly and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and let cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until rice is tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
