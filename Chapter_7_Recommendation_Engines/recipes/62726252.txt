Description: 
I was looking for a gluten free tater tot casserole and found and made this recipe (with my own modifications, of course).  After it was in the oven I realized that people were making this for breakfast and brunch!  My family LOVED this for dinner, and ate the whole pan!  Instead of breakfast sausage, I used 3 hot turkey sausages and 1/2 lb of turkey burger. The addition of veggies also made in more of a dinner faire.Modified from: Tater Tot Casserole I
