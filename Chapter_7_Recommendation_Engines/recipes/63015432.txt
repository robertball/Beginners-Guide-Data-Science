Ingredients:
3 Egg Whites, room temp., 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar, dollop of peppermint flavoring, 1 crushed candy cane, 1 6-oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, enough cream or evaporated milk with enough sugar to taste to make chocolate creamy but not too runny.

Directions:
Using double boiler, heat egg whites and sugar on low, just enough to incorporate sugar smoothly. Use whisk or fork. Add cream of tartar and peppermint flavoring. Beat until foamy. Add 2 boxes confectioner's sugar, or enough sugar to form peaks. Cunell (using 2 spoons to form football shapes). Place on aluminum foil-lined cookie sheet. Bake at 175 degrees for approximately 1 1/2 hours, or until crispy on the outside and softer in middle. Bake on bottom rack of oven. In the meantime, make ganache by melting chocolate in double boiler and adding cream or evaporated milk and sugar, to taste. Cool. When cookies are done, dip or brush with chocolate. (If chocolate thickens too much while cooling, add more cream or evaporated milk while reheating in double boiler.)Crush candy canes and sprinke on top. Refrigerate.
