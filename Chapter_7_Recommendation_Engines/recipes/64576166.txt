Ingredients:
1 Tbsp ground coriander
1 Tbsp ground turmeric
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp fennel seeds
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 Tbsp grated fresh ginger
1 head cauliflower, cut into floret
1 (19-ounce) can chickpeas, drained
1/2 sweet onion, sliced
Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper
Fresh cilantro sprigs, for garnish
Juice of 1/2 lime

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Toast the coriander, turmeric, cumin seeds, fennel seeds and cayenne in a dry skillet over high heat until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the oil into a large mixing bowl, and then add the toasted spices. Add the ginger, cauliflower, chickpeas and onions, and toss to coat everything evenly. Place on a sheet tray and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven until browned and the cauliflower is tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Serve with cilantro sprigs and finish with a squeeze of the fresh lime juice.
