Ingredients:
4 cups half-and-half cream, divided
6 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup sugar
3 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
4 cups whipping cream
6 cups lemon-lime soda, chilled
1 quart vanilla ice cream
1/2 cup chopped maraschino cherries

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine 2 cups half-and-half cream, eggs and sugar. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture reaches 160 degrees F or is thick enough to coat a metal spoon, about 9 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla, nutmeg if desired and remaining half-and-half. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
Pour into a punch bowl. Stir in whipping cream and soda. Top with scoops of ice cream and sprinkle with cherries. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Lemon-lime soda gives this rich beverage a delicate flavor. Even people who don't care for eggnog won't be able to resist a creamy glassful. It's a hit at our Christmas parties.                       --Lorrie Sexauer, DeSoto, Texas
