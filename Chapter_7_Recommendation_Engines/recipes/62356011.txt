Description: 
This is the best Alfredo sauce ever. This is several recipes combined into one. You can also add your choice of meat (chicken, shrimp or even crab). The closest OLIVE GARDEN is an hour away and I will never drive that far again just for Alfredo sauce. I promise this is the best sauce ever. Definitely a dish you would want to impress your guest with.
