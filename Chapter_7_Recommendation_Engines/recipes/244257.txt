Ingredients:
4 cups water, divided
2 cups chopped almonds
1 pinch salt
cooking spray
3 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup chocolate chips
2/3 cup olive oil
2/3 cup chia seeds
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup powdered peanut butter (such as PB2Â®)
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Combine 2 cup water, almonds, and 1 pinch salt together in a bowl; let sit for 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse 2 times.
Blend drained almonds and 2 cups water together in a blender until smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 11x15-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Mix flour, chocolate chips, olive oil, chia seeds, honey, powdered peanut butter, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and 2 teaspoons salt into almond mixture until dough is evenly combined. Transfer dough to the prepared baking dish, leveling dough with a fork or spatula.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and lightly browned, 30 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before cutting into bars.
