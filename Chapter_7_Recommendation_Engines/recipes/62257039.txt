Ingredients:
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon baking soda
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter
1 egg
1 cup raisins (optional)
DIANNE'S SUGGESTIONS:
Use the right butter.  I always use real unsalted butter in my cooking and baking.  It gives you much more control over the salt levels.  I’m pretty sensitive to salt and think it’s one of the most important ingredients in cooking, so I like to have control over it (you’ll find me mentioning salt in a lot of my reviews).  For the scones, “Joy of Cooking” says to cut the butter into little pieces and freeze for 20 minutes.
Use a food processor.  I got a KA food processor a few years ago and have used it for so many things  pesto, salad dressing, shredding cheese, scones….”Joy of Cooking” says to pulse the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, etc) with the frozen butter until crumbly and the largest pieces of butter are the size of peas.  Add the wet ingredients (sour cream and egg) and pulse just until the dough starts to clump together.
Experiment with flavors.  After this, I do my own thing.  I dump the dough out onto the counter and divide into two.  In one pile I add the fresh zest of one orange and ½ cup dried, sweetened cranberries.  In the other pile I add ½ Tbsp. cinnamon and ½ cup raisins.  Then I mix with my floured hands until just combined.  My favorite is the orange-cranberry, but people tell me they love the cinnamon-raisin version too, so I make both!

SUGGESTIONS CONTINUED:
Cut like a professional.  To get scones like you see in bakeries, I roll the dough out into 2 - 14”x4” logs (this is a very approximate measurement), ¾” thick.  Then I cut each log into 4 squares, then cut each square in half diagonally.  This will give you 16 wedges total.
Use an insulated cookie sheet.  I love my insulated cookie sheets and use them to bake everything from cookies to biscuits to scones!  The insulation has air pockets that keep the cookie sheet the same temperature as the oven, so the top and bottom of the scone bake at the same speed.  This way the bottom of the scone doesn’t brown too fast, before the top part of the scone is done baking.  Baking takes a little longer with insulated cookie sheets, so I usually bake the scones for 18 – 20 minutes.
Add a finishing touch.  You can brush the tops with egg whites before baking to get a shinier appearance.  I also like to make a simple powdered sugar glaze to drizzle on top.
DIRECTIONS START HERE
In a small bowl, blend the sour cream and baking soda, and set aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.
In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, cream of tartar, and salt. Cut in the butter. Stir the sour cream mixture and egg into the flour mixture until just moistened. Mix in the raisins. or falvor you would like to be, examples: dried cranberries and orange zest, cinnimon & rasins etc.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead briefly. Roll or pat dough into a 3/4 inch thick round. Cut into 12 wedges, and place them 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown on the bottom.
