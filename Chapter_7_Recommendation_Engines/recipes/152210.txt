Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
2 teaspoons lemon zest
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 egg yolk
2 cups pumpkin puree
3/4 cup vegetable oil
3 egg whites, beaten
1 apple - peeled, cored, and sliced
2 teaspoons white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch round cake pan.
Mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, cardamom, lemon zest, and ginger in a large bowl. Add the egg yolk, pumpkin puree, and oil; mix until smooth. Gently stir the egg whites into the batter; pour into prepared pan. Arrange the apple slices atop the batter; sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.
Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Allow to cool before serving.
