Ingredients:
4 very ripe bananas
1 ripe avocado
1/4 cup cocoa powder (unsalted!)

Directions:
Blend all ingredients in a blender until smooth. Pour into bowls and sprinkle some cocoa powder on top to garnish. Chill in refridgerator for at least an hour before eating - be patient! Time is needed for the pudding to develop its superior texture and flavor.
For a colder treat, use frozen banana slices instead and, after pureed, place your pudding in the freezer for 5 minutes before serving.
