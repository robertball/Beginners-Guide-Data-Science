Ingredients:
8 chicken breasts
12 oz jar apricot preserves
15 medium dried plums, pitted
1/3 cup olive oil
1 tbsp white vinegar
1/8 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
10 clove garlic, peeled
20 to 30 sage leaf

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Trim any extra fat from the chicken pieces and transfer them to a 13 by 9-inch baking pans.
Toss all of the ingredients together with the chicken until the chicken is evenly coated with the sauce. Arrange the chicken pieces skin-side up in the pan, spaced evenly apart.
Roast, uncovered, until the tops of the chicken pieces are browned and the chicken is cooked through, and the juices run clear, about 35 to 40 minutes.
