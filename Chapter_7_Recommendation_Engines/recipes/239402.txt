Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
1/2 cup gluten-free oats
1 scoop protein powder (optional)
2 tablespoons brown sugar

1 teaspoon baking powder
Wet Ingredients:
1 banana
2 eggs
1/2 cup cottage cheese
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
water as needed

Directions:
Preheat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat.
Blend oatmeal, protein powder, brown sugar, cinnamon, and baking powder in a blender until fine; dump into a large bowl.
Blend banana, eggs, cottage cheese, and vanilla extract in a blender until smooth; pour into bowl with dry ingredients and mix into a thick batter. Stir water into the batter to thin slightly, as desired.
Ladle between 1/4 to 1/2 cup batter per pancake onto the preheated cooking surface. Cook until browned on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip pancakes and continue cooking until browned on the other side and the center is set, 3 to 5 minutes more.

Description: 
I combined a few gluten-free recipes to make these pancakes. They are super-high in protein and sweet enough to eat without any toppings, though I usually chop some strawberries or blueberries to top them! Feel free to add chopped fruit, syrup, or whipped cream to top your pancakes!
