Ingredients:
1/4 cup quinoa
1/2 cup water
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can black olives, drained and sliced
1 (14.5 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
1 cup diced fresh tomatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more if needed
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender and the water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Combine garbanzo beans, black olives, corn, tuna, spinach, tomatoes, olive oil, and cilantro in a large bowl; stir to coat. Stir in quinoa. Refrigerate salad to allow flavors to blend, 2 hours to overnight. Serve chilled.
