Ingredients:
4 cups radiatore pasta
1/2 pound applewood ham, cut into quarters
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 large zucchini, chopped
1 (6 ounce) can large black olives, chopped
1/2 cup crumbled Cotija cheese
1/3 cup Greek salad dressing

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook radiatore in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 to 15 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Soak in cold water for 3 minutes. Drain again.
Combine radiatore, ham, red bell pepper, zucchini, black olives, Cotija cheese, and Greek dressing together in a large bowl; toss to coat.

Description: 
This was made for our family's lunch at the pool! In the summer time we spend most of our time together at the pool and BBQ-ing. But this was lunch so we wanted something, COLD, FAST, and of course TASTY! So, since I'm mostly European I thought my family would really enjoy something a little more NORMAL, to their palettes.
