Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 small onion, diced
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
2 star anise pods, broken into pieces
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon chile powder
1 teaspoon garam masala
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 whole clove, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, and anise; stir. Add chickpeas, tomato sauce, water, chile powder, garam masala, salt, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and clove. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until chickpeas start to soften, 5 to 7 minutes.
Mash some of the chickpeas directly in the pot to give the sauce a chunkier consistency. Cover and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 15 minutes. Remove star anise pieces and clove before serving.
