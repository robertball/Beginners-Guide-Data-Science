Description: 
This is my take on a very simple yet surprisingly satisfying salad I had at a Greek restaurant in NYC.   Of course you can add your favorite herbs and toppings. I find the lightly dressed and slightly bitter salad is a perfect start to a rich meal; it pairs really well with warm bread and butter.   Sprinkle with the salt right before serving, that pop of flavor and crunch is so good.  Finishing salt is a must for this salad. You can also use the salt  to top  poached and fried eggs and avocado toast.
