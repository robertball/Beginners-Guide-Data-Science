Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking dish.
Mash sweet potatoes in a bowl with milk, adding the milk a little at a time until potatoes are the desired consistency. Spread sweet potatoes into the prepared baking dish.

Bake in the preheated oven until the sweet potatoes are hot and the topping has begun to cook into a sticky caramel, 20 to 30 minutes.
