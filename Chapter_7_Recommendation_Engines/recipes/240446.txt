Ingredients:
2 cups whole milk
2 tablespoons brown sugar
4 large eggs
1 teaspoon double-strength imitation vanilla extract (such as Goodman's Route 66)
1/2 teaspoon almond extract (such as WatkinsÂ® pure almond extract)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
8 thick slices slightly stale Texas toast

Directions:
Mix whole milk and brown sugar in a large bowl.
Beat eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice together in a separate bowl until the eggs are well beaten; add to the milk mixture and stir to dissolve the brown sugar.
Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-low heat.
Set one slice of Texas toast into the milk mixture; let soak until moistened, about 10 seconds per side.
Cook the dipped toast in the preheated skillet until bottom is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes; flip toast and continue to cook until the other side is browned, 3 to 5 minutes more. Repeat dipping and cooking with remaining bread slices.
