Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
3 eggs, beaten
1 pound fresh asparagus, grated and drained
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, undrained
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
ICING:
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 3/4 cups confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons grated orange peel
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Add oil, eggs, asparagus, pineapple, orange peel and vanilla; mix well. Fold in pecans. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
For icing, beat cream cheese and sugar in a small mixing bowl until smooth. Add orange peel, vanilla and enough milk until icing reaches desired consistency. Spoon over cake, allowing icing to drip down sides.
