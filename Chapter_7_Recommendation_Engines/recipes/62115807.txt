Ingredients:
5-6 cups Old Fashioned Oats
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
1 bag (16 ounces) marshmallows
1/2 tsp salt
Any other "preferred" ingredient you want to add, such as:
Chocolate chips
or any flavor chips you prefer
peanuts or any preferred nut
coconut flakes
raisins, other dried fruits
sunflower seeds, etc.

Directions:
Place the oats in an oven safe dish and place in oven to toast on 350 degrees F for approximately 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove when oats reach the level of toast you prefer.
Once oats are toasted to your liking, remove from oven and add the salt, plus the "preferred" ingredients of your choice (see examples in above list) to taste. Set aside.
In a non-stick pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add the entire bag of marshmallows, stirring constantly until melted.
Turn off heat and immediately stir the toasted oats mixture into the marshmallows. Stir until well blended.
Grease a rectangular cookie sheet. Spread oat and mallow mixture onto the cookie sheet and press down, spreading ingredients out evenly to the edges. Set aside to cool.
When the granola is almost cool, but still pliable, cut into rectangles and lift from cookie sheet to place on cooling racks to finish cooling. Can be enjoyed by everyone immediately.
Makes approximately 3 dozen.
