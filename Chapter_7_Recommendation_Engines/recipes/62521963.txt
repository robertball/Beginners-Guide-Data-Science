Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 ounces minced bacon, preferably slab bacon, or pancetta
2 eggs
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more
1 pound spaghetti, linguine, or other long pasta
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine the olive oil and bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally,until the bacon is crisp.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Warm a large bowl in the oven, or by filling it with very hot water.
Beat the eggs and Parmesan together in the bowl. Salt the boiling water and cook the pasta until it is tender but firm. When it is done, drain it and toss it immediately with the egg-cheese mixture; add the bacon and any fat remaining in the skillet. Add lots of pepper; taste and add salt and more pepper if necessary. Serve immediately, passing more grated Parmesan at the table.
