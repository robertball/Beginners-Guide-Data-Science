Ingredients:
9 1 oz. pieces of day old bread, broken into pieces
1  lb. breakfast meat (bacon, ham , sausage, smoked salmon, shrimp, crab)
1 small  medium onion, or ½ large onion
8 oz. sliced mushrooms (or other veggies of choice)
2 c shredded cheese
9 eggs
2 c milk
1 c greek yogurt
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Spray a muffin tin with cooking spray or grease with shortening.
If you don’t have day old bread, spread broken bread pieces on a cookie sheet (sprayed with cooking spray) and toast at 400° F 8-10 minutes, stir and toast for an additional 8-10 minutes.
Cook breakfast meat as normal, adding onion and mushrooms and cooking until veggies are soft, meat is fully cooked, and onions are translucent.
In a large bowl combine bread crumbs with meat mixture and cheese, and toss until combined.
In a large bowl, combine remaining ingredients and beat until combined.
Pour the egg mixture over the bread crumb mixture and mix until well combined.
Using a ?– ½ c measuring cup or scoop, fill the cups of a muffin tin with strata mixture.  You may fill cups to the top, as the strata will not rise significantly.
Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
Remove strata muffin tin from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking so that it can come up to room temperature.
Preheat oven to 350° F.
Bake 30-40 minutes.

Description: 
I needed to make a breakfast dish for guests and thought of strata.  I decided to try it in single servings just for a fun twist, and this is the result.
