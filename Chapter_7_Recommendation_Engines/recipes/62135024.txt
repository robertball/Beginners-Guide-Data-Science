Ingredients:
1 cup raw almonds
3 cups purified water
dash of sea salt
1 to 3 tablespoons of a sweetener of your choice (agave nectar, honey, or maple syrup).

Directions:
Soak the almonds in a bowl of purified water overnight (at least 12 hours).  The longer you soak them, the creamier the milk turns out.
Drop the almonds into a blender and add 3 cups of water.  Blend them on low speed for 10 seconds, stop for 5 seconds, then blend them on high speed for 60 seconds.
Pour the milk through a paint strainer or nut bag into a bowl to catch all the pulp.  Discard the pulp or save for another recipe.
Clean the blender, pour the milk back into the blender, and add the salt and sweetener (if you choose to).
