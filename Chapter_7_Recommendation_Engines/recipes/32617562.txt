Ingredients:
4 oz. Butter
Flour to make a Roux (about 6 tablespoons)
3 - 3 1/2 cups Milk
1 Beaten Egg
6 tablespoons Grated Parmesan Cheese
1 oz. Whipped Cream (optional)
Salt and Pepper to Taste
Slices of Roast Turkey
8-12 Slices of Toast (may be trimmed)
Extra Parmesan for Topping
8-12 Strips of Fried Bacon

Directions:
Melt butter and add enough flour to make a reasonably thick roux (enough to absorb all of the butter).
Add milk and Parmesan cheese.
Add egg to thicken sauce, but do not allow sauce to boil.
Remove from heat.
Fold in whipped cream.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
For each Hot Brown, place two slices of toast on a metal (or flameproof) dish.
Cover the toast with a liberal amount of turkey.
Pour a generous amount of sauce over the turkey and toast.
Sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese.
Place entire dish under a broiler until the sauce is speckled brown and bubbly.
Remove from broiler, cross two pieces of bacon on top, and serve immediately.

Description: 
Here is the history behind this now legendary dish.

In the 1920's, The Brown Hotel's dinner dance drew over 1,200 guests each evening. After dancing, the tired guests would retire to the restaurant for a snack. Diners became bored with the usual ham and eggs, so Chef Fred Schmidt created something new to tempt his guests' palates. He created an open-faced turkey sandwich with bacon and a delicate Mornay sauce. Exemplifying our unending dedication to serving guests, The Hot Brown was born!

And now The Hot Brown is a Louisville tradition with worldwide appeal.
