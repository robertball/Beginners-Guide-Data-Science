Ingredients:
Cajun Cake:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple with juice
Topping:
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup evaporated milk
1/2 cup margarine
1 cup chopped pecans
1 1/2 cups flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan.
In a large bowl, sift together flour, 1 1/2 cup sugar, salt and baking soda. Add eggs, pineapple, and juice. Mix at low speed until well blended.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven until a tester comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Have the topping ready when the cake comes out of the oven.
To Make Topping: In a saucepan, combine milk, 3/4 cup sugar, and margarine. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add pecans and coconut and combine. Remove from heat.
When cake comes out of the oven, pour on the topping and carefully spread on while cake is still hot.
