Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 pound Italian-style chicken sausage or Italian-style turkey sausage, casing removed
1 onion, diced
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 (32 ounce) carton Swanson® Tuscan Chicken Flavor Infused Broth
20 ounces kale, cut into thin strips
1 (15 ounce) can white cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 6-quart saucepot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat.
Add the onion to the saucepot and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the wine to the saucepot and heat to a boil, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the saucepot. Cook for 2 minutes.
Stir in the broth and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Stir in the kale and beans. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the kale is tender, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with the parsley and cheese, if desired.
