Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
1 cup light brown sugar
2 eggs
2 tablespoons evaporated milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour

1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup flaked coconut
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, shortening, white sugar and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the evaporated milk and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in the oats, chocolate chips, coconut and pecans. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be spaced about 2 inches apart.
Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Cool slightly on cookie sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
