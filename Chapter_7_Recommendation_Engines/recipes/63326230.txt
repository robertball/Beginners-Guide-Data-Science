2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 tsp Italian Seasoning
ground black pepper to taste
3 zucchinis, sliced
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup vegetable oil for frying
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Mix coconut flour, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, parsley, Italian Seasoning, and black pepper in a bowl. Dip zucchini slices into eggs, then press into flour mixture, shaking off excess. Place the breaded zucchini onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry floured zucchini in hot oil in batches until golden brown, about 3 minutes; transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese and salt.
