2 cups Old Fashion Oats (not quick or instant oats)

1/3 cup Brown Sugar

1/2 tsp Pumpkin Pie spice (or more to taste)

Directions:
Spray 4 quart slow cooker with butter spray.
Place diced apples in bottom of slow cooker then add in oats, cinnamon, sugar, pumpkin pie spice and water.
Turn the slow cooker on low heat and cook for 8 hours (depending on your slow cooker the time may vary) then switch to warm until ready to serve.
Notes:
I add all of the ingredients into the slow cooker the night before allowing it to cook overnight.
Can substitute milk for half of the liquid for creamier oatmeal.
Can substitute steel cut oats for the old fashion oatmeal.
Left over oatmeal can be used to make muffins or bread.
