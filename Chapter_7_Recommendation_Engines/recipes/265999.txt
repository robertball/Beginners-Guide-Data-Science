Ingredients:
1 (1.25 ounce) package dry taco seasoning mix
1 cup ground beef
1 (14 ounce) package prepared pizza dough, or as needed
1/2 cup pizza sauce
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 pinch salt
1 1/4 cups shredded mild Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Sprinkle taco seasoning on ground beef. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
Divide pizza dough in half and flatten each half into a thin crust over a nonstick baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 3 minutes. Remove but leave oven on.
Mix pizza sauce, cumin, and salt together in a bowl. Spread 1/2 of the mixture over each pizza crust. Sprinkle beef and Cheddar cheese evenly on top.
Bake until crusts are crunchy and cheese is melted, 10 to 12 minutes.
