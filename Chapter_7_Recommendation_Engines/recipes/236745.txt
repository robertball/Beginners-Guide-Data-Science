Ingredients:
6 large eggs
1 tablespoon milk
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons olive oil

1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup sliced baby bella mushrooms
1/2 cup fresh spinach, or to taste
4 cherry tomatoes, sliced
2 tablespoons shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Beat eggs, milk, and a pinch of salt together in a bowl.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms, spinach, and cherry tomatoes; cook and stir until spinach is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes.
Pour egg mixture over vegetable mixture and cook until eggs are still soft and halfway cooked, 2 to 3 minutes. Add mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese to egg mixture; cook until eggs are set and cheeses are melted, 3 to 4 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
