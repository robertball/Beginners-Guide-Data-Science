Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, or to taste
1/2 cup butter
1 egg
1/3 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking pan.
Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Cut in butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Beat egg and milk in another bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is just blended. Spread batter in the prepared baking pan.
Bake in preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
This is a fabulous old-fashioned recipe given to me by a friend. It was her mother's recipe and it is the best shortcake.  It sops up all the juice and the touch of nutmeg sends it over the top. My very favorite recipe for strawberry shortcake!
