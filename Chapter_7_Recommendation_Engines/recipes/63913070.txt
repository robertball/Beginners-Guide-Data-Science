Ingredients:
1 pound dried split peas
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup finely chopped onions
2 cup finely chopped celery
2 cup finely chopped carrots
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 pound Smithfield ham, chopped
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
8 cups beef stock (low Sodium)
1 bay leaf
2 teaspoons fresh thyme

Directions:
Place the peas in a large pot or bowl, cover with water by 2 inches, bring to a boil for 3 minutes. Set aside for at least one hour before continuing or soak 8 hours or overnight. Drain the peas.
In a large pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the celery and carrots and cook, stirring, until just soft, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.
Add the drained peas, salt, pepper, and pepper flakes, and cook, stirring for 2 minutes. Add 8 cups of stock, the bay leaf and thyme, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the peas are tender, about 1 hour. (Add more water as needed, if the soup becomes too thick).

Description: 
I like this recipe because I do not need a ham bone.  The beef stock (low Sodium) does the trick
