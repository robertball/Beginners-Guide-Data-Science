Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons coconut oil
3 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon sour cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup crushed pistachios
1/4 cup shredded unsweetened coconut
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Mix flour, 1/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Rub coconut oil into flour mixture using your hands until mixture is crumbly. Add milk, sour cream, and vanilla extract and mix just until dough is combined; fold in pistachios and coconut.
Scoop dough, about 1 teaspoon per cookie, and form into balls; arrange on the prepared baking sheet about 1-inch apart. Mix 1 teaspoon sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl; sprinkle over dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges turn light brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool cookies on a wire rack.
