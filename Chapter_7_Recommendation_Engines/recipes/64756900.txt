Ingredients:
Crust:
•	3 cups crushed graham crackers
•	4 tablespoons sugar
•	12 tablespoons butter, melted
•	- or  two 9-inch pre-made graham cracker crusts
Baked traditional Key Lime Pie Layer:
•	5 large egg yolks
•	14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk
•	½ cup key lime juice
No Baked Key Lime Cheesecake Layer:
•	16 oz. cream cheese, room temperature
•	14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk
•	1/3 cup key lime juice
•	2 teaspoons key lime zest
•	1 cup heavy whipping cream, cold
•	1/2 cup powdered sugar
•	1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Whipped cream Topping:
•	1 cup heavy whipping cream, chilled
•	3 Tablespoons granulated sugar
(optional, for a piping whipped cream add 1 tablespoon of powdered milk for a stable whipped cream that holds it's shape when piped)

Directions:
Graham Cracker Crust:
Place oven rack in middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Place graham crackers crumbs, sugar, and melted butter into bowl and mix until the mixture looks like wet sand. Press mixture onto bottom and up sides of two 9-10 inch pie pans evenly. Place into pre-heated oven and bake for 13-15 minutes until slightly browned. Allow to cool completely on wire rack. Prepare the baked layer filling once the crust is cooled.
Traditional Key Lime Layer:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. In a standard mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sweetened condensed milk, and lime juice until smooth and starting to thicken. Pour half the mixture into each of the cooled crusts and bake until the custard is set but still a little jiggly in the middle. 12-14 minutes. Allow the pie to cool completely on a wire rack. This cooling period is a good time to zest the key limes for the second layer.
No Bake Cheesecake Layer:
In a large mixer bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Add the sweetened condensed milk and mix until well combined. Add the key lime juice and zest and mix until well combined. Set the mixture aside. In another large mixer bowl, add the heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Whip on high speed until stiff peaks form. (Do not over whip) Carefully fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture in two parts until well combined. Add the half filling to each of the cooled baked key lime pies and gently spread into an even layer. Refrigerate cheesecake until firm, 6-7 hours or overnight.
Once the pie has set, place chilled heavy cream into a mixing bowl and whisk until soft peaks form. Add 1 tablespoon of sugar at a time and continue beating until still peaks form. Spoon or pipe whipped cream on to pie, or decorate as desired. This recipe can also be used to make one full key lime pie and one full no bake key lime cheesecake, or two 2-layer pies as described here. Pie can be stored for up to four days.
