Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
2 1/2 cups whole milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Combine the sugar, cornstarch, cocoa powder, and milk in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, and stir until thick, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla and butter. Transfer to a heatproof bowl, and refrigerate until cool, approximately 20 minutes.
Stir the chocolate chips into the cooled chocolate mixture. Pour into molds and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.

Description: 
Make frozen fudge pops without a packaged pudding mix. I like using Tovolo popsicle molds. My sons likes the rocket shape.
