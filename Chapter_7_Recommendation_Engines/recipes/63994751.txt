Ingredients:
2 pounds chopped peeled peaches
1/2 cup raisins
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped onion
Rounded tablespoon of ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons mixed chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons mustard seed
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
2 cups packed brown sugar
2 cups apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons pickling spice

Directions:
In a large pot, stir together the peaches, raisins, garlic, onion, preserved ginger, chili powder, mustard seed, curry powder, brown sugar and cider vinegar. Wrap the pickling spice in a cheesecloth bag, and place in the pot.
Bring to a boil, and cook over medium heat uncovered until the mixture reaches your desired consistency. It will take about 1 1/2 hours to get a good thick sauce. Stir frequently to prevent scorching on the bottom.
Remove spice bag. Ladle into hot sterilized jars. Seal with lids and rings. Process in a barely simmering  water bath for 10 minutes with water covering the jars.
