Ingredients:
8 sheets phyllo dough
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 cups fresh blueberries
1/2 cup strawberry jelly
1 cup heavy cream, whipped (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
On a flat surface, place one sheet of phyllo dough. Brush it with melted butter, and cover with another piece of phyllo. Repeat until all 8 sheets are used. Using kitchen scissors, cut layered phyllo into a 12- to 13-inch circle. Carefully press circle into a greased 9-inch pie plate; gently fan edges. Bake in preheated oven until edges are just golden, 6 to 8 minutes; cool slightly on a wire rack. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs until well combined. Fold in 1 cup of blueberries. Pour filling into prepared crust.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until set, 40 to 50 minutes. To prevent the crust from over-browning, gently cover pie with foil for the last 25 minutes of baking. Cool completely on a wire rack.
In a small bowl, beat jelly until smooth; spread over cheese filling. Arrange 1 cup blueberries on top in a star pattern.
