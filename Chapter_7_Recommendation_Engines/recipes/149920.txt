1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon hot paprika

Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a large baking pan with cooking spray.
Whisk together the olive oil, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, oregano, pepper, and chili powder in a large bowl. Place the egg whites in a separate large bowl.
Toss the potato wedges first with the egg whites and then with the olive oil mixture. Arrange the seasoned wedges in a single layer on the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning occasionally, until crispy, about 40 minutes.
