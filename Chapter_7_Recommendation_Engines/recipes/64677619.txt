Ingredients
1 3 lb chuck roast
2 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil
salt & pepper to taste
1 packet ranch dressing mix
1 packet dry onion soup mix
1/2 cup salted butter 1 stick
8 peperoncini peppers
1/2 sweet yellow onion
1 can condensed French onion soup

Directions:
Heat up a large skillet on high.  Add oil to hot skillet.  You want it really hot here to brown or "sear" the beef quickly.  Take a paper towel and make sure you dry both sides of the pot roast.
Season with a little bit of salt and pepper.  Once the skillet is nice and hot, add the roast.
Allow the roast to cook for about 2-3 minutes until it is golden brown.  Using tongs, flip the meat over and sear the other side of the roast for another 2-3 minutes.  Transfer meat to slow cooker.
Sprinkle packets of dry ranch dressing and onion soup mixes over pot roast.  Add onion slices, and French onion soup.  Top with a stick of butter then place peppers on and around roast.  Cover and cook on low for 8 hours.  Take two forks and start shredding the meat.
Discard any big fatty pieces.
Recipe Notes
You can skip the browning step if you are in a rush, or just donâ€™t feel like it. If you prefer, you can cut up the peppers and stir those into the meat mixture for an extra kick of flavor.
