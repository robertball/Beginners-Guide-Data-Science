Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil, for frying
1/2 cup milk, or more as needed
1/4 cup cornmeal
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg, beaten
4 green tomatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk milk, cornmeal, flour, and egg together in a large bowl until it is a fairly thick batter.
Dip each slice of tomato into batter and immediately fry in hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain fried tomatoes in a colander standing on edge to keep crisp as you fry remaining tomato slices.
