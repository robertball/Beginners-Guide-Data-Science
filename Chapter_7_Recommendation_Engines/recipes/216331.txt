Ingredients:
2 egg whites
1 cup brown sugar
2 cups finely chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until light and frothy; beat in sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, until incorporated. Continue beating until the mixture is thick and shiny, 1 to 2 more minutes. Lightly fold in the walnuts. Drop by heaping teaspoonful onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake until dry to the touch, about 40 minutes. Cool thoroughly.
