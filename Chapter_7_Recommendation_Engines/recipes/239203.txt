Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups peanut butter
1 cup butter, cut into small chunks
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract (optional)
1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat peanut butter, butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into creamed butter, beating well before adding next egg; mix in vanilla extract and almond extract.
Slowly stir flour mixture into creamed butter mixture until fully incorporated; fold in oats using a wooden spoon. Roll dough into 1-inch balls and arrange 1-inch apart on a baking sheet. Press a fork into each cookie if desired.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
