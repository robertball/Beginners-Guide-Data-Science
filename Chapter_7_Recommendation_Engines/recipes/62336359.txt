Ingredients:
3 egg whites or 1/2 cup of "egg beaters"
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup of plain yogurt
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 bananas, mashed
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup of milled flax seed
1/2 cup of Oat Bran
1/2 cup of wheat germ
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup frozen sliced strawberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 large muffin cups, or line with paper liners.
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, applesauce, yogurt, brown sugar, vanilla and bananas. Combine the flour/bran/flax/wheat germ, baking soda and cinnamon; "fold" into the banana mixture until moistened. "fold" (lift mixture with spoon or spatula, don't stir- stiring may harden the batter) in the strawberries until evenly distributed. Spoon batter into muffin cups until completely filled.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops of the muffins spring back when pressed lightly. Cool before removing from the muffin tins.
