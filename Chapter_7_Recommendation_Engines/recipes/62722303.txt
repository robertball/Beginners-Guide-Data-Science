Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
2 large onions, chopped
2 pounds sweet Italian link sausage
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
2 8 ounce packages of sliced mushrooms
2 teaspoons dried Italian herb seasoning
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
2 (29 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 (14.5 ounce) cans Italian-style diced tomatoes
2 (14.5 ounce) cans Italian-style stewed tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
4 teaspoons garlic powder
4 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Remove the casing from the sausage and cut the meat into 1 inch pieces. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions and Italian sausage until the sausage is browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer the sausage and onions to a 6 quart slow cooker. In the same skillet, cook and stir the ground beef, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, and marjoram, breaking the meat up as it cooks, until the meat is browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer the ground beef into the slow cooker.
Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, diced tomatoes, stewed tomatoes, thyme, basil, oregano, and 2 teaspoons of garlic powder. Set the cooker on Low, and cook the sauce for 8 hours. About 15 minutes before serving, stir in the sugar.
Serve hot with a crusty or Italian bread.
