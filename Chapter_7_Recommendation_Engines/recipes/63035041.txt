Ingredients:
2 tablespoons of oil, or as needed
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon minced ginger
1 medium onion, chopped
2½ teaspoons of curry powder
1½ teaspoons of garam masala
2 pounds of small or medium shrimp, peeled
2 cups of slightly underripe mangoes, chopped
1 cup coconut milk (a bit more for a creamier curry)
¼ cup parsley, chopped
¼ cup cilantro, chopped
salt to taste (I use about a teaspoon)

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan or dutch oven over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger, stir until it starts to get fragrant, then add onion. Cook until onion is soft and translucent, then add curry powder and garam masala. Cook until fragrant.
Increase heat to medium-high and add the shrimps. Stir to coat the shrimps with the spice mixture, add salt and allow to cook, half covered. After 3 minutes, add the chopped mangoes, reduce heat and cook until shrimp is done (be careful not to overcook!)
Add the coconut milk, stir and taste to adjust salt as needed. Turn off heat, then add half the chopped herbs, stir, then add the other half as garnish. Serve immediately with white rice.

Description: 
This curry is probably not very authentic, but it´s very tasty and quite easy to make. It´s a hit every time I make it, and it´s a very good recipe for adding a personal touch.
