1 clove garlic
1/4 pound mushrooms, diced
1/4 green bell pepper, seeded and diced

1 1/2 teaspoons dried rosemary
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons tomato paste

Directions:
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic until tender. Mix in mushrooms, green bell pepper, and tomatoes. Season with rosemary, salt, and pepper. Stir in tomato paste and beef broth. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes.

Try this recipe when you want spaghetti, but don't want the same old stuff. I never have any complaints (or leftovers, for that matter)!
