This is a great soup for a cold winter night, especially when you don't have a lot of time to make a homemade meal that takes forever. It's also a great way to get some vegetables in your diet, but in a yummy way! Serve with a little buttery toasted bread and you've got yourself a tasty supper. The best part is that it's even better the next day! Shelley
