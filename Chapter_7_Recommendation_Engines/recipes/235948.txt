Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
1 head cabbage, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 oz) ring kielbasa sausage, sliced thin

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and crumble. Reserve drippings in skillet.
Cook and stir cabbage and onion in bacon drippings over medium-high heat until cabbage begins to wilt, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir bacon, salt, and pepper into cabbage mixture; cook until cabbage is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes more. Stir kielbasa into cabbage mixture, reduce heat to low, cover the skillet, and simmer until cabbage is lightly golden and tender, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This recipe works well for many occasions. This is also the type of recipe that you can add to or build on to make your own. If you aren't too crazy about the taste of cabbage, keep in mind that the onion, bacon drippings, and kielbasa seems to tone down that cabbage-y taste a bit, and you can also add other things or spices to tone it down.
