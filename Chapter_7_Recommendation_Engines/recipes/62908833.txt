Gamja Jorim Recipe

Ingredients:
2 C Potatoes cut into a 1" cube
1 or 2 dried thai chiles (optional)
2 Tbsp Olive Oil
The whites of 3 or 4 scallions (retain the tops for garnish)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup water or bouillon
2 1/2 Tbs. soy sauce
1 Tbs. sugar
1 Tbs. corn syrup
Sesame oil, couple drizzles
Salt and Black pepper to taste
Sesame seeds, garnish

Directions:
Rinse cubed potatoes under cold water to remove starch and shake colander well to remove excess water.
In a saucepan or skillet with a lid, heat oil over medium heat, then saute dried peppers until they puff up and begin to blacken.  You can remove these now or at the end.
Increase heat to medium high, and add potatoes.  Stir constantly, as they will stick a bit.
When potatoes begin to appear translucent around the edges (about 5 minutes), add onion and garlic and saute for another minute.
Add water, soy sauce, sugar, and corn syrup, mix well, and cover.
Once at a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and cook for 7-10 minutes, or until potatoes are tender and sauce has thickened.  Check pan and stir frequently to prevent sticking.
Once potatoes are tender, remove from heat.  Add salt and pepper to taste, drizzle with sesame oil, and garnish with sesame seeds and reserved scallion greens.

Description: 
Gamja Jorim is a Korean potato dish that doubles as comfort food for me.  It can be as spicy or as tame as you like (just adjust the amount of dried chiles you saute in the beginning - or leave them out) and works equally as well with sweet potatoes as with regular potatoes.  The cooking method allows the potatoes to hold their form, so this recipe works with either waxy or starchy potatoes.  Enjoy!
