Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into thirds
2 medium yellow bell peppers, seeded and diced
1/4 cup olive oil
1 large red onion, cut into strips
1/4 cup toasted almond slices
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons lime juice
2 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoon hot sauce
salad seasoning mix to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange the asparagus spears and bell peppers in a single layer on the baking sheet, and drizzle or mist with 1/4 cup of olive oil.
Roast 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until tender, turning occasionally to prevent burning. Remove from heat, and cool completely.
In a bowl, toss together the asparagus, bell peppers, onion, almond slices, and Parmesan cheese.
In a separate bowl, mix the 1/2 cup olive oil, Dijon mustard, garlic, lime juice, sugar, hot sauce, and salad seasoning. Pour over the salad, and toss to coat.

Description: 
This delicious cold roasted asparagus recipe is great if you love asparagus, and even if you don't. The tangy dressing and the roasted taste of the asparagus and peppers brings it all together. You can make this a day ahead of serving. You may not need to use all of the dressing. Also, you can make the vegetables the night before and add the dressing a few hours before serving.
