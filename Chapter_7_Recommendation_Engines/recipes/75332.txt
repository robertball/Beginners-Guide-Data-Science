Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 (4 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and chopped
1 (.4 ounce) packet dry vegetable soup mix
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 cup finely shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the spinach, cream cheese, water chestnuts, vegetable soup mix, mayonnaise and Cheddar cheese until well blended. Form into a ball, and roll in chopped walnuts. If the mixture is too soft to form a ball, refrigerate for about 30 minutes to set. Wrap the cheese ball in plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight to blend the flavors before serving with your favorite crackers.
