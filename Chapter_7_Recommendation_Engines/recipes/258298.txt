Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley
sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups spaghetti sauce, divided
1 cup drained and rinsed kidney beans
1 cup cooked couscous
2 Roma tomatoes, diced
1/2 cup finely chopped cabbage
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
2 bell peppers, tops and seeds removed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add 1 cup spaghetti sauce, kidney beans, couscous, Roma tomatoes, and cabbage; simmer until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese into the skillet. Spoon mixture into the bell peppers.
Spread 1/2 cup spaghetti sauce in the bottom of a small casserole dish. Place stuffed peppers into the dish; cover with remaining 1/2 cup spaghetti sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are tender, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese over peppers. Bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is a relatively quick vegetarian stuffed pepper recipe I made using ingredients I had on hand. Instead of cabbage, you could easily sub other veggies you have available, though I really liked the crunchy texture it added to the meal.
