Ingredients:
6 yellow fin tuna steaks, about 4 ounces each, thick cut (or use ahi tuna)
1 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup Asian sesame oil
1/2 cup lime juice
1/4 cup mirin (sweet cooking sake) or use white wine plus a little sugar
2 Tbl. fresh ginger, grated
2 medium cloves garlic, minced
2 Tbl. red pepper flakes, crushed
Optional: 2 to 4 Tbl. black and white toasted sesame seeds
Cilantro sprigs for garnish

Directions:
Marinating time 30 minutes. Prepare grill.
In a small bowl, mix together all ingredients except tuna.
Place tuna steaks in a non-reactive pan large enough to hold them in a single layer.
Pour marinade over steaks.  Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes.
Lightly oil grill and light fire, allowing coals to get very hot, or set gas flame to high.
After marinading, place tuna on hot grill and cook 5 minutes until grill marks appear.  (Optional: before placing tuna on grill coat steaks with sesame seed, pressing lightly into fish until all coated with seeds).
Turn and grill 5 minutes on other side.
Remove tuna from grill while it is still rare in the middle or it will become dry.
Serve immediately, garnished with cilantro sprigs.
