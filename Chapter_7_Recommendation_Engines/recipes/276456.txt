Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package low-moisture mozzarella cheese
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 pound bulk Italian turkey sausage
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup whole milk
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 eggs
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 (24 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce

Directions:
Cut mozzarella cheese into 3/4-inch cubes. Store in the refrigerator while preparing the meat.
Combine turkey, turkey sausage, bread crumbs, milk, Parmesan cheese, parsley, eggs, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a large mixing bowl. Mix well by hand.
Roll meat mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs. Squish a mozzarella cube into the center of each and pull the edges of the meat around it to enclose.
Pour 1 jar of spaghetti sauce into the bottom of a slow cooker. Arrange meatballs on top and cover with the second jar of sauce.
Cover and cook on High until no longer pink in the centers, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
