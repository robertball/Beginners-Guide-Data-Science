Ingredients:
2 cups packed brown sugar
2 cups hot water
2 tablespoons bacon grease
2 cups raisins
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
In a medium saucepan combine the brown sugar, hot water, bacon grease, and raisins, over medium heat. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes, then set aside to cool.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves. Add the ingredients from the saucepan and mix until well blended. Divide evenly between the two prepared pans.
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
A surprisingly good cake that has no eggs, milk, or butter in it. My grandmother was quite proud of it.
