Ingredients:
Roasted squash
1 Butternut squash
olive oil
Miracle blend (seasoning salt)
chopped garlic (about 3 spoonfuls)
ground sage (a few shakes)
Sauce
4 Tablespoons butter
chopped garlic (2 spoonfuls)
¼ cup of flour
3 cups of milk
1 tsp chili powder
sage (several shakes)
½ tsp rosemary
Cheese mixture
1 container ricotta
1 egg
2 cups shredded mozzarella
¼ cup Parmesan
10 oz package chopped spinach, drained and dried

Directions:
Peel and cube butternut squash. Toss with olive oil, Miracle blend, garlic & sage. Roast in 9x11 pan (You will use this same pan for the lasagne) for an hour @ 400. Stir every 20 minutes or so.
Heat butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook about 1 minute. Whisk in flour. Slowly add milk and season with salt and pepper.
Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Add rosemary, sage, chili powder and squash to sauce. Blend with immersion blender until smooth.
Spread bottom of pan with about ½ cup of sauce. Put 3 sheets of no-boil lasagne noodles over sauce.
Mix ricotta, egg, Parmesan, spinach and couple handfuls of shredded mozzarella.
Spread cheese mixture over noodles. Continue to layer sauce, noodles and cheese mixture. Last layer is the remainder of the sauce. Then sprinkle a handful or two of cheese over the top. I used 9 sheets of noodles because that was all I had.
Cover with foil and bake at 375 for about 40 minutes. Uncover and bake about 10 more minutes. It will be bubbly when done.
