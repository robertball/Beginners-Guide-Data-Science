Ingredients:
2 pints cherry tomatoes
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 pinch kosher salt, or more to taste
2 banana peppers
2 cups cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 red onion, sliced into thin strips
1/4 pound hot Italian chicken sausage, casings removed
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Toss tomatoes, 2 tablespoons oil, and 1 pinch salt together in a small roasting dish. Move tomatoes to 1 side of the dish and place banana peppers on the other side.
Broil in the preheated oven until tomatoes are charred and softened but still hold their shape, about 10 minutes. Transfer tomatoes to a large bowl and flip peppers.
Return to the oven and continue to broil peppers until charred and softened, about 5 minutes more.
Remove peppers from the oven and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes; peel, remove seeds, and slice. Fold beans, onion, and peppers into tomatoes.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook chicken sausage in the hot oil until crisp and browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer to tomato mixture and gently fold to combine. Finish with orange juice and cilantro and season with salt.
