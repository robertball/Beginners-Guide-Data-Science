Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen peas
1 (1 pound) package smoked sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 (15 ounce) can yellow corn, drained
1 (12 ounce) bottle chili sauce
¼ cup finely chopped onion
1 tablespoon dried basil
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a pot of water to boil; cook peas in the boiling water until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Mix peas, sausage, corn, chili sauce, onion, basil, black pepper, and 1 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese together in a 3-quart casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese over casserole and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 more minutes.

Description: 
This was one of the first recipes I ever learned. It's easy and great for introducing kids or young adults to cooking. The best part is - it tastes great too! My family loves when I make this dish and the ease in which it's prepared is still appreciated all these years after it was first mastered.
