Ingredients:
1/3 cup uncooked long grain rice
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
2 tablespoons slivered almonds
3 tablespoons butter, divided
3/4 cup water
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
1 (4 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained and chopped
2 Cornish game hens
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a saucepan, cook and stir the rice, onion and almonds in 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat for 5 minutes or until rice is lightly browned. Stir in the water, bouillon, lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 16-20 minutes or until rice is tender. Stir in mushrooms.
Sprinkle outside and cavity of hens with pepper and remaining salt. Stuff hens with rice mixture. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Melt remaining butter; brush half over hens.
Cover and bake at 400 degrees F for 25-35 minutes longer or until juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F for hens and 165 degrees F for stuffing.
