Ingredients:
1 (5.5 ounce) package dry risotto mix
1 cup chopped onion
1 package fresh mozzarella cheese (cut in 1/2 inch cubes)
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Prepare risotto according to package directions adding chopped onion to mixture for additional flavor.
Chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour, until cooled.
Roll risotto into 2 inch mounds. Place a cube of mozzarella cheese on each mound. Press cheese chunks into mounds, then roll mounds around cheese, creating balls.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the oil and cook the risotto balls, turning occasionally, until evenly golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.
