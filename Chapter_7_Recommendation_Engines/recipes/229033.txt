Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow-tie) pasta
1 pound bacon, diced
1 leek (white and light green part only), sliced
3/4 pound cremini mushrooms, sliced
3 tablespoons sour cream
ground black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon parsley, or to taste
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
Fry diced bacon in a large skillet until browned, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon into a bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving drippings in skillet. Cook and stir leek and cremini mushrooms in the hot bacon drippings until mushrooms are tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
Return bacon to skillet and stir in bow-tie pasta. Gently mix in sour cream and season with black pepper and parsley. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
This is our family's take on a dish my husband saw on TV (I believe the original used pancetta and some hard-to-find ingredients). It's super tasty and quick. Always a big hit at my house and we rarely have leftovers.
