Ingredients:
3 cups Brussels sprouts
1 cup chestnuts, peeled
1 large oranges, peeled and segmented
1/2 cup low fat, low sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon canola oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Trim each sprout by cutting a little piece off the bottom. With a small paring knife, make an X in the top of the sprout. Repeat with all sprouts and place in steamer over 2 inches of boiling water. Steam the sprouts covered for about 10 minutes or until tender.
Remove sprouts from pot and allow to cool. Cut each sprout in half and place in a casserole dish. Layer the chestnuts on top of the sprouts. Place the oranges on top of the chestnuts. If using whole roasted chestnuts, follow instructions in step 4
Add the broth and pour over all ingredients. Drizzle the casserole with oil. Grind in pepper and salt. Bake for 15 minutes or until oranges are soft.
To roast whole chestnuts:  Mark an X on the rounded side of each chestnut with a pairing knife. Place all the chestnuts on a baking sheet, and roast in the oven for about 30 minutes or until soft. Let cool. Peel, trying to keep the chestnuts as whole as possible.
