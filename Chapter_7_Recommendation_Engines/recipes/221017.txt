2 cups white sugar
3 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups shredded carrots
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
1 cup shredded coconut

1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
5 tablespoons butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Whisk vegetable oil, white sugar, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth.
Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl.
Stir oil mixture into flour mixture until a well-mixed batter forms.
Fold carrots, pineapple, coconut, and walnuts into batter; pour into prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour; cool completely, about 1 hour.

Description: 
One of my sisters, Beth, learned how to make carrot cake in home economics class in 1978. A few years ago I asked her to write down what she remembered from the recipe. Only remembering two-thirds of the ingredients, I completed the recipe by trial and error. It was worth all the effort. Simply delicious.
