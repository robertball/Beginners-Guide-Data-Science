Ingredients:
6 slices pumpernickel bread
1/4 cup melted butter
1 cup drained sauerkraut
8 cups torn lettuce leaves
1/2 cup sliced green onions
1 tomato, diced
3/4 pound deli sliced corned beef, cut into strips
1 1/4 cups Thousand Island dressing
3/4 cup shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Brush both sides of the bread with melted butter, then cut into cubes. Place on a baking sheet, and bake in preheated oven until crisp, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature, then store in an airtight container.
Layer the sauerkraut, lettuce, tomato, and corned beef in a 9x13 inch dish. Carefully spread dressing over the top. Sprinkle with Swiss cheese. Refrigerate overnight. Top with pumpernickel croutons and serve.
