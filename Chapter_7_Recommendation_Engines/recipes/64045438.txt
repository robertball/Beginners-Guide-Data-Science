Ingredients:
12 oz. somyun (white wheat flour noodles)
2 egg + water, whisked
1 cup red cabbage, thinly sliced
1 cup gaetnip (perilla leaves), thinly sliced
1/2 cucumber, julienned
1/2 carrot, julienned
4 tbsp gochujang (red pepper paste)
1 tbsp gochugaru (red pepper flakes)
2 tbsp cider vinegar (or vinegar)
2, 3 garlic cloves, finely minced
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp sesame oil
2 tbsp sugar
sesame seeds

Directions:
Combine all the sauce ingredients (last 8 items on the list) together in a mixing bowl, set aside.
Crack the eggs and stir well until egg white and yolk are mixed. Heat a pan over low heat and add a generous amount of preferred cooking oil. Pour the stirred egg and cook both sides to make a thin pan-fried egg sheet. Cool the pan-fried egg completely before slicing.
After washing all vegetables and greens, slice the ingredients/toppings into thin matchstick pieces, set aside.
Boil a pot of water with a pinch of salt, then cook somyun according to package directions. Drain noodles with a strainer, and wash it under cold running water until it is completely cooled, set aside.
In a large bowl or serving dish, add the cold noodles and top with sauce. Garnish with available vegetables and greens. Enjoy!!
