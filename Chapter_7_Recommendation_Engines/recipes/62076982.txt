Ingredients:
1 lb. Lean ground beef
½ c. onion, chopped
8 oz. American cheese slices
1 cup chopped celery
1/2-1 cup chopped ripe pitted olives
2 cups fine dry noodles (uncooked)
1  #2 can diced tomatoes
½-1 cup water
1 t. salt
1/2 t. sugar (optional)

Directions:
Brown ground beef and onions in a 10-inch skillet (one that has a lid for use later).  When beef is browned, add the following ingredients on top of beef in layers:
American cheese slices
Chopped celery
Chopped ripe olives
Dry fine egg noodles (uncooked)
Diced canned tomatoes
Water
Salt
Sugar (if desired)
Cover skillet tightly and cook on
Medium-High setting just until steaming—--watch closely so it doesn’t burn.  Reduce heat to Simmer and cook, covered, for 25-30 minutes until noodles are done.  Recipe can be served directly from the skillet keeping layers intact or can be mixed and turned out into a serving dish.  Serves 4-6.

Description: 
This is a quick and delicious one-skillet meal that is perfect for cold weather suppers.  I have fixed this recipe for over 40 years.  The original recipe was given to me by the local power company when I was a Home Economics teach.
