Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup unbleached white flour
2 Tb nutritional yeast flakes
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 1/8 cups water (1 cup + 2 Tb)
1 1/8 cups plain almond milk (1 cup + 2 Tb)
3/4 tsp sea salt
1/4 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Heat oil in small saucepan.  With a fork, stir in the flour, yeast flakes, onion and garlic powder to make a smooth paste; cook and stir about one minute.  Gradually add the liquid, stirring continuously with fork so it will not be lumpy.  Stir in salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, stirring constantly until thickened.

Description: 
Got a recipe for this off this site, but there were too many steps and I wanted something much more simple and easier to prepare.  This is what I did and the resultant gravy was simply delicious!
