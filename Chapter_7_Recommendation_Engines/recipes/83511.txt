Ingredients:
1 rack pork spareribs cut into 2-rib portions
salt and pepper to taste
4 red potatoes, quartered
1 (16 ounce) jar sauerkraut, drained

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Season the ribs with salt and pepper, and arrange them in the greased baking dish.
Roast for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven, and reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Set the ribs on a plate, and drain excess grease from the baking dish. Spread the sauerkraut evenly in the bottom of the dish. Place the ribs on top with the meat side up. Tuck the potato wedges in amongst the ribs. Cover tightly with heavy aluminum foil.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Carefully remove the foil to avoid hot steam, and serve.
