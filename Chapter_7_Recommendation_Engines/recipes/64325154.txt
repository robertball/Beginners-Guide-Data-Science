Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
1 dozen Eggs
1 12 oz pkg shredded cheese
1 pound bacon or bulk breakfast sausage
12 taco size tortillas
1/2 jar of salsa

Directions:
Heat butter in large skillet over medium heat. Meanwhile, crack eggs into a bowl. Whisk eggs and pour into skillet. Cook, while stirring until just set. Transfer to a serving bowl and keep warm.
Fry bacon in large skillet until crispy OR bake at 400 until crisp (10-20 min). Place bacon on paper towels to absorb grease. Roughly chop and set in serving bowl. Alternately, cook sausage in skillet until brown, breaking up the larger pieces as you go. Strain off extra grease. Put in bowl for serving.
Warm tortillas in microwave with damp paper towel covering or warm in oven. Make sure they get soft, not crisp.
