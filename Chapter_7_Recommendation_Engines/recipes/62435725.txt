Ingredients:
2 cups Quinoa
4 cups Water
3 Tbsp Olive oil
4 Garlic Cloves, minced
1 medium Onion of your choosing
Salt and Pepper

Directions:
Rinse quinoa; place quinoa in pot, cover with water. If time permits, allow to soak for an hour (soaking helps make the quinoa a bit more digestible). Place pot over medium-high heat, let boil and stir occasionally until the grains absorb all of the water. In a wok, bring oil to medium heat, saut√© onions and garlic until onions soften. Stir quinoa into garlic and onions. Add salt and pepper to taste. Enjoy!!
