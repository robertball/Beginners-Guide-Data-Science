Ingredients:
5 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch strips
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 clove garlic, minced
¼ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3 tablespoons lemon juice
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
¼ cup white wine

Directions:
Combine chicken with ground pepper, cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, oregano, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and wine in a shallow bowl.  Marinate in the refrigerator for several hours (overnight is best).
Preheat broiler. Remove chicken from marinade (save marinade) and place in a shallow pan. Broil 8 inches from heat, turning once, until chicken is no longer pink inside (about 15 minutes).
In a small saucepan, bring marinade to a boil. Pour over chicken, toss and serve. Yummy!
