Ingredients:
2 prepared pie crusts
4 cups peeled and sliced apples
2 cups cranberries
3/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Fit a pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and arrange sliced apples into crust. Spread cranberries over apples. Whisk sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle mixture over cranberries. Distribute butter pieces over pie filling. Place remaining crust over filling, crimp both crusts together, and cut several slits into top crust to vent steam.
Bake until pie is browned and fruit filling is bubbling, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a modified apple pie recipe my mother has had for years. I prefer a combination of Braeburn, Fuji, and McIntosh apples.
