Ingredients:
For the "pasta"
1 spaghetti squash
Extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling
Salt and pepper
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried basil
For the shrimp scampi
8 oz. shrimp, peeled and deveined
3 tbsp butter
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
Pinch of red pepper flakes
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
Juice of 1 lemon
Zest of half a lemon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place squash in the microwave for 3-4 minutes to soften. Using a sharp knife, cut the squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds and discard. Place the halves, with the cut side up, on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with seasonings. Roast in the oven for 45-50 minutes, until you can poke the squash easily with a fork. Let it cool until you can handle it safely. Then scrape the insides with a fork to shred the squash into strands.
After removing spaghetti squash from the oven, melt the butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add in the garlic and saut√© for 2-3 minutes. Then add in the shrimp, salt, pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Cook for 5 minutes, until the shrimp is cooked through. Remove from heat and add in desired amount of cooked spaghetti squash. Toss with lemon juice and zest. Top with parsley to serve.
