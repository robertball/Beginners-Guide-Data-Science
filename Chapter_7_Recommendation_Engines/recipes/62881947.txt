Ingredients:
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1 TB dijon mustard
1 TB fresh lemon juice
salt & pepper
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
3 TB EVOO
1.5 lbs sweet potatoes, cut into 1/2-in x 2-in strips
3 TB flour
1 egg, beaten
12 oz tilapia, cut into 8 pieces

Directions:
Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees.
In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, mustard and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.  Set aside.
On a rimmed baking sheet, combine the panko with 1 TB EVOO and 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper.  Spread evenly and bake, tossing occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes; transfer to a shallow bowl.
On a rimmed baking sheet, toss the sweet potatoes with 2 TB EVOO; season with salt & pepper.  Arrange in a single layer and bake on the upper rack, turning once, until brown and tender, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a shallow bowl, combine the flour and 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper.  Pour the egg into another shall bowl.  Working with 2 pieces at a time, coat the tilapia in the flour mixture, dip in the egg then coat in the breadcrumbs, pressing to adhere.  Place on a baking sheet and bake until cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Serve the fish with the dipping sauce and sweet potato fries.
