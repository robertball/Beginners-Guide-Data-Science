Ingredients:
12 hard-cooked eggs
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons finely chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon prepared mustard
1/8 teaspoon pepper
3 stuffed olives
1 small sweet red pepper

Directions:
Cut a thin slice from the bottom of each egg so it sits flat.  Cut a zigzag pattern a third down from the top of each egg.  Carefully remove yolks and place in a small bowl; mash with a fork.  Add the mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, onion, curry, mustard and pepper; stir until well blended.  Spoon yolk mixture into the egg white bottoms; replace tops.
Cut olives into slices for eyes.  Cut 12 small triangles from red pepper for beaks.  Gently press the eyes and beaks into egg yolk filling.  Refrigerate until serving.
