Ingredients:
2 Tbsp butter
½ yellow onion, minced
2 Tbsp flour
3 cups milk
2 cups shredded extra-sharp cheddar
Salt and black pepper to taste
1 lb elbow pasta
¼ cup chopped Pickled Jalapeños
2 oz ham cut into thin strips
½ cup bread crumbs
¼ cup grated Parmesan

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent (but not browned), about 3 minutes. Add the flour and stir to incorporate into the butter. Pour in the milk a few tablespoons at a time, using a whisk to incorporate the flour and prevent lumps from forming. When all the milk as been added, allow the sauce to simmer for 10 minutes, until it begins to thicken. Stir in the cheese and season with salt and pepper.
Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente, drain and return to the pot. Add the cheese sauce, jalapeños, and ham and stir to fully incorporate. Divide the mixture among 6 individual crocks or pour into large baking dish. Top with the bread crumbs and sprinkle with Parmesan.
Bake for 10 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil until the break crumbs are golden brown and crispy, about another 3 minutes.
