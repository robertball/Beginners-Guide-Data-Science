Ingredients:
1/2 cup flour
2 beaten eggs
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1/4 c. grated parmesan cheese
1/4 c. crushed garlic croutons
1 Tbs. melted butter
2  Tbs. olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.  Grease 9x13 baking dish.  May need another pan if you make more than 4 breasts, depending on size of breasts.
I cut in half and pound the larger size to flatten to make it same thickness.  Does not have to be thin.
Place flour in bowl. Place eggs in another bowl.  Dip chicken in flour and then into eggs. Place in baking dish.
Combine parmesan cheese, crushed croutons, melted butter, Sprinkle on top of chicken
Loosely cover with foil.  Bake 30-40 min. or until top is browned and chicken is cooked through.
Chop tomatoes and combine with last ingredients.
Spoon mixture over chicken and return to oven for 5-7 min. or until heated through.
