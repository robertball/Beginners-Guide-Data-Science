Ingredients:
2 cups flour
2/3 cup water
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons softened, real butter
olive oil
cornmeal

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Combine first five ingredients until mixture forms a ball. Coat a clean countertop with a little olive oil and knead dough till soft and elastic, adding oil little by little, as needed.
Roll to desired thinness and place on oiled pizza pan sprinkled with cornmeal. Spread a little olive oil over top of crust, to keep sauce from soaking into crust, then top with desired ingredients.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until edges of crust are a light golden brown.
