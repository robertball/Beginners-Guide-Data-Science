Ingredients:
1/4 cup bacon drippings
3 pounds pork spareribs
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup prepared mustard
1/4 cup light molasses
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons vinegar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat bacon drippings in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Place spareribs in the skillet, and brown on each side for about 5 minutes. Season with garlic salt and pepper.
In a medium bowl, mix mustard, molasses, soy sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce.
Place browned ribs in a large baking dish. Cover with the mustard sauce mixture.
Bake 2 1/2 to 3 hours in the preheated oven, basting occasionally with the sauce mixture, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
This recipe is one that has been passed down two generations. They taste like no other ribs I have ever tried. They are sweet and tangy just like the name says. They seem to come straight from the Orient. Lots of raves on this one. Very yummy.
