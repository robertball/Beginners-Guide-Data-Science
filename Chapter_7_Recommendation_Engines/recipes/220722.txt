Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package kluski noodles
1 pound bacon, chopped
1 head cabbage, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHotÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in kluski noodles and return to a boil. Cook kluski noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain well and set noodles aside.
Place chopped bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until evenly browned, 5 to 8 minutes.
Cook and stir cabbage and onion into the bacon and drippings until the cabbage is wilted and tender, about 10 minutes.
Gently mix the cooked kluski noodles into cabbage mixture; season with hot sauce.
