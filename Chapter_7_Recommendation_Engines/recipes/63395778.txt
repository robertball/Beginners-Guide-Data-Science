Ingredients:
1 cup old fashioned oats, not quick cook
1 Tbs. whole flax seeds, optional
2 1/2 Tbs. brown sugar, packed
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 tsp. allspice
1/8 tsp. nutmeg
1/2 tsp. lemon zest
1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. vanilla
2 tsp. butter, softened
3/4 cup pumpkin puree
3/4 cup milk
topping: 1/4 cup pecans, chopped
2 tsp. butter, softened
1 Tbs. brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Grease 4 individual sized ramekins.  Set aside.
Combine the oats through salt in a medium sized bowl.  Stir well.
In a separate bowl, combine the vanilla, butter, pumpkin, and milk.  Whisk thoroughly and pour into the oats.  Stir until combined.
Divide mixture evenly between 4 ramekins.  Place ramekins on a baking sheet (this makes it easier to move in and out of the oven}.
Bake at 375 degrees for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the ingredients for the topping: chopped pecans, butter and brown sugar.
After the oatmeal has baked for 10 minutes, remove and divide topping mixture evenly between the ramekins and bake an additional 7 minutes.
Cool for 5 minutes before serving.
Top with a splash of milk and raisins, if desired.
