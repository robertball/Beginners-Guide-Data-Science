Ingredients:
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
2 cups cold milk
2 cups sour cream
2 (3.9 ounce) packages instant chocolate pudding mix
TOPPING:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk
2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, melted and cooled

Directions:
On a lightly floured surface, roll pastry into a 12-in. square. With a sharp knife, cut into twelve 4-in. x 3-in. rectangles. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 9-12 minutes or until puffed and golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.
In a small bowl, whisk milk and sour cream until smooth. Add pudding mix; whisk for 2 minutes or until blended. Refrigerate for 5 minutes. To assemble, split each pastry in half. Spoon pudding mixture over bottom halves and replace tops. Combine confectioners' sugar and milk until smooth; drizzle over top. Drizzle with melted chocolate. Serve immediately.
