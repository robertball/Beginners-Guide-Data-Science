Ingredients:
4 eggs at room temperature
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
4 slices of bread (any kind)
4 teaspoons softened butter
Paprika
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Separate the eggs, keeping the yolks in individual cups (or in their shells in cups).  Beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar on high speed for 5 minutes or more, until very stiff.
Spread 1 teaspoon of butter on one side of each slice of bread and place bread on a cookie sheet with the buttered side facing up.
Spoon 1/4 of the egg whites onto each piece of bread.  Form a 'nest' on each, making a well in the center of the nest for the egg yolk to be placed.  Carefully drop one yolk into each nest.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika, as desired.
Bake in oven for 10 minutes or until egg whites are golden.  The yolks will still be runny.  Serve immediately.

Egg Nests are great way to impress your friends for breakfast.  I learned this technique from my Mom who always made Egg Nests on special occasions.  My wife and I now make them often.
