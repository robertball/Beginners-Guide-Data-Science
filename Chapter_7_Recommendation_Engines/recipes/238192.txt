Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup cold butter, cut into chunks
3/4 cup cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup milk, or as needed
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon milk, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Whisk flour, sugar, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Cut cold butter pieces into flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Fold cream cheese into butter mixture.
Stir a small amount of the 3/4 cup milk into cream cheese mixture, continuing to add milk until the dough is sticky. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead until the dough is soft, 1 to 5 minutes.
Roll or cut dough into desired shape and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Brush 1 tablespoon milk over the top of the dough.
Bake shortbread in the preheated oven until golden brown and fragrant, 15 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
A shortbread I created for strawberry shortcake or even peach shortcake. The size and shape of these are really up to you. Baking time can vary; you are looking for a golden brown top.
