Gently lower 6 eggs into large saucepan of boiling water, reduce heat to medium, and simmer 6 minutes for soft-boiled eggs. Drain. Cover eggs with cold water and cool. Very gently crack and peel eggs.
Whisk remaining 3 eggs, buttermilk, and sriracha in medium bowl. Whisk both flours in another medium bowl. Mix panko and coarse salt in another medium bowl. Working with 1 soft-boiled egg at a time, gently roll in flour mixture, then egg mixture, then panko mixture. Place on rimmed baking sheet.
Preheat oven to 325°F. Pour enough oil into large saucepan to reach depth of 2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pan. Heat oil to 375°F. Working in 2 batches, fry eggs until brown, turning occasionally, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer fried eggs to ovenproof plate and place in oven 3 minutes to heat through.
Spoon 1/4 cup remoulade into center of each of 6 plates; top each with 1 egg. Garnish with dandelion greens.
