Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
2 large eggs
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1 cup fresh lemon juice
Grated lemon rind (optional)

Directions:
In large microwave safe bowl, whisk sugar and eggs.  Add melted butter, whisking to combine.  Finally add lemon juice and option lemon rind, whisking until smooth.  Put the bowl on a plate (to catch any bubble-overs), place in the microwave, and cook in 1-minute increments, stirring after each.  Depending on the power of your microwave, it should take 8-10 minutes on High.  Curd will just be thickening and will coat the back of a spoon.  Serve warm over gingerbread or refrigerate to thicken.

Description: 
Be sure to use a large enough microwave safe bowl because this will boil up.  I used my 8 cup Pyrex measuring cup.  This recipe comes courtesy of King Arthur Flour.
