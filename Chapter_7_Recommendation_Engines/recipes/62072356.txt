Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 tbs sugar
90 g butter, chopped
1 cup plain flour
2 eggs
vegetable oil for deep frying
ANISEED SUGAR
5 star Anise
1/2 cup sugar

Directions:
Combine water, sugar and butter in pan and stir over heat until butter is melted; bring to boil. Add flour all at once until mixture forms a ball. Remove from heat, beat eggs 1 at a time, beat until thick & smooth.
Place mixture into a piping bag fitted with a star tube.  Pipe 6cm tubes of dough onto a board.  Deep fry fritters in batches in hot oil for 5 minutes or until lightly browned and cooked through. Drain on paper and toss  hot fritters in Aniseed Sugar.
Aniseed Sugar
Blend star anise with sugar until sugar is powdery and star anise is ground finely.  Place through a sieve to remove only large pieces of Star Anise.
Do Not have all too hot or Churros will brown too quickly before cooking through.
