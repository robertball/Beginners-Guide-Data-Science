Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2 inch strips
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon fish sauce
2 teaspoons peanut oil
4 shallots, minced
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
2 small red chile peppers, seeded and minced
1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter
1 3/4 cups coconut milk
2 teaspoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce
1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice
12 wooden skewers, soaked in water for 1 hour

Directions:
Toss chicken, garlic, ginger, and 1 tablespoon fish sauce in a bowl until the chicken is coated in the marinade. Cover, and marinate for 1 hour.
While the chicken is marinating, heat the peanut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in shallots, garlic, ginger, and chile peppers. Cook and stir until the shallot begins to turn golden brown, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and stir in peanut butter, coconut milk, soy sauce, brown sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce, and lime juice until blended. Simmer very gently for 10 minutes, then remove from heat and keep warm.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread chicken onto skewers.
Grill chicken skewers on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side. Serve with warm peanut sauce.
