Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 cups finely crushed vanilla wafers (48 wafers) or shortbread cookies (33 cookies)
1 14 - ounce can sweetened condensed milk
1 cup butterscotch-flavored pieces, candy-coated milk caramels (such as Sugar Babies®), snipped* vanilla caramels, semisweet chocolate pieces, or red and green candy-coated milk chocolate pieces
1 6 - ounce package white baking chocolate, white confectionery bars, chopped, or 1 cup white baking pieces
1 cup mixed dried fruit bits, coarsely chopped dried apricots, golden raisins, dried cranberries or dried cherries
1 1/3 cups flaked or shredded coconut
1 cup unsalted mixed nuts or lightly salted roasted cashew pieces, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 13x9x2-inch baking pan with foil, extending the foil over the edges of the pan. Place butter in prepared pan; place in oven about 5 minutes or until butter is melted. (Leave oven on.) Tilt pan to coat bottom evenly. Sprinkle with crushed wafers.
Drizzle crust evenly with sweetened condensed milk. Sprinkle with butterscotch-flavored pieces, chopped white chocolate, fruit bits, coconut and nuts. Press down firmly with the back of a spoon.
Bake 25 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool in pan on a wire rack. Use foil to lift it out of pan. Cut into bars. (To store, place bars in a single layer in an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months.) Makes 30 bars.
