Ingredients:
2 (4 inch) frozen round waffles
1 egg, beaten
1 slice Co-Jack or American cheese

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Generously coat baking sheet with cooking spray. Place waffles on baking sheet.
Spoon egg over waffles, spreading to fill cavities. Bake in 400 degrees F oven until egg is set and waffles are crisp, 10 to 12 minutes.
Top one waffle with cheese. Cover with remaining waffle and press together. Let stand 1 minute to allow cheese to melt.

Submitter: 
American Egg Board
Description: 
This oven-baked waffle sandwich is like a cross between French toast and grilled cheese, savory and scrumptious.
