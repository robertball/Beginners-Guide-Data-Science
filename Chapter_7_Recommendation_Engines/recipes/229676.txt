Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can jellied cranberry sauce
2 (3 ounce) packages black cherry-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-O®)
1 3/4 cups boiling water
1 (16 ounce) carton sour cream

Directions:
Mash jellied cranberry sauce in a 3-quart bowl. Stir gelatin mix thoroughly into cranberry sauce. Pour boiling water into mixture and stir until gelatin has dissolved completely, about 3 minutes.
Chill in refrigerator until softly set, 2 to 3 hours. Gently fold sour cream into gelatin mixture, leaving marbled streaks of sour cream and gelatin mix. Return to refrigerator until firmly set, 4 hours to overnight. Store leftovers in refrigerator.

Description: 
Great alternative to the typical cranberry salad served at Thanksgiving. This is a recipe that I have been making for so long that it is permanently imbedded in my memory. Very easy and delicious too.
