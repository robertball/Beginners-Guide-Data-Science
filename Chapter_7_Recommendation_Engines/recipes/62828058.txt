Ingredients:
2 ½ Cups Sugar
1 ¼ Cup Vegetable oil
4 Eggs
4 teaspoons Vanilla
3 Cups All-purpose flour
1 Tablespoon Cinnamon
1 ½ teaspoons Salt
1 ½ teaspoons Baking soda
½ teaspoons baking powder
4 Cups Shredded zucchini

Directions:
Grease and flour two loaf pans very well.  For best results line the bottom with parchment paper.
Beat the sugar, oil, eggs and vanilla until well mixed.  Add the flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder and cinnamon and mix until well blended.  In a clean towel, wring the moisture from the zucchini and then mix into the batter until well mixed.
Bake at 350º for 55 to 65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.

Description: 
My tried and true zucchini bread recipe.  I've tried many zucchini bread recipes but I always come back to this one.  In fact, if I don't make this zucchini bread the family complains.
