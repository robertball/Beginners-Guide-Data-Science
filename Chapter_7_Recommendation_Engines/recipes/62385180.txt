Ingredients:
1/4 C Butter
1/4 C Sugar
1/4 C Light Brown Sugar
1 egg
1/2 tsp Vanilla
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 C Flour
1 C Oatmeal
pinch Salt
1/4 tsp Baking Powder
1 cup shredded sweetened coconut
1/4 C chopped pecans
1/2 C Craisins (dried, sweetened cranberries)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375
Cream butter, add sugar, eggs and vanilla.
Mix flour, oatmeal, cinnamon, baking powder and salt.
Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture until well combined.
Add remaining ingredients and stir to combine.
Drop batter about the size of golf balls on a lightly greased pan.
Press mounds down with plastic wrap or parchment paper.
Bake for 10 mins at 375.  Cookies will not look quite done, but overcooking them will make them hard.
Let cool for a minute or two on the cookie sheet.  Transfer to cooling rack.
