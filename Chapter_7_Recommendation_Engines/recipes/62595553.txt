Ingredients:
* 1  2 1/2- to 3-pound  boneless beef chuck pot roast
* 1  medium  onion, cut into thin wedges
* 3  cloves  garlic, minced
* 1/4  teaspoon  salt
* 1/4  teaspoon  ground black pepper
* 1  16-ounce can  whole cranberry sauce
* 2  to 3 teaspoons  finely chopped chipotle pepper in adobo sauce
*     6-inch flour tortillas
*     Salsa (optional)
*     Fresh jalapeño chile peppers, sliced* (optional)
*     Lime wedges (optional)

Directions:
1. Trim fat from meat. If necessary, cut meat to fit into a 3 1/2- or 4-quart slow cooker. Place onion in the cooker. Add meat; sprinkle with garlic, salt, and black pepper. In a small bowl, combine cranberry sauce and chipotle pepper. Pour over meat.
2. Cover and cook on low-heat setting for 8 to 10 hours or on high-heat setting for 4 to 5 hours.
3. Transfer meat to a serving platter. Skim fat from onion mixture. Serve meat and onion mixture with tortillas. If desired, garnish with salsa, jalapeño pepper and/or lime wedges. Makes 6 servings
*Tip:Because chile peppers contain volatile oils that can burn your skin and eyes, avoid direct contact with them as much as possible. When working with chile peppers, wear plastic or rubber gloves. If your bare hands do touch the peppers, wash your hands and nails well with soap and warm water.
