Ingredients:
3 small potatoes, peeled and cut into small pieces
2 (10.5 ounce) cans chicken gravy
1 1/2 cups frozen peas and carrots
1 1/2 cups chopped leftover chicken
2 (9 inch) refrigerated pie crusts
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain and season potatoes with salt.
Combine cooked potatoes, gravy, peas and carrots, and chicken in a bowl.
Press 1 crust into a 9-inch pie pan. Pour potato mixture into crust and cover with second crust. Pinch edges to close pie, and trim off any excess from edges. Make a small cut in the center of the crust. Brush the top with beaten egg.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 35 minutes.
