Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

1/3 cup virgin coconut oil, melted
1 large egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; make a well in the center of the flour mixture.
Beat milk, coconut oil, egg, and vanilla extract together in another bowl; pour into well in the flour mixture and stir until batter is just combined.
Ladle batter into preheated waffle iron and cook until golden and crisp, 2 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
Healthy fat and healthy grain waffle. Freeze well for quick toaster breakfast! Recipe yield is for thin waffles; I'd guess at least half that for Belgian waffles. I like to top with sliced banana.
