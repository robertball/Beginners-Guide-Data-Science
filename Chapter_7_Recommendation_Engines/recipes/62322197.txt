Ingredients:
½ cup dry roasted unsalted peanuts
½ cup roasted sunflower seeds or other chopped nuts
1 cup raisins, cranberries or other chopped dried fruit
1 cup chopped Michigan cherries
2 cups rolled or instant oats
2 cups toasted rice cereal, such as Rice Krispies
½ cup creamy or crunchy natural peanut butter
½ cup packed brown sugar
½ cup light corn syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Combine peanuts, sunflower seeds (or other nuts), raisins (or other dried fruit), cherries, oats and rice cereal in a large bowl.
In a second microwave-safe bowl, combine peanut butter, brown sugar and corn syrup; microwave on high until bubbling, one to two minutes. Add vanilla and stir until blended.
Pour the peanut butter mixture over the dry ingredients and stir until coated. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan. Coat your fingers with cooking spray and then press down firmly. Let stand for about one hour to harden. Cut into 16 bars.
Individually wrap bars in plastic and keep at room temperature for up to one week or freeze for up to one month. Thaw at room temperature.
