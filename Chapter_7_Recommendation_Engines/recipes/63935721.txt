Ingredients:
1 cup soy sauce
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon honey
1 dash lemon juice
6 chicken thighs, skinned
1 cup ketchup
1/2 cup cocktail sauce
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 1/2 teaspoons ground dry mustard

Directions:
In a saucepan over medium heat, mix the soy sauce, water, brown sugar, honey, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and cool.
Place the thighs in a large, resealable plastic bag. Pour the soy sauce mixture into the bag, seal, and marinate in the refrigerator overnight (at least 4 hours).
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Drain the thighs, and discard remaining marinade. Arrange the thighs in a baking dish, cover, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven.
In a bowl, blend the ketchup, cocktail sauce, brown sugar, water, and mustard. Pour over the thighs, and continue baking 30 minutes, till inner juices are clear.
