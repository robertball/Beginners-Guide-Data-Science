Ingredients:
Olive oil
4-5 cherry tomatoes, chopped into 1/4s or 1/8s
3 small mozzarella balls, chopped into 1/4s or 1/8s
Dash of dried basil
Dash of dried oregano
Dash of garlic powder
1 egg, beaten
1 slice bread
Butter (for bread)
Salt & fresh ground pepper, to taste
Dash of chopped basil (optional)

Directions:
Heat a small amount of olive oil over medium heat.  Add chopped tomatoes and dried basil, dried oregano, and garlic powder.  Cook for a few minutes, stirring frequently, until tomatoes and softened and slightly blackened.  Remove tomatoes from heat and set aside.
Toast bread.  Add butter when completed.
Add a small amount of oil to pan that was used for tomatoes.  Add egg and cook.  (It is better if you cook it so it is soft of flat and then fold over, so it lies nicely on the toast later.)
When egg is cooked, lay on top of toast.  Top with tomatoes and chopped mozzarella.  Garnish with salt, pepper, and basil (optional).
