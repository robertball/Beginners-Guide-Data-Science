Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 1/2 cups chopped carrots
3/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup filtered or spring water
1/4 cup soy milk
1 tablespoon miso paste
1/2 cup roasted cashews
3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 1/2 tablespoons real maple syrup
1 1/2 teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder

Directions:
Heat canola oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Cook carrots and onion, stirring occasionally, until carrots are tender and onions are translucent. Do not allow the onions to brown. Add water, and bring to a boil. Cover, and simmer for 15 minutes; set aside to cool.
When mixture is cool enough to process safely, transfer to a blender or food processor. Add soy milk, miso paste, cashews, salt, maple syrup, and Chinese five-spice powder. Blend until smooth. Cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.

Description: 
This is a healthy, delicious, organic vegan recipe for a yummy spread for warm crusty bread. I tried to imitate a spread I tasted at a very popular Vegan restaurant in Los Angeles and bring it home to Montreal to serve to my many vegan friends. This is almost exactly the same...even a little better!
