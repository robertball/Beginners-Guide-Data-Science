Description: 
I am 59 years old, and this recipe was an original from the personal collection of my Grandma's dear friend Maudie, an elderly housewife who lived on an Indiana farm that was blessed with an abundance of persimmon trees. The recipe was created during the time of the Great Depression, so it is very old. As Grandma always said, 'You did with what you had.'
