Ingredients:
2 eggs
3/4 cups lightly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 large apples, unpeeled, grated (about 1 1/2 cups)
1 cup large flake oats, plus a bit more for top of muffins
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup raisins
1 1/2 cups flour
2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven at 350
In large bowl, mix together  the eggs, sugar, oil, oats, apples, vanilla and raisins.  Let sit approx 5-10 minutes while preparing the rest of the recipe.
In a separate bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon.
Grease muffin tin
Add dry ingredients and walnuts to wet ingredients.  Stir until just moistened.   Do not over-mix.
Fill muffin tins.  Top each muffin with a pinch of oatmeal.
Bake at 350 for approx. 25-30 mins until no longer moist in middle.  Cool the muffins in pan on a rack 5 minutes before removing them from the muffin pan.

Description: 
These muffins are just the right balance of sweet and healthy.  They're tasty, moist and very easy to make.  You can hike up the health factor by reducing the oil and substituting 1/2 of it with apple sauce.  I  mix the oatmeal and raisins with the wet ingredients and let them sit a few minutes to soften them a bit before baking.
