Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a (10 inch) single crust pie
1 cup white sugar
2 egg yolks
1 tablespoon quick-cooking tapioca
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 cup milk
1 quart fresh blueberries
2 egg whites
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prepare pie pastry, and place into a 10 inch deep dish pie pan.
In a large bowl, whip egg yolks with an electric mixer on high speed until pale. Gradually add 1 cup sugar while mixing. Mix until sugar has completely dissolved, and the yolks are thick and pale. This will take up to 15 minutes. Mix in the tapioca, salt and lemon juice. Stir in the milk, and then carefully fold in the blueberries. In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites to stiff peaks. Fold egg whites into the blueberry mixture.
Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar with the flour, and sprinkle into the bottom of the unbaked pie crust. This will absorb extra juice, and keep the pie from leaking. Pour the filling into the prepared crust.
Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for an additional 40 to 60 minutes, or until pie is set.

Description: 
Well over 100 years old, this recipe has been part of my family forever.  My Grandmother, born in the 1880's taught it to us, and who taught it to her, I have no clue.  It turns out to be a very large pie with a layer of custard, topped with a layer of blueberries, and then a layer of meringue.  If you like blueberries, its a keeper.  My Grandma always said that you could make a smaller pie by using a pint of blueberries, but we have never tested that theory.
