Ingredients:
3 tablespoons palm sugar
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, cut into thin slivers
1/2 head cauliflower, chopped into bite-size pieces
1 carrot, peeled and sliced
1 cucumber, cut into bite-size pieces
8 baby corn, sliced
1 cup peas
1 large red bell pepper, sliced
1 tomato, cut into bite-size pieces
1/4 fresh pineapple, cut into bite-size chunks

Directions:
Stir the palm sugar, lime juice, fish sauce, oyster sauce, and soy sauce together in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until the sugar is completely dissolved; bring to a simmer. Set aside.
Heat the oil in a large skillet; fry the garlic in the hot oil until browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the onion; cook for 1 minute. Stir the cauliflower and carrot into the mixture; cook and stir for 1 minute. Mix the cucumber, corn, and peas into the mixture; cook for 1 more minute. Stir the bell pepper and tomato into the mixture; cook 1 minute. Pour the sauce over the mixture, add the pineapple, and toss so the entire mixture is evenly coated in sauce; cook another minute. Serve hot.
