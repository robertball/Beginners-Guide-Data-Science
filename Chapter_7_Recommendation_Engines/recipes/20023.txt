Ingredients:
4 cups asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
12 dinner rolls
1 1/2 cups diced processed American cheese
2 1/2 cups cooked ham, coarsely chopped
6 eggs
3 cups milk
3 tablespoons minced onion
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
If using raw asparagus: place a steamer basket or insert and two cups of water into a small stock pot. Bring water to a boil and then add the asparagus.  Cook until tender but still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain and let cool.
Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Split dinner rolls in half and set top half aside. Tear bottom half of rolls into pieces and spread evenly in pan. Layer asparagus, cheese and ham over bread pieces. Arrange remaining half of rolls on top of other ingredients.
Beat together eggs, milk, onion, salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture into pan and refrigerate over night.
Remove pan from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking and preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake uncovered until a knife inserted into center of pan comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Let stand about 10 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
I make this for breakfast/brunch the day after Easter. It's a great way to use up leftover dinner rolls and cooked vegetables. Everything bakes in one pan so assembling this dish is easy.  You can substitute spinach for the asparagus and add mozzarella cheese if you wish.
