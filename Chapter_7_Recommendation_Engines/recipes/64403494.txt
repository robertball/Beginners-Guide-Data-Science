Ingredients:
1.5 cups unsweetened regular almond milk
1/3 cup chia seeds
1/4 cup cacao or unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)
1/4 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
2-5 tbsp maple syrup or other sweetener (I used 4 tbsp)

Directions:
Add all ingredients except sweetener to a mixing bowl and whisk vigorously to combine.  Add sweetener to taste.
Pour into individual serving cups if desired, or just leave in the mixing bowl if you're not too fancy.  Place in refrigerator for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.
OPTIONAL: Place in blender to blend in the little chia seed bubbles.
Serve with optional toppings - fruit, whipped cream, mini chocolate chips, mini M&Ms, peanut butter.
