Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 large green pepper, diced fine
1 small onion, diced fine
2 cups marinara sauce
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
Cooking spray
1 package wonton wrappers (about 48 wraps)

Directions:
1. In a medium skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat until hot. Add in garlic, green pepper and onion. Cook until softened, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in marinara and mozzarella.
2. Preheat oven to 375Â°.
3. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Arrange three wonton wrappers along the bottom edge of the sheet. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of filling into the middle of each wrapper. Using a finger dipped in water, run along the edge of each wrapper and then fold wrapper in half and press down to seal. Continue until baking sheet is filled with pizza rolls (spaced about 1? apart). Spray tops with cooking spray and bake in preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until rolls are golden and crispy. Repeat process with remaining wraps and filling.
4. Let cool 5-10 minutes before serving (filling will be hot).
