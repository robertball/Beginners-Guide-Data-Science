Ingredients:
1 (18 ounce) package Betty Crocker® Carrot Cake Mix
1 cup water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 (12 ounce) can Betty Crocker® Whipped fluffy white ready-to-spread frosting
1 cup flaked coconut
construction paper
jelly beans or small gumdrops
1 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 . Grease (or lightly spray with cooking spray) bottoms only of two 8-inch or 9-inch round pans. Beat cake mix, water, oil and eggs in large bowl on low speed 30 seconds. Beat on medium speed 2 minutes. Pour into pans.
Bake 8-inch pans 25 to 30 minutes, 9-inch pans 22 to 27 minutes. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pans. Cool completely, about 1 hour.  Reserve one layer for another use or to make a second bunny. Cut 1 layer in half as shown in  diagram (see Note).  Put halves together with frosting to form body. Place cake upright on cut edge on tray.
Cut out a notch about one-third of the way up one end of body to form head (small end) as shown in diagram. Attach half of cutout piece for tail with toothpicks. Frost with remaining frosting, rounding body on sides. Sprinkle with 1 cup coconut. Cut ears from construction paper; press into top. Use jelly beans for eyes and nose.
Shake 1 cup coconut and 3 drops food color in tightly covered jar until evenly tinted. Surround bunny with tinted coconut. Add additional jelly beans if desired. Store loosely covered.
