Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) containers lowfat vanilla yogurt, no gelatin added
1 pint fresh strawberries
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup HERSHEYÂ®'S Cocoa Powder
2 tablespoons hot water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
2 (1.3 ounce) envelopes whipped topping mix
1 cup cold nonfat milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large bananas, sliced

Directions:
YOGURT CHEESE:  Line non-rusting colander or sieve with large piece of double thickness cheesecloth or large coffee filter; place colander over deep bowl.  Spoon two 8-oz. containers vanilla lowfat yogurt, no gelatin added, into prepared colander; cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate until liquid no longer drains from yogurt, about 24 hours.  Remove yogurt from cheesecloth and place in separate bowl; discard liquid.
Reserve 3 strawberries for garnish; set aside.  Remove hulls of remaining strawberries; cut strawberries in half vertically; set aside.
Stir together sugar, cocoa and water in small bowl until smooth and well blended.  Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Gradually stir in Yogurt Cheese and orange peel, if desired; blend thoroughly.
Prepare whipped topping mix in large bowl as directed on package using 1 cup milk and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla; fold into chocolate mixture.
Carefully spoon one-half of chocolate mixture into 1-1/2-quart glass serving dish; place one-half of strawberry halves, cut sides out, around inside of entire bowl.  Layer banana slices over chocolate mixture.  Cut remaining strawberry halves into smaller pieces; layer over banana slices.  Carefully spread remaining chocolate mixture over fruit.  Cover; refrigerate several hours before serving.  Garnish with reserved strawberries.  Cover; refrigerate leftover dessert.
