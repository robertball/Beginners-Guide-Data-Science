Ingredients:
Cookies:
1 cup pumpkin puree
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup butter
3 eggs
1 tablespoon milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped pecans

1 teaspoon baking soda
Glaze:
2 cups powdered sugar
3 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 cookie sheets.

Description: 
A very good friend of mine gave me this pumpkin-pecan cookie recipe when I was searching for just the right cookie around Thanksgiving. These were by far the best I have ever tried and are simple to make. The recipe can be cut in half, because as is, it makes around 2 dozen. I would also love to know any alterations that make them any better! Enjoy!
