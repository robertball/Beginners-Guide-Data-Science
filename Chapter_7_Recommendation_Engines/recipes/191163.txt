Ingredients:
½ cup sliced almonds
½ cup butter
¾ cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups oatmeal
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread the almonds onto a baking sheet; toast until the nuts are golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes.  Remove nuts from baking sheet, and reserve.
Melt butter in a small saucepan placed over medium heat.  Stir in brown sugar; cook, stirring, until sugar has dissolved and mixture is bubbly.  Remove from heat.  Stir in vanilla and oatmeal.  Press mixture into an 8 x 8 inch baking pan.  Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned and set, about 20 minutes.
Remove from oven, and allow to cool slightly.  Sprinkle chocolate chips over surface; let chocolate sit until melted, 2 to 3 minutes.  Spread chocolate evenly over oatmeal squares.  Sprinkle warm chocolate with toasted almonds.  Cut into squares when cool.
