Ingredients:
1 (4 ounce) package Idahoan® Butter & Herb or Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/3 cup green onions, chopped
1/4 cup red bell pepper, diced
1 tablespoon Italian parsley, coarsely chopped
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons Old Bay Seasoning™
1 teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning
16 ounces cooked crab meat*
1 cup panko (Japanese-style breading)

Watercress leaves (optional)
Lemon Aioli:
