Yam or sweet potato casserole Recipe

Ingredients:
6-8 yams or sweet potatoes
orange juice (either fresh orange cut in half and squeeze into dish or 1/3 cup orange juice)
1 or 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, & all spice)
2 tbs condensed milk or cream
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 to 3/4 cup brown sugar (depending on how sweet you like it)
If desired, cover with small marshmallows

Directions:
Wash yams or sweet potatoes
Two ways to cook, either way be sure water covers potatoes
Either bring to boil over stove top and turn down to 5/medium for 30 mins, drain the water, let the potatoes cool a bit then the skins will peel right off for you OR my new favorite way because you can do this this day before, put them in the crock pot on high and leave them for 4 hours, then all you need to do is dump the hot water, let them cool and the skins peel themselves!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
As your skinning potatoes, put them into the cooking dish that you've oiled or sprayed with cooking spray, I like olive oil.
Mash with a fork or potato masher
Add all ingredients (except marshmallows) and mash/stir together
Put marshmallows on top and cover (if too much liquid, leave uncovered)

Description: 
I have adapted a few of the other awesome casserole dishes and simplified it. One change is you could add butter, however, I like it without the butter. For new moms, cook the potatoes, leave out the ingredients except the orange juice and you've made baby food.
