Description: 
I love leftovers and especially during our Hewfit challenge I am hungry more often. Last night I made chicken scarpiello and packed up the extra chicken and chicken sausage and made this dish. I will share a recipe for you to cook up chicken if you don't have leftovers handy. Actually, go and pick up a rotisserie chicken. That would be super easy!
