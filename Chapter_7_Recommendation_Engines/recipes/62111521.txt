STUFFED JALAPENOS WITH SMOKED GOUDA AND PINEAPPLE Recipe

Ingredients:
1-2  dozen jalapenos
8  ounces cream cheese softened
6  ounces smoked gouda cheese grated
1  tablespoon bacon bits or 4-6 slices cooked and crumbled   bacon
1/2 (8  ounce) can crushed pineapple

Directions:
Soften cream cheese, grate the gouda, partially drain the can of crushed pineapple and combine all with the bacon bits.
While that rests cut the stem ends off 1 to 2 dozen jalapenos depending on their size. Remove the seeds and the membrane. I use a modified bread knife I ground to make thinner and sharpened the sides and top. Using a small spoon or knife stuff each jalapeno. Place the filled jalapenos in a rack and cook on he grill or in the oven at 350 for 30-45 min again depending on the size. Keep some of the cheese mixture to serve with them because some of the cheese will bubble out. I use a foil bread pan and cut X's in the bottom, place upside down and press the jalapenos into each hole. Can usually get 6-8 in each, makes cleanup easy, just throw them away after. I also have a jalapeno rack I got at a store but the foil is way easier and will accomodate various sized jalapenos. All love these with the hot peppers and the sweetness of the pineapple. The smoked gouda is a nice touch and differs greatly from chedder. Can also dice jalapeno to add to the cheese mix. ENJOY.

Description: 
This is a great appetizer for any BBQ or grilled meal. I always make them camping. I looked thru many recipes and finally decided on this. I love the sweetness of the pineapple and the slight smokey flavor of the gouda.
