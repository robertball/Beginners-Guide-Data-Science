Ingredients:
1 cup crushed butter-flavored crackers
2/3 cup finely chopped onion
1/2 cup finely chopped green pepper
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 dash ground nutmeg
1 dash paprika
1 1/3 pounds finely ground fully cooked ham
1 pound bulk pork sausage
GLAZE:
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon ground mustard

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first 11 ingredients. Add ham and sausage; mix well. Shape into two loaves. Place in ungreased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Bake one loaf at 350 degrees F for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, combine glaze ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; boil for 2 minutes. Remove loaf from the oven; drain. Baste with half of the glaze. Bake 30-40 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F-170 degrees F, basting occasionally.
Cover and freeze remaining loaf and glaze for up to 2 months. To prepare, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed.

Description: 
'This is a great way to use leftover baked ham,' recommends Audrey Thibodeau, Mesa, Arizona. 'I serve one of these loaves right away and store the other in the freezer for later. They're so nicely flavored with a variety of seasonings that everyone loves 'em!'
