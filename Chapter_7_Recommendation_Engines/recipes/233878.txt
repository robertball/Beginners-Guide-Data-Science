Ingredients:
4 ounces dried French bread, torn into bite-size pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup chopped fresh mozzarella cheese
2 cups coarsely chopped seeded red or yellow tomatoes
1 cup seeded chopped cucumber
1 cup thinly sliced red onion
1/3 cup chopped fresh basil
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
Grilled Bison Flank Steak:
1 pound bison flank steak
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Place bread pieces in a shallow baking pan. Drizzle with the 2 tablespoons oil; toss gently to coat. Bake for 5 minutes or until toasted, stirring once or twice. Cool slightly; transfer to a very large bowl.
Combine mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, cucumber, onion, and basil in a large bowl; set aside.
For dressing, whisk together vinegar, the 3 tablespoons oil, the garlic, the 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Pour dressing over the tomato mixture; toss to coat. Spoon the tomato mixture over the bread; toss to coat. Let stand for 15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Serve with Grilled Bison Flank Steak.
Grilled Bison Flank Steak: Sprinkle bison flank steak with the 1 teaspoon salt and the 1/4 teaspoon pepper. For gas or charcoal grill, place steak on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium-high heat. Grill for 8 to 10 minutes or until desired doneness. Cover bison flank steak with foil and let stand for 5 minutes. Thinly slice steak across the grain.
