Ingredients:
Coconut Chicken:
1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
2 tablespoons Smucker's速 Creamy Natural Peanut Butter
1/4 cup fat free milk
1 1/4 cups panko bread crumbs
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1 (16 ounce) package boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders
1/4 cup Crisco速 Puritan Canola Oil with Omega-3 DHA
Apricot-Ginger Sauce:
1 (10.25 ounce) jar SMUCKER'S速 Low Sugar Apricot Preserves
1 tablespoon lite soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon fresh-squeezed lemon juice
3/4 teaspoon dark Asian sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon finely grated gingerroot

Directions:
Combine seasoned salt, five spice powder, peanut butter and milk in a shallow bowl. Combine bread crumbs and coconut in another shallow bowl. Coat chicken in peanut butter mixture, dip into breading mixture. Pat to coat well.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken tenders slowly to achieve even browning, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add more oil as needed.
Combine preserves, soy sauce, lemon juice, sesame oil and gingerroot in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH 20 to 30 seconds or until warmed through; stir. Serve warm with chicken as a dipping sauce.
