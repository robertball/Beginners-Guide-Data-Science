Ingredients:
4 bunches cilantro leaves
2 bunches fresh basil, stems removed
3 cloves garlic
24 ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup olive oil
salt and pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 pounds crimini mushrooms, sliced
1 (8 ounce) jar sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped
3 (16 ounce) jars Alfredo pasta sauce
2 (16 ounce) packages fusilli pasta

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a blender or food processor, puree the cilantro, basil, and 3 cloves of garlic until minced very fine.  Thoroughly combine the herb mixture in a large bowl with the Parmesan, and 1/4 cup of olive oil; season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pack the mixture firmly, about 1 inch thick, into a medium-sized, glass baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until the top is lightly browned and crispy, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove from oven, stir well, and return to the oven for an additional 5 to 7 minutes until golden brown.  Remove from the oven, break apart with a spoon, and allow to cool.
While the crunchy stuff is baking, heat olive oil in a large pan over low heat.  Lightly brown 2 tablespoons of garlic, stir in the mushrooms, and cook until softened.  Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, and Alfredo sauce; cook to warm.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.  To serve, toss pasta in sauce, and sprinkle with crunchy stuff!
