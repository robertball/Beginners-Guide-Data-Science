Ingredients:
4 Flour Tortillas
4 cups shredded cheese - I used sharp cheddar
~2 cups cooked hot Italian sausage or meat of choice or eliminate all together if you have no left overs.
1 - 8 ounce Philadelphia Cream Cheese (can use fat free)
1 - 4.5 ounce chopped green chilies-optional
1 - 26.5 Bush’s Black Beans low sodium - drained and rinsed
½ can Rotel Tomatoes (can use entire can if you like)
Picante sauce for topping
Chopped scallions for topping (only green part)

Directions:
In a saucepan, heat the black beans with the Rotel tomatoes.
Put the cream cheese in a microwave safe dish and microwave for ~ 45 seconds to soften.  Once soften, add the green chilies and mix.
On a non stick baking sheet, place two flour tortillas side by side.
Layer the cream cheese/green chili mixture on both tortillas.
Top with black bean/rotel mixture.
Top with some shredded cheese.
Add sausage or meat of choice or none.
Top with remaining cheese and place the other two flour tortillas on top of each.
Can also put some shredded cheese on top.
Bake @ 350º for 20 or so minutes. You can tell when they are ready as the cheese will be bubbly. Do not let the top of the tortilla brown.
Cut in triangles and place on platter. Sprinkle with scallions and serve with your favorite hot sauce.

Description: 
Had surprise company drop by and I wanted to make a quick appetizer. There are a few things I always have on hand  Rotel tomatoes, green chilies, and black beans. Refrigerator  cheese and cream cheese. 
Possibilities are endless  you can use Canadian bacon versus sausage or leave the meat out all together. I have made a quick veggie quesadilla with just feta cheese, mozzarella cheese, olives, tomatoes and mushrooms.
For this particular recipe is what I had on hand.  YCI Quesadillas came to be and they were fast and delish!
