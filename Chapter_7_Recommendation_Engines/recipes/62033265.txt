Ingredients:
1 small jar plain marinara sauce
1 jar 7.5 oz., roasted red peppers
1 bottle balsamic vinigrette OR
1 bottle Italin salad dressing
8 slices Mozzarella cheese
1/2 tsp. dried Oregano
1/2 tsp. dried basil

Directions:
Brush off the mushroom to remove any dirt and remove the stems.  Place in large zip-lock bag with half of the bottle of salad dressing, gently squeeze out air and seal.  Marinade for 15 minutes (longer if desired).
In a small saucepan, heat the marinara sauce till hot, turn down heat and keep warm.
Brush your grill with oil (to keep the mushrooms from sticking to it) and turn on to medium.  Grill the mushrooms till lightly browned and done. Remove from heat.
Preheat your broiler.
On a appropriate sized plate place a couple of tablespoons of the marinara sauce and rotate to cover the bottom of the plate.  Place mushroom, bottom side up,on the plate. Cover with roasted red pepper and then 2 slices of Mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle with oregano and basil.
Place under broiler until the cheese is melted. Serve hot.
