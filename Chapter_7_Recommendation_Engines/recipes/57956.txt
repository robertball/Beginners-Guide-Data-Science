Ingredients:
1 gallon distilled water
1 (750 milliliter) bottle white wine
1 1/2 cups salt
2 orange, quartered
2 tablespoons dried rosemary

Directions:
Line a large stockpot with a large food safe bag. Pour the water, wine, and salt into the bag; stir until the salt is completely dissolved. Squeeze the orange quarters into the liquid and then drop them into the pot. Add the rosemary and give a final stir.
To use, carefully lower a thawed turkey into the brine and tie the bag to seal; store in refrigerator at least 5 hours before cooking.
