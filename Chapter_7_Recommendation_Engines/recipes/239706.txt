Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup quinoa, rinsed and drained
1/4 teaspoon ground sage
1 fresh basil leaf
3 asparagus spears, chopped
1 tablespoon crumbled goat cheese
1 teaspoon chia seeds

Directions:
Stir water, quinoa, sage, and basil leaf together in a saucepan; bring water to a boil, cover saucepan with a lid, reduce heat to low, and cook until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes.
Remove basil leaf from quinoa mixture and discard. Stir asparagus, goat cheese, and chia seeds into the quinoa mixture; replace lid on saucepan and let the mixture steam until the goat cheese melts and the asparagus softens slightly, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is an alternative version of my apple-cinnamon quinoa breakfast. I like this because it is a savory option for those mornings I don't want sweet.
