Description: 
If you haven’t noticed by now… I love one-pot cooking. Especially when the pan can go from the stove to the table!
These meal came to me while I was walking around the produce department not knowing what to make for dinner and I spotted the Tomatillo on sale! Immediately braised chicken came to me and created this delicious recipe. I hope you try my Braised Chicken with Tomatillo Salsa and it follows the Paleo diet and is gluten free.
