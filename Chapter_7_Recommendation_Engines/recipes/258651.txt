Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 bulb fennel, cored and finely chopped
1 onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon water
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 cup brown rice, rinsed well
2 cups vegetable stock, warmed
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a nonstick saucepan over medium heat. Add fennel, onion, water, and garlic; cook and stir until onion starts to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice until coated with oil and lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir 1 cup broth into the saucepan; cook until rice absorbs broth, about 5 minutes. Add broth a ladleful at time, stirring until rice is tender and creamy, 15 to 20 minutes in all. Stir in black beans; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
