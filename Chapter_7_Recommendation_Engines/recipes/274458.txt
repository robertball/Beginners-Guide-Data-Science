Ingredients:
4 cups crispy rice cereal
2 cups honey graham cereal (such as Golden Grahams®)
4 tablespoons butter
1 (10.5 ounce) package large marshmallows (such as Jet-Puffed®)
4 (1.5 ounce) milk chocolate bars (such as Hershey's®)

Directions:
Grease a 9x11-inch pan. Mix rice cereal and honey graham cereal together in a large bowl; set aside.
Melt butter over medium heat in a large saucepan. Stir in marshmallows until completely melted and combined with butter, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in cereal mixture until coated. Pour into the prepared pan and gently compress with a greased spatula.
Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave oven, heating and mixing until chocolate is melted, in 30-second increments. Spread chocolate over cereal mixture and allow to cool completely, 15 to 30 minutes. Cut and serve.
