Ingredients:
1 tablespoon high-heat oil
1/2 onion, diced
2 ribs celery, diced
1 carrot, peeled and diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 pound cooked salmon, flaked
1/4 cup mayonnaise, or to taste
1 lemon, zested
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 cup breadcrumbs, plus more for rolling

Directions:
Heat oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add onions, celery and carrots and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, fennel seeds, salt and pepper and cook for 2 additional minutes. Set aside and cool.
In a large bowl, combine cooked vegetables, salmon, mayonnaise, lemon zest and juice, and breadcrumbs. Gently mix together until incorporated. Taste and adjust lemon, salt and pepper, to taste.
Using a 1/4 cup measure, scoop cakes into equal portions. Coat in breadcrumbs; chill.
To bake cakes: Preheat oven to 400F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spray cakes with oil and bake for 5 minutes. Flip cakes over, spray again, and bake until heated through, about 5 minutes. For a crispy crust, place under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes.
To fry cakes: Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Cook until crisp and heated through, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
