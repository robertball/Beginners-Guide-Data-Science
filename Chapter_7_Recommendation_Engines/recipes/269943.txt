Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1 (12 ounce) package Hillshire Farm® Rope Smoked Sausage, cut into 1/2" coins
4 cups small broccoli florets
1 medium red bell pepper, cut into strips
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 (12 ounce) package frozen riced cauliflower
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high. Add sausage; cook about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. Add broccoli and bell pepper; cook 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until broccoli is bright green and slightly tender. Remove mixture to a plate.
Wipe skillet clean-careful, may be hot-reduce heat to medium, and add 1 tablespoon oil. Add eggs. Cook 2-3 minutes until set, stirring once or twice. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.
Return skillet to stove over medium-high. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add cauliflower; cook, undisturbed, until softened and lightly toasted, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, pepper, sausage mixture, and egg. Divide among plates and top with cilantro.
