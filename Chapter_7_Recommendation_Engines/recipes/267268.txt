Ingredients:
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
1/4 Asian pear, grated
3 tablespoons dark brown sugar
3 tablespoons minced green onions
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons fish sauce
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1 large egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, Asian pear, brown sugar, green onions, sesame oil, garlic, fish sauce, and pepper together in a large bowl. Add beef, pork, bread crumbs, and egg; mix until just combined. Do not overmix. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Form meat mixture into about 45 mini meatballs. Arrange on 2 baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and cooked through but still tender, 18 to 20 minutes. Turn baking sheets halfway through cooking time. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds.
