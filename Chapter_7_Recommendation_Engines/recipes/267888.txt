Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) refrigerated pie crust (such as PillsburyÂ®)
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
5 Roma tomatoes, or more to taste, cut into wedges
1 cup loosely packed basil leaves, coarsely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup fat-free mayonnaise
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
8 whole basil leaves (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Press pie crust into a 9-inch pan or glass pie plate; fold excess dough under and press to form a thick edge. Cover edges with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese over the bottom. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Drain tomato wedges in a colander or on paper towels. Arrange tomato wedges in the pie shell. Sprinkle basil and garlic on top.
Combine remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Spread evenly over tomatoes; do not spread onto crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden and bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes. Cover edges with a ring of foil to keep from overcooking if needed. Garnish pie with whole basil leaves and serve warm.

Description: 
Cheesy tomato basil pie is a summer staple at my house. I always make two: one for me and one to give away. Use fat-free mayonnaise to cut down on oiliness (and calories!).
