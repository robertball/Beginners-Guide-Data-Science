Ingredients:
7-8 slices bacon, preferably applewood smoked
2 Tbs light brown sugar
1 tsp yellow curry powder
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F.  Position rack to the center of the oven
Mix all but the bacon in a bowl.  Add black pepper and cayenne pepper to taste.
Place the bacon on a backing sheet with a drip rack inside.
Sprinkle the brown sugar spice mixture liberally and evenly over each slice of bacon.
Back until the bacon is crisp and glazed (about 10-14 minutes), rotating the pan once after 6 minutes.
Let the bacon cool on the rack for about 2 minutes before transferring to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
Serve warm
