Ingredients:
1/2 head cauliflower, broken into florets
3 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 cups vodka marinara sauce
5 ounces fresh spinach, trimmed
1 (20 ounce) package frozen cheese tortellini

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Put cauliflower in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over the cauliflower and toss to coat; spread onto a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper.
Roast in preheated oven until browning along the edges, 25 to 30 minutes.
Bring vodka sauce to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, add spinach, cover the pot, and cook at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the spinach wilts, 5 to 7 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add frozen tortellini and cook at a boil until the tortellini float to the surface and the filling is hot, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
Gently stir cauliflower into the tortellini. Pour warm sauce over the mixture and toss to coat.
