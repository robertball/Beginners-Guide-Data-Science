Heat one tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan and add the chicken;
Cook over a high heat for 3-4 minutes, or until the chicken is sealed all over;
Remove and set aside;
Reduce the heat and add the remaining oil;
Add the onions, garlic and ginger and fry gently, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes, until golden and softened;
Add the spice mixture and chillies and fry, stirring continuously, for 1 to 2 minutes to release the fragrance and aroma of the herbs;
Add the tomato mixture and increase the heat to bring to a boil;
Reduce to a Simmer and simmer for 10 minutes until sauce has reduced slightly;
Add the chicken and stir well;
Heat the mixture until simmering, then cook on a low heat for some 30 minutes or until the chicken is tender and cooked through;
If the sauce becomes too thick, simply add more yoghurt;
Add the green pepper and most of the coriander (reserve some for garnish) and cook for some 10 minutes more;
Taste for seasoning, garnish with coriander and serve.
