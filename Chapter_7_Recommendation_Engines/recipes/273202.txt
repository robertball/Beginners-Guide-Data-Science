Ingredients:
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon rice wine
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 tablespoon sea salt
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
½ tablespoon honey
½ tablespoon red pepper flakes
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
12 ounces green onions, cut in 1-inch pieces
1 pinch red pepper flakes

Directions:


Submitter: 
Oriana
Description: 
A common Korean, refreshing side dish; can also use chives in place of green onion. I make this salad often in the summer. It may seem like a lot of green onions, but green onions collapse easily, especially as soon as they come in contact with the spices. Reserve some green onion pieces to use a garnish if desired.
