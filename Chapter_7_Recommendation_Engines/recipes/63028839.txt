Ingredients:
For the Hollandaise Sauce:
4 egg yolks
½ cup very hot water
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
½ teaspoons salt
1 ½ cups clarified butter
For the poached eggs:
2 large fresh eggs
1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
To finish the Eggs Benedict:
2 pieces Canadian bacon
1 English muffin
Softened butter, for spreading on English muffin
1 tablespoon chopped chives

Directions:
For the Hollandaise Sauce:
Over medium heat, in the top of a double boiler, add egg yolks, cayenne, salt, and ½ of the water. Stir until mixture reaches the consistency of mayonnaise. Remove from heat. Alternating the water and butter, starting with the water, slowly add the remaining hot water and butter, whisking constantly, until gone. Adding more water will thin the sauce, adding more butter will thicken the sauce. The sauce will get thicker the longer it sits. Keep the sauce warm until ready to serve.
For the poached eggs:
Fill a large saucepan with 3 inches of water. Bring water to a gentle simmer, then add the vinegar. Carefully break eggs into simmering water. Cook for about 3 minutes. Yolks should still be soft in center. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon and gently place them on a plate. Keep eggs warm until serving.
To finish the Eggs Benedict:
Brown the Canadian bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat and toast the English muffins.
Spread toasted muffins with softened butter, and top each muffin half with a slice of bacon and one poached egg. Drizzle with Hollandaise sauce and sprinkle with chives. Serve immediately.
