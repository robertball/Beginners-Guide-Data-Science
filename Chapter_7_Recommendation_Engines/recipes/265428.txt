Ingredients:
3 cups fresh blueberries
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust
1 cup all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 cup white sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup sour cream
2 eggs
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup cold butter, cut into cubes

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread blueberries over the bottom of the graham cracker crust.
Mix 1/2 cup flour, white sugar, and salt together in a bowl.
Whisk sour cream and eggs together in a separate bowl. Fold in flour mixture. Pour batter over the blueberries.
Combine remaining 1/2 cup flour and brown sugar in a bowl. Cut in butter using a pastry cutter or 2 knives until mixture forms coarse crumbs. Scatter crumb topping over the pie.
Bake in the preheated oven until custard and topping are golden brown, 50 to 55 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool completely before serving.
