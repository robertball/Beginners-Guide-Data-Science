Ingredients:
6 lbs. or 8 pieces of Chicken, quartered, bone-in, skin on.
Chicken Spice Rub:
1 Tablespoons Brown sugar
1 Tablespoon sea salt
1/2 tsp. celery seed
1/2 tsp. mustard powder
1 tsp. oregeno
1-1/2 tsp. Garlic Powder
1-1/2 tsp. Onion Powder
1-1/2 tsp. Paprika
1/4 tsp. Cayenne
Glaze:
1/4 cup Maple syrup
1 Tablespoon Yellow mustard
1/2 Tablespoon spicy brown mustard
1/2 tsp. paprika
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/4 tsp. black pepper

Directions:
Trim any overhanging skin off the chicken pieces. Mix together the spice ingredients. Rub the spice mixture over all the chicken pieces, under the skin of the breasts too. Refrigerate up to an hour.
Mix together the glaze and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 425f. Line a baking sheet with foil and place the chicken skin side up on the sheet pan. Put the breasts in the middle, and the legs on the outside.
Cook for 15 minutes, then baste the chicken with the glaze. Rotate the pan and bake for another 15 minutes, basting again. Check on the chicken after another 10-15 minutes, basting again if needed. Use a thermometer to check doneness, thighs are perfect at 170f and breasts at 165f.
