Ingredients:
1/2 cup orzo pasta
1/4 cup butter, divided
1/2 cup chopped onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups sliced mushrooms
1 cup long grain white rice
1/2 cup chopped smoked sausage, or more to taste
3 1/2 cups chicken broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Toast orzo pasta in an oven-proof skillet over medium heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the same skillet. Cook onion and garlic until onion is slightly translucent, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until tender, about 5 more minutes. Mix with the orzo pasta.
Cook white rice in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter until rice is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in sausage and cook for 3 minutes. Mix in cooked orzo pasta and mushroom mixture; add chicken broth and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and cover with an oven-proof lid.
Bake in the preheated oven until liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Mix well.

Description: 
I'm not sure where I found the original basic recipe, but after a few tweaks, I made this rice pilaf my own. It only needs a few ingredients for a wonderful meal. Any smoked sausage of your choice will do, and you can vary the amount of mushrooms to suit your taste.
