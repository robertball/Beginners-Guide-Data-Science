Description: 
While on our honeymoon in New England, my husband and I walked into an old country store and were immediately swept off our feet by the aroma of soup that was cooking. We each ordered a bowl and found it to be absolutely delicious! We tried to persuade the cook to give us the recipe, but she said it was a secret. Upon returning home, I experimented until I came up with this recipe, which is very close.
