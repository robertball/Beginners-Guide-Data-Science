1	quarter head iceberg lettuce, shredded
3	cups shredded Sharp Cheddar cheese
12 	corn tortillas
1	28 ounce can tomato sauce
¼-1/2	cup Chili powder (Gebhardt)  the brand is important (plus 1 tablespoon)
1 ½	teaspoons onion powder
1 ½	teaspoons garlic powder
1	teaspoon black pepper
1	teaspoon salt
Directions
1.	In Medium saucepan over medium low heat; add tomato sauce and let warm slowly.  Stirring occasionally.  (saucepan should be large enough for corn tortilla to lay flat in pan)
2.	In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add ground turkey.  Season with onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, salt and 1 tablespoon of the Gebhardt chili powder.  Sautee until thoroughly cooked through.  Remove to cool.  Then put in a bowl.  And set aside.
3.	Meanwhile, dice tomatoes, shred lettuce and get into bowls for assembly.
4.	In a small drinking glass mix the chili powder and enough water to make the same consistency as the tomato sauce.  Slowly pour chili powder mixture into warm sauce stirring until well mixed.
5.	for assembly:  Put one tortilla into the sauce.  With 2 slotted spoons lift tortilla out of sauce and place on dinner plate. (lift carefully as they will tear very easily.)  Sprinkle with about 1 to 1 ½ tablespoons of the cooked chicken, 1 tablespoon tomatoes, 1 good pinch of lettuce and about 1 tablespoon cheese.  Roll tortilla carefully as it is still fragile.  Place in baking dish, seam side down.  Repeat with the rest of the tortillas.  Pour about ½ to 1 cup of the tomato sauce mixture over enchiladas in baking dish. Top with about ½  to 1 cup shredded cheese.
6.	Bake uncovered at 350 F.  For  about 15 to 25 minutes.  Or until the cheese is melted well and everything is heate
