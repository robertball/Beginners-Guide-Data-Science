Ingredients:
1 cup (2 sticks) butter [or 1/2 peanut butter, 1/2 butter]
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
2/3 cup white chocolate chunks or chips
2 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour [or 1/2 white whole wheat and 1/2 white]
1 cup peanut butter chips
1 cup semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans or walnuts

Directions:
This recipe halved makes about 3 dozen TBS drop  size cookies.
1) Preheat your oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) four baking sheets, or as many as you have.
2) Beat together the butter, sugars, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3) Beat in the eggs and vanilla.
4) Using a blender or food processor, process the oats with the white chocolate until the oats are finely ground, and the chocolate is mostly ground; a few small chunks are OK.
5) Add the oats and flour to the butter mixture, then stir in the peanut butter chips, chocolate chips, and chopped walnuts.
6) Drop the dough by tablespoonfuls, 2" apart, onto the prepared baking sheets.
7) Bake the cookies for about 12 minutes, until they're just set. They may be barely starting to brown around the edges, but the tops won't be brown at all.
8) Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool.
