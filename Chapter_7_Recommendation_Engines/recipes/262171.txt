Ingredients:
9 ounces farmer's cheese
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste (optional)
1/4 teaspoon salt
oil for frying
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Mix farmer's cheese, flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until a sticky dough forms.
Roll dough into 1-inch balls with wet hands to prevent sticking.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). The oil should be hot but not smoking. It is ready for frying if you see little air bubbles around a wooden spoon placed in the oil.
Fry a batch of the dough balls in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes. Place doughnuts on paper towels to soak up excess oil. Repeat with remaining dough. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.

Description: 
Delicious doughnuts made with a cheese-enriched dough. Tvorog (Russian cottage cheese) is traditionally used for this recipe, but it works very well with farmer's cheese or ricotta, too.
