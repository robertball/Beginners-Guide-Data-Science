Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup minced fresh basil
1 small onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
freshly ground pepper to taste
1 (28 ounce) jar marinara sauce (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk milk and eggs together in a large bowl. Add  turkey, panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, basil, onion, garlic, salt, oregano, and pepper and mix together using your hands.
Form mixture into golf ball-size meatballs and place 1 inch apart on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Plate and top with marinara sauce.
