Description: 
I used a food processor for this tender, flaky pastry dough as it makes it so much easier to achieve the gorgeous 'breadcrumb' texture as you add the ice water. If you use the dough for a savory recipe, I'd cut down the sugar a bit, but not omit it entirely. The most important thing to remember is to use frozen butter and ice cold water.
