Ingredients:
2 cups instant brown rice
1 3/4 cups water
6 tablespoons soy sauce
6 tablespoons water
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 cups broccoli florets
1 cup baby carrots
1 small white onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 1/2 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined

Directions:
Stir the rice and 1 3/4 cup water together in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover, and cook in the microwave on High for 8 minutes until the water is fully absorbed. Fluff with a fork.
Whisk together the soy sauce, water, honey, cider vinegar, and cornstarch in a small bowl.  Set the sauce aside.
Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and cook for 10 seconds. Add the broccoli, carrots, onion, and black pepper; cook and stir until the broccoli and carrots are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and cook for 2 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the skillet and set aside.
Return the skillet to the heat and pour in the sauce mixture; cook for 1 minute. Add the shrimp to the sauce and stir until the shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center and the sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Stir the vegetables back into the pan and serve over the brown rice.
