Ingredients:
1 ¼ cups all purpose flour
½ cup whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp baking soda
¼ cup sugar
¼ tsp salt
¼ cup chilled butter
¼ cup chopped walnuts
½ cup blueberries, cut into halves
1 6 oz. container blueberry yogurt
1 whole large mashed banana
1 T brown sugar
icing made from:
¼ c. powdered confectioners sugar
½ Tbsp. water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a large bowl, blend together the two flours, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Slice blueberries in half then stir in walnuts and blueberries. In a small bowl, beat the yogurt and bananas until smooth. Combine two mixtures, stirring gently, until the dough holds together (may need to mix with hands to combine).
Turn the dough out onto the prepared baking sheet and pat into an 8-inch circle. Using a butter knife score the dough into eight pieces. Sprinkle 1 Tbsp. brown sugar evenly over scones dough before baking.
Bake for 18-20 minutes. Remove and serve warm.
While scones are baking, mix ingredients for icing in a small liquid measuring cup. Drizzle over warm scones before serving.
