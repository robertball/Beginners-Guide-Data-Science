Ingredients:
1 Cup butter (not margarine)
3/4 Cup confectioners sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 Cups flour
1/2 - 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (to taste)
1 Cup finely chopped pecans
Extra confectioners sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325.
In a medium bowl, combine flour and confectioners sugar together--set aside. In a large bowl, cream butter, sugar, and vanilla together. Gradually blend in the flour/cayenne mixture. Mix in the nuts. Shape into 3/4 inch balls. Place on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake 25-30 minutes--cookies will be a creamy color. Remove to wire rack and cool slightly.
When warm (not hot), drop cookies into additional confectioners sugar and roll to coat (several times if necessary) until evenly evenly coated. If desired, sprinkle with additional cayenne pepper. Cool completely on wire racks
