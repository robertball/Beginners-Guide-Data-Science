Ingredients:
2 cups gluten free flour (Cup4Cup brand)
2 large, very ripe bananas, mashed
½ cup sugar
½ cup butter (1 stick), softened
2 eggs
2 tbsp almond milk
½ tsp vanilla
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
¼ tsp salt
½ cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan, set aside.
In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt, set aside.
In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Stir in the eggs, milk, vanilla, and mashed bananas until well blended.
Stir the banana mixture into the flour mixture and mix until just combined.
Fold in the chocolate chips and pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.
Let the bread cool in the pan for about 10-15 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack. Slice and serve warm!
