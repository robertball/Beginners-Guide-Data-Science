Ingredients:
1 lb ground lean hamburger meat
1/4 c. chopped onions
1 T. butter
1/2 t. sugar
1/4 c. Grandma Hoot's Huckleberry Chipotle Sauce
1 t. salt and pepper
1 t. dried garlic

Directions:
Melt butter in small skillet,add onions and when they become translucent, add sugar.  When sugar is melted and onions are carmelized take off heat and set aside.  Put your hamburger meat in a mixing bowl and break up with your hands or big spoon, add the Huckleberry Chipotle Sauce and mix in until fully incorporated.  Add in your onion mixture, salt, pepper and garlic.  Make your patties and when you do, leave a small well in the center of each patty.  Cook your patties how you normally do and the well in the middle keeps the patties flat during cooking (shout out to Bobby Flay for that tip).  Enjoy your juicy burgers!  You can substitute turkey, pork and anything you would use for burgers.  The sauce is also awesome in meatloaf.
