Description: 
Fried chicken that tastes closer to the Colonels than any homemade Fried Chicken recipe.  Excellent on picnics if prepared the morning or day before and any cut of chicken is good just as long as long as you adjust the cooking time appropriately.  Chicken wings are excellent with this recipe and it is why I orginally developed it.  This recipe can be adjusted according to taste by adding any variety of spices however, know how the basic recipe tastes before you adjust the seasoning.  I have found that the extra crispy variety of Shake-n-Bake doesnt adhere to the chicken and is therefore not go
