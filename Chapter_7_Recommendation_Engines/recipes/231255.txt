Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups converted long-grain white rice
3 cups water
1 pound ground beef
2 cups water
1 (20 ounce) jar pasta sauce (such as RaguÂ®)
1 (10 ounce) can tomato soup
3 1/2 pounds cabbage, cut into bite-size pieces
1 onion, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 dash hot pepper sauce

Directions:
Bring converted rice and 3 cups water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot pan until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Stir 2 cups water, cooked rice, pasta sauce, tomato soup, cabbage, onion, salt, black pepper, and hot sauce into beef. Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cover. Simmer until cabbage is soft and tender, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
I made up this recipe after having a craving for cabbage rolls but no time to make them. This is a healthy, hearty recipe. So simple to make and can be adjusted to your liking. You can easily double the recipe and freeze leftovers in portions. Serve piping hot with crusty bread or garlic toast.
