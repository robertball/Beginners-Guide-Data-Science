Ingredients:
1-Gallon Jar of Whole Dill Pickles
2-pks of unsweetened Cherry Kool-aid (Grape works well too)
2-cups white sugar

Directions:
Remove the pickles for the jar, pierce the pickles in several places with a fork or a knife, and set aside.
Add the kool-aid and the sugar to the pickle juice in the jar.  Stir until the kool-aid and sugar is completely dissolved.
Add the pickles back in to the jar, one at a time arranging them carefully making sure they all fit back in. Also make sure all the pickles are completely covered with the brine (pickle juice).   You might have some brine left over.  Place the lid back on and make sure it is tightly secured.
Let the pickles sit in the brine at least 2 weeks.  I prefer 1 month.  It will be worth the wait!!!

I tried these for the first time at a church bazaar.  I have served these as a side for ham sandwiches, or just as a snack.
