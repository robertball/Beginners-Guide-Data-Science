Ingredients:
4 tablespoons salted butter
5 apples - peeled, cored, and finely chopped
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup golden raisins
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add chopped apples and turn to coat. Cook apples, stirring frequently, until golden in color, 15 to 20 minutes.
Slowly stir maple syrup, water, brown sugar, raisins, and cinnamon into the apples. Reduce heat and simmer until a thick syrup forms, about 15 minutes.
Remove from heat and let stand for several minutes to thicken. Serve hot, or refrigerate and serve cold.

Description: 
A delicious compote that is heavenly in the caramel apple cupcakes I make, as well as a topping for ice cream, in place of jam, or perhaps paired with a pork roast? Any way you use it, it's sure to please!
