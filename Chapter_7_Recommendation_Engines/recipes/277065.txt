Ingredients:
3 cups gluten-free rolled oats
1 cup coconut sugar
1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1 cup almond milk
2 tablespoons orange zest
1 1/2 teaspoons gluten-free baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Combine oats, sugar, orange juice, almond milk, orange zest, baking soda, vanilla extract, and salt in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each to the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 22 minutes. Cool in the tin for 10 minutes and serve warm.

Description: 
Growing up in Florida and eating Perkins muffins gives you really high expectations of what a muffin should look and taste like. We all know how much sugar is added and just how unhealthy sweets can be. I'm always trying to find or come up with the healthiest baking recipes that also have that same childhood sweetness. Enjoy these vegan and gluten-free orange muffins warm with some delicious vegan butter!
