Ingredients:
1/3 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon paprika
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 pounds baby Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered
1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, quartered
1 large sweet onion, chopped
2 slices bacon
2 green onions, sliced (optional)
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley (optional)
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Whisk olive oil, 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, honey, paprika, garlic, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Stir potatoes, mushrooms, and sweet onion into vinegar mixture; toss to coat. Spread vegetables over prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes.
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble bacon.
Transfer potato mixture to a large bowl and toss with bacon, green onions, parsley, and remaining 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar.

Description: 
Super easy, delicious and reheats well! This (loosely inspired by German potato salad) recipe is tasty hot or cold and great for outdoor dining - no mayo to worry about keeping cold. Also, you can switch it up and play with different flavor combinations by swapping the vinegar, herbs, and spices. Enjoy!
