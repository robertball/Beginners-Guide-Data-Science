Description: 
This recipe was given to me by a neighbor who often cooks delightful authentic Indian cuisine and was kind enough to share. She describes it as a blend of curd and crispy little golden besan balls and as a very popular variation of the raita and can be eaten with biriyani/pulao or any other gravy dish.
