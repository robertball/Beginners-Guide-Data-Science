Ingredients:
1 lb. hamburger
1 onion, chopped
2 cups celery, sliced
1/2 cup uncooked rice
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup water
1 (4 oz.) can mushrooms
1 (10 3/4 oz.) can cream of mushroom soup
1 small can bean spouts
1 small can sliced water chestnuts
Chinese noodles
.

Directions:
Brown hamburger and onions. Mix everything but Chinese noodles together (including liquid from mushrooms and bean sprouts) into hamburger. Place in a greased 9×9 pan. Bake 1 1/2 hours at 375 degrees. Top with Chinese noodles. Double the amount for a 9×13 pan.
Note: This takes longer to cook because of the uncooked rice. You could use 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice but, if you do, don’t use the liquid from the mushrooms and bean sprouts. That will cut the cooking time in half.
Use Ramen noodles or instant rice in your casseroles. This makes preparation easier since you don’t need to cook these before you add them to the dish.
If you have time, roast your veggies before adding them to your casserole for some added flavor.
