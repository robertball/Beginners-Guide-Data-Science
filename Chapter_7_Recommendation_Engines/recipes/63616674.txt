Ingredients:
1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 oz. mozzarella cheese
1.25 oz. (approx. 16 slices) pepperoni
1 large egg
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup bread crumbs
6 Tbsps vegetable oil
to taste salt and pepper

Directions:
STEP 1: Trim chicken breasts. Slice each breast in half diagonally to create two diamond-like shaped pieces. Using a small, sharp knife, cut a pocket into side of each breast piece. This can be slightly tricky on thinner pieces so be careful. Be sure not to cut all the way through meat but rather just into one side so that the fillings will stay in.
STEP 2: Stuff each piece of chicken with 1/2 oz. of cheese & about 4 slices of pepperoni. Lightly season each piece with salt & pepper. Set stuffed chicken aside.
STEP 3: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees & line baking sheet with aluminum foil. Begin to heat large skillet with 6 Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium/high heat. Collect three shallow dishes & put flour in one, egg in another & bread crumbs in third. Beat egg until it is an even consistency (adding a 1/2 tsp of water helps break it up).
STEP 4: One by one, coat each piece of chicken in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs. Use your hands so that you can keep the open side of the pocket pinched closed & keep fillings in.
STEP 5: Test the oil in skillet to see if it's hot enough by dropping a small pinch of bread crumbs in. The bread crumbs should sizzle & dance A LOT. It's very important that oil is hot enough or else the breading will soak up a lot of oil & youâ€™ll end up with really greasy chicken! Place all four pieces of chicken in skillet & cook until it's golden brown & crispy on each side. This should take no more than 2-3 minutes.
STEP 6: When you remove the chicken pieces from the skillet, transfer them to the baking sheet and place it in the oven. Finish baking the chicken (to cook the inside) for about 25 minutes (longer if you have larger pieces). Remove from the oven (check to make sure the chicken is cooked through) and serve immediately!
