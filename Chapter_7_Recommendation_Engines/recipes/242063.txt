Ingredients:
1 large onion, chopped
2 large cloves garlic, minced
2 (28 ounce) cans tomatoes, undrained
1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce (such as Dei Fratelli®)
1 (15 ounce) can chili beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
3 tablespoons chili powder (such as Mexene®)
1 3/4 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon white sugar
4 cups water, divided
1 cup quinoa

Directions:
Saute onion and garlic in a stockpot over medium-high heat until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, chili beans, kidney beans, chili powder, cumin, salt, and sugar; pour in 2 cups water and simmer until flavors blend, about 1 hour.
Bring 2 cups water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir quinoa into chili.

Description: 
My husband said this is the best chili yet! Plus it is so easy to make! To serve, put a small amount of pasta in a bowl and spoon in chili with quinoa. Add a dollop of sour cream (vegan or regular) and a sprinkle of chives for garnish. Enjoy!
