Combine cottage cheese, parmesan cheese, eggs, and pepper.  Grease two 9 x 13 inch pans; place a small amount of the meat mixture in the bottoms of the pans to help prevent the noodles from sticking.  Layer noodles, cheese mixture, meat mixture and Mozzarella cheese twice in each pan.  Bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is the only way my husband will eat lasagna.  It does not have alot of tomato sauce in it but does have alot of cheese.  I have fixed this many times for people recovering from surgery and I am aways asked for the recipe.  This also freezes well.
