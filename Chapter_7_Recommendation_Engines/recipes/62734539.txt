Ingredients:
1 package cimmamon rolls
10 slices bacon

Directions:
Prepare Bacon being careful not to make it too crispy.  Drain bacon on paper towels and set aside.  Preheat oven.
If the rolls are the kind that can be unrolled into strips, unroll each and roll back up with a slice of bacon inside.
If the rolls can't be easily unrolled,  wrap a slice of bacon around each roll and secure with a wooden tooth pick.  It's OK if the bacon is taller than the roll before cooking.   Cook according to package directions.

This is so easy and so good, you will wonder why you never thought of this yourself.  It was originally inspired by a SeattleGAL blog post, I've modified her recipe to suite my tastes.
