Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups crushed sugar-frosted corn flake cereal
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs and vanilla; mix until fluffy. Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into butter mixture. Stir in the crushed cereal. Melt chocolate chips in a bowl over simmering water or in the microwave. Swirl melted chocolate gently into dough, leaving big streaks of chocolate.
Drop cookies by heaping teaspoonfuls onto unprepared cookie sheets.  Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. After baking remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
