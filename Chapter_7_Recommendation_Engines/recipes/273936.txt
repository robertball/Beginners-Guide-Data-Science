Ingredients:
water to cover
1 (8 ounce) package fresh spinach
9 carrots, peeled and chopped
1 medium head cabbage, chopped
2 yucca roots, peeled and chopped
1 zucchini, chopped
1 small bunch cilantro leaves, stems removed, or to taste
2 cubes chicken bouillon
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
3 radishes, chopped
1 lemon, sliced

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add spinach, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Keep warm.
Place carrots and cabbage into a separate pot with water to cover.
Place yucca into another pot and fill with water to cover. Bring to a boil, cover and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer soft yucca to carrot-cabbage pot. Stir in zucchini. Toss in cilantro leaves. Add additional water as needed to cover and bring to a boil; stir in chicken bouillon cubes and turmeric. Reduce heat and let simmer until all vegetables are soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
Divide soup between serving bowls. Add spinach, top with radishes, and place lemon slices on the sides of the bowls.
