Ingredients:
1/2 ounce dried mushrooms (such as porcini)
1 cup hot water, or as needed
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 yellow onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
1 pinch ground cloves
2 pounds assorted fresh mushrooms, cut into bite size pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 pounds tomatoes - peeled, seeded, and chopped
1 quart vegetable stock, or as needed
8 ounces instant polenta
4 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley, or as desired

Directions:
Place dried mushrooms in a small bowl with enough hot water to cover; let stand 20 minutes. Drain mushrooms; reserve liquid.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium high heat and cook and stir onion until soft, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; stir in garlic, thyme, and cloves and cook and stir 2 minutes more. Stir fresh mushrooms and soaked dried mushrooms into onion mixture; cook and stir until mushrooms are soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Stir tomatoes and reserved mushroom liquid into mushroom mixture; simmer over low heat until thickened, about 20 minutes.
Bring vegetable stock to a boil; whisk in polenta. Cook polenta, whisking constantly, until polenta is thick and stock is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Divide polenta into 4 bowls; ladle mushroom stew over polenta and garnish with fresh parsley.

Description: 
This is a delicious, hearty, heart-friendly vegetarian stew.
 I serve it with polenta, but it would be equally yummy ladled over mashed potatoes, sweet mashed potatoes or rice. Garnish with fresh herbs.
