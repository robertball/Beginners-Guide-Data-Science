Ingredients:
8 (1/2 inch thick) slices French bread, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1 tablespoon creole seasoning (such as Emeril's Bayou Blast!Â®), or more to taste
1/2 cup butter
6 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 clove garlic, sliced thin
1/8 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Put cubes in a large bowl and season generously with creole seasoning.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir Parmesan cheese, garlic, and onion powder into the melted butter; pour over the bread cubes and toss to coat. Spread bread cubes onto a large baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes, stir, and continue baking until golden brown and crispy, about 10 minutes more.
