Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/2176757.jpg
Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) whole chicken
1 cup margarine, softened
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 pinch dried rosemary

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Rinse and pat chicken thoroughly dry with paper towels. Mix margarine, garlic salt, black pepper, thyme, parsley, and rosemary in a bowl and rub the outside of the chicken thoroughly with the margarine mixture. Place any remaining margarine mixture into the cavity of the chicken. Place chicken into a glass baking dish.
Bake chicken in the preheated oven until browned and the juices run clear, about 2 hours. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh, not touching bone, should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
Want a roasted chicken that is juicy inside without the use of a baking bag or flour? Then this recipe is perfect. It is quick and easy to prepare. The picture shown does display a chicken that was cooked in a bag, but the chicken was also roasted with vegetables and needed the bag to immerse the vegetables in the chicken flavor. I still guarantee a juicy chicken without the use of a bag each and every time.
