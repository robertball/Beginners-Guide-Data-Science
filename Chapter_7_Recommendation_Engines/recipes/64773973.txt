Green Chili Recipe

Ingredients:
4 - 5 pounds pork shoulder (boned)
24 ounces frozen green chili
2-3 tablespoons oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2-3 tablespoons flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat oil in a stock pot over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, cover and cook over low heat for about 5 minutes to wilt the onions. Check halfway through to make sure they are not browning. Raise the heat to medium again, stir in the four, cumin and black pepper, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes to cook the rawness out of the flour. The onions will tend to ball up into clumps, but that does not matter. When the onion-flour mixture just begins to color, remove pan from heat and add the broth, pork, oregano and salt stirring constantly.
