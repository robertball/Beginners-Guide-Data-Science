Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie shell
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup dark corn syrup
3 eggs, beaten
2 TBSP butter, melted
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/8 tsp salt
1 heaping cup pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine sugar, corn syrup, eggs, vanilla, salt, and butter.  Stir in pecans and pour into pie shell.
Bake in preheated oven for 55-65 minutes. Check after 30 minutes; if crust is getting too brown, cover edges with aluminum foil. When done, pie will be puffed up and a little loose in center but firmer in the 1 1/2 closest to the edges.  The middle will set as it cools; do not overbake.  Eat when cooled.

Description: 
The dark corn syrup and melted butter make this the best variation of pecan pie I have ever made.  It has the power to turn non-pecan pie lovers to the dark side--myself included!Modified from: Pecan Pie III
