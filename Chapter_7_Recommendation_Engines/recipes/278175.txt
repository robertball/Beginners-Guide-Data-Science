Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package white chocolate chips
3/4 cup corn syrup
gel food coloring as desired (optional)
1/4 cup cornstarch, or as needed

Directions:
Melt white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes.
Heat corn syrup until almost as warm as the melted chocolate and combine with chocolate; it may begin to harden and be difficult to stir, but be sure to fully incorporate. Let rest in a cool place, such as a refrigerator or countertop, until very stiff, about 2 hours.
Break off a piece in the size you need and begin to play with it; the warmth of your hands will make it a Play-Doh consistency. Mix in gel food coloring as desired.
Dust the countertop and a rolling pin with cornstarch and place a ball of modeling chocolate on top; roll to desired size. To cover a cake, roll the chocolate up on the rolling pin for easier transfer to the cake.

This modeling chocolate is more stable and easier to decorate with than fondant, plus it is super delicious! A great way to spend extra time with your kids too. This makes enough to easily cover a round cake and make decorations.
