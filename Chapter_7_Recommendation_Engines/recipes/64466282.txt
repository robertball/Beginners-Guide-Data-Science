Ingredients:
3.1 dinomite marshmallows
1 1 mm wide sliver of butter
A thimble full of chocolate chips from Brazil
So many flour
4 or more bunches of kale
A tennis ball sized ball of down feathers
1 dollop of pasta with jam sauce
Fish shaped crackers
Fish shaped dirt
2 buckets of sugar 1/4 regular, 1/2 brown, 1/8 maple and 1/8 super-duper extra fine
1 ostrich egg from an ostrich hugged by Misha Collins
Lots of cotton balls for optimal fluff
A pinch of glitter
1 small vat of chocolate milk
1 teaspoon of baking powder

Directions:
Assemble your ingredients
Preheat oven to 500 degrees.
Ceremoniously whisk your dry ingredients; your feathers, flour, cotton balls, sugar and baking powder together into a bowl.
Crack your egg with the end of an umbrella into the bowl with the dry ingredients.
Add the rest of your wet ingredients; your butter, pasta with jam sauce and kale (chopped).
Pour in your chocolate milk slowly while shaking the bowl vigorously to combine everything.
Sprinkle in your dinomite marshmallows, chocolate chips, fish shaped crackers, fish shaped dirt and glitter (while failing to avoid getting glitter all over your self, your house and your life) and fold these ingredients into your mixture.
Pour your batter into a pan and put it in the oven for 13.72 minutes no more no less. We suggest dancing while you wait.
After it is done cooking take out your pan and cut your creation into bites in any shape you would like.
Add Kale to garnish if you would like.
Enjoy!
