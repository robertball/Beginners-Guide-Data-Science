Ingredients:
1/3 cup pine nuts
2/3 cup olive oil
5 cloves garlic
1/3 cup nutritional yeast
1 bunch fresh basil leaves
salt and pepper to taste

Gradually mix the pine nuts, olive oil, garlic, nutritional yeast, and basil in a food processor, and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.

CANDIEDVIOLET
Description: 
This is a classic recipe I use and love. Nutritional yeast is substituted for the traditionally used dairy. Tasty on pasta, bread, sandwiches, omelets, etc. Try adding sun-dried tomato slices post-completion for an added boost of rich flavor. P.S. - It also freezes beautifully.
