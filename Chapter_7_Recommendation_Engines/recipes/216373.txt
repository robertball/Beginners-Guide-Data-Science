Ingredients:
4 pounds boneless beef chuck roast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 large carrot, chopped
2/3 cup chopped celery
2 (14.5 ounce) cans Hunt’s® Diced Tomatoes with Basil, Garlic & Oregano, undrained
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth

Directions:
Season both sides of roast with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat 1 minute. Add roast; cook 5 minutes on each side, or until browned on both sides. Remove from pan; cover to keep warm. Reduce heat to medium.
Add onion, carrot and celery to same pan; cook 5 minutes, or until onion is tender, stirring frequently. Add tomatoes with their liquid and broth; stir in all the browned bits from bottom of pan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Return roast to pan. Cover pan with lid; reduce heat to low.
Simmer 3 to 3-1/2 hours, or until roast is fork tender. Remove roast from pan; let stand 10 minutes before portioning.
Serve half of roast and sauce for this meal. Use the remaining roast to make Pulled Barbecue Beef Sandwiches and the remaining sauce to make Tuscan-style Penne Pasta.
