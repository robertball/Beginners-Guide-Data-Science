Ingredients:
6 orange bell peppers (6 to 7 ounces each)
8 ounces bulk Italian sausage, hot or mild
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian (flat-leaf) parsley
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 1/2 cups cooked orzo pasta or quinoa
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Cut off tops of peppers; reserve tops. Remove and discard seeds and membranes. If necessary, cut a thin slice from the bottom of the peppers to make them stand upright. Using a sharp paring knife, cut jack-o'-lantern faces.
In a large skillet, cook sausage, onion, and garlic until sausage is browned, stirring to break up sausage as it cooks. Drain off any fat. Stir in tomatoes, parsley, salt, black pepper, cooked orzo or quinoa, and 1 1/2 cups of the cheese.
Mound mixture into peppers. Place peppers, filled side up, in a 3-quart rectangular baking dish.
Bake, covered, 30 minutes. Uncover; top peppers with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake, uncovered, about 10 minutes more or until peppers are crisp-tender and cheese is browned. Top with reserved pepper tops before serving.
