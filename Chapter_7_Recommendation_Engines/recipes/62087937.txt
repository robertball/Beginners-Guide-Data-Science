Ingredients:
4 slices bread
2 tbsp softened butter or spread
1/2 cup shredded cheese
1/2 cup pasta or pizza sauce
4 ounces Italian sausage
1 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp oregano

Directions:
In a small skillet, cook the Italian sausage over medium heat, breaking it up as it cooks so it crumbles.
Add the pasta sauce to the skillet, stir to combine, and keep warm over low heat.
Butter one side of each slice of bread and sprinkle with the garlic powder and oregano.
Heat another skillet over medium heat and place two slices of bread, buttered side down, in the skillet.  Top each slice with about a fourth of the cheese, then half the sausage mixture, and then the remaining cheese.
Place the remaining two slice of bread on top, with the buttered side up, and cover the skillet.
When the bottom begins to brown, turn sandwiches to brown the other side.  Sandwiches are done when both sides are golden brown and all the cheese is melted.
