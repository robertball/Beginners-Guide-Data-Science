Directions:

Description: 
A zesty bleu-cheese, bacon, and onion cheese ball. Best served with multi-grain crackers. The recipe I reworked for this cheese ball called for 1 pound of bacon fried, drained, and crumbled. I didn't have time for all that, so used the bacon bits and found them at least as good and less mess. Make sure your cream cheese is really soft, or else it is a little hard to mix well. Bon Appetit!
