Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups warm water
1 tablespoon milk
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup sourdough starter
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3 1/4 cups bread flour
1 teaspoon vital wheat gluten (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
Place water, milk, olive oil, sourdough starter, sugar, salt, flour, and vital wheat gluten in a bread machine in the order listed. Sprinkle yeast over flour. Start Dough cycle. Remove dough from the machine after the cycle is done, about 90 minutes.
Turn dough out onto a well floured surface and let rest for 15 minutes.
Flour hands and a bench knife well before handling the dough, but try not to add too much extra flour to the dough itself. Divide dough into 3 equal sections and form into round loaves. Place loaves on pieces of generously floured parchment paper and cover with large bowls, not touching the loaves themselves. Let rise in a warm place for about 60 minutes.
Place a Dutch oven on the lowest rack of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Carefully lift 1 piece of parchment paper by the ends and transfer to the hot Dutch oven. Place lid back on the Dutch oven.
Bake in the preheated oven until loaf is golden, about 20 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until top is golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes more. Lift up loaf with with parchment paper and place on a towel to cool. Bake remaining 2 loaves in the same way.

Description: 
Awesome ciabatta recipe I perfected so that I could use my sourdough starter. With the help of the Dough cycle on the bread machine, it's super easy to make. I highly recommend using a Dutch oven for best results.
