Ingredients:
3 lbs. ground beef
3 eggs
1 cup breadcrumbs or soya granules
1 cup diced onions
1/2 cup tomato paste
1 Tbsp. garlic pepper
1 Tbsp. worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Preheat Oven at 350 degrees.
Mix everything EXCEPT Beef.
After all the ingredients are well blended, then mix in Beef.
Place mixture in 9x13 glass baking dish. Form in a long loaf.
Cover with foil and bake for 20 min.
After 20 min, take off foil. Cover top in Ketchup (if desired, I do). If meat is lean, you may need to add water (I do).
Return to the over and back for another 20-25 minutes, without foil. Cut center piece out to make sure it's cooked. Enjoy!

I love all the experimental meatloaves, but we needed just a basic meatloaf. My husband and I came up with this one.
