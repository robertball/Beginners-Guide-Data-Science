Description: 
Classic batter for waffles with a crunchy outer shell and light, soft inside. It just happens to be gluten free. I use this recipe for my entire family, even those not sensitive to gluten and they love them. I think the key here is to use a simple blend of gluten free flours without the need for gums or binders. The brown rice flour gives the waffle a texture that is very similar to regular all purpose wheat flour. This allows for a classic, simple waffle.Modified from: Waffles I
