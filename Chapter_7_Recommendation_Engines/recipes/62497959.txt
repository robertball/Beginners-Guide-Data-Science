Jansson's Temptation (Janssons Frestelse) Recipe

Ingredients:
2 large onions, cut into 1/4 inch wide strips
14 fillets Swedish anchovies, or regular anchovies (I used a tube of anchovy paste.  Next time, I will use TWO tubes, or regular anchovies.)
6 potatoes, peeled and cut into strips (I wasn't sure what "strips" were, and next time I may take another approach--WHAT I don't know!--from the ungainly way I did it this time.)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Spread onions evenly onto the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Evenly distribute anchovies on top of the onions. Place potatoes on top of the anchovies, then pour in heavy cream. Mix bread crumbs together with the melted butter, then sprinkle overtop of the potatoes.
Place onto a baking sheet to catch any cream which bubbles over. Bake in preheated oven until the potatoes have softened, the cream has reduced, and the dish has turned deep golden brown, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
Who Jansson is, we may never know, but this meal is an absolute must on a cold and frigid evening. The anchovies may seem an odd ingredient in what is basically potatoes au gratin, but when they combine with cream and onions, they'll tempt anyone!Modified from: Jansson's Temptation (Janssons Frestelse)
