Ingredients:
6 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup ready-to-eat sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
3 cloves minced garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup fresh basil, stems removed and leaves chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 long loaf whole grain artisan bread
1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven on broiler setting.
In a large bowl, combine the roma tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt, and pepper. Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes.
Cut the bread into 3/4-inch-thick slices. On a baking sheet, arrange the baguette slices in a single layer. Broil for 1 to 2 minutes, until slightly brown.
Divide the tomato mixture evenly over the bread slices. Top the slices with mozzarella cheese.
Broil for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.
