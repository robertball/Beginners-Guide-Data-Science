Ingredients:
1 1/2 c whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
1/4 c unsweetened cocoa
2/3 c water
2/3 c + 1 T agave
1/4 c vegetable oil
1 Tbl vinegar
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Heat oven to 350*.
Spray an 8 x 8 glass baking dish with non-stick pan spray.
In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, baking soda and cocoa.
With the back of a spoon, push the flour away from the center of the bowl, making a "well" for the wet ingredients.
Add water, agave, oil, vinegar and vanilla to the center of the bowl.
Blend all ingredients together.
Pour into the baking dish.
Bake for 25 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
If you don't want to add a sugary frosting, crazy cake is good with butter (or butter spray), with a sprinkling of powdered sugar, or even plain.
