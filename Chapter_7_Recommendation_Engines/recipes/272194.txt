Ingredients:
1 pound extra-lean ground beef
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons taco seasoning mix
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/4 cup shredded carrots
1 (12 ounce) bottle Mexican guajillo red chile cooking sauce (such as Herdez®)
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 (15 ounce) can reduced-sodium black beans, rinsed and drained
6 (6 inch) corn tortillas
2 cups shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese (such as Cabot®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet, sprinkling in pepper and taco seasoning, until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion, bell peppers, and carrots; saute for 5 minutes.
Pour guajillo sauce into a large measuring cup and stir in sugar. Pour sauce over the beef mixture; stir in black beans.
Place 3 tortillas on the bottom of a casserole dish. Add half the meat mixture on top. Sprinkle 1/2 of the shredded cheese on top. Repeat the layers, ending with cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown, about 25 minutes.
