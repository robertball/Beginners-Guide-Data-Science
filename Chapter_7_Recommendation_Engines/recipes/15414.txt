Ingredients:
2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
1/2 cup water
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/3 cup amaretto liqueur
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
In a small bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Press into the bottom and sides of a 9 inch springform pan, refrigerate.
Put the water into a small saucepan, water should be cold. Sprinkle the gelatin over the water, and let stand for 1 minute. Then, stir over low heat until gelatin is dissolved, set aside. In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until fluffy. Gradually add the evaporated milk and lemon juice, container to beat until fluffy. Scrape the bottom of the bowl occasionally to make sure there are no lumps. Gradually beat in the amaretto, vanilla and the gelatin mixture until everything is well blended.
In a medium bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff but not grainy, then fold it into the cream cheese mixture. Pour the filling into the chilled crust and refrigerate for at least 12 hours before serving. Do not remove the springform ring until serving time.
