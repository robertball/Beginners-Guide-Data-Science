Ingredients:
1 seedless watermelon
2 cups (approximately) fresh berries - strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, etc.
OPTIONAL:
1 to 2 other melons - cantaloupe, honeydew, etc.
1 fresh pineapple
Other fresh fruit

Directions:
To create the base tier of the cake, cut a slice of watermelon 1-2" thick crosswise, from the middle of the melon, to form a large round.  Cut the rind from the melon slice.  Place on a cake plate.
To create additional tier(s), repeat with the other 1 or 2 melons, removing any seeds (or, if just using watermelon, cut another 1-2 tiers from the remaining water melon).
Stack the additional tier(s) on the base tier, placing the largest on the bottom.  If required, use an end slice of melon on the top to cover a seed cavity hole or use berries or chopped fruit to fill it.
Thinly slice (1/4 inch) the pineapple, strawberries, or some remaining melon (if using).  Using a small cookie cutter (or a knife) cut the pineapple and/or melon into shapes.
[optional] Place sliced strawberries (or pineapple) between two layers of melon.
Decorate the tiers with berries and cut shapes.
Store, covered, in the refrigerator until serving time.
Slice the cake, one wedge at a time and lift the stack of fruit out gently.  Serve the slice (now fruit salad) on a plate or in a bowl.

Description: 
This cake was a hit with the children and parents at our two-year old's birthday party.  It is perfect for raw, vegan, gluten/wheat-free, refined sugar-free  diets (and children who don't need sugar!).  This cake was inspired by a 100% watermelon cake we had the year before.
