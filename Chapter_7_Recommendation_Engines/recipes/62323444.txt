Ingredients:
1 cup cold water
1 Hong Style tea bag (can be purchased from any asian grocery store)
2 tsp sugar
2 tsp half and half

Directions:
Boil 1 cup water. Steep tea bag in water for 2 minutes. Stir in sugar and half and half. Add more sugar if needed to taste.

Submitter: 
Risa
Description: 
This is a very popular and yet simple drink ordered in many Chinese bakeries. The Hong Kong Style tea bag gives this tea a more aromatic flavoring than regular lipton black tea. For a more interesting texture and zing to your tea, try adding 2 spoonfuls of large black pearl tapioca to make bubble milk tea. Recipe of tapioca is listed on my recipe for Coconut Milk Tea with Pearl Tapioca.
