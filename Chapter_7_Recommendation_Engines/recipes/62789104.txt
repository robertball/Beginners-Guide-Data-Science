Ingredients:
1/4 cup skim milk
1 cup warm water
2 teaspoons dry active yeast
1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil
1 1/2 tablespoons honey (or maple syrup)
3 cups whole wheat flour
1/4 cup vital wheat gluten
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Put milk and warm water in bread machine pan and splinkle yeast over the top. Let them sit while you measure out the other ingredients. Add the canola oil, honey, flour, wheat gluten and salt.
Select the dough setting.  When it's ready, you won't need any flour to work this dough. Put it in a large bowl and punch it down, then knead it a few times. cover it and let it rise again - about 1 hour. Punch down and knead again, then place in a greased 5x9 loaf pan. let it rise another hour. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes. Let cool completely before slicing for best texture.

Description: 
Most homemade breads which are 100% wheat flour come out hard, but this one doesn't. This has a few adjustments from the original recipe based on suggestions from other reviewers and a couple of my own.Modified from: Good 100% Whole Wheat Bread
