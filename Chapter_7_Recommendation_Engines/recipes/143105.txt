Ingredients:
3 pounds pork tenderloin
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 red onion, minced
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/3 cup white wine
1/4 cup plain yogurt
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 1/2 cubes chicken bouillon, crushed
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the pork tenderloin in a deep baking dish.  Mix together the garlic, onion, parsley, mustard, wine, yogurt, olive oil, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, oregano, basil, thyme, bouillon, and lemon juice in a bowl; pour over the pork. Cover the entire dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 1 hour 30 minutes.
Remove the tenderloin from the dish and cover with aluminum foil on a cutting board. Allow to rest for 20 minutes before slicing. Reserve the sauce from the dish and serve on the side.

Description: 
I created this recipe through a series of trial and error. As they say, practice makes perfect. You can make the marinade and cook the loin immediately or you can let the pork soak overnight. Either way, I promise this will be the best pork tenderloin you've ever had. It may seem like a lot of ingredients, but it is a very simple recipe and well worth the effort.
