Ingredients:
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
1/2 cup 10%, 15% or 18% cream
3/4 pound ground beef
1/4 pound ground pork
1/2 small onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1/3 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
1/3 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
generous grinding of pepper
Sauce
1 tablespoon butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (28 ounce) can plum tomatoes, drained
1 tablespoon dried Italian seasoning
1/2 cup 15% or 18% cream
4 (7 inch) submarine rolls
Toppings:
sauteed mushrooms
sliced hot peppers
shredded provolone cheese

Directions:
Place bread crumbs in a large bowl. Stir with cream. Let stand for 5 minutes until milk soaks into crumbs.
Add meats, onion, garlic, egg, parsley, Parmesan, salt, pepper to the bread mixture. Mix well; form twelve 1 1/2-inch (3.5 cm) meatballs.
Sauce: Meanwhile in a large wide saucepan, heat butter over medium heat. Add garlic; stir 1 minute. Add tomatoes and seasonings. Use a potato masher to crush tomatoes. Simmer covered for 5 minutes.
Add meatballs to simmering tomato sauce. Cook covered, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes. Uncover and turn meatballs; cook until meatballs are cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove meatballs with a slotted spoon. Simmer sauce uncovered, until very thick for about 5 more minutes. Pour in cream; bring to a light boil. Return meatballs to sauce; heat through. Split rolls in half and spoon in three meatballs and some of the sauce in the bottom half of rolls. Top with your favourite toppings. Top with other half of rolls.
