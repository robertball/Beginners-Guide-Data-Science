2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon brown sugar (optional)

Directions:
Mix red onion and lime juice together in a bowl. Refrigerate until onion turns bright pink, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
I made up this salad one day when I bought a watermelon on special and didn't know what to do with it. It sounds unusual but it really works... 

It's great as a fresh starter or as an accompaniment to grilled fish or even a hot spicy curry to act as a cooler.
