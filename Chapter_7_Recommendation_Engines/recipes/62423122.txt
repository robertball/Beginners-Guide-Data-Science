Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour (can sub whole wheat flour)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon allspice
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 eggs, beaten
2 3/4 to 3 cups applesauce
Tip: Can add cinnamon chips for a gooey cinnamon sweetness.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, cream together butter, and brown sugar. Stir in eggs and applesauce until well blended. Stir wet mixture into dry mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.
