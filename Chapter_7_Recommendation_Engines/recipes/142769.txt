Ingredients:
1/2 cup hot red pepper sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar, or to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon honey
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (2 pound) boneless salmon fillet
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1 pinch salt
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Stir together the hot sauce, brown sugar, butter, honey, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir continuously for 3 to 4 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is well blended. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Coat a casserole dish with olive oil. Poke holes in the salmon with a fork, then place into the dish. Pour reserved sauce over the fish, top with green onions, and season with salt and pepper. Marinate for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 C).
Bake salmon in preheated oven, uncovered, until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes.
