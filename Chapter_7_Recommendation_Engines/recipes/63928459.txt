Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts, pounded and chopped into 1.5 inch pieces
salt & pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 package crescent rolls
1 cup alfredo sauce
1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350, line a baking sheet with nonstick foil and grease well with cooking spray.
2. Season chicken with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder. Cook chicken in a large pan or nonstick skillet over medium high heat, stirring throughout until cooked through. Place chicken in a bowl and set aside.
3. Unroll Pillsburry crescent rolls and separate each triangle. Take two of the triangles and put them side by side, pinch the touching sides together in the middle so that they form one large triangle. Repeat with remaining dough. (You should now have four large dough triangles) Spread 3-4 tablespoons of alfredo sauce onto each dough triangle. Place chicken pieces on top of sauce. Sprinkle parmesan cheese over chicken. Starting with the big flat end of the triangle, carefully roll the dough toward the smaller pointy end. Place rolled croissant onto prepared baking sheet. Repeat process with remaining triangles.
4. Bake 8-10 minutes until puffy and lightly browned. Remove from oven. Top with additional sauce and parmesan cheese if desired. Serve warm.
