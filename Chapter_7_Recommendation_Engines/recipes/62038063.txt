Ingredients:
10 large baking potatoes
3 bunches green onions, chopped
2 cups sour cream
1 cup shredded, sharp cheddar cheese
6 slices of cooked bacon crumbled

Directions:
Bake potatoes just until a knife slides through easily.  When they have cooled, grate them into a large bowl, discarding skins.  Add chopped onions, cheese, sour cream, crumbled bacon and salt and pepper.
Slightly grease a large casserole dish and fill dish with potato mixture.  Bake covered for 45 min. and then uncovered for 15- min.  This dish can be made the night before, however cooking times take much longer.
