Description: 
My husband spent 2 years in the Philippines as a missionary. Along with his life-changing experience, he brought home a rich culinary repertoire that he incorporated into our family recipes. He passed away in 2016, and these recipes have become things our children treasure. They are part of the memories and fabric that keep his memory bright and alive. Here is ginisang sardinas which is a wonderful way to use canned sardines. This is usually eaten spooned over rice per each individual's desire/taste.
