Ingredients:
1 large head bok choy
1 tablespoon cooking oil
3 teaspoons low sodium soy sauce, divided
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat cooking oil in a large heavy skillet over high heat until you can see just whisps of smoke.
Meanwhile, chop off the stem end of the head of bok choy, and discard.  Wash the stalks well.  Slice the stalks and leaves into 1/2 inch slices.
Add the sliced stalks only to the hot skillet. They should sizzle.  Sprinkle the stalks with 2 tsp soy sauce, cover, reduce heat to medium low and braise for 5 minutes.
Remove lid and add the leaves to the skillet.  Sprinkle the remaining 1 tsp soy sauce and the garlic powder over the bok choy.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Cover the skillet and braise for and additional 2 or 3 minutes, or until the leaves have wilted.  Remove cover, taste for seasoning, and serve.

A touch of soy sauce and a hint of garlic bring out the natural goodness of this under-used and delicious vegetable.  Great as a side dish with any Asian inspired meal.
