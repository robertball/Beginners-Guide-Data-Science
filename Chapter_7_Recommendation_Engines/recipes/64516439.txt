Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups long grain rice
2 cups water
4 cups milk
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 tsp. salt
1/4 cup butter
Sliced or ground almonds
Cinnamon, optional

Directions:
Simmer rice and water in saucepan for 10 minutes.
Add milk and bring to boil.
Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered x 20 - 25 minutes, or until rice is tender. Stir to prevent mixture from burning.
Add sugar, salt and butter; mix well.
Spoon into dessert dishes.
Garnish with almonds and sprinkle with cinnamon, if using.

Description: 
This version is much richer (aka more fat & sugar!) than my everyday rice pudding recipe. If you don't have a sweet tooth, try a different recipe ;)  And for the raisin-haters, this one is free of those pesky juicy little brown specs!
