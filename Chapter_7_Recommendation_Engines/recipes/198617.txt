Ingredients:
4 (1-inch thick) pork chops
3 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles root beer
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup beef stock
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon chipotle-flavored hot sauce
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 pinch salt, to taste

Directions:
Place the pork chops in a dish; pour 2 cans of the root beer over the chops. Place in refrigerator to marinate at least 2 hours. Remove the pork chops from the root beer; season with salt and pepper.
Combine the remaining can of root beer, the beef stock, brown sugar, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce in a saucepan over medium heat; simmer the mixture until it reduces to about 3/4 cup. Set aside.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Grill the pork chops on the preheated grill until the no longer pink in the center, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Brush the chops generously with the reduction sauce and continue cooking for about 2 minutes more per side. Remove from grill and brush with any remaining sauce. Season with salt to taste before serving.

These are great for outdoor grilling. Simple and very tasty. The glaze at the end gives them a lot of concentrated flavor.
