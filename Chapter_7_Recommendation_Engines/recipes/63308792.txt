Ingredients:
1/4 tsp. ground saffron
1/2 c. olive oil
2 cloves garlic, finely minced or pressed
3 tbsp. freshly squeezes lemon juice
1/4 tsp. ground cumin
2 tsp. ground turmeric
1 tsp. granulated sugar
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 lb. pastina (tiny pasta)
2/3 c. pine nuts, lightly toasted
1/2 c. currants, plumped in hot water for about 20 minutes, drained
1/4 c. each chopped fresh mint & parsley
3 tbsp. chopped fresh coriander (cilantro)
Fresh mint sprigs or leaves (garnish)
Orange blossom water

Directions:
1. Dissolve saffron in olive oil and let stand about 15 minutes. Add garlic, lemon juice, cumin, turmeric, sugar and salt and pepper to taste; set aside. Dissolve in lemon juice, it works much better.
2. Cook pasta in 3 quarts boiling water until very al dente. Drain and rinse well in cold water, then drain again. Place in a large bowl and toss with saffron flavored oil. Cool to room temperature, occasionally stirring the pasta to coat thoroughly.
3. Add pine nuts, drained currants, chopped mint, parsley and coriander to pasta. Serve at room temperature garnished with mint sprigs or leaves and pomegranate seeds, if available. Sprinkle lightly with orange blossom water just before serving.

Description: 
Tiny pastina, most often used in soups, approximates the ubiquitous couscous of North African cuisine. The slight sweetness makes this a good side dish with roasted or grilled meats.
