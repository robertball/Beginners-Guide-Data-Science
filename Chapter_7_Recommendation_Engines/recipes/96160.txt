Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon butter
4 (1-inch-thick) boneless pork chops
Salt and ground black pepper
1 pound sliced mushrooms
2 large garlic cloves, finely minced
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/3 cup chicken broth
1/3 cup white wine
1/4 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Coat chops with remaining oil and lightly season them with pepper. Add mushrooms; saute until liquid evaporates and mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme and season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a plate.
Add chops to the empty, hot skillet; saute until well browned, about 5 minutes on each side to an internal temperature of 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer each chop to a dinner plate, cover and keep warm.
Return mushrooms to pan; mix broth and wine and add to pan; simmer until  reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in cream until blended. Spoon a portion  of mushroom sauce over each chop and serve.
