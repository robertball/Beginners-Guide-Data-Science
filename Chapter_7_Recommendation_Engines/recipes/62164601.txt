Ingredients:
6 good sized red potatoes
4 tbs butter
olive oil
garlic powder

Directions:
Wash your red potatoes and cut them in half. Leave skins! Add a few good shakes of garlic powder and salt to boiling water. Boil  potatoes until soft all the way through.
In a large skillet, mash potatoes over medium/high heat. Melt butter in the skillet, add a few more good shakes of garlic powder and fold into mashed potatoes. Form mashed potatoes into a large patty and douse the edges of the patty with olive oil, allow to get under the patty as well.
Watch your mashed potato patty, as you want it to be golden brown on the bottom. Once you've achieved a golden crisp bottom break up the patty and fold the crisp bottom throughout the potatoes. Repeat once and enjoy your fried mashed potatoes.
