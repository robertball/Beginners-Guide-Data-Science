Ingredients:
2 (8 inch) flour tortillas
cooking spray
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 onion, chopped
1 (12 ounce) can pinto beans, drained
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 cup water
1 cup roasted tomato salsa
1/2 cup guacamole
1/4 cup shredded lettuce
2 tablespoons corn

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray both sides of the tortillas with cooking spray; place on a baking sheet.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in beans, paprika, and cumin. Add water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until beans are soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain beans and transfer to a bowl. Set aside a handful for garnish. Mash remaining beans.
In the meantime, bake tortillas in the preheated oven until golden and crispy, about 5 minutes per side.
Spread mashed beans over the tortillas. Smooth salsa on top. Add a large scoop of guacamole. Garnish with reserved beans, lettuce, and corn.
