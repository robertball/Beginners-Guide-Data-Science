Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/4 cup cornstarch
3 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon rubbed sage
1 teaspoon pepper

1/4 cup water
2 broiler/fryer chickens (3 to 4 pounds), cut up
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, cornmeal, cornstarch, salt, paprika, oregano, sage and pepper. In a shallow bowl, beat eggs and water. Dip chicken in egg mixture; place in the bag, a few pieces at a time, and shake until coated.
In an electric skillet, heat 1 in. of oil to 375 degrees F. Fry chicken, a few pieces at a time, for 3-5 minutes on each side or until golden and crispy.
Place in two ungreased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pans. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until chicken is tender and juices run clear.

Description: 
This Sunday dinner staple is first fried and then baked to a crispy golden brown. Well-seasoned with oregano and sage, this classic is sure to satisfy diners at church potlucks or late-summer picnics, too. I love fixing it for family and friends. -Donna Kuhaupt, Slinger, Wisconsin
