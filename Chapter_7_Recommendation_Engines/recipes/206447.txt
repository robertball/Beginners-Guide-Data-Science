Ingredients:
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 head red leaf lettuce, torn
3 green onions, chopped
1 Granny Smith apple, cored and chopped
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and chopped
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
Dressing:
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons white sugar
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Place the almonds and 1 tablespoon of sugar in a small skillet over medium-low heat, and cook and stir until the sugar melts and the almonds brown, watching carefully to avoid burning. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
In a large salad bowl, mix the lettuce, green onions, apple, avocado, dried cranberries, blue cheese, and cooked almonds.
Whisk together the vinegar, 2 teaspoons of sugar, and salt and pepper in a bowl, and stir in the vegetable oil. Pour the dressing over the salad, and gently toss to combine.
