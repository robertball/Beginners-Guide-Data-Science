Ingredients:
1 stick (1/2 cup) butter, room temperature
1 ounce unsweetened chocolate, melted
1 cup sugar
2 eggs, room temperature
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup cocoa powder (good quality, such as ghiradelli)
1 1/8 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt (heaping)
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon instant coffee

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees (or 325 degrees convection).
Prepare muffin pan with liners.
Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.
Mix buttermilk, vanilla extract  and instant coffee in a separate cup.
Cream butter.  Add melted chocolate and mix. Then add sugar a little at a time. Mix until light and fluffy.
Beat in the eggs one at a time until light and fluffy.
Add flour mixture and buttermilk mixture alternately, starting with flour mixture and ending with flour mixture until fully--but not overly--mixed.
Fill muffin papers 1/2 full and bake for 15 minutes (or fill muffin papers 3/4 full and bake for 18-20 minutes) until top springs back lightly when touched.
