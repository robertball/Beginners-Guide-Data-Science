Ingredients:
4 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast (two packets)
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 cups water
3 1/2 cups bread flour
1 1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Dough:
In the bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer put the yeast, sugar, and water and let it sit for about 10 minutes
Add 3 cups flour, salt and vinegar and beat for several minutes with the paddle.
Add the last 1/2 cup of flour and switch to the dough hook and beat for seven minutes. (Alternately, knead vigorously for five minutes, or until the dough becomes extremely elastic.)
Lightly grease a microwave-safe bowl with vegetable oil and transfer the bread dough to it, rolling it in the oil. Cover the bowl with a very wet towel then cover the whole thing with a dry towel.
Rise:
Let rise for 2 hours.
OR
Microwave on HIGH for 25 seconds.
Let rest in the microwave for about five minutes.
Microwave on HIGH for another 25 seconds, then remove.
Let rest and rise for another 15 minutes.
Bake:
Preheat over to 450F and put oven proof Ikea pot in to warm as the oven heats.
Shape dough into a ball and plop into the preheated pan.
Quickly slash the top with a knife.
Cover and bake for about 30 minutes.
Remove the cover and bake for another 10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
The internal temperature should be between 210F to 220F.
