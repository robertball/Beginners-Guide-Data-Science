Ingredients:
butter
1 tsp water
1 slice bread
1 egg
dashes of hot sauce to taste

Directions:
Put the bread in the toaster.
Put a small, non-stick pan over medium-high heat.
In a small bowl, beat the egg, then add the water.
Rub a pat of butter over the hot pan, just enough to create a thin layer of butter.
Once the butter sizzles (if it doesn't right away) pour in the egg mixture.
Once the egg firms up enough, about 30 seconds, fold one half over the other.
Let cook for another 10 seconds, then take the pan off the heat.
Put your bread (it should be toasted by now) on a plate. Slide the egg onto the bread.
Dash some hot sauce on there.
Slice in half, assemble sandwich, eat!
