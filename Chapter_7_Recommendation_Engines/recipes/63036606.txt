Ingredients:
16 ounces Oreo cookies , crushed
8 ounces cream cheese , softened
24 ounces white chocolate bark
24 ounces chocolate bark

Directions:
Using a blender or hand held mixer, mix Oreos and cream cheese together.
Roll into walnut size balls.
Chill for an hour.
Melt approximately 3/4 package of white almond bark.
Stick a toothpick in an Oreo ball and dip it in the melted white almond bark.
Allow to harden on wax paper. (Takes about 15 minutes.)
While waiting, melt about 1/4 package of chocolate almond bark.
When Oreo balls are no longer sticky to the touch, decorate with drizzles of chocolate and white almond bark.
*I just use a sandwich bag with a tiny hole cut in one corner to drizzle the almond bark.

My husband first had these at a work function and then begged his co-worker for the recipe. These are delicious and super easy! You can try different sandwich cookies and even add chopped candy bars to change it up some!
