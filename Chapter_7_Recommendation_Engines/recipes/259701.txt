Ingredients:
Filling:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
1/3 cup white sugar
1 egg
2 tablespoons 100% pure pumpkin
6 drops yellow food coloring (optional)
3 drops red food coloring (optional)
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips, or more to taste
Cake:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 cup water
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Place cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar, egg, pumpkin, yellow food coloring, red food coloring, and salt in a bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until thoroughly combined and no lumps remain. Stir in chocolate chips.
Whisk flour, 1 cup sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl. Mix in water, oil, vinegar, and vanilla extract until batter is well blended.
Fill muffin cups 1/2-full with batter; top with 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle a few chocolate chips on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
