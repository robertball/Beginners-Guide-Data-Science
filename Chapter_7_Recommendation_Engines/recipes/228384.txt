Ingredients:
2 onions, chopped
2 green bell peppers, chopped
4 carrots, cut into match-stick size pieces
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into cubes
1 cup orange juice
1 cup whiskey
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup vinegar
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil
2 1/2 cups water
1 1/4 cups white rice
1 tablespoon butter, or to taste
1/2 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Place onions, green bell peppers, and carrots in the pressure cooker; add chicken. Whisk 1 cup orange juice, whiskey, brown sugar, vinegar, red pepper flakes, ginger, and sesame oil together in a bowl; pour over chicken mixture. Stir to combine. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. COUNT BOTH IN COOK TIME
While chicken is cooking, combine water and rice in a microwave-safe casserole dish. Cook on high in microwave until water is absorbed and rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir butter into rice; toss well.
Release pressure from the pressure cooker using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes.
Whisk 1/2 cup orange juice and cornstarch together in a bowl; stir into hot chicken mixture until whiskey sauce is thickened. Serve chicken over the hot buttered rice.

Description: 
For all you fans of my 'Chicken Vicious', here is the Polynesian counterpart. Sweet, tangy, easy, spicy, and absolutely the best Polynesian chicken dish you ever tasted! For all you pressure cooker fans, this is a snap. This will also work in a regular Dutch oven, but the cook time will be about 3 times as long.
