Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. BONELESS chicken breast
1-2 Jars Pepperoncini Peppers
3-4 GREEN bell peppers
2 LARGE cans Chicken Broth
2 C. Flour
2 tsp Garlic Powder
Salt and Pepper
8 C Cooked Rice

Directions:
Combine Flour Garlic Powder Salt and Pepper (to taste) in a bowl.
Dice your chicken into bite size peices. (I stress using Boneless breasts because of the dicing)
Dip your chicken into the Flour mixture and BROWN in lg Pan with Oil. DO NOT FULLY COOK YOUR CHICKEN OR THE SOUP WILL NOT TURN OUT.
Slice your Green Bell Peppers (I have tried many different versions and if you would like a slight sweet twist to your spicy soup use red bell peppers instead) and add to the Pot.
Open chicken broth and also add to the pot.
Drain off the oil from your browned chicken and add to the pot.
Cook on high until boiling, then turn to a medium low, at this time you will add your pepperoncini peppers. 1/2 Jar for just a small amount of spice, 2 Jars for alot of heat.
Continue cooking until vegetables are soft. Serve over rice.
