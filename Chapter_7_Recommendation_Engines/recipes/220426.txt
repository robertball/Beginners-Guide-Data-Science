Ingredients:
2 large eggplant, peeled and sliced into 1/3-inch strips
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or to taste
1 (8 ounce) package grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 egg
1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 (6 ounce) container feta cheese
8 ounces frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained

Directions:
Soak eggplant slices in a large bowl of lightly salted water for 30 minutes. Drain and pat dry with paper towels.
Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Whisk olive oil and Italian seasoning together in a bowl.
Brush both sides of eggplant slices with the seasoned olive oil.
Arrange eggplant slices on a baking sheet and place in preheated oven; broil until browned, 2 to 4 minutes on each side.
Set oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Measure 1 cup of Parmesan cheese and set aside.
Stir ricotta cheese, egg, and remaining Parmesan cheese together in a bowl.
Stir spaghetti sauce, diced tomatoes, and ketchup together in a separate bowl.
Spread a small amount of spaghetti sauce mixture in the bottom of a casserole dish.
Top spaghetti sauce mixture with a layer of broiled eggplant slices.
Cover eggplant layer with a layer of the ricotta mixture.
Sprinkle a layer of feta on top of the ricotta mixture.
Cover feta layer with ground beef layer.
Sprinkle a layer of spinach on top of ground beef.
Repeat with remaining ingredients, ending with a final layer of eggplant topped with the reserved 1 cup Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and cheese is browned, about 40 minutes.
Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Roasted eggplant strips take the place of pasta strips and feta cheese takes the place of mozarella. This is a fun and delicious twist on the Italian favorite.
