Description: 
In Minnesota we say hotdish instead of casserole! This is a great recipe to use up that leftover turkey! I created this recipe by taking elements from several noodle casseroles to create a dish to my tastes. My family gobbles this stuff up... my hubby even calls it his favorite hotdish!
