Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
8 (4 ounce) skinless, bone-in chicken thighs
2 medium red onions, sliced
1 large green pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Tomato Soup
1/3 cup golden raisins
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), rinsed and drained
1/3 cup slivered almonds, toasted

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 5-quart saucepot over medium high heat. Add the chicken in batches and cook until well browned on both sides. Remove the chicken from the saucepot.
Reduce the heat to medium.  Add the onions, pepper and garlic and cook for 5 minutes or until they're tender-crisp. Add the cinnamon and curry and cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the soup and heat to a boil.  Return the chicken to the saucepot. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 15 minutes.
Stir the raisins and chickpeas in the saucepot. Cook for 10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the almonds.
