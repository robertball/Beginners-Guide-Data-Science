Ingredients:
3 tbsp cup mayo
3 tbsp cup crema
3 tbsp cup gochujang (alternatively, use 1 teaspoon ancho chili powder for regular elotes)
1 cup finely crumbled cotija cheese
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
4 ears of corn
2 tbsp cooking oil
3 tbsp hot/melted butter
salt
pepper,freshly ground
lime wedges (for garnishing)

Directions:
Mix mayo, crema, crumbled cheese, gochujang (or chili powder), chopped cilantro, and minced garlic into a large bowl. Mix well. Cover and set in the fridge
Carefully peel back the husks of each ear of corn about 3/4 of the way. Remove as much of the silk as you can without pulling the husks off. Put the husks back up.
Bring a large skillet/pan (or BBQ/grill) to high heat w/ 2 tbsp coking oil. Once hot, add 4 ears of corn, rotating every 5 minutes or so (when the side is charred a bit). Every time you rotate an ear, sprinkle with a small amount of salt and pepper (slip it under the husks). This should take 20 minutes total.
When the corn is done, mix the hot/melted butter into the bowl (I put the butter in the microwave for 30 sec) with the cheese-gochujang mix.
Peel the husks back completely but donâ€™t detach them. Use either a spoon to coat the corn on all sides, or dredge the corn (use tongs, as the corn will be hot) into the bowl, with the mixture and serve immediately with lime wedges. Season to taste with additional gochujang and/or ancho chili powder.

Description: 
This is a fusion between Mexican Street Corn and Korean Gochujang (red pepper paste).  You can skip the gochujang for ancho chili powder for a more traditional taste.
