Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed
6 shallots, peeled and thinly sliced
5 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1/4 cup sliced almonds
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place green beans in a large bowl. Mix in shallots, garlic, and almonds. Drizzle olive oil over the top; sprinkle salt and pepper evenly on top. Toss until everything is evenly coated with oil. Spread in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until beans are slightly shriveled and shallots are lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
