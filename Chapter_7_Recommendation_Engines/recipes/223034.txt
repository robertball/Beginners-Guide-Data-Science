Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
1 pound kohlrabi, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
2 1/2 cups milk
1 bay leaf
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup uncooked orzo pasta

Directions:
Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium-low heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until soft, about 10 minutes. Add kohlrabi; cook and stir another 2 minutes. Pour vegetable broth and milk over the onion mixture. Add bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil, place a cover on the pot, and reduce heat to low; cook at a simmer until kohlrabi is tender, about 25 minutes.
Remove and discard bay leaf; allow the soup to cool slightly. Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway. Pulse the blender a few times before leaving on to puree. Work in batches until all soup is blended. Return pureed soup to stockpot; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle orzo pasta into the soup; cover the stockpot and simmer until the orzo is tender, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is a simple but hearty dish. It's similar to cream of broccoli soup only much better! My husband loves this soup so much he planted kohlrabi in our garden; it looks like a small green turnip. The taste and texture of kohlrabi are similar to those of a broccoli stem or cabbage heart, but milder and sweeter. Serve with your favorite bread.
