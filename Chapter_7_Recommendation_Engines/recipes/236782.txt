Ingredients:
1 (24 ounce) jar Ragu® Old World Style® Traditional Pasta Sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, pressed
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 small yellow onion, sliced
1/2 pound deli sliced Angus roast beef
6 slices provolone cheese
6 hoagie buns

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Pour sauce into a small saucepan; cover and heat over low until just warm.
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute olive oil with garlic, peppers, and onion until vegetables soften, about 3 to 5 minutes; remove vegetables from pan. Add roast beef to skillet. Saute over medium-high heat until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
To assemble sandwiches, open each hoagie bun lengthwise and divide roast beef slices among the rolls. Top with vegetables, about 1/4 cup of Ragu(R) Old World Style(R) Traditional Sauce, and one slice of provolone cheese. (Heat remainder of sauce for dipping, if desired.)
Place hoagies on a baking sheet and bake for about 3 to 5 minutes until cheese is melted. Serve hot and enjoy!
