Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dry ziti pasta
1 pound mild Italian sausage
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 egg
1 large yellow onion, minced
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
39 ounces Classico® Tomato and Basil Sauce
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Italian cheese blend
1 teaspoon dried basil (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the ziti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
While pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage, and cook and stir until brown, about 10 minutes. Drain sausage and set aside.
Stir together the ricotta, egg, onion, garlic, and oregano in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in the drained pasta, the drained sausage, salt, pepper, and 13 ounces of pasta sauce; mix well.
In the prepared baking dish, cover the bottom with 8 ounces of pasta sauce. Layer 1/2 of the pasta mixture, 8 ounces of pasta sauce, and 1/2 of the shredded cheese. Then layer the remaining 1/2 of the pasta, 10 ounces of pasta sauce, and 1/2 of the cheese. Sprinkle with basil. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Uncover; return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, 5 to 10 more minutes.
