Description: 
We hadn't been shopping and had surprise company. I just threw together leftovers and created this magnificent dip. Now I fix it whenever family or company stops by! Serve with toast, chips or toasted tortillas. Diced chicken breast may be used in place of canned chicken, and black olives may be added. I've also used this as a casserole by mixing in cooked noodles.
