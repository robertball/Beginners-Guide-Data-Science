Ingredients:
1  egg
½ cup milk
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce
½ cup flour
½ cup tapioca starch
1 ½ teaspoons seasoned salt
1 teaspoon garlic granules
½ teaspoon cumin
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
cooking spray
¼ cup plain Greek yogurt
3 tablespoons sweet chili sauce
1 teaspoon hot sauce

Directions:
Preheat air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk together egg, milk, and hot sauce in a shallow bowl. Combine flour, tapioca starch, salt, garlic, and cumin in a second bowl. Dip chicken pieces first in the egg mixture, then dredge in the dry mix, shaking off excess. Place in batches in the air fryer basket, careful to not overcrowd, and lightly spray chicken with oil.
Cook, shaking basket after 5 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes per batch.
Mix together Greek yogurt, sweet chili sauce, and hot sauce in a small bowl. Serve sauce with the chicken.

Description: 
This is an Americanized version of bang bang chicken cooked in an air fryer. To prevent the chicken from losing its crispy texture, I prefer to serve the sauce on the side.
