Ingredients:
2 tablespoons oil, divided, or as needed
1 pound eggplant, sliced
4 cilantro roots
1 small onion, chopped
2 small chile peppers, or more to taste

3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons fish sauce
9 ounces extra-firm tofu, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/3 cup Thai basil

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or skillet and saute eggplant in batches on both sides until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side, adding more oil as needed.
Combine cilantro roots, onion, chile peppers, garlic, sugar, lime juice, and fish sauce in a mortar; crush with a pestle into a soft paste.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or skillet over high heat, add curry paste and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add eggplant, cover, and cook for 3 minutes. Mix in tofu and Thai basil.

Description: 
I like to make my own curry paste, because it intensifies the flavor of the curry immensely. Besides curry paste, all you need are eggplant and tofu. Serve over rice.
