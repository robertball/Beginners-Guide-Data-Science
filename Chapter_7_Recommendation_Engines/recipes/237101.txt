Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups light cream
1/4 cup butter
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup cornmeal
4 eggs, separated
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch ground white pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a casserole or souffle dish.
Combine cream, butter, sugar, honey, and salt in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until butter melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly stir cornmeal into cream mixture until thickened but not boiling, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour cornmeal mixture into a large bowl.
Beat egg yolks, 1 at a time, into cornmeal mixture, ensuring egg yolk is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir baking powder and white pepper into cornmeal-egg yolk mixture.
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Fold egg whites into cornmeal-egg yolk mixture; pour into the prepared dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and puffed, about 35 minutes.

Description: 
This is an old southern dish that's good for holiday gatherings and family get-togethers. I love this recipe because it has such wonderful flavors in it, and I would serve it with fried chicken and green beans with sauteed sweet peppers.
