Description: 
I have to admit- I was a little spectical about making this recipe before I tried it. It was really really good however, and definitaly something I'll make again and again. 
I didn't have a pot to make it in, so i made it in a glass pie dish and covered it with tin foil. After 45 minutes i took off the tinfoil and left it for another 10 min before taking out. 
Worked out perfectly!
