Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole meal rye flour
3/4 cup filtered or spring water
1 1/2 cups bread flour
3/4 cup filtered or spring water

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together 1/2 cup rye flour with 1/4 cup water to make a thick paste.  Cover with a damp cloth, and set aside at room temperature for 24 hours.
Stir well, and discard 1/2 of the rye flour paste.  Stir 1/2 cup rye flour and 1/4 cup water into the remainder.  Cover with a damp cloth, and set aside at room temperature for 24 hours. Repeat for day three.
Some activity should now be noticeable: the starter should be bubbly.  Stir well.  Measure starter, and transfer to a 1 quart glass jar.   Stir in amounts of water and bread flour equal to the amount of starter. Add more water until the starter resembles a thick but pourable batter. Set aside for 24 hours.
Starter should be very active with lots of bubbles in the batter.  Stir well.  Measure, and return 1 cup starter to the jar.  Begin feeding regularly, every 4 to 6 hours, doubling the starter each time. For instance, if you have 1 cup starter, add 1 cup bread flour and 1 cup water.
