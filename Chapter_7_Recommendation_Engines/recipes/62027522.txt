Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
2 cups tomato juice
6oz. tomato paste
3 1/2 cups water
2 tablespoons minced onion
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons oregano
1 teaspoon white sugar
8oz. angel hair pasta

Directions:
In a large pot, brown the ground beef and drain. To the ground beef add all ingredients except the pasta. Bring this to a boil then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the pasta (I usually break it into pieces) stir well, cover and simmer for another 30 minutes, stirring every so often so that the noodles do not stick together. This is wonderful with garlic bread or texas toast.
