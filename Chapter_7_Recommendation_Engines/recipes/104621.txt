Ingredients:
2 pounds steelhead trout fillets
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 cup barbeque sauce

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Arrange the trout fillets on large piece of aluminum foil. Whisk together the butter, lemon juice, paprika, and cayenne pepper; brush the mixture onto the fillets.
Cook on the preheated grill until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes; brush the fillets with the barbeque sauce; cook another 2 minutes.

Description: 
A steelhead is really just a rainbow trout that has been to either one of the Great Lakes or to the ocean for most of its life and has returned to it's birthplace to spawn. This is a twisted way to serve steelhead or any other trout or salmon. It may sound odd, but this is a delicious dish.
