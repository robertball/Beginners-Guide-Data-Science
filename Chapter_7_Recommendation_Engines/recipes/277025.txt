Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups sushi rice, or Japanese short-grain white rice
2 cups water
1/2 cup rice wine vinegar
1/4 cup sugar
1/8 cup sake
12 ounces imitation crabmeat, flaked
1 cup seeded and chopped cucumber
1 avocado, chopped
1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Rinse rice in a strainer under cold water until water runs clear. Transfer rice to a medium saucepan, add 3 cups water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook under rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine rice wine vinegar, sugar, and sake in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until sugar is completely dissolved, about 1 minute.
Place cooked rice in a large bowl. Stir in vinegar mixture until well combined and let sit for 2 minutes. Stir again. Add imitation crabmeat, cucumber, and chopped avocado; mix well. Use soy sauce to season individual portions.

Description: 
I created this yummy salad because I love sushi, but have neither the equipment nor the patience to make sushi rolls.  For the best sushi rice, a rice cooker is a necessity. This recipe can be easily adapted to reflect your own favorite variety of sushi.
