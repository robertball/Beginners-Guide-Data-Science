Ingredients:
1/2 cup bourbon whiskey (such as Canadian Mist®)
1/3 cup blackstrap molasses
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)
1 (6 pound) bone-in turkey breast

Directions:
Stir whiskey, molasses, and brown sugar in a saucepan until brown sugar has dissolved. Place over medium heat, bring to a simmer, and turn off heat; stir salt and hot pepper sauce into mixture. Pour marinade into a large bowl.
Place turkey breast into the marinade with skin side down; let stand for 1 hour, turning turkey breast over occasionally. Transfer turkey to a roasting pan. Retain marinade for basting.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Roast turkey breast in the preheated oven until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 45 minutes. Baste turkey occasionally with retained marinade. Allow turkey breast to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
