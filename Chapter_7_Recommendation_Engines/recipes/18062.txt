Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package firm tofu

Directions:
Leave tofu in original package and place in freezer for 72 hours.
Bring a pot of water to a simmer. Place package of tofu in water and allow to thaw, approximately 10 minutes. When thawed, remove from package, place in a piece of cheesecloth, and squeeze out liquid. Shred, dice, or slice tofu and include in your favorite recipe.

Description: 
This is a great substitute for any recipe which calls for cooked, diced, or chopped chicken meat. Freezing tofu gives it a meat-like texture. The process is very easy, but you'll need to plan 72 hours ahead.
