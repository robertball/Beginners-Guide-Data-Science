Ingredients:
1 pound ground lamb
1 onion, grated
1 egg
3 tablespoons minced fresh dill
1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro
2 teaspoons coarse salt
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package baby carrots
2 (15.5 ounce) cans cannellini beans
1 cup water
1 tablespoon sour cream

Directions:
Mix together the ground lamb, onion, egg, dill, cilantro, salt, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, and pepper in a bowl until evenly incorporated.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble the lamb mixture into the skillet and cook until no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the carrots to the mixture; reduce heat to medium. Pour in the contents of the 2 cans of beans and the water; stir. Simmer mixture 25 minutes. Stir the sour cream through the mixture; cook until the liquid thickens, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
Based on the ingredients of the lula kebab, this Middle Eastern-derived recipe uses ground lamb, carrots, and white beans to create a tasty stew-like dish for serving over rice. It's good for those one-bowl meals and reheats well. The flavors get even better after a day. Add more meat and fewer beans if you like a meatier dish. Also, you can mix in beef with lamb, but the lamb flavor is essential. I like cumin, but you can always take away the spice, or try adding a minced serrano chili pepper or two for some heat.
