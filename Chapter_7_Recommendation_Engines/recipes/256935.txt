Description: 
One of the most iconic foods from Hawaii is a dish called poke. It is a traditional Hawaiian dish that usually consists of raw fish and various seasonings which may include soy sauce, sesame oil, Hawaiian salt, onions, chili peppers... and the list goes on. I wanted to create a chicken wing appetizer with the flavorings of poke. This is a very simple recipe, but it is bursting with flavor.
