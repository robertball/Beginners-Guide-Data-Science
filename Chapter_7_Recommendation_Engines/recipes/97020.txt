Ingredients:
1 cup heavy cream
1 pinch white pepper, or to taste
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®) (optional)
3 tablespoons prepared horseradish

Directions:
Whisk the cream in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the cream should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Season with the white pepper, hot sauce, and horseradish. Stir to combine.

Description: 
This is a fabulous addition to prime rib and other cuts of beef. The whipped cream tones down the heat of the horseradish, so even kids like this. Plus it's pretty! You can substitute 1/4 cup of freshly grated horseradish for the 3 tablespoons of prepared horseradish.
