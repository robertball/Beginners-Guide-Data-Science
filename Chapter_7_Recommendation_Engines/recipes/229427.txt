https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/998123.jpg
Ingredients:
2 cups panko bread crumbs
1 tablespoon parsley flakes
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
Stir panko bread crumbs, parsley flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper together in a bowl. Dip tenderloin slices in the crumb mixture to coat both sides.
Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet and fry the pork until the crumb coating is browned and the pork is no longer pink inside, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the pork should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).

Description: 
I love this recipe because it's very easy and very much an under-20-minute recipe when you are in a hurry! I serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and a side of either mixed veggies or some sweet corn on the cob! I top it with my Mustard Pork Garnish recipe I have on site.
