Ingredients:
Aioli Dipping Sauce:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon finely minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 pinches Cajun seasoning
Patties:
12 ounces salmon, minced
1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon finely minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1 lemon
cooking spray

Directions:
Mix mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice, and Cajun seasoning together in a small bowl and refrigerate dipping sauce until needed.
Place salmon, chives, parsley, garlic, and salt in a medium bowl and mix well. Add flour and mix well. Divide into 4 equal portions; mold into patties.
Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut lemon into 4 slices.
Place lemon slices into the bottom of the air fryer basket and place salmon patties on top. Lightly spray patties with cooking spray.
Place the basket into the preheated fryer and drop the temperature to to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
Cook in the air fryer until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a patty reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes. Serve with sauce.
