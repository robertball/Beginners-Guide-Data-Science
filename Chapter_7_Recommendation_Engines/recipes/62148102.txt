Optional - Basil, Oregano, or Parsley

Directions:
In a small sauce pot, heat olive oil, onion powder, and minced garlic over medium heat. Slowly stir in the chicken broth and milk.  Once the mixture begins to bubble, add the cream cheese and the parmesan cheese, pepper, and any Italian herbs that you like. Use a whisk to mix the sauce well then cook for 2-3 minutes over low heat.  Remove from heat when the sauce is creamy and whisk once more. Sauce will thicken up a bit while cooling.
