Ingredients:
5 fresh raspberries
6 tablespoons water, divided
1 teaspoon honey, or to taste
3/4 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste
ice cubes (optional)
1/2 (12 fluid ounce) can grapefruit-flavored seltzer (such as SanpellegrinoÂ®)
1 calamansi lime, halved

Directions:
Use a fork or spoon to mash raspberries in a small bowl. Mix in 2 tablespoons water. Stir in honey and sugar until dissolved. Strain into another small bowl and set aside.
Fill a glass with ice. Add remaining water and seltzer. Squeeze in juice from the lime. Slowly pour in the raspberry mixture; it will sink to the bottom and create a pretty ombre effect. Get the maximum raspberry flavor by mixing your drink before taking a sip.
