Description: 
A simple cooked dressing gives this crisp cabbage mixture a delightful sweet-and-sour flavor my family savors. When I was a child, my mother used the recipe often, too. It's perfect for potlucks since you make it ahead, then chill it before serving. -Ronnie Stone, Arapahoe, North Carolina
