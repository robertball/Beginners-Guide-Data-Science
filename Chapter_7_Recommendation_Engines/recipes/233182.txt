2 sleeves buttery round crackers (such as RitzÂ®), crushed and divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Stir whole kernel corn, cream-style corn, sugar, egg, and about 3/4 of the melted butter together in a casserole dish. Fold about half the crushed crackers into the corn mixture. Sprinkle remaining crushed crackers over the top of the mixture and drizzle with the remaining butter.

Description: 
This is always requested over and over again. I love it and I don't really like corn. My best friend made this once and convinced me to try it, now it's a tradition to make for all holidays.
