Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 teaspoon ground, toasted cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 16-ounce can tomatoes, seeded and chopped, with juice
2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 medium parsnips, peeled, and cut into 1-inch chunks
3 medium to large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
1 medium rutabaga, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
3 medium turnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
1 pound wedge winter squash, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
1 bulb fennel, trimmed, and cut into sixths, lengthwise
1 pound can chick peas, rinsed and drained
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint or parsley, for garnish
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, for garnish

Directions:
1) In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil and saut√© onion until it just starts to turn color. Add garlic, curry, cumin and cayenne and cook a few minutes, stirring, so that garlic does not burn. Add tomatoes, stock and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and simmer 10 minutes.
2) Meanwhile, in a large bowl, toss vegetables with salt and pepper. Fold in chick peas and put in the clay pot. Pour stock mixture over. Put in a crock pot and cook on high 1 hour or until all vegetables are tender.
3) Garnish with parsley and sesame seeds and serve in soup plates with good, country bread or over couscous or basmati rice.

Description: 
Adapted from recipe on Samcooks.com.  Original recipe calls for baking stew in a clay pot.   I don't have one so I'm going to try a crock pot instead.
