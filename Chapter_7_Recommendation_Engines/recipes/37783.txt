Description: 
Here is another of my Mom's old recipes. It is great for leftover turkey after the holidays, when you tire of turkey soups and sandwiches. Optional: if you want to show off, garnish with fresh parsley and side dishes of raisins, chutney, slivered almonds, hard cooked eggs, and both sweet and dill pickle spears.
