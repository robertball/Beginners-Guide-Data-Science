Description: 
This is my customization of a recipe from Jean Enerson of Seattle KING-TV.  It's easy to customize, using your favorite dried fruits and nuts, and syrups of your choice. My favorite is almonds and dried apricots. If using a mixture of syrups and honey, don't mix honey and molasses (it makes a bad-smelling gas). I substitute 1 C. xylitol for syrup, because it helps prevent tooth decay. If using xylitol, you have to bring the wet ingredients to a boil. The bars can be put into ziplock bags & stashed in your purse or lunch bag. I added the cinnamon to her excellent recipe.Modified from: Granola Energy Bars
