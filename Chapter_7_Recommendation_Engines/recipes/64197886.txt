Ingredients:
6 small yellow summer squash
Sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tbsp olive oil
1 red bell pepper (ribs and seeds removed),  diced
1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp chipotle powder
2 tsp oregano
1 14oz block extra firm tofu, drained and crumbled
1 cup frozen corn kernels
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup grated Monterrey Jack Cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Cut each squash in half, lengthwise.  With a soup spoon, scoop out the center of the squash, leaving at least 1/4 inch on each side.  Reserve half the removed squash and dice.
Place squash on a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Add reserved squash, bell pepper, white parts of scallions, and garlic.  Saute, stirring occasionally, until bell pepper begins to soften.
Add tomato paste, chili powder, chipotle powder, and oregano and saute 1 minute more.
Add tofu and heat through.  Remove from heat and stir in corn and Parmesan cheese.
Spoon tofu mixture into each squash equally.   Sprinkle with Monterrey Jack cheese.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes, or until squash is tender.  Remove foil and bake an additional 7 minutes.
Garnish squash with green parts of scallions.  Serve immediately.
