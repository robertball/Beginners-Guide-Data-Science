Ingredients:
1 pound mild Italian sausage
1 1/4 teaspoons red pepper flakes
4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 large onion, diced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
5 (13.75 ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth
1 cup cauliflower florets
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 bunch spinach, tough stems removed

Directions:
Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add sausage and red pepper flakes; cook until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease and transfer sausage to a bowl.
Reduce heat to medium and cook bacon in the same pot until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings in the pot. Stir in onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Add cauliflower and boil until fork-tender, about 20 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium. Stir in heavy cream and the cooked sausage; heat through. Mix spinach into the soup just before serving.
