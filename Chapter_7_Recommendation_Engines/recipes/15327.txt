Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf white bread
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup raisins
1 cup pineapple chunks, drained
4 ounces Colby longhorn cheese
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
10 cinnamon sticks
2 cups white sugar
2 cups water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine water, cinnamon, and sugar in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and let simmer for about 15 minutes. Set aside.
Toast bread and butter each slice on one side. Arrange toast in a single layer in a large casserole dish. Sprinkle bread with raisins, nuts, and pineapple. Slice cheese and place over this mixture. Repeat layers until all bread is used, making sure enough cheese is left over for the top. Pour the cinnamon syrup mixture over everything in baking dish.
Bake for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cool for at least 15 minutes.

This dish was served by my mother every Christmas. It was a big hit! This bead pudding is lovely with the texture of walnuts and the taste of cinnamon. This may be served warm or cold.
