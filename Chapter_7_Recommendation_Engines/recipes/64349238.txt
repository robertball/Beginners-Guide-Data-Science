Ingredients:
8-10 roma tomatoes, chopped very small
1/2 red onion, peeled and chopped fine
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 small can of chopped green chilies, or fresh if you'd like
juice and zest of 1/2 lime
1/2-1 cup of chopped cilantro (optional if you don't like)
1 tsp. each of onion and garlic powder
1/2 tsp. cumin
1/8-1/2 tsp. kosher salt or salt of choice or leave out
If you want spicy, add some red pepper flakes to taste.

Directions:
Mix all together and let sit for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to come together good. I usually make mine the night before and then its great the next day.
