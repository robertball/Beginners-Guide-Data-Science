Ingredients:
2 smoked ham hocks
2 yellow onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
3 quarts water
1 pound sauerkraut, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, drained
1/2 pound bacon, chopped
1 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sautee onion and garlic until tender; set aside. Put ham hocks, onion, garlic and water into a stockpot, season with pepper to taste, cover and bring to a simmer for 1 1/2 hours.
Stir the sauerkraut and beans into the soup. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Remove bacon into the stockpot, reserving drippings. Stir flour into the bacon drippings to make a roux. Stir the roux into the soup. Continue to simmer the soup until thick. Remove from the heat and stir in the sour cream. Serve.
