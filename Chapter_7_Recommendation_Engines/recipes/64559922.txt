Ingredients:
4 chicken thighs, skin removed*
3 tbsp Dijon mustard
1 tbsp light mayonnaise
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 lime, squeezed, and lime zest
3/4 tsp pepper
kosher salt to taste
dried parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Rinse the chicken and remove the skin and all fat.
Pat dry; place in a large bowl and season with salt.
In a small bowl combine Dijon, mayonnaise, lime juice, lime zest, garlic and pepper. Mix well. Pour over chicken, tossing well to coat.
Spray a large baking pan with a little Pam to prevent sticking since all the fat and skin was removed from chicken. Place chicken to fit in a single layer. Top the chicken with dried parsley. Bake until cooked through, about 40 minutes. Finish the chicken under the broiler until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
