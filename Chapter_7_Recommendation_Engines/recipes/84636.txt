Ingredients:
1 cup 2% milk
2 teaspoons white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Pour the milk into a microwave-safe mug. Stir together the cinnamon and sugar, then stir into the milk. Mixing the cinnamon into the sugar first will help to keep it from floating on top. Stir in the vanilla. Place mug in the microwave and heat for 1 minute and 40 seconds, or longer for a warmer drink. Stir before drinking.
