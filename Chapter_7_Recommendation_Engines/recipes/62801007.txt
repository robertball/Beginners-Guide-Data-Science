Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 eggs, beaten
2 1/3 cups mashed overripe bananas
1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips
1/2 cup of white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lightly grease muffin tin or use cupcake liners. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Add chocolate chips and mix.  Pour batter into prepared muffin tin.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 18 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean. Let muffins cool on a wire rack.
