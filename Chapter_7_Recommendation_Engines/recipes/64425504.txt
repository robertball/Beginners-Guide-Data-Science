4 pieces 1/4" thick Applewood smoked Bacon

4 corn tortillas
1 tsp butter
Optional: pico de gallo salsa, sour cream

Combine eggs, salt, pepper, and onion powder, whisk in small bowl, adding a splash of cold water (fluffy eggs) or milk (dense, creamy eggs) as you whisk
Cook bacon until evenly brown (approx 2.5 minutes per side)
Place bacon on paper towels to absorb grease
In a clean skillet/pan, preheated to medium-high heat, melt butter and add egg mixture. Scramble eggs
Crumble bacon or break into small pieces
Place eggs on plate, sprinkle with cheese, stir, and top with bacon
On low heat, warm tortillas
