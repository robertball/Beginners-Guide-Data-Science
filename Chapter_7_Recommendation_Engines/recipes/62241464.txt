Ingredients:
2 Cups of milk
9 Tablespoons of melted butter
4 Cups of self-rising flour

Directions:
Preheat oven at 400 degrees.
Melt the butter in a small bowl in the microwave.
In a large mixing bowl place the milk and 6 tablespoons of the melted butter.  Stir in the four cups of flour, a cup at a time.
Sprinkle another cup of flour on your counter surface and place biscuit dough on it.  Knead enough of the flour into it until it is soft, but no longer sticky.  With hands (not a rolling pin) flatten the dough out until it is about 3/4 inch thick.  Cut with a 4 inch biscuit cutter (Mom uses that old Tupperware hamburger press).
Place on a baking/cookie sheet beside one another.  Take remaining three tablespoons of butter and spread over the top of the biscuits.  Allow them to sit for two to three minutes before baking.
Bake at 400 degrees for approximately 15 minutes.  Should be lightly browned on top.
