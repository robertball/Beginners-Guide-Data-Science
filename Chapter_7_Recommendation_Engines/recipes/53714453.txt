Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts, ends trimmed and sliced in half
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 T Spicy Red Sauce*

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (205 degrees C).
Place trimmed and sliced Brussels sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal tightly, and shake to coat. Pour onto a baking sheet in a single layer, and place on center oven rack.
Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, checking pan after 30 minutes to check for even browning. Reduce heat when necessary to prevent burning. Brussels sprouts should be darkest brown, almost black, when done. Add Red Hot Sauce. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Who knew such a nutritious powerhouse could taste good?!

Made a few changes to the original recipe:  (1) I cut the raw sprouts in half to increase the amount of surface area for carmelization while decreasing the amount of interior mush, (2) increased the oven temperature while decreased the cooking time to prevent overcooking interiors while still getting that crisp outer shell and (3) after cooking, I seasoned with some of my Red Hot Sauce.Modified from: Roasted Brussels Sprouts
