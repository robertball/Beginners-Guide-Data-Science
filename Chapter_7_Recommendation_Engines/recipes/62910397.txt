Ingredients:
1 cucumber
1/2 cup red onion
8 medium potatoes (any color; red looks best!)
6 slices bacon
3 eggs + 1 hard-boiled egg for garnish
1 cup celery
1/2 cup fresh parsley + surplus parsley sprigs for garnish
1 cup mayonnaise
1 Tablespoon paprika + dash of paprika for garnish
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Add eggs and potatoes to boiling water for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, fry bacon on medium heat until cooked through, then drain.
As the potatoes continue to cook: chop celery, cucumber, parsley and onion.
Once the potatoes are cooked and cooled, mash or chop to preference.
Combine ALL ingredients (saving the 1 sliced egg aside) including mayo and spices into a large serving bowl and mix WELL to distribute salt.
Garnish with remaining sliced egg, a few sprigs of parsley, and a dash of paprika. Enjoy!
