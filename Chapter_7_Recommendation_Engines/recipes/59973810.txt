Ingredients:
28 ripe tomatoes
1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 cup butter
3 onion, chopped
3 green bell pepper, chopped
5 carrots, chopped
12 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 cup Burgundy wine
3 bay leaf
6 stalks celery
1/3 cup tomato paste

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil.  Have ready a large bowl of iced water.  Plunge whole tomatoes in boiling water until skin starts to peel, 1 minute.  Remove with slotted spoon and place in ice bath.  Let rest until cool enough to handle, then remove peel and squeeze out seeds.  Chop 20 tomatoes and puree in blender or food processor.  Chop remaining 8 tomatoes and set aside.
In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, cook onion, bell pepper, carrot and garlic in oil and butter until onion starts to soften, 5 minutes.  Pour in pureed tomatoes.  Stir in chopped tomato, basil, Italian seasoning and wine.  Place bay leaf and whole celery stalks in pot.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 2 hours.  Stir in tomato paste and simmer an additional 2 hours.  Discard bay leaf and celery and serve.
