Description: 
This is a traditional fried rice noodle in Taiwanese way and Hong Kong style. I make a little change for vegetarians. Most of the fried noodles are oily and high in calories, but this one is good for health or diet and it is easy. The cabbage and the mushroom makes the noodle taste really perfect, and you can add Chinese salt mustard if you want to make it little bit salty.
