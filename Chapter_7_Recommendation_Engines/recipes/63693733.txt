Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup diced onion
1/4 cup diced green bell pepper
1/4 cup diced red bell pepper
1/2 cup shredded broccoli slaw
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 (12 ounce) jar HERDEZ® Red Guajillo Chile Mexican Cooking Sauce, or to taste
1 1/2 cups low sodium chicken broth
1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes and chilies, undrained
1 cup salsa
6 (6 inch) corn tortillas, cut into strips
Additional toppings if desired: diced avocado, shredded cheddar cheese, salsa, pico de gallo, diced tomato, sour cream, cilantro, hot sauce

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until onions begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken and continue cooking and stirring, about 5 more minutes.
Place a large soup pot on the stove and add chicken and onion mixture, chile cooking sauce, water, corn, black beans, diced tomatoes, chicken bouillon, and V-8 juice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Ten minutes before soup is ready, lay tortilla strips on a baking sheet and bake in pre-heated oven for 10 minutes, or until nice and crispy.
Ladle soup into bowls, add additional toppings if desired, and add a few tortilla strips.
