Ingredients:
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup sifted cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 sticks butter
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (11.5 ounce) jar dulce de leche
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, or as needed for dusting

Directions:
Mix flour, confectioners' sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a bowl. Place butter in a separate bowl and use an electric mixer to beat until soft and fluffy. Add white sugar and vanilla and mix well.
Add flour mixture to the bowl with the butter mixture in 3 stages; mix until just blended. Divide dough in half and roll each half into a log. Refrigerate dough logs until firm, about 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Slice dough logs into 1/4-inch cookies and place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until just starting to turn golden around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes.
Allow cookies to cool on the pan for 1 minute. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely, about 30 minutes more.
Use a knife to apply a generous amount of dulce de leche on one cookie. Sandwich another cookie on top and place on a serving tray. Repeat with remaining cookies and dulce de leche. Lightly dust finished cookies with confectioners' sugar.
