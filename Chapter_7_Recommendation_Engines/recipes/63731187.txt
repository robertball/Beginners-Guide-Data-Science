Ingredients:
8 cups peeled, seeded, diced zucchini
3/4 cup fresh lemon juice approx. 4-5 lemons
3/4 cup sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
2 cups flour
2 cups rolled oats

1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven 350 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 baking dish.
Peel. Seed. Chop. Cube squash into large chunks. It already pretty much looks like APPLES!
Cook zucchini with lemon juice in a covered saucepan over medium heat for 15 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in 3/4 cup sugar & 1 tsp cinnamon & nutmeg. Simmer for a min. Remove from heat, set aside.
Combine flour, oats, molasses, 1 tsp cinnamon & 1 1/2 cups sugar. Cut in butter & olive oil into coarse crumbs(or applesauce). Add (optional) vanilla & almonds.
Stir 1/2 cup of crumb topping into cooked zucchini mix.
Pour into dish. Top with remaining topping.
Bake 35-40 minutes until light golden brown & bubbly.
Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. Great the next day.

Description: 
Everyone will be fooled by this great zucchini squash recipe! It looks and tastes just like apple cobbler! I serve it warm with vanilla ice cream or the next day room temp with whipped cream. Use one of those giant 'I've been hiding' zucchini you find in the deep vestiges of the garden! A real family favorite! Even people who think they hate zucchini will love this recipe!
