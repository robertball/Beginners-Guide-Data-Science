Ingredients:
9 cups water
2 cups granulated sugar
4 green tea bags
12 oz frozen lemonade concentrate
12 oz frozen orange juice concentrate
12 oz vodka
12 oz gin
lemon-lime soda (such as 7-up)
maraschino cherries (optional)

Directions:
Add water, green tea bags, and sugar to large pot.
On stove top, bring water to a boil.
When water reaches a boil, dunk green tea bags several times, remove from pot, and discard.
Add frozen lemonade and frozen orange juice to pot.
Remove from heat.
Stir mixture to dissolve frozen juices.
As mixture is cooling, add vodka and gin.  Do not add alcohol to mixture when it is boiling as the alcohol may steam off.
Add mixture to freezer safe container.
Put mixture in freezer until frozen.  Mixture will not be solid, as the alcohol will prevent it from freezing completely.
Stir mixture to evenly distribute alcohol.
Fill glass approximately ½ - ¾ full with slush to taste.  Fill remaining glass with lemon-lime soda.
Garnish with 1-2 maraschino cherries (optional)
Makes approximately 32 four oz. servings.  Adjust serving suggestions accordingly for larger glasses.
Enjoy!
