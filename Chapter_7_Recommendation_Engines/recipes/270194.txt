Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds chicken wings
1 tablespoon olive oil
2/3 cup cayenne pepper sauce
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons vinegar
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).
Place wings in a large bowl. Drizzle oil over wings and massage until chicken is evenly coated.
Place 1/2 the wings in the air fryer basket and cook for 25 minutes. Use tongs to flip wings and cook 5 minutes more. Transfer cooked wings to a large bowl. Repeat with remaining wings.
While second batch is cooking, combine hot pepper sauce, butter, vinegar, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir and keep warm until wings are done.
Pour sauce over cooked wings and toss to coat.

Description: 
Push the deep fryer aside and pull out the air fryer instead next game day. There is no need to add all of that oil when you can achieve crispy wings straight out of the air fryer. Serve with celery sticks and ranch dressing, if desired.
