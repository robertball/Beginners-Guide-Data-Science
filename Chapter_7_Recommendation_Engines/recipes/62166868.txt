Ingredients:
1 lb. chicken breasts
1 c. blue cheese crumbles
1 bottle Frank's Redhot Wings Sauce - Buffalo flavor

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Pound each chicken breast to 1/4 inch thick
Sprinkle each chicken breast with equal amounts of blue cheese crumbles
Beginning with one of the short sides, roll up each breast so that the blue cheese is stuffed inside the chicken like a pouch.
Secure chicken rolls with a toothpick and place seam-side down in a shallow baking dish
Smother chicken breasts with 1/2 - 3/4 of the bottle of Buffalo Sauce, making sure to coat the meat thoroughly
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes or until chicken juices run clear
