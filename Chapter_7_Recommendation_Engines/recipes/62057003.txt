Ingredients:
2 Tbsp. cornstarch
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/8 tsp. salt
2 cups pineapple juice (I use 2 drinking boxes)
1/4 tsp. cloves
1 Tbsp. butter
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
In medium saucepan, combine cornstarch and brown sugar.  Add vinegar, salt and pineapple juice, stir to combine.  On medium-high heat, whisk constantly until mixture comes to a boil.  Boil and stir for 1 minute.  Remove from heat; add cloves and butter, then raisins.  Serve immediately, or refrigerate overnight.

Description: 
Serve this with warm or cold ham slices.  I tweaked several recipes to come up with this one.  Make it a day ahead so the raisins can plump.  Our family likes a subtle clove flavor, but add more cloves if you like it spicier.
