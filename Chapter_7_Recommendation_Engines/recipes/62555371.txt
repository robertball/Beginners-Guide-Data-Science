Ingredients:
3/4 tsp. vanilla
4 c. milk
8 egg yolks
1 vanilla bean
1/2 c. + 3 T. sugar
Pinch salt
1 qt. half & half
3/4 c. firmly packed brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F, placing rack on lowest position.
In large bowl whisk egg yolks gently. Whisk in sugar until almost dissolved; do not beat.
Heat half & half in a large saucepan over low heat until just warm with vanilla bean. Remove bean; rinse and save for other uses.
Gradually pour into egg yolks, gently whisking. Add salt.
Strain mixture through fine mesh sieve into 8 porcelain baking dishes. Let liquid settle a minute. Skim off any foam on top with large flat spoon.
Place dishes in large baking pan. Place on lowest rack. Add enough very hot water to come half way up the baking dishes.
Bake 30 minutes or until just barely quivering. Remove from water to cool on wire rack to room temperature.
Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours or until cold.
About 1 hour before serving, spread brown sugar out on a tray in a thin layer so it can dry. (If it is too moist, it will liquefy into the custard.)
About 5 minutes before serving, remove custard from refrigerator. Sift brown sugar in thin, even layer over custard. Place custard briefly under preheated broiler just until sugar has hardened and browned somewhat, usually less than 1 minute. Watch carefully since sugar will burn easily. Remove from broiler and let stand 1 minute before serving. This is the classic way to create the caramel topping. Using a torch might be fun, but you can ruin the dessert very easily.

Description: 
I got this recipe from Cuisine Magazine(their title as well)a very long time ago. When I first prepared it I was amazed at the delicate consistency and flavor. I looked on this web site for something similar. But all the other recipes call for heavy cream(which I normally love.) I however wanted a true brulee, in the French fashion. not a creamy rich pudding or a too-light flan, So here it is. See if you don't agree.
