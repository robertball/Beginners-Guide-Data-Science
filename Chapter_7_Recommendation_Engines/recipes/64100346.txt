Ingredients:
For smoking
1 medium red onion
1 medium yellow onion
12 +\- cloves garlic
Bell pepper/sweet bell amount equal to onions
handful of cherry tomatoes
drizzle of oil
handful of celery leaves
Sprigs of fresh oregano, marjoram, lemon thyme, lime thyme and orange thyme
6 large ripe peaches skinned and diced
3\4 c. apple cider vinegar
1 c brown sugar
2 t. prepared mustard
salt & pepper to taste
Hot peppers of choice to add heat if desired

Directions:
Cut onions and separate the rings.  Peel garlic, slice in half and add to onions. Slice the peppers and add to onions and garlic.  Toss in the handful of cherry tomatoes.  Drizzle oil and toss to coat.  Place in appropriate style pan to smoke.  Toss fresh herbs on top of mix then smoke at 225 degrees for 3-4 hours until onions caramelize.
Once smoking is done pull and trash the herbs except for the thyme.  Put everything else into a sauce pan over medium heat.  Add in diced peaches and simmer until peaches soften.
Using an immersion blender or food processor, blend until no chunks remain. You can add the vinegar at this point if needed to help smooth out the sauce.  Return to stove top and add in remaining ingredients.  Simmer on low until your desired consistency.
