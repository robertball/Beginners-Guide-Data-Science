Ingredients:
1 mango - peeled, seeded, and diced
4 tomatoes, chopped
2 Persian cucumbers, finely chopped
1 (15.5 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), rinsed and drained
1 lime, juiced
1 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon minced pickled jalapeno pepper
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons chopped fresh lemon basil
kosher salt to taste
2 pounds cod fillets
2 teaspoons paprika, or to taste
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1/4 cup canola oil, or as needed
4 flour tortillas

Directions:
Stir the mango, tomato, cucumber, garbanzo beans, lime juice, lemon juice, jalapeno pepper, red pepper flakes, and lemon basil in a bowl; season with kosher salt. Set aside.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Season the cod with the paprika, salt, and pepper; brush with the canola oil.
Cook the cod on the preheated grill until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes per side. Quickly warm the tortillas on the grill just before the cod is finished. Serve the cod in the warm tortillas topped with the mango salsa.

Description: 
This recipe is one I created this evening after going to the local market. Wild cod was on sale and my husband was craving it. I thought the delicate flavor of cod would work perfectly with a tangy salsa. This recipe was super easy to make and perfect for a hot summer night!
