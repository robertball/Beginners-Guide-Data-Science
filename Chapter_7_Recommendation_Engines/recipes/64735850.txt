Ingredients:
__Dough 1.__
40 dkg (14 oz) Flour
2 dkg (2.5 Tbsp) Coconut Oil
2 Egg Yolks
2 Envelopes Rapid rise Yeast
2 Tbs Sugar
1/4 tsp salt
warm water to make a soft dough
__Dough 2.__
5 dkg (2 oz or 6.4 Tbsp) flour
13 dkg (4.5 oz) Coconut Oil
__Chocolate filling__
15 dkg (5.3 oz) Baking Cocoa Powder
10-15 dkg (3.5 oz - 5.3 oz) sugar
2 Tbs Vanilla
1 Tbsp coconut oil
3 tbsp Corn Starch
warm water to make it a thick, but spreadable chocolate cream, like icing (video shows no water, no coconut oil, but that turns out too dry)

Directions:
1.
Dough 1.
-    Knead ingredients  together in a large bowl, for 3-5 minutes, until a soft dough forms.
-    Cover bowl, and let it rise to double, appr. 40-60 minutes.
-    In wintertime, warm oven (80-100F) helps a lot
2.
While waiting
- prepare Dough 2.: mix ingredient together, until smooth
- Chocolate spread: mix ingredients together, until smooth
3.
- when Dough 1. doubled, roll it out to 3/4 inch rectangular shape
- spread Dough 2. in the middle, and completely cover it with Dough 1.
- Fold it in 3, roll it out, *Repeat Two Times*
Help: Layered dough: around 1:14 it shows how to fold Dough 1. and Dough 2. together, to get the layered dough.

4.
Roll it to 1/2 in thick rectangular shape, and spread the chocolate cream to completely cover the dough.
- Roll it up again, and slice it into 1 inch thick rolls.
- Put the rolls on the double layer (insulated) cookie sheets, 2 inch apart from each other.
If too soft, refrigerate for 1/2 hour before slicing.
4.1
- I don't like to wait, so instead of rolling it up and slice it, I cut it into ribbons with a pizza cutter; as I cut it, the roll forms on the side of the pizza cutter.
5. Let the rolls rise for 15 minutes.
6.  Heat the oven to 375 F and bake them for 14-17 minutes.

This is the most beloved, classic breakfast pastry, in Hungary.
Comes out exactly like the ones they sell in the bakeries.
It is really easy, but plan 2 hours because it has to raise. Completely dairy free!
