Ingredients:
2 cups dried cannellini beans, soaked overnight in cold water
2 large onions, peeled
6 celery stalks
1 lb tomatoes
1/2 cup olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
6 cups vegetable stock
1 tsp thyme or sage
salt & pepper
freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Drain beans and put them in a saucepan. Cover with fresh water, bring to a boil, and boil rapidly for 10 minutes. Lower heat and cover and simmer until beans are tender, about 50 minutes. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid. Put half the beans in the blender. Add 1 1/2 cups of the reserved liquid and puree until smooth. Roughly chop onions, celery and garlic and cook over medium heat until beginning to brown, 5-10 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, stock, whole beans, bean puree, and spice. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until all ingredients are tender, about 40 minutes. Serve hot, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.
