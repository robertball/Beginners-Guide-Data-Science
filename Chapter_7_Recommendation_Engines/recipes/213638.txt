Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa
1 tablespoon butter
2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup diced green bell pepper
1/2 cup diced red onion
1 cup corn
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1 large tomato, diced
1/2 cup fresh lime juice, or to taste
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon adobo seasoning
1/2 cup feta cheese
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Rinse the quinoa thoroughly under cold water, and drain. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the quinoa until the water has evaporated and the quinoa is lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the quinoa has absorbed all the broth, about 10 minutes. Cool quinoa in refrigerator at least 10 minutes.
Mix together green pepper, red onion, corn, black beans, cilantro, tomato, lime juice, red wine vinegar, olive oil, adobo seasoning, and feta cheese in a large salad bowl. Lightly stir in the quinoa, and season with salt, pepper, and additional lime juice to taste, if desired. Chill the salad at least 30 minutes before serving; serve cold.
