Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons shortening
1 egg
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour, sugar, yeast and salt. In a saucepan, heat the milk, water and shortening to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until moistened. Add egg; beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Do not let rise.
Divide into 12 pieces. Shape each into a bun. Combine paprika and garlic powder. Dip each bun in melted butter, then in paprika mixture. Place 6 buns in a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans; sprinkle with half of the sesame seeds. Top with remaining buns and sesame seeds. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool.
