Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 large onions
4 garlic cloves
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 1/4 quarts beef stock

Directions:
In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan or flameproof casserole, heat the butter and oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook for 10 to 12 minutes until they are soft and beginning to brown.
Putting one garlic clove aside, finely chop the rest and add to the onions.  Add the sugar and thyme and continue cooking over medium heat for 30 to 35 minutes until the onions for brown, stirring frequently.
Sprinkle the flour over and stir until well blended.  Stir in the wine and stock and bring to a boil.  Skim off any foam from the surface.  Lower the heat and simmer for 45 minutes.
Heat the broiler.  Rub each slice of toasted French bread with the remaining garlic clove.  Place 6 or 8 flameproof soup bowls on a cookie sheet and fill them about three-quarters full with the onion soup.
Float a piece of toast in each bowl.  Top with grated cheese, dividing it evenly.  Broil about 6 inches from the heat for 3 to 4 minutes until the cheese begins to melt and bubble.  Serve piping hot.
