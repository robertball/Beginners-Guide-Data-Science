Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon seasoned salt (such as LAWRY'SÂ®)
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
4 thin-cut, boneless pork loin chops
1/2 cup canola oil

Directions:
Mix flour, seasoned salt, and pepper thoroughly in a wide bowl.
Dredge each side of the pork chops in the flour mixture. Set aside on a plate.
Pour oil into a frying pan over medium-high heat. Drop a pinch of flour in the oil; it will sizzle if the oil is ready. Add 2 pork chops and cook until golden brown on the outside and no longer pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining chops.

This is my favorite recipe for chops on a long day after work! They are quick, simple, and easy to make, and turn out like you slaved for hours. Pair with Yukon gold mash and some long green beans and have a perfect delicious dinner.
