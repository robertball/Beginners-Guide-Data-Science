Ingredients:
1/3 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard (such as ClovisÂ®)
1 tablespoon mustard seeds
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
5 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Mix olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, mustard seeds, honey, black pepper, and allspice together in a bowl.
Cut small slits in a crosswise-pattern in each chicken breast to help the mustard marinade soak into the chicken. Add chicken to the mustard marinade; toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 hours.
Remove chicken from marinade and sprinkle with salt. Discard the leftover marinade.
Lightly oil a grill pan and place over medium-high heat.
Cook chicken in the grill pan until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 7 minutes per side.

Description: 
I wanted a new chicken recipe today, and my mum loves mustard chicken, so I came up with this recipe and it turned out great! Next time I'm going to double the quantity and coat the chicken with 1/2 the marinade. The 2nd half I will heat and serve as a side sauce to the chicken.
