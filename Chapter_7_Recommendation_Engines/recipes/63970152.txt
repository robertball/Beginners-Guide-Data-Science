Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons corn syrup
1 loaf Texas Toast bread -- extra thick slices, or French bread
5 eggs
1 1/2 cups half and half
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
1.	In a small saucepan melt butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup over medium heat until smooth, stirring occasionally.  Pour mixture onto large, greased jelly roll pan (18x13x1-inch).  Spread to cover surface.
2.	Place 12 slices of bread in a single layer to cover pan.  Mix together eggs, cream, salt and vanilla.  Spoon mixture over each piece of bread.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.
3.	Bake uncovered at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.  Remove from pan and serve.  If not serving immediately, turn each slice of bread over (this will prevent bread from sticking to the bottom of the pan).
