Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 1/4 cups chicken broth
1 cup pumpkin puree
1/3 cup low-fat milk
2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
2 teaspoons white sugar
2 teaspoons dried sage
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon salt
1 (8 ounce) package rotini pasta

Directions:
Spray a deep skillet with cooking spray. Add onions and cook over medium heat until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ground turkey and cook until no longer pink, about 8 to 10 minutes.
Pour chicken broth into the skillet and bring to a boil. Add pumpkin puree, milk, chipotle peppers, sugar, sage, black pepper, cinnamon, coriander, pumpkin pie spice, and nutmeg. Reduce to a simmer; cook until pasta ready.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add 1 tablespoon salt and rotini. Cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
Stir cooked pasta into the skillet with the turkey-pumpkin sauce until evenly coated.
