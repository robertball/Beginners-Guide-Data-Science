Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
4 cups raspberries
1 cup white sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons tapioca
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons butter
1 tablespoon half-and-half cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Mix together the raspberries, sugar, tapioca, lemon juice, cinnamon, and salt until raspberries are well-covered.
Pour into 9 or 10-inch pastry shell. Dot with butter; add top crust and crimp edge.
Make slits in the top crust and brush with cream.  Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes to set the crust. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbly, about 25 minutes more. Allow pie to cool completely before serving.
