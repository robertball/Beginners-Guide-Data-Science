Ingredients:
1 pound spaghetti
1 pound bacon, chopped
4 eggs, well beaten
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, reserving some of the drippings, crumble and set aside.
Scramble eggs in bacon drippings.
Place spaghetti in a  large bowl.  Pour in olive oil, and mix well; use enough to just moisten spaghetti.  Stir in bacon, eggs, and Parmesan cheese.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a favorite supper dish that's quick and easy to make.  I double it for our family of 4 growing boys.  We serve it all up and then add on the goodies that are left in the bottom of the bowl - there's always bacon and eggs left down there.
