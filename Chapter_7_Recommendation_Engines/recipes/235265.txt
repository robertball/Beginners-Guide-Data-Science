Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1 clove garlic, minced
3/4 cup thinly sliced carrots
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/3 cup diced red bell pepper
2 cups turkey stock
1 cup diced cooked turkey
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 teaspoons lemon zest
2 cups fresh baby spinach leaves
1 pinch sea salt
fresh ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add carrots, celery, and red bell pepper; cook and stir until carrots begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes.
Pour turkey stock into vegetable mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors blend, about 20 minutes.
Stir cooked turkey, lemon juice, and lemon zest into turkey stock mixture; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Add spinach leaves, salt, and black pepper; simmer until spinach wilts and turns bright green, 1 to 2 minutes.
