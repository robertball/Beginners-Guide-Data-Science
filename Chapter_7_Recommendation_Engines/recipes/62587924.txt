Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves boiled in
garlic to taste.  Shredded with grater.
18 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn in half
1 (28 ounce) can green chile enchilada sauce
1 (16 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
Taco Seasoning, to taste
Cilantro, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken in boiling water with garlic cloves.  When no longer pink, remove from water.  Cool and  shred.  Mix the sour cream taco seasoning and cilantro together, then add in chicken last.
Pour about 1/2 inch enchilada sauce in the bottom of a 9 x 11 baking dish, and arrange 6 tortillas in a single layer. Top with 1/2 the chicken mixture, 1/3 cheese, and 1/3 of the remaining enchilada sauce. Repeat. Coat remaining tortillas thoroughly with remaining enchilada sauce, and arrange on top of the layers. Sprinkle with remaining cheese, and top with any remaining enchilada sauce.  Cover and bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool slightly before serving.
