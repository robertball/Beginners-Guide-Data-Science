Ingredients:
1/2 pound of Alaskan King Crab (shelled)
2 Tbsp. real Mayonnaise
1 Tbsp. minced scallion (green only)
1 Tsp. minced Red Pepper
1/2 Tsp. Dijon Mustard
1/2 Tsp. Old Bay seasoning
3 Tbsp. breadcrumbs (Grissol)
Panko Bread Crumbs for coating
Peanut oil for frying

Directions:
Mix Mayonnaise and seasonings in a bowl.
Add bread crumbs (not the Panko) mixing well
Break up crab and fold into the mixture until well blended...be careful not to overmix.  Crab chunks should be about 1/4 to 1/2 inch in size.
Grease 6 muffin cups in a standard-size muffin tin
Divide mixture into the 6 tins
Refrigerate for an hour
Turn out the crab cakes onto wax paper by tapping on the muffin tins until they fall out
Carefully move cakes to panko bread crumbs and press crumbs onto all sides
Heat oil over medium-low heat.
Fry 3 cakes at a time for 1 1/2 - 2 minutes a side until lightly browned.

Description: 
Lump crab cakes are delicious, but you don't have to worry about juicy chunks of crab when you use Alaskan King Crab.  The presentation (zucchini alfredo from the AR website) and the roasted garlic aioli (I've posted the recipe) were inspired by a visit to a restaurant in New Orleans.  Check with your local Costco for when they bring their seafood in.
