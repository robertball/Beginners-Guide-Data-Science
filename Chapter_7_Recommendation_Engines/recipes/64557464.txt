Ingredients:
1 lb potatoes, diced
3 Tbsp water
1/2 onion, chopped
3/4 lb kielbasa sausage, sliced into 1/4" pieces
1 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 Tbsp beef broth
2 Tbsp brown sugar
1 Tbsp Dijon mustard
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1/4 tsp pepper
4 eggs, scrambled
3 cups fresh baby spinach
1 Roma tomato, quartered and sliced

Directions:
Place potatoes and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover and cook on high for 3-4 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Drain and set aside.
Heat olive oil in a skillet on medium-high heat, until lightly smoking. Add onion and kielbasa, and cook until the onion is tender, about 3-5 minutes.
Add the potatoes. Saute 3-5 minutes, until the kielbasa and potatoes are lightly browned.
Whisk together the apple cider vinegar, beef broth, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, thyme, and pepper. Add to the skillet and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 3-5 minutes.
Add eggs, and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, or until eggs are fully cooked, stirring frequently.
Add spinach and tomato, stirring frequently. Cook until spinach is wilted, then remove from heat and serve.

A slight variation on another recipe I found online (see below). It makes four very hearty servings, and has almost everything you need for a balanced breakfast. Works well as a relaxed weekend breakfast.
