Ingredients:
2 (1 1/2) pounds loaves of white bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 cup butter
1 1/2 onion, minced
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 stalks celery, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
4 pints shucked oysters

Directions:
Spread the bread cubes out onto baking sheets or a work surface, and allow to dry for 24 to 48 hours (longer for a drier dressing).
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion, garlic, and celery until the onions become translucent, about 8 minutes. Pour the vegetables and butter into a large bowl. Lightly mix in the bread cubes, and stir in the oysters and their liquid until thoroughly combined.

This is a family recipe to stuff your turkey with. My dad used to ask me to make a Thanksgiving dinner in June so he could have the dressing!! If you like oysters this will be your new tradition! Mix everything in a large bowl, and stuff that bird!
