Description: 
This is a kid friendly recipe sure to please! Do you know any child who doesn’t love hot chocolate? I imagine very few have gotten  to make their own hot chocolate mix. This is a recipe from Christy Jordan's first grade teacher, Mrs. Menotti. She made it with her class when she was six years old and then everyone got to bring a sampling of mix and the recipe home. She was so thrilled when her mama then went out and got the ingredients for us to make, too!
