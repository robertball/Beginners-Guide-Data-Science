Ingredients:
2 pounds beef, top or bottom round or chuck roast
4 ounces butter
1 large onion
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 cup white wine
4 tablespoons corn starch
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef broth (I added additional liquid)
1-2 TBSP worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon prepared mustard
1 (6 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained (optional)
1/2 cup sour cream
salt to taste
lots of fresh ground pepper to taste

Directions:
Remove any fat and gristle from the roast and cut into strips 1/3 inch thick by 2 inches long. Season with salt, pepper and paprika.
In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and brown the beef strips quickly, then push the beef strips off to one side. Add the onions and cook slowly for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with the beef strips.
Pour in beef broth, worcestershire sauce and mustard and bring to a boil. Lower the heat,cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.
Five minutes before serving, add corn starch dissolved in 1/2 cup water. Stir in the mushrooms,  and white wine. Heat to boiling.  Finally, add some of the sauce to the sour cream to temper it.  When it is warm and thin enough add to the pan or crock pot.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
