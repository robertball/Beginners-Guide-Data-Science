Description: 
I got this delicious recipe from a family friend when looking for something to do with all my extra cubanelle peppers in my garden. I Love the versatility in this recipe because I have a vegetarian, I omit the sausage in the mixture when making a batch for her, and everyone can enjoy this flavorful dish.
