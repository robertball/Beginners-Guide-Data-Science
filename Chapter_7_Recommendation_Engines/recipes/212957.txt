Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground pork
1 (12 ounce) container fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAMÂ®), sliced thin
2 (4 ounce) links chorizo de bilbao (spicy Spanish semi-cured sausage), sliced thin
2 tablespoons chopped sweet pickle
1 (1.5 ounce) box raisins
3 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix together the ground pork, luncheon meat, chorizo de bilbao, pickle, raisin, eggs, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Form the mixture into 2 logs and wrap with aluminum foil. Place the wrapped logs in a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
Set the meatloaves aside to rest. Carefully drain the drippings from the baking dish into a small saucepan placed over medium heat. Stir the soy sauce and corn flour into the drippings; bring to a boil. Cook the mixture at a boil, stirring continually, until the sauce is thick, 5 to 7 minutes. Unwrap the meatloaves and slice; serve the sauce over sliced meatloaf.
