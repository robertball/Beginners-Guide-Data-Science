Ingredients:
1 (17.5 ounce) pouch dry sugar cookie mix (such as Betty CrockerÂ®)
1 stick butter, softened
1 egg
1 (14 ounce) can fat-free sweetened condensed milk
2 lemons, zested and juiced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan.
Pour cookie mix into a bowl and add butter. Mix together using a fork until crumbly. Add egg and mix until well blended. Press 1/2 of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan; reserve remaining mixture for the topping.
Bake crust in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine condensed milk, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a bowl and mix well; filling may thicken as it sits.
Remove crust from the oven; it will be puffy. Leave oven on. Let crust cool for 10 minutes.
Spread lemon filling over the crust in the pan. Top with reserved mixture by crumbling it over the filling.
Return pan to the hot oven and bake until lightly browned, about 30 minutes more.
Allow to cool completely, about 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours before cutting into bars and serving.
