Frozen Pudding Pops Recipe

Ingredients:
1 3 oz box instant pudding, any flavor
3 cups cold milk

Directions:
Mix pudding and milk.  (Does not need to set up, but won't hurt if it does thicken a bit.)
Pour in Tupperware popsicle cups and snap on lid.  Or fill a small dixie cup.  Place a piece of wide masking tape over top of cup and poke a popsicle stick thru the tape.
Place on a tray in freezer for 6-8 hours or until frozen.
Just for fun, I sometimes make 2 or more flavors and layer them in the cups.

Description: 
Tastes just like Jell-o pudding pops that you buy in the grocery store, but cost a lot less to make! I use the old Tupperware popsicle set to make these, but you can improvise with any small foam cup and a popsicle stick.
