Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups chopped rhubarb
ground cinnamon

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Stir in the milk and cream; set aside. Combine the sugar and flour in a separate bowl. Pour the sugar mixture into the egg mixture, then stir until well combined. Fold in the rhubarb. Pour into a casserole dish, and sprinkle with cinnamon.
Bake in a preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 to 60 minutes.

Description:
