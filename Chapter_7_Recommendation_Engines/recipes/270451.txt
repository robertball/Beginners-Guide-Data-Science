Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef, or more to taste
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 green bell pepper, finely chopped (optional)
1 egg, beaten
2 sleeves buttery crackers (such as Keebler ClubÂ® Crackers), crushed
12 slices Cheddar cheese
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup
2/3 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix beef, mayonnaise, and green pepper together in a large bowl. Form into 12 palm-sized balls and dip into beaten egg to coat. Roll in crushed crackers and flatten into a patty.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Fry patties in batches until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Place patties into two 9x13-inch baking pans.
Cover each patty with a slice of cheese. Mix each can of soup with 1/3 cup milk and pour over the patties.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and soup starts to bubble, 20 to 25 minutes.
