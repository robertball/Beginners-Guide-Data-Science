Ingredients:
3/4 cup dry garbanzo beans
3 cups water
1 tablespoon olive oil, divided, or as needed
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 pinch sea salt
4 medium sweet potatoes, scrubbed and halved lengthwise
1/4 cup hummus
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
1/4 cup diced grape tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste

Directions:
Soak garbanzo beans in water for 8 hours, or overnight.
Rinse and drain beans. Place in a pot and cover with 3 cups water. Boil until tender, about 45 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water for 2 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Remove and discard garbanzo bean skins. Place beans in a bowl and add 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, smoked paprika, and sea salt. Stir gently until beans are covered and transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
Rub sweet potatoes with remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. Place potatoes face-down on the baking sheet with the beans.
Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Stir garbanzo beans gently with a wooden spoon and continue cooking about 15 minutes more.
Remove from the oven. Flip sweet potatoes over so they are flesh-side up; smash down insides of sweet potatoes with a spoon and place on a serving plate.
Mix hummus, garlic, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and dill together in a bowl.
Fill centers of sweet potatoes evenly with hummus mixture. Top with roasted garbanzo beans, tomatoes, and parsley. Drizzle each with lemon juice.
