Description: 
I've been making this recipe for a long time and I usually don't make it the same way twice.  I like to use cabbage, shredded carrots, broccoli, cauliflower and green onions, but use any combination of vegetables you like. Add as much garlic oil as you need to prevent the noodles from sticking together.Modified from: Linguine with Chicken and Sauteed Vegetables
