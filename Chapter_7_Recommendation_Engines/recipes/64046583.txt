Ingredients:
2 cups cooked rice
2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cooked
1 can cream of chicken soup (I used their Healthy Request brand)
4 oz sour cream (I used light)
8 oz. cream cheese, softened (also used light) :)
1 can Rotel
1/2 cup red onion
black beans (optional - I left these out but think they would be delicious!)
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 tbsp chili powder
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix together cooked rice, chicken, cream of chicken soup, sour cream, softened cream cheese, Rotel, chili powder, red onion, black beans (optional) and 1 1/4 cups cheddar cheese.
Pour into greased 9x13 baking dish or two smaller dishes.
Bake at 325 for 20-25 minutes.
Sprinkle additional 3/4 cups cheddar cheese over casserole.
Bake another 5 minutes, until cheese is bubbly.
Cool 10 minutes - Enjoy!
