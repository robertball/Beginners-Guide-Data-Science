Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces

1  green bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, with liquid
1 ¾ cups chicken broth
1  bay leaf
2 teaspoons paprika
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until hot, not smoking. Add chicken pieces and saute until browned, about 5 minutes each side. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in skillet, then add onion and bell pepper and saute, stirring frequently,  until onion is translucent (about 5 minutes).
Add rice and saute about 2 minutes, stirring, to coat the rice with the oil. Then add the reserved chicken, tomatoes with liquid, chicken broth, bay leaf, paprika and ground black pepper. Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove bay leaf and serve.
