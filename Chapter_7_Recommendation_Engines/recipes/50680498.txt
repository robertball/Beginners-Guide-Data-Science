Ingredients:
1/2 cup paprika
2 tablespoons cayenne pepper
5 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper
6 tablespoons garlic powder
3 tablespoons onion powder
6 tablespoons salt
3 tablespoons Accent (msg)
2 tablespoons Beau Monde
1 1/2 tablespoons curry powder
2 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano crushed
2 1/2 tablespoons dried thyme crushed

Directions:
In a quart ziploc bag (use to store mix) place paprika, cayenne pepper, ground black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, Accent, Beau Monde, curry powder, oregano, and thyme. Mix well.
For Ribs; place a very long strip of heavy duty foil on a counter, place one rack of ribs on foil meat side up, dribble olive oil on ribs, lightly rub to coat, use 1 tablespoon rub mix, sprinkle length of ribs, rub in thouroughly, turn over and repeat, place to the side on foil, repeat for additonal slabs. Stack slabs on top of each other and wrap tightly with foil. Place in refrigerator to marinate for at least 1 hour.  Note: make sure to not tear foil when rubbing ribs since you will be wraping ribs with the same piece to marninate.
For other meats, just use smaller portions of foil, olive oil, and mix. Prepare and marinate the same.

Description: 
Use this dry rub on your favorite meat before grilling. It stores well in an airtight container, and I've had a lot of positive feedback no matter what I cook it on.Modified from: Hugh's Dry Rub
