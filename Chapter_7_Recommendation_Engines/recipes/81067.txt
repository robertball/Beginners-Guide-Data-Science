Ingredients:
1/3 cup olive oil, divided
1/3 cup finely chopped red onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 pinch dried thyme
2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained
1/3 cup white wine
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place onion, garlic, and tomatoes in the skillet, and season with oregano and thyme. Cook and stir 5 minutes, until onion is tender. Mix in tuna, wine, lemon juice, and remaining olive oil. Continue cooking 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add angel hair pasta. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until al dente. Drain, and transfer to a bowl.
Toss the cooked pasta with Parmesan cheese. Top with the skillet mixture to serve.

Description: 
I came up with this simple and easy recipe with stuff I had around the house. I was very pleased with the outcome. A quick fix for a zingy and flavorful dish. If you want to add a little more Italian cheesy flare to it, try tossing the pasta with 3/4 cup each shredded Asiago & Fontina cheeses. Enjoy.
