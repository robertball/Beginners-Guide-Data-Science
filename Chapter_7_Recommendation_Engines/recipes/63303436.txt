Ingredients:
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 pound boneless chicken breasts
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, pressed
1 cup zucchini, cubed (about 1 zucchini)
1 cup red bell peppers, cut into chunks
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 14 oz. can Italian style diced canned tomatoes

Directions:
In 1-Qt. Batter Bowl, combine flour, salt and black pepper.  Dredge chicken in flour mixture, shaking off excess.  Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in 10-inch Generation II Frying Pan over medium heat.  Add chicken and cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Transfer chicken to a plate.
Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and garlic to pan and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add zucchini, bell pepper and basil.  Continue to cook, stirring until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Add tomatoes and stir.  Return chicken to pan and cook until chicken is no longer pink in center and vegetables are tender, about 6 more minutes.  Serve hot.
