Image:

Ingredients:
6 pork chop cutlets
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 large eggs, beaten
2 cups dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup olive oil
aluminum foil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season pork chops with garlic powder and seasoning salt. Dredge chops in flour; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both sides. Place the breaded chops, unstacked, onto a plate.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-heat. Cook pork chops in hot oil until breading appears well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer pork chops to a 9x13-inch baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until pork chops are cooked through, 60 to 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a great, basic recipe for breaded baked pork chops. Feel free to experiment with different seasonings and breading. We just did a batch using honey-wheat bread crumbs which gave a slightly sweet taste that balanced our chosen Cajun seasoning.
