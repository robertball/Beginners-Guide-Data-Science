Ingredients:
2 cup medjool dates
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 tablespoons agave syrup
A pinch of salt
Cake pop sticks
Dark chocolate

Directions:
Put all of the ingredients except the chocolate in a blender and blend until completely smooth.
Put the fudge in the freezer for an hour. This will make it less sticky and easier to roll into balls.
Put a small amount of coconut oil on your palms and roll the fudge into small round balls.
Put the fudge balls on a plate and put them in the freezer for half an hour.
Pop in the cake pop sticks and dip the fudge balls quickly in melted chocolate.
Sprinkle with your favorite sprinkles.
Put the fudge pops in a jar or a glass while the chocolate is still wet.
Keep the fudge balls in the fridge up to 2 weeks.

Description: 
Satisfy any sweet tooth with these cute raw fudge pops. This weekend I experimented with new raw food recipes and this is one of my new creations. Raw fudge pops. They would be perfect for any birthday party. I only made seven fudge pops this time and they were eaten as soon as I had taken the pictures for this blog post. My youngest daughter asked me about a hundred times if I was finished soon so she could have one. They were a big hit!
