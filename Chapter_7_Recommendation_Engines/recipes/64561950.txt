Ingredients:
8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
salt and pepper to taste
liquid smoke
1/2 cup Dijon mustard
1/2 cup honey
2 garlic cloves, minced

Directions:
Spray crock pot with non-stick cooking spray.
Sprinkle chicken thighs generously with salt and pepper and then give both sides a generous dousing of liquid smoke (I did 2-3 squirts on each side of the chicken breast). Place chicken thighs inside of crock pot.
In a bowl, mix together mustard, honey, and garlic. Pour of the top of the chicken thighs and place lid on top of crock pot.
Cook on LOW for 5-6 hours or HIGH 3-4 hours (but I highly recommend cooking on low).
Remove chicken from crock pot and serve with salad or on rice.

Description: 
This is definitely one of those slow cooker recipes youâ€™ll want to keep in your back pocket for when you need a delicious dinner in a short amount of time!   If you are short on time, you can substitute honey mustard dressing instead of making your own. It still turns out awesome! This can be adapted to use with pork loin chops as well.
