Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons dried chives
1 clove garlic, minced
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, butterflied or 10 chicken tenderloins
2 tablespoons butter, melted or 1 egg beaten
Italian style breadcrumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a bowl, mix the cream cheese, chives, and garlic. Divide the mixture into 4 balls.
Dip chicken in butter or egg and coat with breadcrumbs.
Place 1 cream cheese ball in the center of each butterflied chicken breast half. Fold the chicken over the cream cheese (If using tenderloins, spoon on top of one and place another on top). Arrange the chicken in a baking dish.
Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear
