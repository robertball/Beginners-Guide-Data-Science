Combine milk and broth in a microwaveable bowl; heat at FULL power for 2 minutes or until piping hot.
In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour, then hot broth mixture to form a smooth sauce. Stir in cheese, shrimp and pesto sauce; simmer until shrimp cook through and turn pink, 3 to 4 minutes.
