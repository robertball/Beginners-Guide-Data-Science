Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup cornmeal
1/4 cup turbinado sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup sweetened, plain soy milk
1/3 cup applesauce or tofu
1/4 cup soft silken tofu

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 7 inch square baking pan. Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl; set aside.
Place the soy milk, applesauce, and tofu into a blender. Cover, and puree until smooth. Make a well in the center of the cornmeal mixture. Pour the pureed tofu into the well, then stir in the cornmeal mixture until just moistened. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cut into 9 pieces, and serve warm.
