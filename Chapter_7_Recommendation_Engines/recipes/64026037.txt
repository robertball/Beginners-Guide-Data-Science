Ingredients:
10-12 lamb chops, loin or center-cut
2 large onions
6 carrots, peeled and cut into 3" pieces
4 stalks celery, washed and cut into 3" pieces
2 lbs. baby red potatoes
4 cloves of garlic, minced
2 cans cream of mushroom soup
2 jars, whole mushrooms, do NOT drain
2 tsp. dried thyme
1/2 tsp. cayenne
salt and pepper
12 oz. Guinness beer or another dark beer

Directions:
Spray the liner of a 6 quart slow cooker with non-stick spray.  Finely mince one onion and coarsely chop the other.  Liberally season the lamb chops with salt and pepper.  Spread half the minced onion and half the minced garlic on the bottom of the crock.  Layer half the seasoned chopped on top of the onions and garlic.  Sprinkle the remaining minced onion and garlic over the chops and add the remaining meat over the first layer.  Arrange the remaining vegetables over the meat and season them lightly with salt and pepper.  In a medium mixing bowl combine the un-drained mushrooms, the two cans of mushroom soup, the thyme and the cayenne and the beer.  Mix well and pour evenly over the meat and vegetables.  Cover and cook on low for 10 hours.

Description: 
A pleasing and hearty way to serve lamb chops.  The dark beer adds a rich, nutty note to the favor profile and tenderizes the meat.  It smells divine simmering in the slow cooker all day.
