Description: 
I live in Cambodia, and from January to May the markets are always full of ripe juicy mangoes. The problem is, I've never really found a way to use them in a dessert. So when I was looking at a recipe for an apple crumble I decided to substitute the apple with mango and with a few of my own alterations, it's been a family favorite! The passion fruit really brings that extra tangy taste to the mangoes. Serve this dish with vanilla ice cream or even some plain youghurt, it's delicious.
