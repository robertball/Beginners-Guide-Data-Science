Ingredients:
8 cups fresh broccoli
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 small onion, chopped
1 1/4 cups milk
salt and pepper to taste
4 cups shredded Swiss cheese
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place broccoli in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover.  Cook until tender but still firm, about 2 to 6 minutes. Drain.
Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and add flour; cook until bubbly.  Stir in onion and gradually add milk, stirring well.  Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper.  Stir in cheese and eggs; mix well.  Combine mixture with broccoli and transfer to a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great casserole that I threw together one day when a friend requested Broccoli au Gratin for her birthday dinner.  This is a great idea for those who aren't big fans of bread crumbs.  Also, the eggs can be taken out for a great sauce and using skim milk and fat-free cheese works well, too.  It's basically a great recipe that can be easily altered according to taste. Enjoy!
