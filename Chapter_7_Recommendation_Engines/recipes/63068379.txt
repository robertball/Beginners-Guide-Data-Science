Ingredients:
1 cup hot water
1/4 cup honey
1 tsp instant coffee granules*
1/4 cup milk
2 1/2 tsp active dry yeast
1/4 cup dark molasses
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup rye flour
1 Tbsp vital wheat gluten
2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 tsp salt
2 cups AP flour (more or less)
2 tsp caraway seeds (optional)
caraway seeds, dried minced onion, or oats for topping (optional)

Directions:
In KA bowl, dissolve honey and coffee granules in hot water. Add cold milk and mix. Add yeast and let proof 5-10 minutes.
Add molasses, oil, WW flour, rye flour, VWG, cocoa and salt (and caraway). Stir to combine.
Add AP flour gradually, while mixing with dough hook, until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Knead on Speed 2 about 7 minutes or so.
Coat with oil and move to a greased bowl. Cover and let rise in the fridge overnight.**
In the morning, punch down and let rise and warm up to room temp on the counter.
Punch down, divide dough into 16 equal pieces, and shape into rolls. (16 pieces makes sandwich bun/large dinner roll sized.) Brush with egg wash and top with dried onions, seeds or oats, if desired. Bake on a cornmeal coated sheet pan. 375F for 18 min, or until 190F internal temp. Cool on a rack.

Description: 
My little girl always called the deep dark restaurant bread, chocolate bread. Cocoa actually works here, and including the caraway seeds gives it a pumpernickel flavor that i really enjoy.
