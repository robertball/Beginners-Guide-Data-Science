Ingredients:
4 skinless boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon coarse sea salt
Tony Chachere's original Creole seasoning, to taste
a little water

Directions:
Preheat convection oven to roast at 400 degrees.
Rub the chicken breasts with olive oil, sprinkle both sides with salt and Tony Chachere's seasoning. Place on broiler pan and place in the oven.
Cook for 10 minutes, then turn breasts over.  Cook an additional 15 minutes, until chicken is cooked through.  Remove from oven.  Pour a little water over the broiler pan to loosen the browned bits of "chicken candy" to flavor the juices in the bottom of the pan.
