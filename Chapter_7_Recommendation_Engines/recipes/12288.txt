Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups fresh blackberries, rinsed and drained
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/4 cup tapioca flour
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1 egg white, beaten
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Mix tapioca flour and sugar together, and blend mixture into the berries.
Line a pie dish with pastry.  Pour filling into pie shell, and cover with top crust.  Seal edges by pinching or fluting the edge.  Brush top with egg white and sprinkle with a little sugar.  Cut slits in top to allow steam to escape.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes, until pie is golden brown and bubbly.

Description: 
I use tapioca flour mixed with sugar to thicken the berries.  The filling will thicken upon cooling, so try not to cut into pie until completely cool.
