Ingredients:
2 cups warm milk
1/3 cup warm water
2 tbsp sugar
3 tbsp honey
1 tbsp active dry yeast
3 tbsp butter, melted
1 tbsp salt
2 cups WHITE whole wheat flour
2 cups BREAD flour
3/4 cup Hi-maize, high fiber flour (King Arthur)
4 tablespoons vital wheat gluten (a must have for lightness)
3 tbsp liquid lecithin (found in heath food store - maintains freshness and is a natural product)

Directions:
Place all ingredients in the bread machine as directed by the manufacturer.
Select the dough cycle.
When complete, remove dough to a lightly oiled surface.
Knead for 2 minutes.
Divide into 2 portions.
Shape into loaves and place in greased 9x5 pans.
Cover and let rise until double. About 30 minutes. (I use a shower cap for this- works great!)
Heat oven to 375* and bake about 30 minutes or until insta-read thermometer reaches 200 degrees.
Rub top of loaves with butter and let cool in pans 10 minutes.
Remove to a wire rack to complete cooling.
Wrap cooled loaves in plastic bags. I recommend freezing one loaf.
