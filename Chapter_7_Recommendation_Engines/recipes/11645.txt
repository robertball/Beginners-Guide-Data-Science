Ingredients:
2 cups butter
8 ounces cream cheese
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 cups any flavor fruit jam
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, blend the butter and cream cheese together. Sift together the flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar and baking powder. Stir the dry ingredients into the creamed mixture. Knead dough by hand for a few turns.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. If dough is too sticky, refrigerate for 1/2 an hour. Cut dough with a round cookie cutter or the rim of a glass. Place about 1/2 teaspoon of the preserves into the center of each circle. Close cookies by folding circles in half and pressing the edges with a fork to seal. Place cookies onto an unprepared cookie sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven.
In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar with the cinnamon. Roll cookies in the sugar mixture while they are still warm from the oven.
