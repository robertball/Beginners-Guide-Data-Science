Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
1/2 cup frozen egg product, thawed
1/4 cup nonfat milk
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon cooking oil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
1 cup frozen loose-pack hash brown potatoes with onion and peppers
2 ounces fully cooked ham, cut into strips
1 1/4 cups frozen egg product, thawed
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Lightly coat four 4-1/2-inch foil tart pans with cooking spray. Beat the 1/2 cup egg product, milk, flour, oil, and thyme until smooth. Divide batter evenly among pans. Bake in a 400 degree F oven for 25 minutes or until brown and puffy. Turn off oven; let stand in oven for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, lightly coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Cook the frozen hash brown potatoes over medium heat for 7 to 8 minutes or until tender; stir often. Add ham; heat through. Beat together the 1-1/4 cups egg product, salt, oregano, and pepper. Add to potatoes. Cook, without stirring, until mixture begins to set on bottom. Use a spatula to lift and fold partially cooked eggs so uncooked portion flows underneath. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more or until eggs are cooked. Spoon into center of puffs. Serve immediately.
