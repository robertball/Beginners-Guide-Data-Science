Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter-flavored shortening (such as Crisco®)
8 McIntosh apples, peeled, or more to taste
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon ground allspice
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup butter, sliced
1 1/4 cups rolled oats
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon instant mulling spice (such as Tastefully Simple®)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon cinnamon sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x10-inch glass baking dish with butter-flavored shortening; dust with flour.
Place apples in a colander. Douse with lemon juice; drain. Cut with an apple slicer and place into a bowl. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon allspice and 1 tablespoon cinnamon.
Arrange seasoned apples in the prepared baking dish; cover evenly with sliced butter.
Mix oats, flour, baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon allspice, mulling spice, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat sugar, coconut oil, applesauce, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract in a stand mixer on medium speed. Beat in oat mixture on low speed, scraping down the sides, until dough is combined.
Spoon dough over apple mixture; sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
