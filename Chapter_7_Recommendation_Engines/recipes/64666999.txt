Ingredients:
2 Tbsp olive oil
1/4 cup chopped yellow onion
1/2 leftover roast or rotisserie chicken (breasts plus tenders plus a thigh or two), chopped
2 Tbsp roasted garlic
1/4 c crumbled bacon or salad bacon pieces
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp garlic powder
2 Tbsp prepared ranch dressing
2 Tbsp sour cream
1 bunch of green onions, chopped
2 cups shredded cheddar-jack cheese
15-20 corn tortillas (small flour tortillas would also work)
1 cup mild enchilada sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450F.
Heat oil on medium in a large skillet.
Sauté yellow onion until soft.
Stir in chicken, roasted garlic, and bacon.
Season to taste with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
Stir in green onion.
Mix together the ranch dressing and sour cream in a small bowl.
Remove chicken mixture from heat.
Stir in just enough ranch mixture to barely coat the chicken mixture.
Spray a 9x12 brownie pan with spray oil.
Hold a tortilla in one hand and spoon out 2 Tbsp chicken mixture across the diameter of the tortilla.
Sprinkle 1 Tbsp cheese over top of chicken, then roll up the tortilla. Place it, seam down, against the short side of the pan, so it doesn’t unroll.
Repeat process until the pan is jammed full of enchiladas.
Pour enchilada sauce over top to cover (don’t drown them).
Sprinkle remaining cheese generously over top of everything.
Bake about 15 minutes, until bubbly on top.
