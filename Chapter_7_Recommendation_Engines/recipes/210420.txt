Ingredients:
1 (18-inch) baguette with flaky crust
8 ounces Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate baking bars
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature

Directions:
Slice the bread on the diagonal into slices 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick; there should be at least 20 slices of bread. Break the chocolate into 1/2 ounce squares. On a 4-ounce bar, there are eight 1/2-ounce squares. Butter one side of each slice of bread with 1/2 teaspoon of butter and make a sandwich, butter side out, using a piece and a half of chocolate per sandwich.
Heat a large pan over medium heat and, in batches, cook each sandwich until golden brown, pressing down with a spatula. Flip the sandwiches and cook the second side until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Keep warm in the oven.
