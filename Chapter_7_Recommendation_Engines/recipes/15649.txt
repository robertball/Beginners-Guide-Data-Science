Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
15 miniature chocolate covered peanut butter cups, unwrapped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a medium bowl, cream the butter, white sugar, brown sugar, and peanut butter together. Stir in the egg and vanilla. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture.
Drop by tablespoonfuls into the cups of a muffin tin. Cups should be about 1/4 full. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove from oven and immediately press a peanut butter cup into the center of each cookie. Allow the cookies to cool completely before removing from their pan.
