Description: 
When a sweet craving hits, you'll have this chocolate mousse ready in no time. No need to pre-whip the heavy cream - just throw everything into a bowl and mix! Use any keto-friendly granular sweetener that measures like sugar. I prefer the powdered version of Swerve®, since it dissolves better. Adjust cocoa powder and sweetener amounts to suit your tastes. This is quite rich, so you don't need a lot to feel satisfied.
