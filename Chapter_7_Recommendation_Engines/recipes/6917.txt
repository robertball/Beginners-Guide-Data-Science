Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cornmeal
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 cup boiling water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a small bowl, sprinkle or crumble yeast and sugar over the lukewarm water.  Let stand for 2 or 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve.  Set the bowl in a warm, draft-free place for 8 to 10 minutes, or until yeast doubles in volume.
Pulverize the cornmeal in a blender until fine.
In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup cornmeal, salt, and boiling water.  Stir vigorously until smooth. Stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Cool mixture to lukewarm.  Stir proofed yeast into the cornmeal mixture.  Gradually add 1/2 cup cornmeal and flour.  Gather the dough into a ball, and place it in a greased bowl.   Cover.  Set it aside in a warm place for about 30 minutes, or until doubled in bulk.
With a pastry brush, coat the bottom and sides of a 9 inch pie pan with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Turn the dough out into pie pan, and cover.  Let it rise in a warm place for another 30 minutes, or until it doubles in bulk again.
Bake in the middle of a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven for 40 minutes, or until top is golden.  Transfer to a rack to cool.
