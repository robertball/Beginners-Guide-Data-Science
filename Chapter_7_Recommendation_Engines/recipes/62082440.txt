https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting dough
1/2 teaspoon table salt
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
4 tablespoons vegetable shortening, chilled
3 - 4 tablespoons water, iced

Directions:
1. Mix flour, salt, and sugar in food processor fitted with steel blade. Scatter butter pieces over flour mixture, tossing to coat butter with a little of the flour. Cut butter into flour with five 1-second pulses. Add shortening and continue cutting in until flour is pale yellow and resembles coarse cornmeal, with butter bits no larger than small peas, about four more 1-second pulses. Turn mixture into medium bowl.
2. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons ice water over mixture. With blade of rubber spatula, use folding motion to mix. Press down on dough with broad side of spatula until dough sticks together, adding up to 1 tablespoon more ice water if it will not come together. Shape into ball with hands, then flatten into 4-inch-wide disk. Dust lightly with flour, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before rolling.
Cooking instructions are dependant on the type of filling you are using.  See my other recipes for pies, which includes shell bake times.

Description: 
The best and most foolproof method for making this common but often troublesome recipe. My award-winning solutions: Use a high proportion of fat for good texture, including both butter and vegetable shortening for the optimal mix of flavor (from the butter) and flakiness (from the shortening).  You've never had a pie crust this good!  (I also have a firm crust variation published.)
