Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1/4 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoons dried tarragon
1 teaspoon ground pepper
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons butter
2 cloves of garlic, minced
2 medium shallots, finely chopped
1/4 cup white wine
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 cup whipping cream
2 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed

Directions:
In a shallow bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, pepper and tarragon.
Dredge the chicken breasts in the flour mixture. Set aside. Retain remaining flour mixture.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place coated breasts in skillet, and increase heat to medium-high. Turn chicken frequently, until brown, about 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, and cook 5 to 7 minutes, until breasts are cooked through. Remove chicken to a warm serving platter.
Return skillet to stove and toast the garlic and shallots until light brown, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of the remining flour mixture into the skillet. Add white wine to deglaze the pan, then add lemon juice. Increase heat and add whipping cream, whisking continuously until reduced to sauce consistency, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in capers. Pour sauce over chicken, and serve.
