Description: 
A fairly easy and tasty version of Parmesan chicken cooked in a skillet. I use as many no- or low-sodium ingredients as I can, due to my wife's health condition, but it is not necessary to the recipe. This goes well with a warm loaf of your favorite crusty bread, and, surprisingly, mashed potatoes.
