Ingredients:
2 cups white whole-wheat flour
3/4 cup rolled oats
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
3 large eggs
3/4 cup canola oil
1 cup agave nectar
2 cups pomegranate seeds
1/4 cup flaxseed meal
3 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 1 1/2 12-cup muffin tins or line 18 cups with paper liners.
Combine white whole-wheat flour, oats, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and ground ginger together in a bowl. Set aside.
Beat eggs in a large bowl and add oil and agave nectar. Add pomegranate seeds, flaxseed meal, and vanilla extract. Slowly add flour mixture to the egg mixture until mixed well. Spoon batter into 18 cups of a muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 22 minutes.

Description: 
I adapted an old recipe my grandmother used to make by switching to white whole wheat flour, adding flax, and using agave nectar instead of sugar. This makes a fantastic high-fiber, moist, low-glycemic breakfast treat that my 2 toddlers love. Hope you enjoy!
