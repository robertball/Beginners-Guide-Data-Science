Ingredients:
5 pounds chuck roast
2 cubes beef bouillon
2 tablespoons salt
2 teaspoons garlic salt
2 bay leaves
2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons dried rosemary

Directions:
Place roast in a large pot with water to cover. Mix in bouillon, salt, and garlic salt. Place the bay leaves, peppercorns, oregano, and rosemary in a coffee filter and secure tightly with a rubber band. Add this to the pot.
Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low, cover with a lid, and simmer for 6 to 8 hours. Remove coffee filter and discard. Remove roast from the pot and shred with two forks. Reserve broth for dipping if desired.

Description: 
This recipe makes tender, wonderfully flavored meat that is great for sandwiches.  I also like to serve it with flour tortillas, cheese, refried beans, etc. for people to 'build their own burritos'.
