Ingredients:
½ C Mayonnaise
3 T Dijon Mustard
Zest and juice of a lemon
2 t dried tarragon
1 t freshly ground pepper
½ t salt
16 asparagus spears
4 Provolone cheese slices
1 C Panko Bread crumbs
4 boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.  Mix the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, zest and juice of the lemon, tarragon and salt and pepper together and set aside.  Partially cook asparagus by microwaving them for 1 to 1 ½ minutes, just until bright green.   Pound the chicken breasts until thin.  Place a slice of provolone in the middle of each breast followed by 4 asparagus spears.  Roll the chicken breasts up around the cheese and asparagus.  Arrange in a greased oven safe pan seam side down.  Use a pastry brush to liberally apply the mayonnaise mixture all over the breast roll-ups.  Finally cover each roll-up with panko breadcrumbs and press them a little to make them stick well.  Bake in oven for 25 minutes or so until juices run clear.  Really wonderful!  Very nice served with artichokes!

Description: 
Very flavorful chicken and asparagus dish with almost a hollandaise inspired flavor with a little crunch from the Panko breadcrumbs.  Quick and easy to prepare, the presentation is simple yet elegant.  Great served with artichokes!
