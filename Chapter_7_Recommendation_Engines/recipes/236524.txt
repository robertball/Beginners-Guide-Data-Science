Ingredients:
8 eggs
3 slices bacon
1/4 cup instant potato flakes
1/4 cup fat-free mayonnaise
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
6 ounces cooked shrimp - peeled, deveined, and chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.
Place bacon in a large skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels; crumble bacon when cool enough to handle.
Cut each egg in half lengthwise; place half the egg yolks in a bowl, reserving remaining yolks for another use. Mash yolks with a fork; stir in potato flakes, mayonnaise, chives, Dijon mustard, seafood seasoning, black pepper, and red pepper until smooth. Stir shrimp, parsley, and cilantro into yolk mixture.
Arrange egg whites cut-side-up on a serving platter. Spoon about 1 rounded tablespoon yolk mixture into each egg white half; sprinkle with crumbled bacon.
