Ingredients:
1 pound skirt steak
2 garlic cloves, smashed
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium Worcestershire sauce
1 (12 ounce) package Wacky Mac®
2 large tomatoes, cored and diced small
2 large scallions, trimmed and finely chopped
1 jalapeno chile, cored, seeded and minced (see note)
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons chicken broth
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Trim all fat from skirt steak. Rub garlic over surface of meat; discard garlic. Score steak: diagonally slash steak in 1/2-inch intervals; then diagonally slash again in the opposite direction to form diamond-shaped cuts. Brush Worcestershire sauce over meat. Place in a bowl; cover and refrigerate 3 to 4 hours.
Grill or broil skirt steak to medium doneness, about 3 to 5 minutes per side. Let steak stand for 5 minutes to firm up. Slice 1/4-inch thick on the diagonal. Cut into strips about 1 1/2- to 2-inches long.
Prepare Wacky Mac according to package directions. Drain and rinse under cold water. Place in large salad bowl. Add skirt steak, tomatoes, scallions, chile and cilantro. Toss gently but well.
Combine chicken broth, oil, vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper in a cup. Stir well. Pour over salad. Toss gently but well.
