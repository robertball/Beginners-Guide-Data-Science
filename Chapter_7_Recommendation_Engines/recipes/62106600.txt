Ingredients:
1 cup chopped cooked chicken or turkey
1/4 cup coarsely chopped peanuts
1 tablespoon parsley
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 cup shredded carrots
3 tablespoons sliced green onions
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 clove garlic, minced

1 cup water
2 tablespoons vinegar
3 to 5 drops hot pepper sauce

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
8 oz. cream cheese
1 tablespoon milk or sour cream

Directions:
To make topping, combine chicken or turkey, peanuts, parsley, sesame oil, carrots, green onions, soy sauce and garlic in a medium sized bowl.  Refrigerate.
To make Sweet and Sour Sauce, combine brown sugar and cornstarch in a small pot and gradually stir in remaining ingredients.  Cook on medium heat until sauce thickens.  Cool and refrigerate.
Beat 8 ounces of cream cheese with 1 tablespoon of milk or sour cream until smooth.  Spread over bottom of glass plate.  Spoon topping mixture over cream cheese and drizzle with sweet and sour sauce.  Serve with crackers.
You can freeze the topping and sauce separately if you want to make it ahead.  Defrost and assemble just before serving.
