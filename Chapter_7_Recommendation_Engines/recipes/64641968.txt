Ingredients:
600g fresh okra, washed
2 tsp olive oil
1 tsp ground Tajin spice
1/2 tsp smoked salt

Directions:
Preheat airfryer to 200C
Put the whole okra in a zip top plastic bag. Add the oil, Tajin spice, and salt in the bag. Seal the bag and shake it enough to completely cover the okra. Allow to rest a few minutes, until the airfryer has reached its temperature.
Pour the contents of the bag into the airfryer basket. Cook for 6 minutes. Toss the basket and cook another 6 minutes or until the okra is crispy outside.
Serve immediately.
