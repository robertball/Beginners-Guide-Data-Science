Ingredients:
1 cup butter or margarine, softened
2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 cups Pillsbury BEST® All Purpose Flour
1 (14 ounce) can EAGLE BRAND® Sweetened Condensed Milk
2 large eggs, beaten
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/3 cups flaked coconut

Directions:
In large bowl, beat butter and cream cheese until fluffy; stir in flour. Cover; chill 1 hour.
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Divide dough into quarters. On floured surface, shape 1 quarter into a smooth ball. Divide into 12 balls. Place each ball in a 1 3/4-inch muffin cup; press evenly on bottom and up side of each cup. Repeat with remaining dough.
In medium bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk, eggs and extracts; mix well. Stir in coconut. Fill muffin cups 3/4 full. Bake 16 to 18 minutes or until slightly browned. Cool in pans; remove. Store loosely covered at room temperature.
