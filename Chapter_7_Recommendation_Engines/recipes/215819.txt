Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, diced
1 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast half - cut into cubes
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground cloves
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon ketchup
½ (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup water, or as needed
4 sprigs cilantro for garnish

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onion and chicken until the onion is dark brown, and the chicken is golden, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, and stir in the garlic, curry powder, cinnamon, and clove. Cook and stir until the spices are fragrant and the garlic has softened slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the garbanzo beans, ketchup, tomato paste, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook 10 minutes. Uncover, and increase heat to medium-high, and allow the sauce to reduce to your desired consistency. Stir in additional water if too thick. Garnish with cilantro to serve.
