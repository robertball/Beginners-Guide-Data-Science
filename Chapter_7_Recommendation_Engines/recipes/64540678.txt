Ingredients:
12 large eggs
2 cups white sugar
2 cups canola oil
3 3/4 to 4 cups all purpose flour**
2 tablespoons Anise seed
2 tablespoons Anise extract
2 tablespoons Vanilla extract

Directions:
Beat eggs until light and frothy.
Add in sugar,oil, seeds and extracts. Beat until well combined.
Gradually add in flour and mix until fully incorporated.
Use 1 tablespoon of the batter on a hot Pizzelle iron and bake 30 to 45 seconds. (depending on your iron)
Lay flat to finish cooling or roll around a Canoli tube or cone.
**Note---Do a one cookie test to be sure the batter works properly in your machine.  Flour absorbs moisture and on humid days you may need more flour as damp days you may need less.  If cookies spread too much, add 1/4 cup flour and do another one cookie test.
The amount of cookies depends on your machine and how much batter you use.
