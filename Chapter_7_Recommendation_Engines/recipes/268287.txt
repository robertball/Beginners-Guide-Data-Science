Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound ground venison
2 bell peppers, chopped
2 large carrots, chopped
1 onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (12 fluid ounce) can cream-style ale
3 large beefsteak tomatoes, chopped
2 cups no-salt-added chicken broth
2 cups water
1 tablespoon molasses
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
2 bay leaves

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a 6-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Add ground venison and cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add bell peppers, carrots, and onion; cook until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Mix in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds more. Stir in chili powder, salt, paprika, cumin, oregano, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes.
Mix in tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Add ale; cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cook until juices start to release, about 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, water, and molasses; stir to combine. Add beans and bay leaves.
Bring chili to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until flavors blend, 30 to 45 minutes more. Taste, adjust seasonings, and discard bay leaves.

Description: 
This chili came about when we had an over-abundance of produce from our garden. Fresh tomatoes, carrots, peppers, and onions make for a delicious chili! Serve warm, topped with cheese, if desired.
