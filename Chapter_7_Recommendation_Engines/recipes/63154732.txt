Ingredients:
3-4 pound corned beef briskets with spice packet
1/4 cup peppercorn based spice mix
6 garlic cloves

Directions:
Place the corned beef brisket into a large pot. Sprinkle in spice packet, liquid to cover (part beer is good), peppercorns and garlic cloves. Cover, and bring to a boil.
Once the liquid comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for 4 to 5 hours, checking hourly, and adding more water if necessary to keep the meat covered. Carefully remove the meat from the pot, as it will be extremely tender. *or cook in a crock pot. Set on a cutting board, and allow it to rest until it firms up a bit, about 10 minutes. Slice or shred to serve. Cook cabbage wedges in leftover liquid.  Boil red potatoes separately and add butter and parsley.  Roast carrots separately. Put all together on a platter to serve.
