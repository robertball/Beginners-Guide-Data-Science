Ingredients:
1 cup creamy peanut butter
2 tbs butter, softened to room temperature
1/2 cup confectioners sugar
3/4 cup light brown sugar
60 small pretzels, wagon wheel works best
8 oz semi-sweet chocolate

Directions:
Line a large baking dish with parchment paper.  Set aside. In a medium bowl, mix together peanut butter and butter with a spoon. Stir in sugars until dough is thick. Roll peanut butter dough into 30 balls. If it is too sticky, add more powdered sugar. Sandwich ball between 2 pretzels and place on baking sheet. Freeze for 20-30 minutes. While pretzels are chilling, melt chocolate in microwave, stirring every 20 seconds. Dip pretzels halfway into melted chocolate and place back on baking sheet. Refrigerate at least 10 minutes to set. Keep cool until served.
