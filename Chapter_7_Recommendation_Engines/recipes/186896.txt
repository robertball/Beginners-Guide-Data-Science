Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/4 cup mayonnaise, plus
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
2 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1 teaspoon chili powder
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and shredded
7 ounces imitation crabmeat, flaked
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup lemon zest
salt and black pepper to taste
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley for garnish

Directions:
Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl; whisk in the mayonnaise, mustard, seafood seasoning, and chili powder. Add the sweet potatoes, crabmeat, mozzarella cheese, and lemon zest. Season to taste with salt and pepper; mix until evenly combined.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Scoop heaping spoonfuls of the sweet potato mixture into the heated pan. Flatten into 3-inch circles and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining sweet potato mixture. Sprinkle with parsley to garnish.
