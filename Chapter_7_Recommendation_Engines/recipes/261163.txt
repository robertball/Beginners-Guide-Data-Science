Ingredients:
30 blanched almonds
1 (4 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
1/2 onion, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
30 green olives, pitted

Directions:
Toast almonds in a skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Allow to cool, about 15 minutes.
Combine feta cheese, onion, and garlic in a small bowl. Add olive oil and mix into a smooth paste.
Spoon a little bit of feta paste into each olive and stick an almond inside. Cut very large almonds in half. Refrigerate before serving, 8 hours to overnight. Serve with toothpicks stuck into the olives.

Description: 
A great Spanish tapas recipe of stuffed green olives with feta cheese and almonds. It's easy to make but it takes some time to stuff those olives - the bigger the olives, the easier the stuffing.
