Ingredients:
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 medium onion, chopped
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro
4 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 teaspoon pepper
CORNMEAL DUMPLINGS:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/3 cup cornmeal
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 egg
2 tablespoons milk
2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a slow cooker, combine the first 10 ingredients. Cover and cook on high for 4-5 hours.
For dumplings, combine the flour, cheese, cornmeal, sugar and baking powder in a bowl. In another bowl, combine the egg, milk and oil; add to dry ingredients just until moistened (batter will be stiff). Drop by heaping tablespoons onto soup. Cover and cook on high 30 minutes longer (without lifting cover) or until a toothpick inserted in a dumpling comes out clean.

Description: 
This soup has a great southwestern flavor and is a real winner with my family. I love it because I can have the soup cooking in my crock pot, and when I get home from work, I can quickly make the dumplings and fix dinner in a jiffy.
