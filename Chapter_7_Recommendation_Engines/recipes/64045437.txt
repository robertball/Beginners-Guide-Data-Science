Ingredients:
2 Tbsp. active dry yeast
1 cup plus 2 Tbsp. warm water
1/3 cup oil
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg
1 tsp. salt
3 to 3-1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add oil and sugar; let stand for 5 minutes.  Add the egg, salt and enough flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 3-5 minutes.  Do not let rise.  Divide into 12 pieces; shape each into a ball.  Place 3" apart onto greased baking sheets.
Cover and let rise for 10 minutes.  Bake at 425* for 8-12 minutes or until golden brown.
