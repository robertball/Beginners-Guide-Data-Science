Ingredients:
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 banana, sliced
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1 pinch salt
1 cup water
1/4 cup Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons strawberry jam
1 tablespoon peanut butter

Directions:
Combine oats, banana, cinnamon, and salt in a microwave-safe bowl; add water and stir. Cook in microwave until water is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir to evenly distribute cinnamon; let stand until slightly cooled, about 3 minutes.
Spoon Greek yogurt, strawberry jam, and peanut butter over oatmeal; stir.

Description: 
Oatmeal is a great way to start a day! I have it almost every morning, so to not get bored I add different toppings and vary the ingredients I put in, always healthy and always delicious! Greek yogurt goes fantastically with hot oats and makes it creamier, adds protein, and most important of all makes a standard bowl of oatmeal phenomenal! Sprinkle with some more cinnamon, if you desire.
