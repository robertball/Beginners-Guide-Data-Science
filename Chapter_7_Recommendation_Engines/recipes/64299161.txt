Ingredients:
3-4 pounds beef marrow and knuckle bones
2 pounds meaty bones such as short ribs
Â½ cup raw apple cider vinegar
4 quarts filtered water
3 celery stalks, halved
3 carrots, halved
3 onions, quartered
Handful of fresh parsley
Sea salt

Directions:
Place bones in a pot or a crockpot, add apple cider vinegar and water, and let the mixture sit for 1 hour so the vinegar can leach the mineral out of the bones.
Add more water if needed to cover the bones.
Add the vegetables bring to a boil and skim the scum from the top and discard.
Reduce to a low simmer, cover, and cook for 24-72 hours (if you're not comfortable leaving the pot to simmer overnight, turn off the heat and let it sit overnight, then turn it back on and let simmer all day the next day)
During the last 10 minutes of cooking, throw in a handful of fresh parsley for added flavor and minerals.
Let the broth cool and strain it, making sure all marrow is knocked out of the marrow bones and into the broth.
Add sea salt to taste and drink the broth as is or store in fridge up to 5 to 7 days or freezer up to 6 months for use in soups or stews.
