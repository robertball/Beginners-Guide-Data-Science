1/4 cup minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/4 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 Thai or serrano chile pepper, minced
3/4 cup peanut or canola oil
2 pounds extra large shrimp (16-20), peeled and deveined, tail left on
1/4 cup lime juice
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
1/2 cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
2 tablespoons cold water
3 tablespoons grated lime zest
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
2 teaspoons fish sauce
2 fresh Thai or Serrano chile, seeds removed
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1/2 cup smooth, unsalted peanut butter
1/4 cup peanut oil

Directions:
Stir together lemon grass, 1/4 cup ginger, garlic, cilantro, 1 minced chile, and 3/4 cup peanut oil in a large bowl. Add the shrimp, and toss to coat; let marinate at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes.
Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.
Meanwhile, pour lime juice, rice vinegar, mirin, soy sauce, and water into the bowl of a blender or food processor. Add the lime zest, 1 tablespoon ginger, fish sauce, 2 chile peppers, garlic, and peanut butter; process until smooth. While processing, slowly pour in the peanut oil; process until smooth and creamy. Pour into a bowl, stir in mint, cilantro and chopped peanuts; season to taste with salt.
Remove shrimp from marinade, shaking off any excess. Grill on preheated grill until pink and firm, about 2 minutes per side. Serve immediately with sauce.
