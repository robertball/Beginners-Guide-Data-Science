Ingredients:
1/2 cup carrots (frozen or fresh), sliced into rounds
2/3 cup pineapple (frozen, fresh or canned)
1/2 cup old fashioned oats
2/3 cup almond milk
1 tablespoon 1 teaspoon walnuts or pecans
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)

Directions:
Place frozen carrots and frozen pineapple in a microwave safe bowl and defrost for 1 minute. (If using fresh carrots and fresh or canned pineapple, this step will be skipped and the carrots would need to be partially steamed. This can be done in the microwave by adding a teaspoon of water and microwaving for about 1-2 minutes.)
Add 1/2 cup old fashioned oats, 2/3 cup almond milk, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (if desired) to the bowl and stir. Microwave for another minute.
Stir and continue microwaving, stirring every 30 seconds, until it reaches desired consistency. Top with nuts and enjoy!

Description: 
This idea came to me one morning as I had steamed carrots followed by a bowl of oats topped with pineapple and walnuts...I immediately wished I had combined the two and added a few more spices from some delicious desserts. Thus, this oatmeal was born.
