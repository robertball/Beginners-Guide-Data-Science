Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
5 tablespoons melted butter
2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Filling:
All ingredients should be at room temperature!
2-2/3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup milk
3 eggs
2/3 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place a baking pan large enough to hold the springform pan and at least 2 inches deep in the oven with 1-inch of boiling water in the pan.
Grease a 6 inch springform pan.
In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add melted butter and mix thoroughly. Press onto bottom of springform pan.
In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream and vanilla until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Turn the oven off and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 1 to 2 hours; this prevents cracking.
Chill in refrigerator until serving.

Description: 
I removed the flour and adjusted the recipe for a six inch pan.  I also adjusted the crust recipe to use packaged graham cracker crumbs and add sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg and use more butter. I also use a water bath for baking the cheesecake and cool in the oven only 1 to 2 hours.Modified from: Chantal's New York Cheesecake
