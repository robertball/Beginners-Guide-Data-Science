Ingredients:
6 (4 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken thighs
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 onion, sliced into rings
1 1/3 cups apple cider
1 tablespoon sambal oelek (optional)
1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives (optional)

Directions:
Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken thighs into the hot oil and cook until brown, about 4 minutes, then turn and place onion slices on top.
Stir together apple cider and sambal oelek; pour over chicken and onions. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken and onion to a plate and keep warm.
Increase heat to medium-high and bring the liquid in the skillet to a boil. Continue boiling, uncovered, until the liquid has reduced to about 3/4 cup. Pour over chicken thighs and onions and garnish with fresh chives. Serve warm.
