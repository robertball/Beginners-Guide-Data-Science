Ingredients:
Caramel:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/4 cup water
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
5 eggs
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat sugar and water together in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves into a light brown caramel, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour into a round glass baking dish.
Place condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, cream cheese, and vanilla extract in a blender; blend into a smooth custard. Pour over caramelized sugar in the baking dish.
Place baking dish in a deep baking pan. Pour in enough water to reach halfway up the baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until custard is set and top is light brown, about 1 hour.
Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate until cold, 3 to 4 hours.
