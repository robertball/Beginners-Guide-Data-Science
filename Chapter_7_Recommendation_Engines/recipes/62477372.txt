Ingredients:
Matzo Balls:
1/3 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
3 tablespoons, finely chopped fresh herbs (such as basil, parsley, dill, rosemary, sage)
11/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
1 cup matzo meal
Chicken Soup:
1 whole chicken, cut up
2 small yellow onion, diced
3 quarts water
2 celery stalks, cut into chunks
3 carrots cut into chunks
1 bunch of dill
1 bay leaf

Directions:
1 For matzo balls: combine, oil, eggs, herbs, salt and pepper, mix well. Stir in matzo meal, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
2 Boil a pot of water at least 3 quarts with about 1 teaspoon of salt. With wet hands, shape matzo balls and drop them into the boiling water.
3 Simmer for at least 20 minutes. Then tranfer the matzo balls to the soup pot using a slotted spoon.
4 For the soup: Put all ingredients in a large pot. Bring to a boil and then simmer for at least 5 hours.
5 Cool and refrigerate overnight. Skim the fat off the top with a paper towel.
6  Once cool, strain the soup, if you like add back in the carrots and take the chicken off the bones and put it back in as well (or you can use it to make a chicken salad).
7 Add the matzo balls and heat to searve.
