Ingredients:
Dough:
3 cups sifted flour
2 tsp baking powder
1 scant tsp soda
1/2 tsp nutmeg, optional
1 c shortening
2 beaten eggs
1 c sugar
4 scant TBS milk
1 tsp vanilla
Filling:
1 c dates chopped fine
1 c sugar
1/2 c boiling water
1/2 c finely chopped nuts

Directions:
Cut shortening into the first four ingredients (like making pie crust).
Beat the egg in a separate bowl. Add the sugar, milk, & vanilla and beat all together well. Then pour this egg & milk mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir to form a soft dough. Chill for several hours - or overnight.
Roll out thin. Bake on lightly greased cookie sheets until just delicately browned. When cool decorate, or they may be baked, cooled, & frozen ahead and decorated later.
Now for the Filled Cookies - here's the filling recipe....
Mix altogether & simmer until mixture starts to thicken. Cool.
Roll out your cookies - place on a cookie sheet - put 1/2 to 1 tsp of this on cookie. Place another cookie on top. Press all around the edges to seal. Bake until light delicate brown 350-375 oven.

This is an exact transcription of my grandma's hand-written recipe, which my mother passed to me. The recipe doesn't indicate a yield or a baking time, so I had to guess - so please don't use these figures as a definitive!
