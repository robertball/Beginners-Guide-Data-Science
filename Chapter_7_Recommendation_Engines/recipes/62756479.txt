Ingredients:
8 oz rice vermicelli (sev)
3 T light sesame oil
2 tsp black mustard seed
1 T urad dal
2 - 4 whole dry chili
1/3 tsp ground asofoetida (hing powder)
1/4 tsp turmeric
1/4 c water
1 tsp salt
2 T coarsely chopped cilantro
2 to 3 T lemon juice

Directions:
Measure all ingredients out in advance and set aside so they will be readily at hand as needed.
Bring 4 qts of water to a boil.  Turn off heat and add the rice noodles.  Soak for 5 minutes.  Drain and rinse in COLD water.  Set aside, tossing to keep them from clumping.
Heat the oil in a frying pan on a high heat, then turn down to med-high.  Toss in the dals, when they JUST begin to brown, toss in the mustard seeds.  When they start to pop, toss in the dry chilis (crumbled coarsely) and the asafoetida. You don't want to take a deep breath of this, trust me.  After 10 or 15 secs (chilies will burn FAST) add the noodles and stir quickly.
Immediately add the turmeric water and salt.  Toss well to thoroughly coat the noodles.  Cook for about 5 mins to cook the noodles thoroughly.
Turn off heat and add lemon juice and cilantro.  Toss again.
Serve garnished with chopped cilantro and lemon slices.
