Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix flour, sugar, and baking soda in a bowl. Stir in bacon bits, butter, and egg until well blended. Fold corn flakes and Cheddar cheese into flour mixture. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheet.

Description: 
The only bad thing about these cookies is that it's impossible to eat just one or two. They are not too sweet, and the bacon adds the most amazing flavor. I have made these with all white flour, half white/half whole wheat, and all whole wheat flour, and all tasted wonderful.
