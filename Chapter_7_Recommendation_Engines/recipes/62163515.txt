Ingredients:
3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (frozen okay)
2 tblsp Italian dressing
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 container refrigerated "light" alfredo sauce
1 pkg whole wheat spaghetti noodles
1 can chicken broth
1/4 - 1/2 cup lowfat milk
1/4 cup sundried tomatoes (dry, not in oil), chopped
1-1/2 cups frozen mixed veggies (such as peas, corn, carrots)

Directions:
1) In large skillet, place the chicken breasts (frozen okay) drizzled with Italian dressing, and minced garlic.  (If frozen, cover with lid for first 10 mins) Cook on med-low heat, turning a few times, until done and juices run clear.  Turn off heat.
2) While the chicken is cooking, fill large pot with water.  Add chicken broth.  Bring to a boil.
3) Add spaghetti noodles.  When noodles are almost done (with approx 3-4 mins to go), pour in frozen mixed veggies.  The veggies will be done when noodles are done.  Drain - do not rinse.  Return veggies and noodles to large pot.
4) Cut up chicken and add to noodle mixture.  In the same skillet that the chicken was in, add light alfredo sauce, sundried tomatoes, and enough milk to thin the sauce to desired consistency.  Stir until smooth and warm.
5) Pour alfredo mixture onto noodle mixture.  Toss to combine.  Salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle with parmesan.  Enjoy!
