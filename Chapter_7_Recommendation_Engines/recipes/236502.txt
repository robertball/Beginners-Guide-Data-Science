Description: 
In my humble opinion, this crispy, crunchy, cheesy masterpiece is the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich. Make sure you follow some basic rules for this to work properly. Only use airy, nutritionally insignificant white bread. Use a nice sharp cheddar and be sure to use a quality non-stick pan over medium to medium-low heat.
