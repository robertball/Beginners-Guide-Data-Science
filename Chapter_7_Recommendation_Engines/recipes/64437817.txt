Ingredients:
1 cup raw cashews
water
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
1 garlic clove, minced
½ teaspoon sea salt
black pepper, to taste
½ tablespoon chopped fresh basil
½ teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
¼ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
For Garnishing
malden sea salt or other large flake sea salt
black pepper
chopped basil, thyme, oregano

Directions:
1 Soak the raw cashews in about 2 cups of water for at least 4 hours (I soaked mine overnight).
2 Drain the cashews completely and add them to a food processor along with the nutritional yeast, lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of water, white wine vinegar, garlic, sea salt, and black pepper. Process for 3-4 minutes or until you have a very smooth cream.
3 Transfer the cashew cream to a bowl and stir in the chopped basil, oregano, and thyme.
4 You can either enjoy the cheese as is or line a small colander with tightly-woven cheesecloth, pour the cashew cheese into the cheesecloth, fold the cheesecloth over top, and place the colander over a medium-size bowl so that it is suspended. Then, refrigerate overnight.
5 Once refrigerated, unwrap the cashew cheese, transfer it to a serving platter, and garnish with sea salt, black pepper, and chopped herbs.
6 Refrigerate leftovers.
