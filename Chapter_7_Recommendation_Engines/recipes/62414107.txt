Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour for coating
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into
pieces
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 cup green beans
1 cup baby carrots
1 zucchini, sliced
1 yellow sqush, sliced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 cup white wine
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine the flour, salt and pepper in a plastic bag. Shake the chicken pieces in flour until coated. Heat the oil in a large skillet (one that has a cover/lid). Fry the chicken pieces until they are browned on both sides. Remove the chicken from the skillet.  Add the onion, garlic, mushrooms, and bell pepper to the skillet until the onion is opaque.  Add the tomatoes, wine, carrots, green beans, zucchini, and squash and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and return the chicken to the skillet, adding the basil, salt, and pepper. Cover and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes.
