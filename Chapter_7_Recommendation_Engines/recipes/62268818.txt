Ingredients:
(optional) 1 bag (3/4 lb) Morningstar sausage crumbles
1 lb bag Morningstar or Quorn ground beef substitute
1/2 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
- Either:
1 (28 ounce) can crushed
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
- Or: or 2 lbs fresh tomatoes reduced over heat
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons Stevia
1 1/2 teaspoons fresh or dried basil
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds or 1/4 cup fresh fennel
1 teaspoon oregano
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
12 prepared homemade whole wheat lasagna noodles
16 ounces low-fat cottage cheese
1 egg or egg substitute
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 pound part skim low-fat mozzarella cheese, grated
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in reduced tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with Stevia, basil, fennel, sausage, 1 tablespoon salt, black pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 2-5 minutes until al dente ("firm to the bite".) Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.  In a mixing bowl, combine cottage cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
To assemble, spread 1/3 meat sauce to lightly cover the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.  Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the cottage cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese. Spoon another 1/3 meat sauce over mozzarella.  Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil (to prevent sticking, spray foil with cooking spray.)
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
