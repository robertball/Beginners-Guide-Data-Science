Ingredients:
6 sun-dried tomato wrap-sized tortillas, room temperature
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 c. Medium Salsa (you can also use Mild or Hot salsa to suit your taste
2/3 c. shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 c. cooked bacon crumbled or real bacon bits
1.5 c. Fresh Spinach, washed and patted dry
2 Roma tomatoes, thinly sliced
2 avocados, thinly sliced
1/4 c. lemon juice

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese and salsa.
Thinly slice tomatoes, removing excess seeds and liquid.
Thinly slice your avocados, dipping each slice in a shallow bowl of lemon juice to prevent browning and set aside.
Spread cream cheese mixture in a thin layer onto each tortilla, all the way to the very edge.
Sprinkle cheese then bacon over the entire tortilla.
Place avocado slices, tomato slices and spinach side-by-side down three lines of the center of the tortilla.
Tightly roll up tortillas starting at the edges, moving toward the avocado/spianch/tomato center. Chill about 1 hour, or until the filling is firm.
Slice chilled wraps into 1 inch thick roll-ups.
Optional: Serve with salsa or sour cream.

These little roll-ups make a great appetizer for a larger group, or nice light lunch for just a few. They are fairly healthy and my kids love them!
