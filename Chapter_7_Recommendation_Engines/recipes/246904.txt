Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups diced rhubarb
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 cup buttermilk
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons melted butter
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
vegetable oil for frying
1 cup frozen strawberries, chopped

Directions:
Place rhubarb, white sugar, and water in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook until rhubarb is tender, about 5 minutes. Strain rhubarb, reserving sugar syrup.
Combine buttermilk, egg, and melted butter in a bowl. Stir in cooked rhubarb.
Mix flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in buttermilk and rhubarb mixture until batter is thick and smooth.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spoon batter into a resealable plastic bag; snip a large hole in one corner. Working in batches, squeeze 1-inch lengths of batter into hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Stir strawberries into reserved sugar syrup to make sauce. Serve sauce alongside beignets.

Description: 
Just a concoction that I came up with, and it turned out so well that I wanted to share it! Crispy fried dough riddled with tangy rhubarb and topped with sweet strawberries. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.
