Ingredients:
1 med. lemon
2 1/4 cups flour
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
3/4 tsp. salt
1 1/2 cups + 2 tbsp sugar
3/4 cup butter or margarine

Directions:
Grate all the peel from lemon . Squeeze the juice; set aside.
In large bowl, mix flour, baking powder, salt and 1 1/2 cups sugar.
Cut butter into flour mixture.

In small bowl, beat eggs slightly and add milk. Mix into flour mixture just until moistened.
Bake in greased loaf pan (or two smaller pans) @ 350* x ~ 1 1/4 hrs for large loaf (reduce time for smaller loaves). *I prefer not to use convection oven for this recipe.
Cool in pan x 10 min. Remove to cool.
In small saucepan over med. heat, heat lemon jc. and 2 tbsp. sugar to boiling. Cook, stirring, until slightly thickened (about 5 min.). Brush over top of loaf with pastry brush.
Freezes well.
