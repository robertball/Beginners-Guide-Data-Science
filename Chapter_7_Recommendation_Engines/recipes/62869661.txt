1.5 cup lukewarm water (leftover pasta water works well)
.25 cup coconut oil (can use sunflower, safflower, etc)
.25 honey OR maple syrup
16.5 ounces whole wheat flour (if using fresh organic WW flour, I use 16.5 ounces. if using KAF or other brand of WW flour, I only need 14 oz.)
.25 cup wheat gluten flour
6 T freshly ground flax (I prefer golden)
6 T wheat germ

2.25 tsp yeast

Add ingredients to bread machine according to manufacturer instructions (usually wet, followed by dry, in the order listed above), using the dough cycle (which includes one rise). Place in oiled loaf pan and rise again (approx. 45 mins). Bake at 350 until internal temp is 190 (approximately 30 mins). Loosely tent with foil for last 10 mins if top is browning too quickly.
