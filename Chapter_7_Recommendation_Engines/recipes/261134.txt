Ingredients:
4 cups skim milk
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper, or more to taste

Directions:
Pour milk into a microwave-safe container and heat in a microwave oven until warm, about 2 minutes.
Melt margarine in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and continue cooking until the mixture bubbles, about 5 minutes. Pour milk into the saucepan slowly while whisking. Cook and whisk until the mixture begins to thicken, about 3 minutes. Add salt and pepper. Continue whisking until the gravy comes to a boil, about 3 minutes more. Remove from heat.

Description: 
A creamy and peppery white gravy that will sure to please everyone! This goes great on fries, mashed potatoes, and meats! If you are wary of adding all of the pepper, add a teaspoon at a time and taste. I like mine really peppery, so I always use the 2 tablespoons. My mother doesn't like it so peppery, so she tends to use 1 or 1 1/2 tablespoons. The best part about this recipe is that you can adjust the spice to your liking!
