Ingredients:
1 16-oz pkg angel hair pasta
4-5 chicken breasts
2 cups shredded carrots
2 cups sliced celery
6 green onions, sliced thin, including green tops
3 tbsp. black bean and garlic paste
1-1/2 cups chicken broth
1 tbsp. soy sauce
3 tbsp. sesame oil
3 tbsp. cornstarch
2-3 tbsp. peanut oil

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions.  Drain and rinse with cold water.  Drain thoroughly and set aside.
Grill chicken breasts until just done.  (You may also saute them in 1 tbsp. peanut oil until done.)  Do not overcook.  Cut into bit-sized pieces.  Set aside.
Heat wok.  Add 2 tbsp. peanut oil.  Add vegetables and saute until tender-crisp.  (My family requested this particular combination.  However, you may use snow peas, broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, etc., as you like).  About 5-6 minutes.
Add black bean and garlic paste.  Stir fry 1 minute.
Mix together chicken broth, soy sauce and cornstarch.  Blend well and add 2 tbsp. sesame oil.  Pour over vegetables and simmer until thickened.
Toss in drained pasta.  Using two utensils, toss and stir fry until well-coated and heated through.
Serve with Padang sauce on the side for those who like it SPICY!  Sprinkle chopped peanuts and sliced green onion over all just before serving if you care to garnish!
