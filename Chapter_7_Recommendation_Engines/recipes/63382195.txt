Ingredients:
12 oz. rice noodles
3 Tbsp. oil
3 eggs
3 Tbsp. vinegar (or whatever is needed to separate noodles)
1/2 cup tamarind sour sauce
2 Tbsp. fish sauce (more to add salty flavor)
4-8 Tbsp. brown or white sugar
1 Tbsp. fried chopped tofu (with a batter)
2 cups bean sprouts
1 cup cut green onion
1/2 cup chopped peanuts
3 cups (meat of your choice...chicken)

Directions:
Let Pad Thai noodles soak in water (in fridge) for 10 hours. Heat oil in wok and add  three eggs to scramble. Then add chicken and tofu (if tofu isn't cooked).
Once chicken is cooked, add noodles and vinegar. Stir and make sure noodles aren't sticky (Benja says not to over stir).
Add tamarind sour sauce and fish sauce. Lastly, add 4-8 Tbsp. brown or white sugar. Once sauces are added, mix in tofu (if previously cooked), bean sprouts, green onions and chopped peanuts. Add more sugar or fish sauce to taste.
