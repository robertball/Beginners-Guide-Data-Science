Ingredients:
1 3/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter (2 sticks), softened
1/2 cup all-natural peanut butter
1/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup candy-coated peanut butter candy

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt.
With a stand mixer or large mixing bowl, beat together the butter, peanut butter, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla and egg until it’s smooth.
Gently beat in the dry ingredients until the dough forms. Add in the chocolate chips and the candy-coated peanut butter candy.
Place a piece of wax or parchment paper on a clean surface and spoon the dough onto the middle of the paper. Form the dough into a long log and then fold the paper over the dough, wrapping it inside the paper. Let the wrapped dough sit in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours before slicing and baking.
If you’d like to freeze the dough, I recommend letting it sit in the fridge for 24 hours, then transferring it to the freezer.
To bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and cut the dough into 1/4 inch circles. Bake in the pre-heated oven for nine to 11 minutes. If baking from frozen dough, bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool the cookies on a cooling rack before serving.
