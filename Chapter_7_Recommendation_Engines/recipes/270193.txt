Ingredients:
3 cups water
2 Assam tea bags
2 Ceylon tea bags
1/8 cup Chinese lump white sugar
1 (1/4 inch thick) slice fresh ginger
1/2 inch cinnamon stick
2 dried rose buds
3 pods green cardamom
2 pods black cardamom
1 cup evaporated milk

Directions:
Heat water in a small saucepan until bubbles start to form around the edges. Add tea bags. Reduce heat to a simmer.
Lightly crush lump sugar, ginger, cinnamon, rose buds, and cardamom pods in a mortar. Stir into the pot. Simmer until the tea bags and spices have become saturated, about 3 minutes. Add evaporated milk. Stir and simmer, without boiling, until sugar has dissolved and tea reaches the desired strength, about 8 minutes for strong tea. Strain into mugs.

Description: 
I found this tea on a recent trip to the UAE but have learned that it is popular all over the Middle East. Roughly translated, karak chai means 'strong tea'. It differs from Masala chai by using fewer spices, slightly stronger tea, evaporated milk, and lump sugar. I make up a big batch in the morning and drink it throughout the day. It's nice chilled or reheated.
