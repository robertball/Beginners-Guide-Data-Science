Ingredients:
4 large onions
1/2 cup butter
4 cubes chicken bouillon

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat.
Peel outer layer off onions. Slice a small section off of one end of each onion, and make a small hole in the center. Fill the center of each onion with a bouillon cube and 2 tablespoons butter or margarine. Replace the top of the onion, and wrap in aluminum foil.
Place onions on grill over indirect heat, and close the lid. Cook for 1 hour, or until tender. Remove the tops, and cut into bite size chunks. Place in a serving dish with all the juices from the foil.

Description: 
If you like onions, you'll love this grilled treat! When I barbeque, I like to try and make the whole meal on the grill. This dish can be prepared as an appetizer or a side dish. Enjoy!
