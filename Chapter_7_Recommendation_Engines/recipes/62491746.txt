Ingredients:
2 cups rolled oats or 3 cups (?) old-fashioned oats
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup ground flax seeds
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup any dried fruit bits (apricots, craisins, cranberries, etc.)
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup vegetable oil (or 1/4 c peanut butter + 1/4 mashed banana)
1/2 cup honey (in same measuring cup)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Line 2 8x8 square inch baking pans with foil.* Then grease them generously, using Pam spray.
In a large bowl, mix together the oats, brown sugar, flax seed, cinnamon, flour, fruit bits and salt.
Make a well in the center, and pour in the honey, egg, oil and vanilla.
Mix well using your hands.
Pat the mixture evenly into the prepared pan.
Decorate the top if you want: pat sliced almonds or dried fruit bits into the top of the bars.
Bake about 18 minutes, until the edges begin to turn golden.
Cool for 5 minutes, then cut into bars while still warm.  (Don't let the bars cool completely first - they will be too hard.)
