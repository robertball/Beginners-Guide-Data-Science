Ingredients:
6 tbsp butter
1 package dry yeast
1/4 c lukewarm water
1/4 c sugar
3/4 tsp salt
3 egg yolks
1/2 c milk
2 1/2 - 3 c all purpose flour
butter to grease bowl
confectioner's sugar

Directions:
Melt the butter and let it cool slightly.
In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water.
Add the sugar, salt, egg yolks, milk, 4 tablespoons of the
cooled butter, and 2-1/2 cups of the flour. Mix well.
Lightly flour a work surface. Turn out the dough and knead for 5 minutes.
Add enough of the remaining flour so that the dough is not sticky.
Grease a bowl with butter. Put the dough in it and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 45 minutes.
Grease a 9-inch square baking pan. Set aside.
Punch the dough down. Knead it on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 18x9 inches.
Brush with the remaining melted butter.
Roll up the dough from one short end and cut it into 9 slices; trim the ends to make them neat.
Arrange the slices in the baking pan. Cover and let rise for 40 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 F. Bake the rolls for 30 minutes, or until lightly browned.
Let the rolls cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Transfer to a platter
and dust with confectioners' sugar.
