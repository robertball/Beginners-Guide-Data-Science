Image:

Ingredients:
2 Tbsp butter
1 medium/large onion, halved and then sliced thinly
3 medium zucchini, peeled and sliced 1/4" thick
4 medium ripe tomatoes (I use vine-ripened, as they yield a lot of juice), blanched, peeled, and sliced
Salt
1 tsp dried basil
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 lb cooked pasta, good choices are Farfalle, Linguini, Spaghetti, Fiori, Penne Rigate, and Orrechiette

Directions:
Blanch tomatoes by cutting a small "x" in bottom of tomato and placing in boiling water for 1 minute, then remove to ice water.  Peel will come off easily.
Sautee onion in butter over medium low heat in 3 quart pot until transluscent.
Alternate single layers of zucchini and tomato over onions until all are in pot.
Salt a little more than to taste in order to help draw out liquids from vegetables.
Cover and lower flame, simmering for about 20 minutes without lifting lid or disturbing vegetables.
Add basil and oregano, stir, cover, and simmer about another 5 minutes or until tender.
Enjoy as a side dish or as a topping for pasta.

Description: 
This is a tasty, easy dish that can double as a side dish if you omit the pasta.  In fact, it started out as a side!  I just happen to think it makes a wonderful topping for pasta as well.  The ingredients can be easily adjusted to suit your taste.
