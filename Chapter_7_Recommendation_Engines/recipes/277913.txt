Ingredients:
2 tablespoons grill seasoning (such as Montreal Steak Seasoning)
1 tablespoon brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 pounds salmon fillets, skin on

Directions:
Preheat the air fryer to the fish setting of 330 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 2 minutes.
Combine steak seasoning, brown sugar, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of the seasoning mix (or more, if desired) on each salmon fillet. Place salmon in the air fryer basket in one layer.
Working in batches if necessary, cook salmon in the air fryer until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 18 minutes. Transfer the cooked salmon onto a plate and keep warm in the oven preheated to the lowest setting. Repeat with remaining salmon fillets. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This air-fried salmon invokes a spicy yet sweet seasoning. The more seasoning you add to the salmon the spicier it will be, so I recommend starting with 2 teaspoons of seasoning per salmon fillet. You may use less salmon if desired. If you use the full amount you will need to cook in batches. You may have extra seasoning leftover, which can be stored in a jar and kept in a cool, dark place.
