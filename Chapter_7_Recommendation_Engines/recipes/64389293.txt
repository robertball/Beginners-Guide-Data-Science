Ingredients:
BREAD PUDDING
1 loaf Italian Bread
1 quart milk
1 cup half and half
2 cups sugar
2 tablespoons vanilla
3 eggs
1/2 cup chopped apple
1/2 cup shredded coconut
1/2 cup raisins (can be soaked in rum for 1-3 days)
3 tablespoons butter
AMARETTO SAUCE
1 stick softened butter
1 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 egg
3 tablespoons amaretto (or whiskey or lemon)

Directions:
BREAD PUDDING - Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Dice the Italian bread into bite-sized pieces, trying not to flatten as you cut, placing them in a large 12 quart bowl. Pour the milk and half and half over the bread and let soak for 30 minutes.
In a medium bowl, mix the sugar, vanilla, and eggs until consistent. Then fold in the apple, coconut, and raisins.
Place the butter in a 13x9 pan and put into the oven to melt the butter.
Once the bread has soaked for 30 minutes, stir the sugar mixture into the bread mixture. Pour contents into the prepared 13x9 pan, over the melted butter. Spread evenly, without flattening. It should be airy and lumpy. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes or until lightly browned and bubbly.
AMARETTO SAUCE - Cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Gently mix in the egg, vanilla, and amaretto. Heat in a saucepan over low to medium heat and gently stir until it thickens (try not to scramble the egg). Pour sauce over the bread pudding when it comes out of the oven.
