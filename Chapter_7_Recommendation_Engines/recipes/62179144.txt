Ingredients:
9 FL OZ Spring Water, 70ºF
3 OZ Organic Grapes
9 OZ Bread Flour

Directions:
Combine 3 fl oz of the water and the grapes.  Add 3 oz of the flour and mix together using a rubber spatula.  The dough will be somewhat firm.  Transfer the mixture to a container with a tight-fiting lid or cover tightly with plastic wrap.
Store at room temperature, 70ºF to 75ºF, for about 24 hours.
Remove the grapes and stir in 3 oz of the flour and 3 fl oz of the water and mix well.
Cover tightly and store at room temperature until the starter is bubbling, about 24 hours.
Add the remaining flour and water to the bubbly dough and mix well.
Cover and store at room temperature for about 24 more hours.
The starter may now be refrigerated for 2 to 3 days and then used in any recipes calling for a sourdough starter.

Description: 
Grapes have been the fruit of choice in wine making for centuries because of their moderate yeast and sugar content.  This sourdough starter takes advantage of that to create an all-natural product.
