Ingredients:
2 pounds small potatoes
6 slices bacon, chopped
1 cup sour cream, or more to taste
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
3 scallions, thinly sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a bowl of ice-cold water to cool completely.
Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes.; drain on paper towel.
Peel about half of the potatoes; chop peeled and unpeeled potatoes together.
Stir sour cream, sharp Cheddar cheese, scallions, salt, and ground black pepper together in a large bowl; add chopped potatoes and stir to coat.
