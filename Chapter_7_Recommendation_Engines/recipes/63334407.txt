Ingredients:
1 c quinoa
2 1/2 c water
1 1/2 lb eggplant, peeled and diced
1 large red bell pepper, diced
1 medium cucumber, peeled and diced
1 29-oz can chickpeas, drained & rinsed
1/2 4-oz jar capers - capotes, drained & rinsed
salt
olive oil
red wine vinegar
black pepper
mustard seeds
30 leaves fresh basil, minced
dried basil

Directions:
Place the quinoa and 2 c water in a pot and bring to a boil.  Once it boils, bring it down to a simmer and cover.  Cook for 10-15 minutes or until all the water is absorbed.
Meanwhile, combine the eggplant and the remaining water in a pan and place on medium heat.  Add olive oil, salt, and dried basil to taste.  Add red wine vinegar to taste, liberally.
When the eggplant and the quinoa finish cooking, place them in bowls.  Place the bowls in the refrigerator to chill.  To speed up the chilling process, you can place smaller bowls filled with ice water on top.
When everything is done chilling, combine the eggplant, quinoa, pepper, cucumber, chickpeas, capers, and fresh basil.  Add olive oil, vinegar, and mustard seeds generously, plus salt and black pepper to taste.
