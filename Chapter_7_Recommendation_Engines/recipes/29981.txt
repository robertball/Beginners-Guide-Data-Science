Ingredients:
4 portobello mushroom caps
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 pound linguine pasta
1 teaspoon red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
2 teaspoons lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven broiler.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine, and cook for 9 to 13 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Brush the mushrooms with 1/2 the olive oil, and arrange on a medium baking sheet. Broil in the prepared oven 6 to 8 minutes, turning frequently, until browned and tender.
Cut the mushrooms into 1/4 inch slices, and place in a medium bowl. Mix with the remaining olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, basil, rosemary, garlic, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper.
In a large bowl, toss together cooked linguine and the mushroom mixture.
