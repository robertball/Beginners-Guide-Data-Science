Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar, divided
3/4 cup margarine
1 egg
1/4 cup molasses
2 cups oat flour
1 tablespoon ground ginger
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Beat 1 cup sugar and margarine together in a medium bowl until creamy. Beat in egg and molasses until well blended.
Combine oat flour, ginger, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and cardamom in another bowl; stir into the molasses mixture to form a dough.
Roll dough into 1-inch balls and rolls in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are slightly cracked, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cookies cool for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
