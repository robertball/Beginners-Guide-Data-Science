Ingredients:
HOMEMADE MAYONNAISE: 1 raw egg, 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, 3/4 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup water, 1 Tablespoon flour, 3/4 to one cup of sugar, salt & pepper.

Directions:
This is my homemade dressing for cole slaw, I use it for potato salads also. --> 1 head cabbage, 3 celery stalks, 1/2 bell pepper, 3 carrots & a tiny piece of onion: grate or grind all above ingredients together. Combine the grated ingredients with a mixture of the homemade mayonnaise and Hellmans (Best Mayonnaise) mayonnaise, half and half measurements or an amount of each to combine this mixture to your taste preferance. --------> HOMEMADE MAYONNAISE: 1 raw egg, 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, 3/4 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup water, 1 Tablespoon flour, 3/4 to one cup of sugar, salt & pepper. ----------- Combine the vinegar and water in a measuring cup; pour into a blender. Add the egg, dry mustard, flour and salt & pepper to taste. Combine ingredients in the blender. Pour into a saucepan and add the sugar. Cook over low heat stirring constantly until boiling and thick. Let cool and pour into a clean glass jar. Store in the refrigerator it will keep for months. Use as needed. (Again, the way I make it is to make the homemade mayo and combine it with a little Hellmans mayo. so the homemade can be sweet and tangy from the vinegar) Hope this helps you.
