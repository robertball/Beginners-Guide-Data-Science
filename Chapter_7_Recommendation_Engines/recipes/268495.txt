Ingredients:
2 hot dogs
4 slices pepperoni, halved
1/2 cup pizza sauce
2 hot dog buns
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 teaspoons sliced olives

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Make 4 slits down each hot dog. Place hot dogs in the air fryer basket and cook for 3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board using tongs.
Place a pepperoni half in each slit of the hot dogs. Divide pizza sauce between buns and fill with the hot dogs, mozzarella cheese, and olives.
Return hot dogs to the air fryer basket and cook until buns are crisp and cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.
