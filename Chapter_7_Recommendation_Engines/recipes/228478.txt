Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups spinach
3 tablespoons olive oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt to taste
2  beefsteak tomatoes, sliced
2 (4 ounce) balls of buffalo mozzarella, sliced
ground black pepper
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir garlic into hot oil and cook until slightly softened, about 2 minutes, stirring often. Add spinach and toss with hot oil and garlic; cover and remove from heat. Set spinach mixture aside to wilt spinach.
Heat 3 more tablespoons olive oil in an oven-safe skillet. Cook chicken breasts in hot oil until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Season with salt. Layer 1/4 of the wilted spinach, tomato slices, and mozzarella slices on top of each breast. Season with ground black pepper and drizzle with balsamic vinegar.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese has browned and chicken is no longer pink inside, about 15 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
