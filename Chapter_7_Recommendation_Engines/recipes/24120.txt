1 1/3 cups quick-cooking oats
1/3 cup brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup butter
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
2/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground mace
5 egg yolks, beaten
3/4 cup milk
1 cup pumpkin puree
3 egg whites
