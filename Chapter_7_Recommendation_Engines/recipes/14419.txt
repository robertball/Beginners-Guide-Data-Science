Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups water
1 cup long-grain white rice
1 pound thin asparagus spears, trimmed and cut into 1 inch
1 1/2 cups English cucumber - peeled, seeded and chopped
3 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill weed

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, bring 1 3/4 cups water to boil. Add rice; return to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook until water is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Fluff with fork; transfer to bowl. Cool to room temperature.
Cook asparagus in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 1 minute. Drain and rinse with cold water to cool. Cut the asparagus into 1-inch pieces. Add asparagus, cucumber and green onions to rice.
Whisk together the mustard, sugar, vinegar, dry mustard, oil and chopped dill. Cover salad and dressing separately. Refrigerate until chilled.
