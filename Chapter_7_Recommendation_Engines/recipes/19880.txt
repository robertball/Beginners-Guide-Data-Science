Ingredients:
8  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 cup brown sugar
4  fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced
⅛ teaspoon ground ginger
⅛ teaspoon ground cloves
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Place chicken in the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Place peach slices over chicken, then sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar, ginger, cloves, and lemon juice.
Bake for about 30 minutes in the preheated oven, basting often with juices, until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.

Description: 
Rushed? Need an elegant main dish to serve for an important occasion, that doesn't take a lot of preparation or time? This is it. This dish is not only easy and quick, it serves up beautifully as well. My family loves it. Tip: For a delicious sauce to serve over the chicken and peaches, mix 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch with 1/2 cup cold water and pour mixture into cooking juices. This mixture will thicken and become a sauce to pour over the chicken and peaches.
