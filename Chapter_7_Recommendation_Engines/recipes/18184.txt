Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar
2 teaspoons water
1 3/4 cups mint chocolate chips
2 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
20 chocolate covered thin mints

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine the butter, brown sugar, water and mint chocolate chips. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until melted. Transfer to a medium bowl and set aside to cool for about 10 minutes.
Beat the eggs into the chocolate mixture one at a time. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt, stir into the chocolate mixture. Cover dough, and chill for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place 1 1/2 inches apart onto an unprepared cookie sheet.
Bake for 12 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven. As soon as the cookies are out of the oven, place 1/2 of  a mint candy on top of each one. Let sit for 30 seconds, then swirl with a toothpick. Cool on wire racks.
