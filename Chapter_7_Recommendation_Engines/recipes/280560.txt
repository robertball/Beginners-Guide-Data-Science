Description: 
Day drinking is the best drinking, and if that day happens to be a very sunny, hot day, there's no better cocktail to enjoy than a classic whiskey sour. I'm very excited to show you my favorite formula for this incredibly refreshing, super simple, absolutely delicious drink. Garnish with a slice of blood orange and a Luxardo cherry.
