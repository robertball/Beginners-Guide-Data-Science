Ingredients:
1 ½ teaspoons cayenne pepper
1 ½ teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground white pepper
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon dried thyme
½ teaspoon dried oregano
1  bay leaf, crumbled
¾ cup low-sodium chicken broth
2 cups chopped onions
2 cups chopped celery
2 cups chopped green bell pepper
3 tablespoons gumbo file powder (such as Zatarain's(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 tablespoon hot sauce (such as Tabasco(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 ½ cups seasoned tomato sauce
8 cups low-sodium chicken broth
6 cups chopped cooked chicken
1 pound turkey kielbasa, sliced and cut into bite-sized pieces

Directions:
Combine cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, white pepper, black pepper, thyme, oregano, and bay leaf in a small bowl for the seasoning mix. Set aside.
Combine 3/4 cup chicken broth with onions, celery, and green pepper in a heavy 4-quart soup pot. Cook over medium- to medium-high heat until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to high. Stir in the seasoning mix, file powder, hot sauce, and garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is fragrant and vegetables are well coated, 6 to 8 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium and stir in tomato sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Mixture will begin to smoke and stick to the bottom of the pan; just keep stirring. Add remaining broth and bring to a boil. Add chicken and kielbasa. Reduce heat; cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors meld, 45 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
This is a very hot and spicy gumbo, but a healthier version. It takes time, patience, love, and devotion. My husband and dad love this dish and will eat it for days, with no complaints of having leftovers. They savor every drop... they are so funny. Serve each portion over 1/2 cup cooked white rice.
