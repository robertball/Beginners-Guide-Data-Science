Ingredients:
Potatoes:
25 ounces russet potatoes
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
Chili:
1/4 cup tvp
1/2 cup hot vegetable broth
2 tbsp olive oil
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup diced carrot
1/4 cup diced celery
1 minced garlic clove
1 cup cooked black beans, drained
1/3 cup cooked kidney beans, drained
1/3 cup cooked white beans, drained
1/3 cup cooked pinto beans, drained
10 ounces diced Mexican style tomatoes with green chilies
1/2 tbsp blackstrap molasses
1 tsp New Mexico chili powder
1 tsp Mexican oregano
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1/2 tsp smoked salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
Cheese Sauce:
1/2 cup shredded vegan cheddar flavored cheese
1 tbsp vegan butter
1/2 cup unsweetened soy milk, divided
1/4 cup minced red onion
1 jalapeno, sliced into rounds
3 tbsp minced cilantro

Directions:
Wash the potatoes and remove any discoloration or eyes. Do not peel. Slice them evenly into shoestring style fries or use a french fry cutter. Put the fries into a large bowl. Rinse them with cool water. Once the water runs clear, fill the bowl with enough water to cover the fries by at least one inch. Cover and let rest 30 minutes.
Put the tvp into a bowl. Cover with the hot vegetable broth. In a pot over medium heat, sauté the onion, carrot, celery. Once the vegetables have become fragrant, add the garlic and stir. Add the tvp with the broth. Add all the beans, tomatoes, molasses, chili powder, oregano, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes.
After the potatoes have soaked 30 minutes, preheat an air fryer to 320 Fahrenheit. Drain the potatoes and dry them with a clean towel. Put them back into the bowl, drizzle 1 tbsp olive oil over them and toss to coat.
Cook in the air fryer, untouched, for 18 minutes. Shake and cook another 6 minutes. Shake them and cook another 6 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste.
Meanwhile, in a microwave-safe bowl, add 1/2 cup vegan cheese shreds, 1 tbsp vegan butter, and 1/4 cup soy milk. Microwave at 360W for 30 seconds. Stir and check the consistency. If needed, add more soy milk and microwave for another 30 seconds at 360W. Stir briskly to create a creamy sauce.
Place the french fries on a large platter. Top with chili. Pour the faux cheese sauce over the chili. Top with onion, jalapeno rings, and cilantro.
Serve hot.
Notes/Footnotes: If you don’t have an air fryer, the potatoes can either be fried or baked at 450 Fahrenheit, but you’ll need more oil.
