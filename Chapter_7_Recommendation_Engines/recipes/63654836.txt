Cowboy Caviar Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 can black beans (rinsed and drained)
1 can black eye peas (rinsed and drained)
1 can white corn (drained)
1 can sliced olives (drained)
½ red onion (diced)
½ red pepper (diced)
½ green pepper (diced)
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3 cloves garlic (minced)
Dressing:
¼ cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup cider vinegar or red wine vinegar
2 Tablespoons water (if you use cider vinegar)
4 Tablespoons of sugar
1 Tablespoon ground cumin

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix.  *Sometimes I add tomatoes, but you should seed and drain them before adding to the mixture.
You can also use canned diced tomatoes (not the seasoned variety), but also rinse and drain them before adding to the mixture.
Wisk all ingredients together and add to chopped vegetable/bean mixture.  Refrigerate at least two hours before serving.  If the dressing is too tart, you can add a little more water or more sugar.
*Note:  If you add tomatoes you probably won’t be able to keep any leftovers for more than a day because the tomatoes will get mushy.
