Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds boneless beef sirloin steak, cut 1-1/2 inches thick
5 green onions, white part only, cut into 1-inch pieces
Marinade:
1/2 cup country Dijon-style mustard
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
4 teaspoons bottled minced or fresh crushed garlic
1 tablespoon ground red pepper

Directions:
In large shallow bowl, combine marinade ingredients; whisk until blended.  Remove and reserve 1/2 cup for basting.  Trim fat from beef steak; cut into 1-1/2-inch cubes.  Add beef to remaining marinade in bowl; toss to coat.  Cover and marinate in refrigerator 20 minutes.
Remove beef from marinade; discard marinade.  Alternately thread an equal amount of beef and green onion pieces onto each of four 12-inch metal skewers.
Place skewers on grid over medium, ash-covered coals.  Grill, uncovered, 10 to 12 minutes for medium rare to medium doneness, basting frequently with reserved 1/2 cup marinade and turning occasionally.  Serve immediately.
