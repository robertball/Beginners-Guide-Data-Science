Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
1/4 teaspoon pepper
4 medium baking potatoes (1 pound), peeled
FISH:
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon pepper
egg substitute equivalent to 1 egg
2 tablespoons water
2/3 cup crushed cornflakes
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 pound frozen haddock fillets, thawed
tartar sauce

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine oil and pepper. Cut potatoes lengthwise into 1/2-in. strips. Add to oil mixture; toss to coat. Place on a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan that has been coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown and crisp.
Meanwhile, combine flour and pepper in a shallow dish. In a second dish, beat egg substitute and water. In a third dish, combine cornflakes, cheese and cayenne.
Dredge fish in flour, then dip in egg mixture and coat with crumb mixture. Place on a baking sheet that has been coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 425 degrees for 10-15 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve with chips and tartar sauce if desired.
