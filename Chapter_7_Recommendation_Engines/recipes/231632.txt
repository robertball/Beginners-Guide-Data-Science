Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup honey
1 egg
1 tablespoon lavender flowers
2 cups whole wheat flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat honey, egg, and lavender into the creamed butter until incorporated. Stir flour, 1/2 cup at a time, into butter mixture until blended. Drop spoonfuls of batter onto the prepared baking sheet about 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are browned on the bottom, about 15 minutes.
