Ingredients:
Tri tip roast (Also known as a triangle steak)
Sprinkle outside of meat with pepper or a pepper steak mix.
Marinade:
1 cup olive oil
1 cup rice wine vinegar
1/2 soy sauce
1/2 cup sugar
8 cloves garlic (chopped)
3 T worchestire sauce
1 tsp galic powder
1 tsp onion Powder

Directions:
Season Tri tip with pepper.   Mix marinade ingredients and pour over tri-tip (I use a ziplock bag) and refridgerate overnight (longer the better)
Turn meat a few times during the marinating process.
I cook on a Traeger Smoker/Grill
Low (180-220) for 45-1 hr, turn meat and turn up heat to medium (300-325).  Cook until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees (approx 45-1 hr). Remove from heat cover with foil and let rest for 20 minutes.  Slice against the grain.
