Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped garlic, or to taste
1 pound okra, chopped into bite-sized pieces
3 tablespoons yellow cornmeal
1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until soft and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add okra and cook for 5 minutes. Sprinkle cornmeal on top; cook and stir until okra is fork-tender and cornmeal absorbs excess moisture, about 2 minutes.
