Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole white wheat flour
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/4 cup cocoa
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon cream of tarter
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
3 tablespoons oil
2 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Mix all dry ingredients until well blended in a mixing bowl.  Mix eggs and oil in a separate container, then add milk and vanilla.  Mix well and add to dry ingredients, stirring gently until moistened.  Some lumps may remain.  Cook 1/2 cup of batter over medium heat with a little bit of oil in the pan, if needed.  Cook all of the batter as soon as possible as it does not keep well.  Enjoy!
Notes:
All purpose flour may be substituted for the whole white wheat flour.
The cream of tarter and baking soda make a fast acting baking powder which is superior for pancakes.  If needed, 1 1/2 tablespoons double acting baking powder may be substituted, but the pancakes will not be quite as light.
