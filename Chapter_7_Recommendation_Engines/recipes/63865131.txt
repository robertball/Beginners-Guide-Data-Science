Description: 
I adjusted this recipe, after seeing one with similar ingredients that had far more steps and ingredients.  Using salsa in place of canned tomatoes and chopped onions, not only saves time, but also offers the ability to add spice, by using medium or hot salsa.  I make this in both the slow-cooker and oven.
