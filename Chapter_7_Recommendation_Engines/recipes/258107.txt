Description: 
My grandmother and mom used to make these every Christmas when I was little and my grandmother has since passed away and my mom lost the recipe. I looked for years and couldn't find anything that made cookies like those I remembered and then my aunt found her recipe! These are best after they've set overnight and become softer, moist and spongy, like cake. Separating the egg is a bit of a pain, but I think that may be what helps to give these such a different texture than your average sugar cookie. I sprinkle these with red and green sugar at Christmastime. Enjoy!
