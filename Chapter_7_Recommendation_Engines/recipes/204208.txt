Ingredients:
7 slices Wonder® Classic White Sandwich Bread, toasted
2 tablespoons margarine or butter
4 shallots, chopped
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well-drained (squeezing until dry)
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 cups shredded Swiss cheese, divided
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups low-fat milk

Directions:
Spray an 11 x 7-inch baking dish with nonstick spray coating. Tear 3 slices toasted Wonder Bread into quarters and arrange in a single layer over the bottom of the baking dish.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until shallots are tender. Stir in spinach and seasonings. Stir to combine. Spoon spinach mixture evenly over bread. Top with 1 1/2 cups cheese. (Seal and refrigerate remaining cheese.)
Tear remaining 4 slices toasted Wonder Bread into quarters and arrange in a single layer over the dish.
Whisk together eggs and milk. Pour milk mixture evenly over the bread. Cover and refrigerate several hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Bake, uncovered, 50 minutes or until set and knife, inserted just off center, comes out clean. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Remove from oven and allow to stand 5 to 10 minutes. Cut into serving portions.

Wonder® bread
Description: 
You can feel good about serving this meal. Because now, just two slices of Wonder Classic White Sandwich Bread have as much calcium as an eight ounce glass of milk. And that means, Florentine Strata will not only taste good, it'll help your family feel good, too.
