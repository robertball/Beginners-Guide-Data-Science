Ingredients:
2 cups seedless grapes
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 crusty baguette, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1/2 cup ricotta cheese
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon balsamic glaze, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and set aside.
Toss grapes, 1 tablespoon olive oil, thyme, and oregano together in a medium bowl. Spread grapes out evenly on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until grapes are tender and their skins start to wrinkle, 12 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, brush baguette slices lightly with remaining olive oil and place on another baking sheet.
Toast in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove grape mixture and crostini from the oven and let cool slightly.
Mix ricotta cheese and lemon zest together in a bowl. Spread onto each crostini and top with grape mixture. Drizzle with balsamic glaze and serve.
