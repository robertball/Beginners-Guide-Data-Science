Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups warm water
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup raw honey
3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/4 cup flaxseed meal
1/4 cup vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 tablespoons dry milk powder
2 teaspoons yeast

Directions:
Place warm water, butter, honey, whole wheat flour, flaxseed meal, vital wheat gluten, salt, dry milk, and yeast in a bread machine in the order listed. Run a basic wheat bread cycle, but adjust the cook timer to cut baking time down by 25 to 30 minutes. I time the bread and take it out when I see that it is not yet brown. If you like a crusty bread you may let it cook the entire time.
Remove loaf from the machine after the cycle is done.
