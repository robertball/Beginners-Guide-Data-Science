Description: 
This is a very simple meal and isn't for those snobby eaters who are all fancy n junk but sometimes less is just MORE. My grandmother has been cooking our family this meal my whole life and I'm pretty sure that her mother cooked it as well. So this dish has a very soft place in my heart and i always DEMAND it on my birthday! p.s. don't try and change it by using a homemade tomato sauce, it WONT be good, trust me!
