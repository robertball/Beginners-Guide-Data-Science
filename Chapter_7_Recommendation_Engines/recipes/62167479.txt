Description: 
Got this receipe from someone else but made some changes to it to make it not taste Gluten Free. My family loves bread and my husband is always looking for something that taste normal.  So this is as close as it gets for muffins :)  They are actually really good.  The extra applesauce really makes it moist and not to dry!! The batter will look runny but when you take them out of the oven they will be nice and soft :) I can't keep them long, they go so fast!!
