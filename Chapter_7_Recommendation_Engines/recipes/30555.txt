Ingredients:
4 Scotch fillets (chuck eye)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 eggs
3 cups fresh bread crumbs
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup butter
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced
Mustard Sauce
3 egg yolks
1 tablespoon lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/2 cup butter, diced and softened

Directions:
Pound the steaks out to 1/2 inch thickness.
Coat steaks lightly with flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Dip steaks into lightly-beaten eggs, then coat with combined breadcrumbs and parsley, pressing on firmly. Place steaks on to tray, and refrigerate until ready to cook.
In a large frying pan, heat 1/4 cup butter and oil over medium-high heat.  Cook steaks until golden brown, and cooked to desired doneness. Remove from pan, and keep warm.
In a metal bowl, whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and mustard. Place the bowl over simmering water, and stir until sauce is thick and creamy. Whisk in the remaining 1/2 cup softened butter, and remove from heat.
Place steaks onto serving plates, place two slices of avocado on each steak, and spoon the Mustard Sauce over each one.
