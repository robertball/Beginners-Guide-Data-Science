Description: 
Veggies, potatoes and Polish sausage topped with melted Cheddar cheese make this a delicious casserole. This recipe is so simple, it's the one thing my husband makes himself! When I do it, I like to add green and red bell peppers, but it's really all in what you want to do with it. Enjoy!
