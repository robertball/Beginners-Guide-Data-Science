Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package pork sausage, halved and cut into 4-inch pieces
2 tablespoons vegetable oil butter spread
1 (32 ounce) jar sauerkraut, drained
1 teaspoon dried celery flakes
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
2 tablespoons brown sugar
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Grill the sausages on the preheated grill until browned, about 3 minutes on each side. Cut the cooked sausage into 1/2-inch slices.
While the sausage is grilling, melt the butter spread in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the sauerkraut, celery flakes, onion, caraway seeds, brown sugar, and pepper. Cook and stir until the sauerkraut begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the sausage slices. Serve hot.
