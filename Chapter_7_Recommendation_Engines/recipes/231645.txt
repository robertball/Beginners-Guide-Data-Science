Ingredients:
4 unbaked 9-inch pie crusts, divided
2 (16 ounce) containers whole-milk ricotta cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 eggs
1/4 pound pepperoni
1/2 pound sweet capicola (coppa)
1/2 pound hot capicola (coppa)
1 egg white, slightly beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press 1 pie crust each into the bottom of two 9-inch pie pans.
Mix ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and eggs together in a large bowl. Roughly chop the pepperoni, sweet capicola and hot capicola; fold in chopped meats. Spoon half the mixture into each of the 2 prepared pie pans.
Top each pie with a pie crust, crimping the edges together creating a seal. Brush the top of each pie with egg white.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 45 to 60 minutes. Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Pizzagaina is Italian Easter pie. A very traditional savory dish that is a much-anticipated treat for Easter. It can be quite an undertaking to prepare, but I've got a simplified recipe here that the Italian Nonnis may curse me for but tastes great!
