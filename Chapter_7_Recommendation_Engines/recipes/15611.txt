Ingredients:
1 large head cabbage
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat.
Cut the cabbage into 8 wedges, and remove the core. Place all the wedges on a piece of aluminum foil large enough to wrap the cabbage. Season to taste with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Seal cabbage in the foil.
Grill for 30 to 40 minutes on the preheated grill, until tender.
