Ingredients:
1 lb. backfin crabmeat
1/2 cup soft bread crumbs
1 TBS. minced onion
1 TBS. finely shopped bell pepper
1 TBS. chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup mayo
1 egg
2 tsp. white wine Worcestershire sauce
2 tsp. lemon juice
1 tsp. prepared mustard
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. ground white pepper
Vegetable oil for frying
Bottled tartar sauce

Directions:
Remove any cartilage and shell from crabmeat by gently squeezing a teaspoonful at a time between fingers.  Feel carefully for small bits; discard.  Flake with fork.
Place crabmeat in medium bowl.  Add bread crumbs, onion, bell pepper and parsley; set aside.
Mix remaining  ingredients except oil and tarter sauce in small bowl.  Stir well to combine.  Pour mayo mixture over crabmeat mixture.  Gently mix so large lumps will not be broken.  Shape mixture into 6 large cakes or 36 bite-sized cakes.
To panfry crab cakes, pour enough oil into 12" skillet to cover bottom.  Heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add crab cakes; fry 10 minutes for large cakes and 6 minutes for bite sized cakes until cakes are lightly browned on bottom.  Using spatula, carefully turn halfway through cooking.  Serve cakes with tartar sauce.  Garnish as desired.
