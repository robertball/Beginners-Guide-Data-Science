Image:

Ingredients:
4 Chicken legs with the thighs attached
2 Medium onions chopped in long strips
4 Tablespoons sumak
1/3 cup pine nuts
4 Small pita bread or 2 big pitas cut in half
salt & pepper
dollop of ghee or butter

Directions:
Rub some salt and pepper on the chicken legs. Don't add too much salt as the sumak also makes the food salty.
Add the ghee/butter to a pot and partially cook and brown the chicken.
Remove the chicken and set aside.
In the same pot saute the strips of onion until tender.
Add the pine nuts and stir.
Add the sumak and mix well.
Now open up each pita pocket and add the chicken and onion mixture.
Put the pita pockets on a pan for the oven.
Sprinkle some water over the pita so that it doesn't dry quickly.
Cover with aluminium foil.
Leave in the oven on 350 degree oven for 1/2 hour or until the chicken is cooked through.
