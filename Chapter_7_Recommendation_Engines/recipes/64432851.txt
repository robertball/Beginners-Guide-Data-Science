Description: 
This was created on a whim.  My significant other was looking to have me make my 1st Italian beef roast on the grill for sandwiches.  We had 1/2 of a mesquite pork loin from the previous weekend in the freezer.  I did my part by cooking the roast and left her on her own.  Lordy these are good. We kept these simple but I can envision them with chilies, other cheese combinations etc.  Have fun
