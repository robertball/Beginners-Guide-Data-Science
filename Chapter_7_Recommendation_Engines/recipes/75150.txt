Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup wheat germ
2/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups half-and-half cream
1 cup fresh blackberries
1 cup fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter muffin pan.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flours, wheat germ, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. In another bowl, whisk together half and half cream and eggs. Stir wet ingredients into dry, mixing just to combine. Fold in berries. Scoop batter into muffin pan cups. If there are any empty cups, fill those halfway with water.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until done.

Description: 
These are moist and sweet, and full of berries. My two children cannot get enough of them, and often bring me berries they have picked to make these muffins. The muffins are made with whole wheat flour and wheat germ, but the kids do not seem to notice.
