Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 1/2 pounds lamb or mutton breast chops, chopped into portions
2 tablespoons cake flour
1 large onion, chopped
2 1/4 pounds fresh tomatoes, chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
6 whole white peppercorns
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
1 cube beef bouillon cube
2 medium potatoes, quartered (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Dredge meat in flour, and cook in hot oil until well browned.
Stir in onions, and cook until onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Mix in tomatoes. Season with salt, black pepper, white peppercorns, bay leaves, brown sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and beef bouillon cube. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 1 1/4 hours.  Stir occasionally, making sure nothing sticks on the bottom of the pot.
Stir in the potatoes and cook for an additional 45 minutes, until the potatoes are done and the meat is tender.

Description: 
This is a traditional South African meal, and is good winter fare. Bredie is an old Cape name for a dish of meat and vegetables stewed together so that the flavors intermingle. The gravy is rich, thick and full-bodied, and is obtained by using meat with a fair amount of bone and fat, rolling it in flour and browning it before the vegetables are added. The flavor improves if left a day or two before eating. Nice with brown rice.
