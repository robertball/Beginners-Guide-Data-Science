Description: 
This salad is light, healthy, and surprisingly tasty.  People who normally turn their noses up at tofu will never notice it, as it looks like feta and takes on the flavors of all the other ingredients.  Good as a side dish, main vegetarian entree, and perfect as a potluck contribution.
