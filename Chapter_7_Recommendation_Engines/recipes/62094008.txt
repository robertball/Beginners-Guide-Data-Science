Ingredients:
Tempura vegetables:
*   Yellow Squash
*   Broccoli
*   Carrots
*   Cauliflower
*   Zucchini
*   Onions
*   Mushrooms
*   Asparagus
*   Red bell peppers
*   Yellow bell peppers
Batter ingredients:
1 c all-purpose flour
1 c rice flour
3 TB cornstarch
1 TB baking powder
1.5 tsp salt
3 egg whites, lightly beaten
1.5 cup ice water
For the meat:
~1 lb flank steak, cut into thin strips across the grain
~1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, also cut into thin strips
~ 1 lb whole shrimp, tails on (I recommend getting the larger ones, at least 20/lb or larger.  U-10's are OK when you can get them, but excessive -- and remember, they take longer to cook)
Marinade for the meats:
1/2 c dry white wine (or sake, if you have it)
1/2 c oyster sauce
1/2 c soy sauce
3 TB cornstarch
1 TB salt
1 TB sugar
1 tsp red pepper flakes
2 cloves garlic, minced
Dipping sauce for tempura (basic):
1/2 c soy sauce **and/or**
1/2 c oyster sauce
1/2 c mirin **or** 1/4 c rice vinegar
1 c water
You can also use purchased dipping sauces -- but playing with making your own is a great experience!

Directions:
Begin by cutting your vegetables.  Make them  of a size to be easily pierced (and subsequently eaten!) on a skewer or toothpick.  Make sure that after you wash your vegetables they are dry.  Arrange them on a platter and chill throughly.
Prepare the marinade for the meats:  Mix ingredients well in medium bowls. Marinate the meats separately for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.  Even though it's basically the same marinade, you can add and subtract certain spices and ingredients to make other ingredients stand out.  For example, you can eliminate the red pepper flakes for the shrimp's marinade, which makes the garlic more prominent.  It's up to you, but that's the basics.  And I have to admit, my family really, really likes garlic, so...
Prepare the dipping sauce: In a 1 qt saucepot, combine all ingredients and bring to a boil.  This sauce should be served warm.
Prepare the batter: Combine the dry ingredients well in a bowl and then add the egg whites and water.  Do not beat!  The batter should be a little lumpy and not perfectly smooth.
Heat oil to 375 degrees.  Present the oil in the center, surrounded by platters of vegetables and bowls of marinated meats.  Have bowls of batter and dipping sauce(s) on the table as well.  Dip the vegetables (and meats, if desired) in the batter and fry until golden in the oil.  Dip the fried vegetables and meats in the dipping sauce(s) and consume immediately.
Note:  You may want to "pre-skewer" the meats so that they're easier for guests to pick up.  If you do put your meats and vegetables on skewers ahead of time, do them individually (not like a kebab) and, if you're using bamboo skewers, soak the skewers in water for about 20 minutes before use so that they don't burn.

Description: 
Tempura is a wonderful, romantic way to enjoy a meal.  It's casual, yet not too casual; fun; and tasty.  It's also a great opportunity to make a really spectacular presentation.  I hope you enjoy this idea!
