Ingredients:
1 Tbls. Olive Oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 large carrot, peeled and diced
1 large zucchini, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 Tbls. tomato paste
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
One 15.5 oz. can chickpeas (preferably low-sodium), drained and rinsed
1 cup basil leaves, sliced into ribbons, plus more for garnish
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
Four 6 oz. skinless salmon fillets

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add the carrot, zucchini, and garlic and cook, stirring, until the carrots are firm-tender, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the tomato paste, stirring to incorporate completely.  Add the chicken broth and chickpeas and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, until the liquid thickens slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.
Remove the skillet from the heat, add 1 cup of the basil and 1/4 tsp. each of salt and pepper and stir to incorporate.  Cover to keep warm while you cook the salmon.
Preheat the broiler.  Season the salmon with the remaining 1/4 tsp. each of salt and pepper.  Broil the salmon for 8 to 10 minutes per inch thickness, turning once.
To serve, spoon 1 1/2 cups of the chickpea ragu into a shallow bowl or rimmed plate.  Top with a fillet of salmon and garnish with ribbons of basil.
