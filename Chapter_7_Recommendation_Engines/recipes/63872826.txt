Ingredients:
1 pound Ground Pork
1 pound Ground Veal
1 1/2 teaspoons Rubbed Sage
2 1/2 teaspoons Kosher Salt
1 teaspoon Ground Black Pepper
1 teaspoon Dried Marjoram
1 teaspoon Fennel Seed
1 teaspoon Crushed Red Pepper Flakes (more or less if you like)
1 pinch Ground Cloves
1 Tablespoon brown sugar
1 Tablespoon of Canola Oil
1 Tablespoon of Butter

Directions:
Mix all dry ingredients in a small bowl. By hand, mix the spices into the meat. Be careful not to overwork the meat.
Make sausage patties whatever size you desire. With your thumb, push the center of the patty down, to make an indentation, so your sausages don't become rounded on the top.
In a skillet on medium-high heat, add the oil and butter. Once the butter melts, add the sausages and cook for about 5 minutes per side or until done.

Description: 
I've always wanted to make my own sausage because store bought sausage weirds me out. I thought of all the spices I would image to make a tasty sausage and this is what I came up with. A winner recipe in my collection.
