2 pounds boneless beef ribs
4 McIntosh apples - cored, peeled, and cut into large chunks
2 cups apple juice
2 onions, sliced
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
5 cups water

Cut the ribs apart if necessary. Place the separated ribs, apples, apple juice, onions, apple cider vinegar, and water into a large soup pot, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook the ribs until tender, about 4 hours.

Description: 
This is a stove top cooking process for boneless ribs that I was forced to do when we had a propane shortage in our neighborhood one summer. This recipe is also great for slow cookers. Adjust water to fit into slow cooker.
