Ingredients:
2 tbs olive oil
2 large onions, peeled, halved and sliced into rings
6 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
1 ½ cups chicken stock
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with peppers
2 tbs jalapeno relish
2 tsp cumin powder
5 bay leaves
1 ½ cups white rice
Salt and pepper
2 good-quality frankfurters with herbs, sliced into rings and then halved
Olive oil and butter for frying

Directions:
Fry the onions in olive oil in a large pot on medium heat until they go soft and just begin to colour.
Add the garlic and fry for about 30 sec.
Stir in chicken stock, tomatoes, jalapeno relish, cumin powder, bay leaves, rice, and season with salt and pepper.
Cover the pot and simmer until rice is tender, about 30-40 minutes. Stir regularly to avoid the rice sticking to the bottom and stir almost continuously for the last five minutes or so.
While the rice is cooking, fry the sausage pieces in a pan in a mix of olive oil and butter.
Once the rice is ready, remove the bay leaves and add the sausages, stir and serve.

Description: 
I came up with this dish on a rainy autumn Sunday when I wanted something hearty and all the shops were closed. So this is a bit of a let’s-see-what’s-in-the-cupboard-dish :)
