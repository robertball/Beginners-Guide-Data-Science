Ingredients:
1 large box of vanilla instant pudding
1 large container of Cool Whip
Milk
Graham crackers (without cinnamon)
1 container of butter cream icing

Directions:
Mix the vanilla pudding according to directions but with 1/2 of the milk that it calls for. Mix this together with the cool whip.
In a 9x13 cake pan put down a layer of graham crackers then layer with the pudding/cool whip mixture.
Keep alternating until you end up with a final graham cracker layer. Top this with the butter cream icing. Refrigerate.
* This recipe is much better if it sits overnight so that the moisture from the pudding can soak into the graham crackers.
* This recipe can be made low-calorie with low-fat milk, fat-free pudding and fat-free Cool Whip!
* This recipe is also delicious with chocolate pudding and icing!!
