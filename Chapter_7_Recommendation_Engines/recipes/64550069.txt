Ingredients:
Sriracha salt for rim of mug, or as needed
ice cubes
1/4 teaspoon smoked salt
1 lime, juiced
2 dashes of bitters (Angostura is both vegan and gluten free)
1/8 tsp ground celery seed
1/8 tsp course ground black pepper
pinch of habanero powder
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste
1/2 teaspoon vegan and gluten free Worcestershire sauce
1 cup cold tomato juice cocktail (make sure it is vegan and gluten free), or as needed
1 cup cold gluten free, pale beer

Directions:
Dip the rim of a chilled, 1-pint mug into the Sriracha salt and fill the mug 1/4 way with ice cubes.
In a cocktail mixer, add a couple of ice cubes, the tomato cocktail, smoked salt, lime juice, bitters, celery seed, habanero powder, hot pepper sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Shake well. Pour the tomato cocktail mixture into the mug and top up the mug with beer. Stir gently. As you drink, you can keep topping up your mug with more beer.

Description: 
In my youth, a bartender in Mexico made me a Michelada when he saw how hungover I was.  I think he was an angel. It cured everything! I've adapted this recipe for gluten free and vegan diets to be able to enjoy it now with my new dietary restrictions . This has been adapted from Joe's Famous Michelada.
