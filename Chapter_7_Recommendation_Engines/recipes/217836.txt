Description: 
A Vietnamese friend taught me how to make this dish that originates from Laos and Cambodia.  If you can't find galangal, substitute fresh ginger and a squirt of lime juice. Pre-ground chicken, turkey or pork may be used instead of the chicken thigh meat. Serve with sticky rice or in lettuce cups.
