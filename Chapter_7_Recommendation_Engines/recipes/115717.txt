Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet
1 head cabbage, cored and coarsely chopped
6 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger Irish whiskey

Directions:
Place the beef brisket and contents of the spice packet into a pot and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook over low heat for about 2 hours. Add the cabbage and potatoes, and simmer over low heat for 2 more hours. Stir in the whiskey when it is almost done. Check the water level occasionally and replace as needed.

Description: 
A nice bowl of Lucky's corned beef and cabbage will bring you luck on St. Patrick's Day or any cold day. Serve in a big bowl with bread of your choice. I like Irish soda bread with it.
