Ingredients:
1 pound block of chocolate
2 pounds pecans
1 cup butter
14 oz condensed milk
1.25 cup brown sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
1 dash salt

Directions:
Put aluminum foil shiny side up and spray with PAM
line up pecans in groups of 2 big or 3 small pecans (I think she said 45 piles).
Cook the caramels: In a 2 quart glass Pyrex bowl, put all ingredients (butter through salt) in the bowl along with a short wooden spoon.
Cook 13 minutes in the microwave (stir really good 3 times during cooking) (this is on High on Mom's microwave).
Leave it sit for 3 minutes
Looks kinda lumpy. Use hand mixer to beat it until smooth.
Let it cool a while until  it is a bit thicker. It will run off the pecans. 1 spoonful on each clump.
The next day (or when the caramel and pecan piles are totally cooled) fold over the extra caramel (that ran off) down to the bottom of the piles.
Break up the chocolate (cut with a sharp knife and be careful not to cut yourself). Melt in microwave (level 5 30 seconds repeat until melted and stirred smooth)
Peel the caramels off the aluminum foil. Put them back with chocolate on the bottom, and chocolate on the top. Mom puts chocolate on the bottom (in addition to the top) to help keep them from sticking to each other when stacked.

Description: 
This is Ginny Howe's recipe (my Mom's) which is a Christmas tradition. 

Mom uses Real Milk Chocolate Coating by Ambrosia. Need a bit more than pound of chocolate.
Mom gets pecans from www.RenfroePecan.com in Pensacola -- Elaine's parents used to send her some every year, and now she orders them. She uses 3 pounds throughout the year (maybe uses about 2 pounds for turtles).
