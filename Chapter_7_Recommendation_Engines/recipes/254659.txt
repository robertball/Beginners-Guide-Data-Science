Ingredients:
1 tablespoon cracked black pepper
2 (8 ounce) kosher chuck steaks, cut 1-inch thick
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons low-sodium beef broth
2 tablespoons red wine
1 pound red Swiss chard, stems removed and leaves cut into 1/2-inch strips

Directions:
Press cracked pepper onto both sides of each steak.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add steak; cook until browned, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Remove skillet from heat.
Transfer steaks to a serving platter, reserving drippings in the skillet. Stir beef broth and red wine into the skillet, scraping up browned bits. Return to the heat and bring to a boil. Add chard; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted, about 5 minutes.
Cut steak into serving-size pieces. Serve with chard.

Description: 
Chuck is kosher equivalent of non-kosher beef top loin. A kosher ribeye is also possible but incredibly expensive. Kosher chuck can be found for 7 dollars a pound on special.
