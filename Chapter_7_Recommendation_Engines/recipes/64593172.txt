Ingredients:
2 mangoes, peeled and sliced in small cubes
2 peaches, peeled and sliced in small cubes
1/2 medium purple onion, minced
1/2 orange bell pepper, cut in small pieces
1/4 red bell pepper, cut in small pieces
4 Roma tomatoes, cut into small pieces
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 Tbsp lime juice
1/4 cup cilantro, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
Pinch of salt

Directions:
Mix everything together in a bowl.  If you like your salsa watery, leave the juice from the mangoes and peaches.  If you like your salsa a little more dry and chunky, drain the juice out.

Description: 
This wonderful salsa in tasty on grilled chicken, fish or just with tortilla chips.  It's very refreshing and you won't be able to stop eating it.  It tastes even better the second day.  It's a beautiful salsa, but unfortunately the photo function doesn't work on this site currently.   You'll just have to take my word for it!
