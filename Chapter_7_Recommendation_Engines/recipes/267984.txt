Ingredients:
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 tablespoon garlic, minced
1/4 cup full-fat coconut milk
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon ranch dressing mix
1/2 cup hot sauce
1/4 cup salted butter
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup nutritional yeast

For Dipping:

1 red bell peppers, cut into strips
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into strips
1 fresh seeded cucumber, cut into strips

Directions:
Place chicken breasts in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Add onion, celery, garlic, coconut milk, mayonnaise, ranch dressing mix, hot sauce, butter, and apple cider vinegar. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 20 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Shred chicken using 2 forks.
Select saute setting and stir in 1/4 cup nutritional yeast. Simmer for 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast.
Serve with sliced celery, red and yellow bell peppers, and cucumbers for dipping.

Description: 
This Buffalo ranch chicken dip is a little more 'juicy' than a traditional dip with cheese, but the flavor is rich and layered! If you like, finish in an oven-safe dish to thicken and get crispy edges.
