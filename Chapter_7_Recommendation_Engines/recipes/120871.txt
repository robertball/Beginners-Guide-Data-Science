Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
3/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
2 eggs
3 tablespoons honey
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric
3 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add 1 egg, honey, mustard, butter, salt, turmeric if desired and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; shape into a loaf. Place in a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Beat remaining egg; brush over top. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-17 minutes. Cover with foil. Bake 25 minutes longer or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
Rave reviews will come your way when you present this golden bread. For a flavorful variation, I sometimes add 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano and thyme to the dough.
