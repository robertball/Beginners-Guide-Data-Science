Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray baking sheet with cooking spray and set aside.
Unroll and separate biscuit dough. Pat each biscuit in to 1/4-inch thick rounds. Place on prepared baking sheet. Make "dimples" in each round with fingertips.
In a small bowl, combine olive oil, garlic, and Italian seasoning. Using a pastry brush, brush tops with olive oil mixture. Place 2 artichoke quarters on each round and about 5 grape tomatoes halves and top with 2 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese
Bake in oven for 13 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
