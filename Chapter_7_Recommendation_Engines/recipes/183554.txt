Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1/4 cup butter
1 onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup minced green onion
1 bunch fresh parsley, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped garlic
5 cups chicken broth
1 (1 pound) package smoked sausage, quartered lengthwise and sliced
2 cups uncooked white rice

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from pot and set aside.
Melt the butter in the large pot. Cook the onion, green onion, and parsley in the butter until the onions begin to soften, 4 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken broth, cooked chicken, sausage, and rice; bring to a boil for 2 minutes and then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for 1 hour. Do not remove cover or stir while simmering. Serve hot.

Description: 
Over the years my family has made this dish. I've always known it as jambalaya, but years ago found out it wasn't the traditional jambalaya served in a spicy or zesty tomato-based dish. This is my family's twist on it. We love it very much. It's our comfort food. I've made quicker adjustments on my family's recipe for a faster prep time. And this recipe is scaled down. It's normally twice this size for our huge family.
