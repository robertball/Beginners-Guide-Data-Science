Ingredients:
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon honey
1/2 cup olive oil
1 pound pasta- I've used orzo, rotini, or fusilli- but any small shape will work
1 pint cherry tomatoes
1 bunch green onions
1 cup chopped fresh basil (HAS TO BE FRESH, not dried)
1 7oz container feta, chopped into cubes
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, and honey. Set aside.
Cook pasta in salted water until al dente is reached. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop cooking.
In a large bowl, combine pasta, tomatoes, green onions, feta, and dressing and toss to combine.
