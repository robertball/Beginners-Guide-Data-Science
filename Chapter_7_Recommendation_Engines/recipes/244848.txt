Ingredients:
1 head green cabbage, cut into bite-size pieces
1 pound ground beef
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups water
1 cup white rice
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup (such as Campbell's®)
1 (32 ounce) container crushed tomatoes (such as Hunt's®)

Directions:
Boil cabbage in a stockpot until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain well.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix salt, parsley, onion powder, and black pepper into ground beef.
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir tomato soup and crushed tomatoes together in a bowl.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine cabbage, seasoned ground beef, rice, and tomato mixture together in a bowl; transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
Grew up eating golumpki. Yes I'm mostly Polish, but always wanted more sauce on them and didn't like the 'mushiness' of the burger inside. This is the version I came up with and hope you enjoy!
