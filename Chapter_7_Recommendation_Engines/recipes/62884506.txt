Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups of grilled chicken breast cut into small pieces
1 cup of sliced red grapes
1 cup of diced red apple
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 to 3/4 cup of mayonnaise
1 tablespoon of lemon juice (juice of one lemon)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a medium sized bowl add diced apple, and one tablespoon of lemon juice.  Stir lemon juice into apples coating them well.  This will help keep the apples from turning brown.  Add chicken, sliced grapes, diced celery, and pecans.  Mix well until everything is mixed through.  Add 1/2 cup mayonnaise, if the mixture is too dry you can add another 1/4 cup of mayonnaise.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Allow flavors to marry in a covered bowl in the refrigerator for about 1 hour before serving.
