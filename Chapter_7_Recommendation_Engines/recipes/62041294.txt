Description: 
To have this ready to go for a party, I
have mixed all the fruit juice 
concentrates and fruit in a large
plastic container and then put it in
the freezer.  Then, when I'm ready to
serve, I just pop out the frozen 
fruit/juice chunk into the punch bowl 
and pour the ginger ale over it,
breaking it up a bit to mix.
