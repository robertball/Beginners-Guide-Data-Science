Ingredients:
1-1/4 cups whipping cream (35%)
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/4 cup icing sugar
4 tsp cocoa powder
42 vanilla wafer cookies

Directions:
In large bowl, beat cream with vanilla until thickened. In separate bowl, add icing sugar; sift in cocoa powder, whisking to combine. Sprinkle cocoa mixture over cream mixture; beat until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.
Spoon 1 tsp cream mixture over bottom of 1 cookie. Sandwich with another cookie, top side down; press gently to squeeze cream to edge. Repeat layers to make a 6-cookie stack; top stack with 1 tsp cream mixture and 1 more cookie, top side up. Lay stack horizontally on waxed or parchment paperâ€“lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining cookies to make 5 more stacks.
Spread remaining cream mixture by rounded 2 tbsp over top and sides of each stack. Using tines of fork, make shallow ridges in cream to resemble bark. Refrigerate until cream is slightly set, about 2 hours. Cover loosely with plastic wrap; refrigerate until cookies are soft, about 24 hours.
