Image:

Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 zucchini, diced
1 pound sausage
1 onion, diced
1 tablespoon melted butter
1 (6 ounce) package dry bread stuffing mix, divided
2 eggs
1/4 cup water, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x11-inch casserole pan with cooking spray.
Place zucchini in a pot with 1/4 cup water. Cover and bring to a boil. Boil until almost tender but still firm, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and return zucchini to the pot.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook sausage, breaking it up into small pieces, until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease; remove sausage from the skillet. Cook and stir onion in the same skillet until just translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.
Mix butter into 1/2 of the stuffing mix. Add to the zucchini mixture and mix well.
Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add a small amount of the hot sausage to the eggs; stir well. Add remaining sausage, onion, and zucchini-stuffing mixture. Pour filling into the prepared pan.
Mix remaining stuffing together with 1/4 cup water to get a spreadable consistency. Add more water if too dry. Spread mixture over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Incredibly rich and flavorful zucchini casserole. I developed this recipe in a quest for a meal that has plenty of flavor, is relatively low in calories, and can be eaten by my son, who has a milk allergy.
