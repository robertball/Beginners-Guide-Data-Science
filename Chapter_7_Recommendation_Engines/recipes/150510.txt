1 (14 ounce) can EAGLE BRAND® Sweetened Condensed Milk
3/4 cup whipping cream, unwhipped
3/4 cup evaporated milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Prepare cake mix as directed or warm prepared cake.
Combine the 3 milks and extract. Remove 1/2 cup mixture to a smaller bowl; whisk in cocoa powder and cinnamon until smooth. Slowly whisk chocolate mixture back into larger milk mixture.
Remove baked cake from oven. Cool slightly and transfer to a larger baking pan or deep serving dish. Using a fork, poke holes liberally in top and sides of cake. While cake is still warm, pour half the milk mixture overtop. Wait one minute and pour remainder over cake.
Cover and chill 1 hour. Keep extra sauce on the table to spoon over top. Garnish as desired. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
