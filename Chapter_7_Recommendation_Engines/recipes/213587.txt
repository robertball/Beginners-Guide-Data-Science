Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 (1 ounce) envelopes instant hot chocolate mix
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg, beaten
2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 cup flaked coconut
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup milk, or as needed
2 tablespoons instant vanilla pudding mix
2 cups confectioners' sugar
4 (1 ounce) squares milk chocolate
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Grease a 9x9-inch square pan. Melt 1/2 cup butter in a saucepan over low heat, and stir in cocoa mix, vanilla extract, and egg. Whisk together until the mixture thickens, about 1 minute (do not boil); remove from heat and stir in graham cracker crumbs, 1 cup coconut, and walnuts. Mix well, and press into the bottom of the prepared pan. Chill the crust for about 1 hour.
Place the cream cheese into a mixing bowl, and beat with an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy. Beat in the milk, vanilla pudding mix, and confectioners' sugar to make a spreadable, creamy mixture. If mixture is too stiff to spread easily, add more milk, 1/2 teaspoon at a time. Spread the filling in an even layer over the crust, and return to refrigerator. Chill until firm, about 1 hour.
Melt milk chocolate and 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan over very low heat, stirring constantly until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Spread the topping evenly over the vanilla layer, and refrigerate about 1/2 hour, until the topping is firm but not hard. Cut into bars, then return to refrigerator to finish chilling, at least 1/2 hour more. Serve cold.
