Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 1/2 cups white sugar
1 1/8 cups vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 tablespoons poppy seeds
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
3 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup Lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons butter, melted

Directions:
Beat together the eggs, 2 1/2 cups white sugar and vegetable oil.  Add in milk, salt, baking powder, poppy seeds, vanilla, almond flavoring, and flour.  Mix well.
Bake in paper lined muffin cups (filled 3/4 full or 3 small greased loaf pans) at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)  for 30 minutes for Texas size muffins.  The tops should be browned and a toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean.
Remove muffins as soon as you can while still warm/hot and dunk tops into glaze.  Turn right side up and cool on a cookie rack.
To Make Glaze:  In a saucepan over low heat, combine 3/4 cup sugar, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and 2 teaspoons melted butter.  Warm in pan until the sugar is dissolved.   Brush muffin tops with glaze when cooled to room temperature.
