Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta
1 (12 ounce) bag broccoli florets, cut into bite-size pieces
¼ cup olive oil
4 teaspoons minced garlic
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
½ cup finely shredded Romano cheese
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain and return to pot.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir garlic and red pepper flakes until garlic is fragrant, 1 to 3 minutes. Add garlic mixture and broccoli to linguine; gently toss to coat. Add Romano cheese, parsley, black pepper, and salt; toss to combine.
