Ingredients:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 medium green bell pepper
1/2 pound lean ground beef
2 slices Cheddar cheese
2 hamburger buns, split
2 slices tomato
2 slices onion
2 lettuce leaves

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, mustard, cumin, lemon juice, salt and pepper; cover and refrigerate until serving.
Grill green pepper, covered, over medium heat until skin blisters, about 6 minutes. With tongs, rotate pepper a quarter turn. Grill and rotate until all sides are blackened. Immediately place pepper in a bowl; cover and let stand for 15-20 minutes.
Meanwhile, shape beef into two patties. Grill, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 7-9 minutes on each side or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F.
Peel off and discard charred skin from green pepper; remove stem and seeds. Cut pepper in half. Top each patty with green pepper and cheese; grill 1 minute longer or until cheese is melted.
Grill buns, cut side down, for 1-2 minutes or until toasted. Spread bun bottoms with mayonnaise mixture; top with burgers, tomato, onion and lettuce. Replace bun tops.

My husband requests these burgers weekly and loves every bite, notes Tina Green of Albany, Oregon. I usually make extra dressing and keep it in the refrigerator to use on beef sandwiches or wraps.
