Ingredients:
A little olive oil (for cooking the mushrooms)
1 (10 oz) package fresh baby spinach (or frozen, thawed and drained well)
4-5 eggs
1 cup shredded cheese of your choice (I use mozzarella or the Italian Blend)
1 (8 oz package) mini-bella mushrooms, chopped
1-2 Tbsp, milk, water or cream
Salt and Pepper, to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375F
Heat a little oil in a large skillet.
Saute the mushrooms until they are soft, about 5-6 minutes. Set Aside.
Place the spinach in a deep pan or in the skillet that you used for the mushrooms. Add 1/4 cup water.
Using medium heat, cook the spinach just until wilted, about 3-4 mins.
Drain the excess water really well (especially if you decide to use frozen spinach instead).
In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs until combined.
Add the cooked mushrooms, spinach, cheeses and water/milk  to the eggs.
Mix well.
Season to taste.
Divide evenly among the muffin cups.
Bake for about 20-23 minutes, or until it's well set and a tester/toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Leave in the pan for a few minutes or just until it's cool enough to handle.
