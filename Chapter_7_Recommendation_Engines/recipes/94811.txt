Ingredients:
4 cups heavy cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
16 egg yolks
1/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup canned pumpkin puree
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Heat the cream and vanilla in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Whisk together the egg yolks, brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, cloves, and pumpkin in a bowl. Slowly pour 1 cup of the cream mixture into the egg mixture, stirring continually. Then pour the entire egg mixture into the saucepan; whisk briskly for 1 minute.  Pour the mixture into ramekins. Arrange ramekins on a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until set, about 15 minutes; refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours.
Before serving, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of sugar over the top of each creme brulee. Use a kitchen torch or your oven's broiler to caramelize the sugar. It may take 2 to 3 minutes in the broiler. Serve immediately.
