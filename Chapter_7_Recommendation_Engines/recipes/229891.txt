4 cups white sugar
1 cup apple cider vinegar

Description: 
This is a twist on an old hand-me-down recipe my mother came up with; it's a family favorite! It doesn't last around momma's house! I was so happy when she gave me a copy of it to take with me when I moved across the country, and I feel like its too good and too easy not to share! Tastes great on toast, biscuits, and (my favorite) waffles!
