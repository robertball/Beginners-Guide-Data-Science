Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
1 cup brown sugar
½ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
1  egg
1  egg yolk
2 tablespoons natural peanut butter (such as Natural Jif®)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
53  pretzel sticks, crushed
3 tablespoons chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix 2 cups and 2 tablespoons flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat brown sugar and butter together in a separate bowl until smooth and creamy; add egg, egg yolk, peanut butter, and vanilla extract and beat until smooth. Slowly pour flour mixture into sugar mixture and stir just until dough is combined; fold in pretzels and chocolate-hazelnut spread.
Drop dough onto a baking sheet using 2 spoons.
Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes; rotate baking sheet and continue baking until cookies are fully cooked and still soft in the middle, about 7 minutes more. Cool cookies on baking sheet for about 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

Description: 
This is an easy base recipe. Feel free to mix up the flavors! Leave out the peanut butter for any allergies. Instead of Nutella® and pretzels, try white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts.
