Ingredients:
1 Large Onion, chopped
6 to 8 Cloves of Garlic, or minced from a jar
3 Carrots, grated
2 Bell Peppers (any color) chopped
4 Stalks Celery finally chopped
3 Tbsp. Olive oil
1 lb Ground Beef
1 lb Your favorite Sausage
1 10 oz can Tomatoe Paste
6 ot 7 cans (15 oz) of Diced or Stewed Tomatios
(If using the large cans, use 3 or 4)
1/2 Cup of beef stock
1 cup of Wine (optional)
2 teasp. garlic salt
1 teasp. pepper
2 teasp. Basel
2 teasp. Oregano
2 teasp. Marjoram
Dash or two of Rosemary
(or instead of the spices, add 2 Tbsp. Italian Seasoning)
Mushrooms if you like

Directions:
In a large pot saute the chopped and grated vegies in the olive oil 8 to 10 minutes. I push the vegies to the side and add the Ground Beef and Sausage.  Once the meat starts browning I stirr it all together and cook until the meat is done.
Add all remaining ingredients except mushrooms and simmer with a lid on for a few hours.  I skim the fat off the top as it simmers.
If you like mushrooms, add them the last hour or so.
