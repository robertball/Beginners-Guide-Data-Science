Ingredients:
Rice:
3 cups water
1 cup long-grain brown rice
1/2 teaspoon salt
Dressing:
1 lime, juiced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon dried Thai basil
1 teaspoon minced hot chile pepper
Vegetables:
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1/2 (8 ounce) package snow peas
1 cup cooked chickpeas, drained
1/2 (16 ounce) package firm tofu, cut into strips
16 baby corn, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 cup grated carrots
1 small green bell pepper, diced
2 green onions, cut on the diagonal
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Combine water, brown rice, and salt in a pressure cooker. Close and secure the lid; bring to high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. Cook for 10 minutes. Release pressure naturally according to manufacturer's instructions. Drain any remaining water and transfer rice to a large bowl.
Whisk lime juice, olive oil, sesame oil, Thai basil, and chile pepper in a small bowl to make dressing.
Toast sesame seeds in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Cook and stir snow peas in the same skillet until bright green, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
Arrange snow peas, chickpeas, tofu, baby corn, carrots, and green bell pepper over the brown rice. Drizzle dressing over the entire bowl; toss to mix. Sprinkle toasted sesame seeds on top. Garnish with green onions and cilantro.
