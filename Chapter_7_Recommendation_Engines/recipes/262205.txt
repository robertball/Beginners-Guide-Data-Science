Ingredients:
1 cup warm milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup fine white sugar
1 medium egg
2 teaspoons instant yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
vegetable oil for deep frying

Directions:
Combine milk, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, sugar, egg, instant yeast, salt, and cardamom in a large bowl. Mix in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough comes together and is easily handled. Knead dough on a flat work surface until no longer sticky.
Put dough back in the bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm area until doubled, about 1 hour.
Press dough down gently. Knead it briefly and divide it into 4 portions. Roll each portion into a ball; keep covered with a cloth to prevent them from drying out.
Roll 1 ball into a 1/3-inch-thick circle on a floured work surface. Cut into 4 triangles using a pizza cutter. Repeat with remaining balls of dough, keeping other dough covered.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan over medium heat. Fry dough triangles 3 or 4 at a time, without overcrowding, until puffed like balloons, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn and continue frying until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes more. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining dough.

Description: 
These amazingly soft triangle-shaped donuts are very famous in East Africa where I come from. They are excellent with a cup of tea or coffee. The dash of cardamom adds an authentic taste which makes it different from regular donuts. You can serve it with either honey or jam. Could be also served with curry - that is how we like it...
