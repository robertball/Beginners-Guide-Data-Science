Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter (1 stick)
2 cups sugar
1/4 cup cocoa
1/2 cup milk
3 cups oatmeal
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 tsp. vanilla
1 1/2 cups mini marshmallows
Dinosaur Sprinkles (or your favorite sprinkles

Directions:
1.  Stir the butter, sugar, cocoa, and milk together in a saucepan, and cook on medium heat until it boils.  Boil for about 3 minutes.
2.  Remove from heat and add the oats, peanut butter, and vanilla.  Stir until thoroughly mixed. Let it rest for a few minutes for it to cool just slightly and then stir in the marshmallows. If you add them with everything else before letting them sit they will just melt
3.  Drop by spoonful onto waxed paper, add the sprinkles and allow the cookies to cool and harden slightly, which takes about 20 minutes.
