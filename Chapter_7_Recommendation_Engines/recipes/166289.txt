Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil
2 onions, chopped
4 cloves chopped garlic
2 pounds ground beef
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
6 eggs
1 (15.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, with liquid
1 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 cups red wine
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onions and garlic, and cook until the onions have caramelized to a deep, golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir frequently as the onions cook. Meanwhile, place the ground beef, celery, bell pepper, eggs, tomatoes, and parsley into a mixing bowl; mix until evenly combined.
Add the meat mixture into the caramelized onions, and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes. Stir in the red wine and red pepper flakes. Continue simmering, covered, until the liquid evaporates, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is an authentic Brazilian ground beef and vegetable recipe which I tweaked to my family's liking. Who says ground beef has to be boring?! Serve over hot white rice.
