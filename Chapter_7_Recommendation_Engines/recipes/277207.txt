Ingredients:
5 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon minced garlic
5 boneless pork chops
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to bubble, being careful not to burn. Stir in minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add pork chops and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a large baking dish, leaving pan drippings in the skillet.
Bake chops in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, add sour cream to the skillet and whisk together with the pan drippings until smooth. Add canned soup and whisk until incorporated.
Remove chops from the oven and pour sour cream-soup mixture over top. Return to the oven and bake until chops are no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
