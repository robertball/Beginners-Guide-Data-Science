Ingredients:
3 slices bacon
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon garlic, minced
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
3 tomatoes - peeled, seeded and chopped
5 artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1/4 cup chopped kalamata olives
1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and drained
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups uncooked rigatoni pasta
2 ounces crumbled feta cheese, for topping
1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain on paper towels, and crumble into large pieces.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the rigatoni pasta and cook until al dente, about 13 minutes. Drain, and place pasta into a large bowl.
Place olive oil in another skillet, and heat over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Mix in the bacon, red pepper flakes, tomatoes, artichokes, olives, and capers. Cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Add bacon-vegetable mixture to pasta, and toss until evenly mixed. Divide between two serving plates. Sprinkle with feta cheese, and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately.

Description: 
A combination of Puttanesca and Arrabbiata sauces, plus a few added ingredients, this dish makes a great main course. It's also fun to experiment with this recipe. I used rigatoni, but any pasta would work well.
