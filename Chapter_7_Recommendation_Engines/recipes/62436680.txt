Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 tsp salt (scant)
1 tsp sugar
1 cup cold butter (2 sticks cut into small pieces0
1/3 to 1/2 cup ice water

Directions:
Put the flour, salt and sugar into a food processor and pulse a few times to mix.
Add the butter pieces to flour mixture, and process about 10 seconds until mixture is consistency of coarse meal.
With the food processor running, slowly add ice water in a thin stream just until the dough holds together. Do not process the dough for more than half a minute.
Turn dough out and wrap securely in a plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour before rolling out. Makes enough pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie. May be frozen for 3 months.
