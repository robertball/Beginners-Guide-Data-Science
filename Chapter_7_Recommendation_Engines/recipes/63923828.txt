Ingredients:
2 1/4 teaspoon (or 1 packet) instant dry active yeast
1 cup warm water (not hot!)
1/2 tablespoon sugar
2 1/2 - 3 cups bread flour, or as needed
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Add the water, yeast, sugar, and a 1/2 cup of the flour into a mixing bowl. Stir well and let sit for 20 minutes. It will get bubbly as the yeast activates.
Add olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of the flour, and mix with a wooden spoon until it's together enough to turn out on to a lightly floured work surface to knead.
Knead for about 10 minutes, while adding more flour a little at a time, to produce a soft, elastic and slightly sticky dough. Do not add too much flour, just enough to keep it from sticking to the work surface as you knead.
Form the dough into a ball and place in a large oiled bowl. Drizzle a few drops of oil and coat the top of dough to prevent the surface from becoming dry.
Cover with a kitchen towel and place in a warm spot for 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size.
Punch down the dough and if desired, divide for smaller pizzas, and place in large zip lock plastic bag(s) and refrigerate over night for a final rising.
When ready to use, remove from fridge, and let the dough come up to room temperature before using. The dough can also be frozen for longer storage.
