1/2 tsp paprika
2 tbsp vegetable oil

Grate zest from two lemons and set aside. Sprinkle juice of one of the seated lemons over chicken breasts.
Mix flour, salt, and paprika in gallon-sized plastic bag. Shake one breast at a time on flour mixture, remove and shake off excess flour.
Heat oil in large frying pan or skillet over high heat. Add the chicken and fry until lightly browned on both sides, about 3-5 minutes a side.
