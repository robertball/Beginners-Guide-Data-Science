Ingredients:
1 Bag frozen hash browns
1 8 oz pkg cream cheese, softened
1 envelope dry ranch dressing
1 can condensed cream of potato soup
1 small jar pimento

1 1/2 cups sharp cheddar cheese
1 lb bacon, cooked and crumbled (save 1/2 cup for topping)

Directions:
Put potatoes in crock pot. Mix remaining ingredients in a bowl and add to potatoes.  Stir well.  Cook on low 5-6 hours.  Stir before serving and top with reserved crumbled bacon.  You can double this recipe if you have a larger crockpot.  Also, you could substitute ham for the bacon.
