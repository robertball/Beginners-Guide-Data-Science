Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1/3 cup brown rice
1 1/2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins, cubed
1 large onion, diced
1 1/2 cups diced carrot
1 1/2 cups diced celery
1 cup frozen corn kernels
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup half-and-half
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup frozen peas

Directions:
Stir together broth and brown rice in a multi-functional pressure cooker until rice is moistened. Add chicken, onion, carrot, celery, corn, garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasoning, thyme, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the lid.
Select high pressure and set timer for 18 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure naturally, about 10 minutes. Carefully release remaining pressure using the quick-release method. Remove lid.
Stir together half-and-half and cornstarch in a small bowl. Add to cooker, along with peas, and stir. Select Saute function; cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes.
