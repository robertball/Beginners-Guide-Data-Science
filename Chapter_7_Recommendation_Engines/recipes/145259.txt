Ingredients:
1/2 pound smoked sausage, thinly sliced
1 cup diced cooked ham
1/2 pound sliced bacon, diced
1 onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
3 cups chopped fresh tomato
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
4 cups water
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢)
1 cup yellow stone-ground grits
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add sausage, ham and bacon; cook and stir until browned. Remove the meat from the pan and set aside. Reserve 2 tablespoons of grease in the pan.
Return the pan to medium heat and add the onion, bell pepper, tomatoes and garlic powder. Cook and stir until onion is tender. Pour in the water and season with Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt and hot pepper sauce; bring to a boil.
Gradually stir in the grits, cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture is thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Return the meat to the pot and stir in cheese. Heat through until cheese is melted.

Description: 
What's more Southern than grits? My own version of a dish that is a house specialty at a restaurant in the Florida Panhandle. I've tweaked the original recipe, and I think this version is even better than the original! You can use either yellow or white grits, but the yellow ones make a more attractive presentation.
