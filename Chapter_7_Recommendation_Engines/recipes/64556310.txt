Ingredients:
3 Tablespoons Margarine
8oz 2% shredded sharp cheddar cheese
2oz shredded parmesan cheese
1/2 pound penne pasta
Pinch cayenne pepper, or more for your liking
Salt
2/3 cup 2% milk

Directions:
Cook pasta to desired tenderness
Pre-Heat oven to 375 F
Combine pasta, most of the cheese, most of the milk, and most of the margarine,  seasonings to desired taste. Put it in a 9x13" pan (I used parchment paper instead of butter on the bottom)
Dot the top of the mixture with remaining butter, cheese,  and milk.
Cover and bake for 40 minutes, uncover and increase temperature to 400 F for another 15 minutes to get the top crusty.
Allow to cool, and enjoy
