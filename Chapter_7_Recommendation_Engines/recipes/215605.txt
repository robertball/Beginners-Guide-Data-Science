Ingredients:
1 (1.5 pound) head cauliflower, separated into large florets
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup ProgressoÂ® lemon pepper Panko crispy bread crumbs

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Butter a 10x8-inch oval baking dish or a dish of equivalent size.
Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the cauliflower, and boil until slightly softened but still retaining some crispness, about 3 minutes. Drain well, and then slice them lengthwise so the stems are about 1/4 inch thick.
Arrange the slices, overlapping them tightly, in the prepared baking dish. Season with salt and several grinds of black pepper; dot with thin slices of the butter. Sprinkle with the cheese and bread crumbs.
Bake uncovered until lightly browned on top, about 30 minutes. Serve hot.
