Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1 tablespoon freshly minced garlic
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1  red chile pepper, seeded and diced
1 pound mild Italian chicken sausage, casings removed
3 cups water, or more as needed
2 cups unsalted chicken stock
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk
1 large sweet potato, cubed
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (14.5 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes, drained
1 cup red lentils, rinsed
2 tablespoons tomato paste

1 ½ teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
½ teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in onion and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, and chile; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add sausage and cook, stirring constantly, until broken up and browned, about 5 minutes.
Pour water, chicken stock, and coconut milk into the pot. Add sweet potato, black beans, diced tomatoes, red lentils, tomato paste, and bay leaves, stirring after each addition. Season with salt, cumin, coriander, paprika, cinnamon, and red pepper flakes.
Bring soup to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until sweet potato and lentils are soft, 30 to 40 minutes. Add more water if soup gets too thick.
