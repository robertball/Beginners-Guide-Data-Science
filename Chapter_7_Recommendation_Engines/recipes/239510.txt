Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter, cut into small chunks
2 (14 ounce) packages dry stuffing mix (such as Stove TopÂ®)
6 boneless center-cut pork chops
2 (15 ounce) cans Italian-style stewed tomatoes
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Arrange butter into the bottom of a cast iron Dutch oven. Spread dry stuffing mix over the butter to cover the bottom of the pot. Place pork chops onto the layer of stuffing mix. Pour tomatoes over the pork chops.
Bake until chops are slightly pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Season with salt and pepper.
