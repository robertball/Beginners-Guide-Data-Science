Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/3 cup brown sugar
3 1/2 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
1 banana, mashed
1 egg
2 tablespoons honey
1 cup self-rising flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Spray a small fluted tube pan with cooking spray.
Beat sugar and butter together together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Combine banana, egg, and honey in a separate bowl. Whisk banana mixture into butter mixture until smooth.
Sift flour, cinnamon, and salt into the combined banana-butter mixture. Mix batter until smooth. Transfer to the prepared pan; level the surface using the back of a spoon.
Place the cake pan in the air fryer basket. Slide the basket into the air fryer and set the timer for 30 minutes. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
