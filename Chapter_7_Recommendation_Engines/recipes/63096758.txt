Ingredients:
2 pounds ground turkey
1(10 fluid ounce) bottle steak sauce divided
2 tablespoons fajita seasoning
2 tablespoons chopped onion
8 slices American cheese, divided
2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chiles, drained
1 (4 ounce) can mushroom pieces, drained
dash of cayenne

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the ground turkey, 1/4 cup of the steak sauce, fajita seasoning, and chopped onion until well blended. Form the mixture into 8 patties. Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat. Lightly oil grate.
Place patties on the grill, and let them brown on both sides. Once they begin to brown, brush the tops with remaining steak sauce. Continue to grill for about 30 minutes, basting frequently with steak sauce, until meat is no longer pink, and the juices run clear. When the meat is ready to come off the grill, place slices of cheese over the tops of the patties. Serve on buns, or just by themselves.
