Ingredients:
1 cup softened butter
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
1 1/4 cups almond flour
1 cup coconut flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chocolate chips, or to taste
1/4 cup rolled oats (optional)
1/4 cup shredded coconut

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Combine butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add vanilla extract. Beat in eggs one at a time.
Combine almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Mix into the creamed butter mixture until just combined. Add chocolate chips, oats, and coconut; stir again just until combined.
Scoop cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
