Ingredients:
2/3 cup white rice flour
2/3 cup oat flour
1/3 cup tapioca starch
1/3 cup flax seed meal
1/3 cup oatmeal
1/3 cup potato starch
2 tablespoons potato starch
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 cups milk
2 eggs, beaten
1/3 cup applesauce
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine white rice flour, oat flour, tapioca starch, flax seed meal, oatmeal, 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons potato starch, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda in a large bowl.
Mix milk, eggs, applesauce, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the milk mixture. Stir batter until liquids are fully incorporated.
Heat a skillet over medium heat and lightly spray with cooking spray. Ladle the batter onto the pan using a 1/3-cup measuring cup. Cook until edges of pancake begin to dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is browned, about 2 minutes more.

Description: 
These are very tender and filling pancakes, excellent with maple syrup. No butter or oil is needed! They don't even need xanthan gum, which lowers the cost.
