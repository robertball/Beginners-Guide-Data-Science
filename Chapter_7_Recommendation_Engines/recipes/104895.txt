Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into thin strips
½  onion, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon flour
¼ cup fresh lime juice, or to taste
4 ½ cups baby spinach leaves

Directions:
Place chicken, onions, garlic, salt, pepper, and flour in a resealable bag.  Stir in the lime juice.  Allow to sit for a few minutes to marinate.
Spray a non-stick frying pan with olive oil cooking spray and place over medium heat.  Pour in the entire contents of the bag and cook until the onion has softened (there is no need to brown).  Add additional lime juice to taste.  Serve over spinach.

Description: 
This is a quick dish that's great for summer. I came up with it on a Thursday after school when Mom asked me to get dinner ready before she got home. Nice and light.
