Ingredients:
6 Center cut boneless pork chops, pounded to about ¾” to 1”
2 cups Seasoned bread crumbs
1 cup Grated Parmesan cheese
1 tbsp each: Garlic salt and onion powder
2 tsps	Dried parsley
2 large Eggs
4 tbsps Olive oil
2 tbsps	Minced garlic
4 cups	Prepared cornbread stuffing
2 tbsps each Shredded Parmesan  and Mozzarella cheeses mixed for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Mix eggs together in a small bowl and set aside.
In a large plastic resealable bag, add bread crumbs, cheese, and spices.  Seal and shake to mix.
Dredge 1 pork chop at a time through egg mixture and then drop into plastic bag, seal and shake to coat thoroughly.  Repeat with remaining 5 chops.
In a large skillet, heat olive oil  and minced garlic over medium high heat and in 2 batches; brown both sides of chop about 4 minutes per side.
In a large glass baking dish, place cornbread stuffing in an even layer, and place pork chops on top.
Sprinkle each chop with shredded cheese mix, cover loosely with foil and bake 25-30 minutes, or until chops are cooked through.
Remove foil and place under broiler about 1 minute to brown cheese and serve immediately.
