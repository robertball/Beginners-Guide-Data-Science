Description: 
The finest of all cold soups--and the very best thing invented in the USA! This wonderful, smooth soup can be garnished with a very few finely chopped chives.  The chef at the Algonquin (where the soup originated) now sprinkles a very little curry powder, and provided it is a VERY little this can be very pleasant. Enjoy.
