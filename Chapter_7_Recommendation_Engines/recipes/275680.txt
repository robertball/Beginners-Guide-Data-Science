Ingredients:
2 ounces cream cheese
2 tablespoons powdered sugar
4 ounces pumpkin puree
1 3/4 cups vanilla wafer crumbs
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 (1 ounce) squares white chocolate
2 teaspoons vanilla wafer crumbs, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Combine cream cheese and powdered sugar in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add pumpkin puree; beat until combined. Add 1 3/4 cups wafer crumbs, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon; beat until everything is combined and the mixture is soft and thick, about 2 minutes.
Roll pumpkin mixture into teaspoon-sized balls and place onto the prepared baking sheets.
Place white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high power until chocolate is completely melted and smooth, about 1 minute.
Dip each truffle into the melted chocolate using 2 forks, and return to the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining truffles. Sprinkle truffles with wafer crumbs and cinnamon and store in the refrigerator until chocolate has completely set, at least 1 hour.
