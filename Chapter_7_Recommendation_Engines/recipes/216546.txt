ice cubes
2 fluid ounces golden rum
1 fluid ounce unsweetened pineapple juice
1/4 teaspoon grenadine
1/4 teaspoon cherry liqueur
maraschino cherry for garnish

Directions:
Chill a martini glass in the freezer. Add ice to a cocktail shaker. Pour in rum, juice, grenadine, and maraschino liqueur. Shake well, then strain into chilled glass, and garnish with a cherry.

Submitter:

Description: 
In the glass, the combo of golden rum and pineapple juice must have reminded some smitten Prohibition era barkeep of Mary Pickford's famous flaxen locks. Whatever the case, add some grenadine and cherry liqueur and you have yourself a sensational old-school cocktail.
