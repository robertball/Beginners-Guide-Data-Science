Ingredients:
2 cups of white or whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cup of sugar
3/4 cup of cocoa powder
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup water
1 cup of canola or olive oil (can be reduced to 3/4 cup or replaced with applesauce and 2 tbsp of oil)
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Mix together all the ingredients in no particular order.
Oil a pan very well and bake for 30-40 minutes, checking at the 30 minute mark with a toothpick. The final product should be fudgy, but not gooey.
Eat the entire batch while the pan is still too hot and contemplate your life thus far.
