Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) whole chicken
1 lemon, juiced
5 tablespoons salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup thousand island dressing
2 cups water

Directions:
Place the sectioned chicken parts in a shallow, nonporous dish so that the pieces fit snugly.
In a separate, nonporous small bowl, combine the lemon juice, salt, paprika, ground black pepper, garlic and thousand island dressing. Mix well, pour over the chicken and add water to cover.
Cover and refrigerate, allowing the chicken to marinate for 8 hours.
Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect heat and lightly oil grate.
Grill chicken over indirect heat for about 50 minutes, or until temperature reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Discard any excess marinade.

Description: 
The name comes from my daughter, who calls it 'wishy' chicken. She loves this dish! It's barbecued chicken using a really simple marinade.
