Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups milk
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Grease a loaf pan.
Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, and cheese in a large bowl.  Mix in milk and melted butter.  Stir to form a soft dough. Spoon dough into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 34 to 40 minutes.  Remove from pan to cool.
