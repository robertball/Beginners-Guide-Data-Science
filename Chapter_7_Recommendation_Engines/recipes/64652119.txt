Ingredients:
2 slabs baby back ribs
1-2 tablespoons salt, or to taste
1-2 tablespoons black pepper, or to taste
1-2 tablespoons garlic powder, or to taste
1-16oz. bottle of your favorite bbq sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees.
Line a large cookie sheet (use 2 if you have to), with heavy duty foil and spray with cooking spray.
Cut the ribs into portions (I cut them into sections of 2 ribs).
Place on cookie sheet, backside up, and season liberally with salt, pepper and garlic powder.
Turn the ribs over and season the other side liberally with the salt, pepper and garlic powder.
Cover tightly with foil and place in the oven.
Bake at 200 degrees for exactly 5 hours.
Remove from oven.
At this point you could allow them to cool and put them into a pan and into the fridge to be finished the next day.
Preheat outdoor grill to medium-high.
Place the ribs on the grill and allow to brown.
Flip and begin basting with the bbq sauce.
Continue to flip and baste until they are the color that you like.
Turn off the grill and put the cover down.
Allow the ribs to rest for about 10 minutes.
Serve and enjoy!
