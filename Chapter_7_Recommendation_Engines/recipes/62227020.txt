Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
enough olive oil to make a paste
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoons olive oil
SAUCE
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup white wine
1/4 cup butter, cut into 1 tablespoon sized pieces
1 teaspoon grated lime zest
2 tablespoons lime juice
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
IHeat oven to 350F.
In a small bowl, mix together salt, black pepper, cayenne, paprika, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, onion powder, thyme and parsley. Add olive oil to make a paste. Rub spice mixture generously on both sides of chicken breasts.
Heat butter and olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute chicken until golden brown, about 6 minutes on each side. Place in baking dish & put in oven for about 10 minutes or until juices run clear.
Meanwhile, place the garlic and white wine in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and reduce the wine to 2 tablespoons. Remove from the heat, and whisk in the butter, one piece at a time, adding each piece after the last one has melted. Once the butter has been incorporated, whisk in the lime zest and juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in cilantro and serve immediately
