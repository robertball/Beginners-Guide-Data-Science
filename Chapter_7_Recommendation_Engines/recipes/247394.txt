Ingredients:
12  Original Snack Factory(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Pretzel Crisps(<sup>&reg;</sup>)
¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
⅛ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 link sweet Italian chicken sausage, thinly sliced, or more as needed
12  long fresh chives for tying
1 cup pizza sauce, purchased or homemade, heated

Directions:
Preheat broiler to high. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange Pretzel Crisps(R) on foil.
Combine mozzarella, Parmesan, and parsley in a small bowl. Carefully top each crisp with about 1 teaspoon of the mixture. Place pan under broiler; broil until cheese is warm and beginning to melt, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Watch carefully so they don't burn.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and sausage. Cook and stir until sausage is nicely browned on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Top the cheese on each Pretzel Crisp(R) with a piece of sausage. Carefully wrap a chive around the middle of the crisp tying it into a knot. Cut off any excess chive and place on your serving platter. Serve immediately with pizza sauce for dipping.
