Ingredients:
5-6 tbsp Tbsp of Extra Virgin Olive oil (use judgement depending on pan size)
1/2 large onion, sliced
2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (each cleaned, cut in 1/2 width wise, and patted dry)
1 dash of Garlic Salt (for seasoning)
1 cup of all purpose flour
1 can of Stewed Tomatoes

Directions:
Put a couple tablespoons of olive oil in the iron skillet and let it heat. Add onions and a dash of garlic salt and cook until brown. -Remove onions from skillet and set aside.-
Coat the bottom of the skillet with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, you'll want just enough to literally cover the bottom of the pan, but not too much. In a ziplock bag, add the flour and chicken and toss until coated. Add chicken breasts to heated skillet and brown each side for 5 minutes on medium-high heat. After one minute, cover with lid.
Add onions and stewed tomatoes and stir until steamy. Place lid on for 1 minute on medium heat. Don't let it sit longer than a minute, you want to keep your chicken crispy on the outside but moist on the inside!
Have fun with this! Add your own spices and twists! You can go any direction.
