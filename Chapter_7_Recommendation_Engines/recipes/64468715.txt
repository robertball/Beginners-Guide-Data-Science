Ingredients:
1 package of Pillsbury Grands
1/4 cup of sugar
2 tbl Cinnamon
1 tbl Nutmeg
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup Brown Sugar
1 stick of unsalted butter
Hopes
Dreams
Dignity

Directions:
Step 1: Cut dough into 1/4's. This will take about 3 hours as you have to simultaneously feed the cats, find that one video on YouTube your kid will actually watch, clean up the spilled juice, try to remember where you saw that shoe and remind your son that crayons are not for walls.
Step 2: Combine Cinnamon, nutmeg and salt together in a bowl. Nicely done, chef! Roll the balls of dough around in there. Oops! You forgot the sugar - add it, add more. Wow - are you going to be sorry when your kids are bouncing off the walls.  Don't tell the wife. Keep your fingers away from your eyes. , that stings.
Step 3: Place pieces gently in the Bundt pan. What is a Bundt pan? You sing for a living.  Cooking is hard.
Step 4: Bake at 350 or 500 degrees for 11 min or 2 min.  Be manly about it.
Step 5:  Put butter and brown sugar in a pan. Stir it a lot. Wow, this makes caramel - remember to tell the guys on poker night.
Step 6: Remove "bites" - pour magic "caramel" over "bites." Consider getting your own cooking show.
Step 7: Bake another couple of min.
Step 8: Remove from oven. Remember to constantly remind your wife throughout the day how tired you are from making brunch, champ.
Enjoy!
