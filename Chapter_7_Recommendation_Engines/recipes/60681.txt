Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cubed
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup orange juice
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
Place pork into a large bowl. In a small bowl, mix together  the vinegar, cumin, turmeric, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Pour over the pork, and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Remove pork from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and place in the hot skillet. Cook until nicely browned on the outside. Add orange juice, 1/2 cup water, dried onion, and the reserved marinade. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the pork is fork tender.
In a small cup, stir together the flour and 2 tablespoons of water. Stir into the skillet, and simmer uncovered until thickened, 2 to 4 minutes.

Description: 
This different pork flavor is delicious served over rice and has always been met with praise.  The spices in the marinade can stain, so I use a metal bowl to do the marinating in (also wear an apron!).  DO TRY!
