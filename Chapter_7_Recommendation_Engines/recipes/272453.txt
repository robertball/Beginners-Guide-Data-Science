Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
1 jalapeno pepper, sliced into thin strips
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 (4 ounce) fillets swai fish, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 tablespoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
12 corn tortillas, warmed
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion, red bell pepper, jalapeno, and garlic until slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
Heat remaining oil in the same pan. Add swai; cook for 2 minutes. Add chili powder, salt, cumin, and pepper; cook until swai is coated and opaque in the center, 1 to 2 minutes. Return vegetables to the pan.
Divide swai and vegetables among tortillas. Sprinkle Monterey Jack cheese on top.

Description: 
Fantastic new recipe we discovered when we were looking for a way to use some swai we found on sale at the market. The fish is sturdy enough to hold up to sauteeing and really absorbs the flavors perfectly for a great fish taco!
