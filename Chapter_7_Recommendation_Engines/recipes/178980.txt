Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups Swanson® Chicken Stock
1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 (4 ounce) swordfish steaks, 1-inch thick
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Stir the stock, mustard, lemon juice and black pepper in a small bowl.  Pour 1 cup stock mixture into a shallow nonmetallic dish or gallon-size resealable plastic bag. Add the fish and turn to coat. Cover the dish or close the bag and refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove the fish from the marinade.
Lightly oil the grill rack and heat the grill to medium.  Grill the fish for 10 minutes or until it's cooked through, turning the fish over halfway through cooking and brushing often with the marinade. Discard the marinade.
Heat the cornstarch and remaining stock mixture in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens. Serve with the fish.
