Ingredients:
1 cup japanese rice
1 cup water
100 g ground chicken
1/4 teaspoon pepper
75 g sweet potatoes (1 piece)
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Start by washing the rice 1-2 times or until the water used to wash the rice becomes clearer. After the last wash, use a strainer to drain the liquid completely then soak the rice in a cup of water for about 30 minutes.
Season about 100 grams of ground chicken with a quarter teaspoon of salt and a quarter teaspoon of pepper. Mix well then leave it for about 10 minutes so the chicken can absorb the flavors from the seasonings.
Wash the sweet potato carefully then slice it into smaller pieces, about a centimeter cubes.
Once the rice, ground chicken and sweet potato are ready, you can put all those ingredients in the microwave pressure cooker including the water used to soak the rice. Add about a quarter teaspoon of salt then mix all the ingredients inside.
Cover the microwave pressure cooker then cook in the microwave for about 10 minutes using 600W. After 10 minutes, keep the microwave pressure cooker covered for 15 more minutes to allow the remaining steam inside to continue to cook the rice and soften it.
After 15 minutes, remove the cover then mix well before serving.

Description: 
Sweet potatoes have served as a great rice extender for many generations now in Asia. The softness and sweet taste of the sweet potato gives rice a livelier taste that’s why it is liked by many.
