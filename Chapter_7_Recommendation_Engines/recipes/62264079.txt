Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. kielbasa, diced (1/2" pieces)
8-10 medium russet type potatoes, baked in microwave
1 can whole kernel corn (or 1/2 16 oz. bag frozen)
1/2 onion, chopped (1/2" pieces)
1 Tbsp. minced garlic
3 Tbsp. olive oil
Seasoned salt
Ground black pepper

Directions:
Saute kielbasa and onion in large skillet, adding garlic when kielbasa is almost browned.  Remove to bowl, set aside.
If using frozen corn, place in collander and set under running cold tap water for about 1 minute to thaw, set on plate to drain.
Scrub and prick potatoes, place on plate in microwave and cook.  (3 min. per potato, turning potatoes at half-way point).  When potatoes are almost finished baking in microwave, remove to cutting surface.  Cut potatoes in half, allow to cool somewhat.  When sufficiently cooled, dice potatoes and saute in olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper.  When almost finished browning, add corn to heat through.
Combine kielbasa with pototoes, season again and mix well.  Serve with sour cream or catsup as preferred.
