Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package softened cream cheese
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon Italian bread crumbs
1 green onion, chopped
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (6 ounce) can snow crab, drained
1 (4 ounce) can small shrimp, drained
12 large white mushrooms, stems removed
or 24 medium mushrooms, stems removed
1 cup Italian bread crumbs
some parmeasean cheese added to bread crumb

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place cream cheese, egg yolk, 1 tablespoon bread crumbs, green onion, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a mixer. Mix until smooth and evenly blended. Fold in the snow crab and shrimp. Stuff the mushrooms with this mixture, and press into the remaining bread crumbs/parmesean mixture to coat. Place onto baking sheet stuffing-side-up once coated.
Bake in preheated oven until the mushrooms have softened slightly, 12 to 14 minutes, or until mushrooms are soft. Set oven to Broil, and broil mushrooms for a few minutes until the tops are golden and bubbly.
