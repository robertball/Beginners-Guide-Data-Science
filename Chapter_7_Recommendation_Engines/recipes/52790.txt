Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 pounds large shrimp (21-25 per pound), peeled and deveined
2 cups red peppers, diced
1 cup chopped onion
3 large cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 (14.5 ounce) can canned diced tomatoes
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Quickly saute shrimp until they turn pink, but are not cooked through; remove from skillet and set aside.  Add the bell peppers, onion, garlic, fennel seeds, and thyme; cook until the onion softens, about 8 minutes.
Stir in white wine, tomato paste, and diced tomatoes.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the flavors blend, about 10 minutes.  Add the shrimp, and simmer until they are cooked and turn opaque, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the basil, and season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.

Description: 
For a gourmet meal this is very easy to prepare.  Leftovers reheat well the next day too!  Instead of using fresh shrimp like the recipe originally called (took too long the first time I did it) we now use frozen, raw, peeled and it tastes the exact same, but with 1/4 of the time! This is great over rice and served with French bread.
