Ingredients:
2 lb potatoes
2 T curry powder
1 T oil
1 tsp salt

Directions:
Boil the potatoes without peeling til they are just tender.  Peel and slice thickly (about an inch thick) while still warm
Toss gently with the curry powder til they are well-coated.  Spritz with a little water if necessary to help the spices stick.  Set aside for about 15 mins.
Heat the oil on high.  Add the potatoes, reduce heat to med, and fry, turning as they brown (as you would for country fries).  You want a nice crunchy brown coating.
Serve.
