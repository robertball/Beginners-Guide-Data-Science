Ingredients:
2 large tomatoes
1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
2/3 cup mayonnaise
Paprika (to taste)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Line baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray liberally with non-stick cooking spray.
Cut a small slice in the bottom of each tomato so that the bottom of tomato lies flat and evenly on baking sheet without tilting.  Slice tomatoes in thirds to make 3 thick tomato slabs (for a total of 6 slabs).  Place on prepared baking sheet.
Combine cheese and mayonnaise (cheese should have just enough mayonnaise to hold it together, if too dry add just a bit more mayonnaise).
Heap cheese mixture evenly on each tomato slab.  Sprinkle with paprika to taste.
Bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Topping should be nicely browned.  Serve hot.
