Ingredients:
5 cups sliced, firm, tart apples
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground cloves
2 scrapes of nutmeg on a zester, or 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup granulated sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 egg, well-beaten
1/2 cup table cream (18% cream) or milk
1/3 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Mix together the first 5 ingredients (apples, sugar, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg).  Distribute evenly in 9 x 9" baking dish that is at least 2" deep.
Mix together flour,  baking powder, 1 c sugar (can use sugar substitute for half the sugar)and salt.  Mix together the egg, cream and melted butter and add all at once to the dry ingredients.  Stir well.  Spoon the batter over the apple mixture, using the back of the spoon to spread the batter so that the apples are all sealed in, that there are no gaps where apples peak out.
Bake at 350F for 50 - 60 minutes, or until nicely browned on top.   This goes really nicely with a custard sauce such as Bird's Custard.
