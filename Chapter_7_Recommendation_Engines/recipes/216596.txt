3/4 cup maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup rolled oats

2 cups whole almonds
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup sunflower seeds

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Stir the maple syrup, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a small saucepan over medium heat until it begins to simmer. Meanwhile, combine the rolled oats, pecans, almonds, raisins, cranberries, and sunflower seeds in a large mixing bowl. Pour the hot maple syrup over top, and stir until evenly mixed. Spread onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove from oven, scrape onto a cold baking sheet, and cool to room temperature. Break into clumps and stir in the chocolate covered peanuts once cool.
