Ingredients:
•	Cooking spray
•	3 medium carrots, finely chopped
•	2 stalks celery (including leaves), finely chopped
•	1 ear of cooked corn, cut off the cob
•	2 garlic cloves, minced
•	1 bay leaf, torn in half
•	1 to 1½ tsp. dried thyme, divided
•	8 oz. sliced mushrooms
•	1 ½ cups frozen green peas, defrosted and drained
•	3 cups rotisserie chicken, chopped
•	1/2 cup butter
•	1/2 cup all-purpose flour
•	Salt, to taste
•	Black pepper, to taste
•	3 cups chicken broth
•	2 9-inch refrigerator pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
In a large pan sprayed with cooking spray, sauté the carrots, celery, corn, garlic, bay leaf, 1/2 tsp. thyme and salt and pepper for 5-7 minutes over medium heat, until the vegetable medley begins to soften.
Add the mushrooms and sauté for another 5-7 minutes. Remove bay leaf pieces.
In a separate bowl, mix the vegetables with the chicken and the peas.
In the same large pan used to cook the vegetables, melt ½ cup butter. Blend in flour, salt, pepper and ½ - 1 tsp. thyme. Add in chicken broth ½ cup at a time. Stir constantly until all of the chicken broth is incorporated. Add the chicken and vegetable mixture to the pan. Mix well.
In a 9-inch pie pan, spray the entire pan with cooking spray and place one of the crusts in the pan. Pour the entire mixture into the crust. Cover with the top crust, seal edges, and cut away any excess dough. Make slits in the top so that the steam escapes.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown, and the filling bubbles.
