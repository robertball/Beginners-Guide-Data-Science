Ingredients:
3 tbls chunky peanut butter
2 cups chicken stock (additional as needed)
4 tbls rice wine vinegar
2 tsp sesame oil
2 tbls peanut oil
3 cloves minced garlic
1 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp red pepper (or any pepper for a "kick")
1 medium red pepper - chopped
1/2 chopped yellow onion
1 head bok choy - green tops sliced to 1/2"
1 package Aidells Pineapple Terryaki meatballs
9 oz. Japanese udon noodles (spaghetti is a good substitute)
toasted pinenuts for topping

Directions:
Combine the first 5 ingredients on medium heat in a medium saucepan stirring until combined, adding just 1/2 cup of stock at a time.  After this has reached a sauce consistency, add garlic, ginger, red pepper and onion, cooking for about 10 minutes on low, adding chicken stock as needed, stirring occasionally.  Add meatballs in the last 8 minutes (just long enough to heat) and chicken stock as necessary to keep sauce from becoming too thick.
While this is cooking, boil water for and cook the noodles.  Place cooked noodles in a large bowl, put meatball mixture over top and sprinkle with pinenuts.  This is a great on the go meal for the pre-holiday season or when you are busy and need a quick nutritious meal.
