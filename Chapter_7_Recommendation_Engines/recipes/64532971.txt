Ingredients:
2 cups water
2 6-oz packages of lemon gelatin
2 large lemons (or 4 small lemons)...extract the zest and juice
1 medium orange (or two tangerines)...use only the juice
64 oz plain yogurt
2 graham cracker pie crusts (baking isle of market)

Directions:
Grate the peel of the lemons...try to include as little of the white pulp as possible and set aside.
Squeeze the orange and lemons and set aside.
Remove yogurt from container into a large mixing bowl.
In a four-cup Pyrex bowl, pour in two cups of water
Bring to an almost-boil in the microwave oven...about four minutes.
Remove from microwave, add lemon gelatin and stir until dissolved (probably one to two minutes)
Add orange juice, lemon juice and lemon zest to the gelatin.
Combine all ingredients to the yogurt bowl.
Use a mixer (hand crank or electric) to completely combine the ingredients.  The result should be a creamy-looking liquid.
Use a ladle to spoon mixture into pie crusts.  Pour remaining mixture back into the original yogurt container.
Refrigerate the pie crusts and container for four hours to set the gel.
