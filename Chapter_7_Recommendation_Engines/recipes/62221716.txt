Ingredients:
3 eggs
3/4 + 2 tablespoons cup milk
4 slices bread, torn
2/3 cup chopped onion
2/3 cup grated carrot
1 1/3 cup shredded Cheddar or mozzarella cheese
1 Tbsp + 1 tsp minced fresh parsley
1 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon sage
1 1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 pounds lean ground beef
TOPPING:
2/3 cup tomato sauce
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/4 teaspoon prepared mustard

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat eggs. Add milk and bread; let stand until liquid is absorbed. Stir in the onion, carrot, cheese and seasonings. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well.
Shape into a 7-1/2-in. x 3-1/2-in. x 2-1/2-in. loaf in a shallow baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes.
Combine the topping ingredients; spoon half of the mixture over meat loaf. Bake 30 minutes longer or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F, occasionally spooning remaining topping over loaf. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
'THE COMBINATION of onion, carrots, parsley and cheese--plus the tomato-mustard topping--makes this meat loaf unusually colorful. This is an attractive entree to serve, and it has a unique, unforgettable flavor. The recipe lends itself easily to being doubled or halved to suit the number you're cooking for, and it also freezes well!'Modified from: Best-Ever Meat Loaf
