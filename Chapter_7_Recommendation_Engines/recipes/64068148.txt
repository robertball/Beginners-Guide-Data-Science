Ingredients:
2 cups baking mix, such as Bisquick
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon dried minced onions

1 Tablespoon sugar
2/3 cup leftover spaghetti sauce
1 Tablespoon white vinegar
1 cup whole milk
1 cup of 1/4" medium cheddar cheese cubes
1 egg
1 Tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 and grease muffin pan.
Whisk dry ingredients in a medium bowl.
In a 2-cup measuring cup, combine vinegar and milk; and let sit a minute (homemade buttermilk).
With a spoon, mix cheese and sauce into the dry until fully incorporated.
Whisk oil and egg into milk, then pour into dry and fully combine.
Spoon mixture into prepared muffin pan, about 2/3 full.  Bake for 15-20 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean (might be cheesy, but cook until no batter sticks to it).

Description: 
My little ones are a kitchen disaster with noodles.  This is a good way to get nutrition in them, in 30 minutes or less, without so much of a mess.  I called it Pizza Muffins to my 3yo, but my hubby says it tastes more like spaghetti.  Either way, we love it!
