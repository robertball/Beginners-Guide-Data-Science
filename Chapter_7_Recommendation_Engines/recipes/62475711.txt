Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
3/4 cup walnuts
Wet Ingredients:
2 apples, whatever you have, peeled and diced into 1/2 inch pieces
3 large, very ripe bananas, peeled
1/4 cup sour cream
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons brandy
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Creaming Ingredients
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, slightly softened
2 1/4 cups superfine granulated sugar
4 whole eggs
3 egg yolks
For the Glaze
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon cream
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 ounces bittersweet chocolate

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F, place rack in the middle.
Whisk all dry ingredients except the walnuts in a bowl to combine. Toss 1/2c of mixture with the walnuts in a small bowl. Set bowls aside.
Slice bananas 1/3 inch thick. Set aside 1/2 cup and mash the remaining banana slices in a bowl. Add the reserved banana, the apples, and remaining wet ingredients. Stir gently to combine.
Cream butter and sugar together until fluffy in a separate bowl. Add the whole eggs, then the yolks, one at a time, allowing each to incorporate before adding the next.
Alternate the dry and wet ingredients, each in fourths. Mix each installment just to combine, but don't pause. Gently fold in the walnuts.
Pour the batter into a buttered 12c bundt pan and bake for about 60 minutes, or until it passes the toothpick test. Allow the cake to cool on a wrack for 20 minutes before inverting it onto a plate.
In the meantime, make the glazes. Whisk together all of the glaze ingredients except the chocolate and divide evenly between two bowls. Melt the chocolate either in a double boiler or the microwave. Stir half of the melted chocolate into one of the bowls of glaze.
When the cake is warm, pour all three glazes over the top. Start with the white glaze, then the brown, then the pure chocolate. Slice and enjoy.
