Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
4 thin slices fully cooked ham
4 thin slices Swiss cheese
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon paprika
1/3 cup butter
1/2 cup white grape juice
1 cube chicken bouillon
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Flatten chicken to 1/4-in. thickness. Top each with a slice of ham and cheese; fold to fit. Roll up tightly and secure with toothpicks. In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and paprika. Coat chicken with flour mixture.
In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Cook chicken for 5 minutes on each side or until browned. Add grape juice and bouillon. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until chicken is tender.
Remove chicken and keep warm. In a small bowl, combine cream and cornstarch until smooth. Gradually stir into pan juices. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Spoon over chicken.
