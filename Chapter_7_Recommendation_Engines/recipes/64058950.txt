Ingredients:
Sauce:
2 TBSP bacon grease
2 TBSP red chili powder, or to taste
2 TBSP flour
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/4 tsp. salt
garlic powder, to taste
Enchiladas:
1 lb hamburger
1/2 onion, chopped
1 lb grated cheddar cheese
Garnish:
lettuce
tomatoes
avocados

Directions:
Melt bacon grease in a sauce pan oven medium hot heat. Stir in chili powder. Once flavor is released from the chili powder; quickly stir in flour. When the flour is absorbed stir in the chicken broth. season with salt and garlic powder. Add additional chicken broth or water for proper consistency. Remove from heat. The amounts are approximate, I've never measured them successfully, sorry.
Enchiladas:
Cook and stir hamburger until crumbly and done. Soften tortillas in the sauce; place on a dish. Place hamburger, then onions, then cheese on half the tortilla. Drizzle the sauce over the hamburger stuff; fold over tortilla and cover with sauce. Microwave for 45 seconds or until cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve with lettuce, tomatoes, avocados and Spanish rice.
You can also layer the tortillas and other ingredients in a casserole dish and bake 375 degrees for 20 -25 minutes until cheese is bubbly.
