Ingredients:
Chicken Breasts with Strawberry-Blueberry Chutney
Makes 4 servings
2 teaspoons canola oil
1/2 cup chopped red onion
2 cups quartered strawberries
1/2 cup dried blueberries
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 pounds)
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon butter

Directions:
1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
2. In a small saucepan over medium, heat the canola oil. Add the onion and saute until softened, about 4 minutes.
3. Add the strawberries, dried blueberries, brown sugar, vinegar and ginger. Bring to a boil, then cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until the berries are softened and breaking down, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.
4. In a shallow dish, combine the flour, salt and pepper. Dredge both sides of each breast through the seasoned flour.
5. In a large nonstick oven-safe skillet over medium, heat the olive oil and butter. Add the chicken and cook for about 10 minutes per side.
6. Transfer the chicken to the oven and cook for another 5 minutes, or until an instant thermometer inserted at the thickest part reads 165 degrees. Serve the chicken topped with strawberry-blueberry chutney.
