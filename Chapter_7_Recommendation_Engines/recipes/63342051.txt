Ingredients:
1 large loaf of ciabatta bread (enough for 4 people)
2 packs of thinly sliced chicken deli meat (approximately 180g, enough for 4 people)
8 slices Monterey Jack cheese
Carmelized onion chutney (approximately 8-16 tbsp, depending on size of sandwiches)
Olive oil (approximately 1 tsp)
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Turn on panini press to heat.
Cut ciabatta roll lengthwise to create tops and bottoms of paninis.  Then, cut the loaf into 4 pieces for the individual sandwiches.
Scoop out about half of the bread on each slice. (This allows the paninis to hold the ingredients more easily, and is also healthier!)
Lay out the bread to build the sandwiches.  Drizzle a small amount of olive oil on each slice, so that it will be on the inside of the sandwich when complete.  (I use an olive oil spritzer to get a thin, even coat.)
Sprinkle each slice with a small amount of salt and pepper.
Spread onion chutney on inside of bottom slice of bread (approximately 2-4 tbsp for each sandwich, or enough to thinly coat the slice).
Top onion chutney with slices of chicken.  (I like to pull apart the slices into smaller pieces, makes it easier to eat the sandwich).
Top each sandwich with 2 slices of Monterey Jack cheese, and place top slice of bread on each sandwich.
Grill on panini press until cheese begins to melt (approximately 5 minutes) and serve immediately.

Description: 
Grilled cheese for grown-ups! My husband and I love these paninis.  The caramelised onion chutney gives them a unique flavour.  A very quick and easy sandwich.
