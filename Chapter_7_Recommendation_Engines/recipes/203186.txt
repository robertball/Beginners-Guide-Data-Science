Description: 
Threw this together when my husband decided he was getting sick of my peanut butter and banana smoothies for his diet/workout plan.  It was a request of his and now a constant in our home. You can use this as a meal replacement for breakfast or lunch or as an after workout shake.  Even my kids LOVE it.
