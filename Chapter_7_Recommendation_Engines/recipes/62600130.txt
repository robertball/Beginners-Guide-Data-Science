Description: 
When my siblings and I were growing up, we would beg mom to make this spaghetti sauce. We all loved it!  And, it wasn't just us, when any of us would have friends over on Spaghetti night, they would rave about it too.  Now that my mom is gone, I am carrying on the tradition and my kids are just as wild about it as we all were.  I have even had calls from old friends requesting the recipe and they now make it for their families too.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
