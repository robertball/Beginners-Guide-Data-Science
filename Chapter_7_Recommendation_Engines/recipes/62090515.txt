8-10 Nabisco Famous Chocolate wafers
2 score candy bars, crushed
4 cups Coffee Ice Cream, softened

Line a loaf pan with saran wrap.
spread hot fudge on slices of pound cake.  Layer half the pound cake in the loaf pan, with the slices overlapping and fudge side up. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the crushed candy bar.
Spread 1/2 of the ice cream on top of cake layer.  Lay the chocolate wafers on top of the ice cream in an even layer, its ok if they overlap alittle.
Next layer the rest of the ice cream then crushed candy bar ending with pound cake on top with the fudge side down.
Cover with saran wrap and press down alittle to mash it together, but not to much to squeeze the ice cream to the sides.  Freeze for 4 hrs.
