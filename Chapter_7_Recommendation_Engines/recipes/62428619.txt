Spray skillet with cooking spray once skillet is heated.  Saute onion until transluscent then add kielbasa.  Cook about 5 minutes stirring a couple of times throughout.  Add potatoes and broccoli and mix up with kielbasa and onion.  Season with some salt and pepper.  Stir and season again with some salt and pepper.  Stir again and cover.  Cook for 15 minutes.  Stir again.  Finally, cook for 10-15 more minutes (until potatoes are cooked through).

Description: 
The house always smells awesome while this very tasty, filling meal is cooking. It makes kielbasa worth stocking up on when it goes on sale and uses basic/cheap ingredients overall.  Vary the vegetables depending on what you have on hand, ex. add/replace broccoli with a can of corn a/or peas, etc. If you like a little heat, sprinkle a little hot sauce on top after it's cooked.  This should make about 4 servings, but it almost always turns out to be split into 2 large servings between the me and the boyfriend.  :-)  We like to crisp up/brown the kielbasa slightly before adding the vegetables.
