Description: 
Way back in the 60's my mom bought Thomas' English Muffins. For some reason one day we decided to make pizza out of the muffins. I am not sure if they were advertised on the package or it was just an invention we made one day. Kids love them, and we had fun making our own and putting on it what we wanted.
