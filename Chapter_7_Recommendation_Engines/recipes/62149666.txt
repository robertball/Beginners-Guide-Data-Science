Description: 
My grandmother, Anne Druzgal, used to have these cookies around every time we visited her house. They are very simple soft cookies that emphasize the flavor of the butter and raisins. Despite being simple, they are very tasty and tend to be a crowd-pleaser. And chances are that you probably have all the ingredients in your kitchen already!
