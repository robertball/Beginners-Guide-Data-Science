Ingredients:
1 package Boneless skinless chicken breast
1 packet taco seasoning
small jar of salsa
small sweet onion
1-2 tsp olive oil
Fat free sour cream

Directions:
Place the chicken in a bowl and dump the olive oil (about 1 to 2 tsp) and toss around to make sure each gets a thin coating of oil. Slice onion into rings and line the bottom of a baking dish with onions. Take chicken and sprinkle both sides of each patty with Taco seasoning. Place on top of onions. Scoop salsa on top of each breast, and place in oven at 350, and cook until done. The onions are great as a side or as garnish on top of meat when served. TOp with sour cream if desired!
