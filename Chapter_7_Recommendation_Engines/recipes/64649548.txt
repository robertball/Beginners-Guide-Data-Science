Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
2 tbsp (28g) unsalted butter, cold and cubed
1/2 cup plain, non-fate greek yoghurt
3 tbsp pure maple syrup
3 tbsp + 2 tsp nonfat milk, divided
1/2 tsp coconut extract
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
2 1/2 tbsp shredded, unsweetened coconut
1/3 cup cranberries, sliced up

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425F and line baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut in the butter with a fork until the mixture resembles fine crumbs.
Stir in the greek yoghurt, maple syrup, 3 tbsp of milk, coconut extract, vanilla extract.
Gently fold in the cranberries and shredded coconut.
Using a spatula, shape the dough into a 3/4" tall circle on the prepared baking sheet and brush with the remaining milk.
Slice the circle into 8 triangular segments with a sharp knife.
Bake for 18-21 mins or until the tops are slightly golden. Cool on the pan for 5 mins before  transferring to a wire rack.

Another brilliant creation from amyshealthybaking.com 
Her recipe calls for pineapple but I wanted to experiment with some flavors. I kept the same measurements (1/3 cup).
