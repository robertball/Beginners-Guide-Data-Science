Ingredients:
2 pints hulled strawberries
¼ cup freshly-squeezed orange juice
½ lemon, juiced
½ cup plain yogurt
2-4 tablespoons simple syrup
½ teaspoon vanilla extract
Mint leaves, for garnish
Sliced or diced strawberries, for serving

Directions:
Blend all ingredients until smooth. Refrigerate until chilled. Serve with garnishes of diced strawberry, mint leaves and yogurt, if desired.
Cook's notes: Use a flavored simple syrup such as mint, thyme, lavender, hibiscus or orange to add some interesting complexity. Make this soup vegan by replacing the yogurt with coconut milk.
