Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter, softened
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
Chicken Pieces - thighs,breasts, rinsed and patted dry
or 1 whole chicken cut into pieces
Salt and pepper
2 heads of garlic, unpeeled and blanched in boiling water for 10 minutes
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme or Herbes de Provence
1 bay leaf
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 cup chicken stock or canned broth

Directions:
In a large, deep skillet over medium high heat, warm 2 tablespoons of butter and the oil until hot. Add the chicken, season with salt and pepper, and brown it on all sides. Distribute the garlic cloves around the chicken and season with the thyme and bay leaf. Cover the skillet and cook the chicken over medium-low heat for 30-35 minutes or until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced with a fork. Transfer the chicken and garlic to a platter and keep warm. Discard the bay leaf. Skim and discard the fat from the pan, add the wine, and reduce the liquid by half over high heat. Add the stock and reduce to 3/4 cup. Remove the pan from the heat and swirl in the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter. Pour the sauce over the chicken.
