Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin
3 tablespoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup nonfat milk
1 1/2 cups nonfat plain yogurt (Greek style or regular)
2 tablespoons lime or lemon juice
1 Chilean Hass avocado

Directions:
In small microwaveable bowl or glass measuring cup, stir together gelatin, sugar and salt. Add milk, stir and let stand 2 to 3 minutes. Microwave until milk just begins to simmer, about 1 1/2 minutes. Stir until gelatin dissolves. Set aside to cool for about 3 to 5 minutes. Pour into blender or food processor. Add yogurt and lime juice and blend about 15 seconds.
Rinse avocado. Cut in half and remove the pit. Scoop out fruit and add to yogurt mixture. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute.
Rinse 6 individual (1-cup) molds, small custard cups or souffle dishes with cold water. Divide avocado mixture among molds, pour into small serving dishes. Cover tops with plastic wrap and chill several hours or overnight. To remove, run a sharp knife around edges of molds. Dip bottom of mold briefly into pan of hot water. Put serving plate on top of mold, turn over and gently shake to remove.
