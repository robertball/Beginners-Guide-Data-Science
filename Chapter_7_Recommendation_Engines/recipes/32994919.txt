Ingredients:
2-1/4 cups whole milk
1 cup heavy cream
10 fresh wintergreen leaves or 1/4 tsp. wintergreen oil
6 egg yolks
1 cup granulated sugar
1/4 tsp. vanilla extract

Directions:
In a mid-sized saucepan bring the milk, cream and leaves (if you are using them) to a boil over medium heat. Remove and let stand 10 minutes.
In a bowl, blend egg yolks with sugar, then beat at high speed until smooth enough to form a ribbon. Slowly pour cream mixture into eggs, whisking gently to prevent curdling. When cream and eggs are incorporated, pour into a saucepan and heat until slightly thickened.
Strain through a sieve. Add vanilla (and wintergreen oil if you are using it.) Mix thoroughly. Cover the surface with plastic wrap and chill at least three hours or until quite cold. Freeze mixture in an ice-cream maker. (Serves four to six.)
