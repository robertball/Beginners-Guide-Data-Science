Ingredients:
3/4cups orange juice
1/8 cup olive oil
1/8 cup chopped fresh chives
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3-4 boneless chicken breasts

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix the orange juice, olive oil, chives, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Place the chicken in the mixture. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours.
Preheat the oven broiler...  or grill.
Arrange the chicken on a baking sheet. Broil 30 minutes in the preheated oven, 6 to 8 inches from heat. Turn and brush frequently with the remaining marinade mixture, until no longer pink and juices run clear.  Strain rosemary out of marinade before using on top of chicken when serving.

Description: 
It's fabulous hot or cold. I make a big batch so there are leftovers (which make tasty quesadillas). I move my oven rack to a lower setting to keep the chicken moist, and even then it barely takes 30 minutes.Modified from: Orange Rosemary Chicken
