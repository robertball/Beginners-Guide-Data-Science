Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk, chilled
1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar

Remove the top layer of cream from the chilled coconut milk. Place in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 5 minutes. Beat in confectioner's sugar gradually until well combined, about 2 minutes. Add yogurt, coconut butter, vanilla extract, and salt; beat for 1 minute more. Transfer to an airtight container and chill in the refrigerator until firm, about 4 hours.
