Ingredients:
1 bag baby carrots, or 3 cups peeled and sliced carrots
1 tsp salt, divided
1 tbsp butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 tsp ginger
1/2 tsp cinnamon
pepper

Directions:
In a medium pot, add the carrots and about 2 inches of water, and half of the salt.  Bring to a simmer, and steam (covered) for about 8 minutes or until carrots are fork-tender.
Drain carrots, and mash with a fork or potato masher, then add the rest of the ingredients.
Cook over very low heat for several more minutes, until very tender and flavors are combined.  Enjoy!
