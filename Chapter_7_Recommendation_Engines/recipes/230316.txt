Description: 
My grandma always made Hoppin' John on New Year's Day when I was growing up in Virginia. I now live in New Mexico and decided to put a hot Southwestern spin on the recipe this year, hence the name. It's simple and tasty, and has some heat. I only added two jalapenos, but you could add more if you like it hotter. If you don't like hot food, you might want to eliminate the jalapenos completely. My husband and I both loved it.
