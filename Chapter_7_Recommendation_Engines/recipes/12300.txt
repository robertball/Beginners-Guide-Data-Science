Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust
1/3 cup caramel ice cream topping
1 1/2 cups milk
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
6 (1.4 ounce) bars chocolate covered English toffee, chopped

Directions:
Spread caramel topping into pie crust.
Beat milk and pudding mix for 2 minutes; let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in whipped topping and chopped candy bars. Spoon into crust.
Freeze for 4 hours or until set. Before serving, let stand for 15 minutes so that pie can easily be cut. Store any leftovers in refrigerator.
