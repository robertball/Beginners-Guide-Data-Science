Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in large wok over medium high heat. Add zucchini, onion, peppers, and mushrooms and sauté for 10 minutes.
While veggies are cooking, mix together remaining ingredients in a small bowl. Drain pasta and add to wok. Sprinkle spice mixture over wok, adding more oil as necessary to make the mixture spread more easily. Saute until spices are evenly distributed, then serve immediately.
