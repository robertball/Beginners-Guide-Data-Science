Ingredients:
2 cups butter
2 cups white sugar
9 eggs
1/4 cup white rum (optional)
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon almond extract
1 grated zest of one lime
2 pounds chopped dried mixed fruit
2 cups red wine
1 cup dark molasses
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 - 9 inch round cake pans.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, then add rum, lime juice, vanilla, almond extract, and lime zest. Stir in mixed fruit, wine, and molasses. Sift together flour, baking powder, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and salt. Fold into batter, being careful not to over-mix. Pour into prepared pans.
Bake in preheated oven for 80 to 90 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
