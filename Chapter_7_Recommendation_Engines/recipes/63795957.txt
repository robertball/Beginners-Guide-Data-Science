Ingredients:
2 cups granulated sugar
5 Tbsp dark unsweetened cocoa (ie: Hershey's Special)
1/2 cup butter, cut into cubes
1/2 cup milk,
1 tsp vanilla
3 cups quick cooking oats
1/4 cup ground flaxmeal
1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/8 tsp. salt
Few drops hot water (if needed)

Directions:
Line two baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper.
Combine oats, flax, cinnamon and salt in bowl; set aside.
Combine sugar, cocoa, butter and milk in medium heavy-bottomed saucepan.
Cook over medium-high heat until butter is melted, stirring often to combine.
Bring to a boil; boil, stirring or whisking constantly, for 6 minutes.
Remove from heat; add vanilla.  Quickly stir in oat mixture, adding a few drops of water if mixture becomes too crumbly.
Using a small cookie scoop, drop by spoonfuls onto paper-lined sheets.  Let cool until set.

Description: 
A twist on one of my favorite cookies - I used dark cocoa and added cinnamon.  I also added a bit of flaxmeal for a subtle nutty flavor.
