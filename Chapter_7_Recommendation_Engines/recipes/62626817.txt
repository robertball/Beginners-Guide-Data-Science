Ingredients:
1 cup warm water
2 tsp salt
4 tsp quick rise instant yeast
1 375ml can pitted black olives
3 cups all purpose flour
2 tsp sugar
3 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp corn starch

Directions:
Combine water, sugar and yeast.  Stir, let sit for 10 minutes until frothy
Strain olives, keeping 1/4 of the liquid.  Chop olives by hand or in food processor to desired consistency.  Mix into water/yeast mixture once frothy, stir.
In a separate bowl, mix flour, salt and 2 tbsp olive oil.
Pour yeast/olive mixture into flour mixture and knead until well mixed. Add water or flour by the tablespoon until dough is no longer sticky (add flour if it is too sticky, water if it is too dry).
Lightly coat exterior of dough with 1 tsp olive oil
Grease loaf pan with 1 tbsp olive oil and dust with corn starch.  Place dough in loaf pan and cover.  Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
Preheat oven at 375F; bake for 20 minutes or until toothpick inserted in centre comes out clean. During the baking process, throw water into the oven (one cup at a time) for a crispy crust every 10 minutes.  Alternatively, bake with a pan of water in the oven.

Description: 
While I love making bread, I hate all the repetitive kneading and rising, etc.  I concocted this recipe to avoid all that!  One rise and straight in the oven.
