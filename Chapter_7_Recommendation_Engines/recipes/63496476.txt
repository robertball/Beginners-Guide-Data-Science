Ingredients:
4tbsp Vegetable Oil
450g/1lb Chicken Thighs - cubed
1 large Red Onion - finely sliced
2 cloves Garlic - finely chopped
2 Red Chillies - finely chopped - you can remove some seeds to reduce heat - Can always add more back later if the taste is too mild
1 x 2” piece fresh Ginger - peeled & grated
2tsp ground Paprika
2½tsp ground Coriander
2tsp Garam Masala
¾tsp ground Cumin
2 x ¼tsp Salt

Salt and freshly ground Black Pepper
To Serve
Basmati Rice and/or Naan Bread, Chapatis & Papadums

Directions:
Mix the Paprika, coriander, garam masala, cumin, chilli powder and ¼tsp salt together in a small dish to form a flavour enhancing spice mixture;
In a large bowl, blend the tomatoes, yogurt, lemon juice and ¼tsp salt together to form a rich mixture;
Heat 2tbsp oil in a large frying pan and add the chicken;
Cook over a high heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the chicken is sealed all over;
Remove and set aside;
Reduce the heat and add the remaining oil;
Add the onions, garlic and ginger and fry gently, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes, until golden and softened;
Add the spice mixture and chillies and fry, stirring continuously, for 1 to 2 minutes to release the fragrance and aroma of the herbs;
Add the tomato mixture and increase the heat to bring to a boil;
Reduce to a Simmer and simmer for some 5 minutes or so until sauce has reduced slightly;
Add the chicken and stir well;
Heat the mixture until simmering, then cook on a low heat for some 30 to 35 minutes or so or until the chicken is tender and cooked through;
If the sauce becomes too thick, simply add more yoghurt;
Add the green pepper and most of the coriander (reserve some for garnish) and cook for some 10 minutes more;
Taste for seasoning, garnish with coriander and serve.

My absolute favourite concocted over the years. Now, is in it's grandeur. Packed with flavour, this Indian dish is one to savour over and over.  Complimented as true restaurant class.
As below, also great with Lamb.
