Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) jar kimchi
1 large egg
1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions
3/4 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 tablespoons bonito flakes (optional)

Directions:
Drain kimchi thoroughly through a sieve and reserve the juice. Chop kimchi finely.
Combine egg, 3 tablespoons kimchi juice, water, brown sugar, salt, and sesame oil in a large bowl. Whisk together. Add green onions and kimchi. Stir in flour just until combined.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add a few spoonfuls of pancake batter; any size pancake will do. Cook until edges are lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer pancake to a serving plate and repeat with remaining batter. Sprinkle bonito flakes on top.

Description: 
Michele and I recently discovered these incredibly tasty, and visually thrilling, savory pancakes at a local bar. I loved the taste and texture, but what really got my attention were the dancing bonito flakes on top. I found them as mesmerizing as I did delicious. Along with the kimchi, feel free to toss in any leftover meat and vegetables and see what happens. These would also be great topped with spicy mayo and served with eggs or grilled meat.
