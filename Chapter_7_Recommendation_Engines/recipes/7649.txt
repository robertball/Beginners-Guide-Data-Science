Ingredients:
12 (1 ounce) squares bittersweet chocolate
2 cups unsalted butter
1 pinch salt
2 eggs
4 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Melt the bittersweet chocolate, and allow to cool slightly.
Place the butter or margarine, salt, and vanilla in a mixing bowl.  Beat with a mixer until very light and airy, about 4 minutes.  Add the powdered sugar a little at a time while beating on low speed.  Mix well, and beat on medium speed for about 4 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, and beat for 5 minutes more. Add the melted chocolate, and beat 4 minutes.
