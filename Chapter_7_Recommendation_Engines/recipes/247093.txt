Description: 
Seeing the juicy pork chops in my friend Jennifer Yu's blog post (Use Real Butter) inspired this recipe, which features one of my favorite getting-meat-ready-for-the-grill techniques of all time. If you can call sprinkling salt on pork chops a technique. As long as you don't horribly overcook your meat, this 'dry-brine' technique will produce the juiciest and most flavorful pork chops you've ever had.
