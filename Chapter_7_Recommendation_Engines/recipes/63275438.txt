Ingredients:
1/2 cups butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 egg
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/8 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Grease light colored baking sheets with non-stick cooking spray or line with parchment and set aside.
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Whip in vanilla, egg, lemon zest, and juice. Scrape sides and mix again.
Stir in all dry ingredients slowly until just combined, excluding the powdered sugar. Scrape sides of bowl and mix again briefly.
Pour powdered sugar onto a large plate. Roll heaping teaspoons of dough into a ball and roll in powdered sugar.
Place on baking sheet and repeat with remaining dough.
Bake for 9-11 minutes or until bottoms begin to barely brown and cookies look matte (not melty or shiny).
Remove from oven and cool cookies about 3 minutes before transferring to cooling rack.
