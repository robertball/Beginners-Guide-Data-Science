Ingredients:
1 pound dry penne pasta
1 onion, chopped
1 pound lean ground beef
1 pound mild italian sausage
2 (26 ounce) (large) jars spaghetti sauce
2 packages provolone cheese, sliced
1 1/2 cups sour cream
2-3 bags mozzarella cheese, shredded
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese- I use LOTS more!

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.
In a large soup pot, brown onion, sausage and ground beef over medium heat. DRAIN and return to pan.
Add spaghetti sauce, and simmer 15 minutes.
Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with PAM. Layer as follows: thin layer of sauce, 1/2 of the ziti, (stir together),Provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/2 sauce mixture, remaining ziti, mozzarella cheese and remaining sauce mixture. Top with mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese.
Do not bake ahead.  Just put note on to bring to room temp and bake 350 for 30-40 minutes until bubbly.
