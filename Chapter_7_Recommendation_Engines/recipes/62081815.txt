Ingredients:
4 cups flour
1/2 tsp. cream of tartar
1/2 tsp. baking soda 1/2 tsp. salt
2 cups sugar
1 1/4 cups butter, softened
2 eggs
2 tsp. vanilla
2 Tbs. milk
Plain or colored sugar for decoration
Cream Cheese Icing
1 8 oz. pkg. cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
2-4 tsp. milk
1 tsp. vanilla
4 cups powdered sugar
Colored jimmies

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.  All ovens vary;  if your oven bakes hotter, preheat to a lower temp, 350-360.  Stir (not sift) together flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt.  In a separate mixing bowl, beat together sugar and butter until light and fluffy.  Add eggs and vanilla; beat well.  Add milk; beat until mixed in.  Gradually add flour mixture.  Drop by 1/4 cup, 2 inches apart, onto an ungreased, lined cookie sheet. Best to use a small cookie scoop for perfect symmetry.  Flatten slightly with sugar-coated glass bottom. Bake at 375 for 10-12 minutes, or 360 for 13-15 minutes.  Cookies are done when sides start to turn a golden brown.  Do not overbake.  Tops of cookies should look slightly "wet" when removed from oven.
For the icing, in a large bowl, beat cream cheese, butter, 2 tsp. milk, and vanilla until smooth.  Add powdered sugar 1 cup at a time on low speed.  Add milk to desired consistency.  After spreading on cookies, top with jimmies if desired.  Any remaining frosting can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.
