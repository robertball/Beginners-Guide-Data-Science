Ingredients:
2 Cups Long Grain White Rice
1 Tbs Canola or Vegetable Oil
1/2 of a White Onion, Diced
3 Green Onions, Diced
2 Cloves Garlic, Minced
1 15 oz Can Whole Peeled Tomatoes, Crushed
1 8 oz Can Tomato Sauce
4 Beef Boullion Cubes
1 1/2 Cups Water
Salt & Pepper To Taste

Directions:
In a large saucepan on medium high heat slightly brown the white rice in the oil.
Add white onion and garlic, cooking a few minutes more.
Add the tomatoes & juice too, making sure to crush each one by hand (watch out - they squirt everywhere!), also add the tomato sauce and boullion cubes.  Fill each of the cans about half full of water to rinse and pour into pan also.  Stir and bring to a low boil.  Use salt sparingly until the boullion dissolves!  Add pepper to taste.
Cover and turn down to simmer for about 15 minutes then stir in the green onion, cover again and check it in another 15 minutes.  If all the water is not absorbed continue to simmer covered checking every 10 minutes.
