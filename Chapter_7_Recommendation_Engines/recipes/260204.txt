Ingredients:
4 boneless pork loin chops, cut 1-inch thick
Salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 small yellow onion, cut into thin wedges
2 tablespoons butter, divided
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage leaves

Directions:
Trim excess fat from chops. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add pork chops. Cook 8 to 10 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted through the side into the centers registers 145 degrees F, turning once halfway through cooking. Remove from skillet. Cover with foil.
Add sweet potatoes and onion to the skillet with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Sprinkle with additional salt and ground black pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes or until sweet potatoes are tender and onions are caramelized.
To skillet, add garlic, remaining 1 tablespoon butter, brown sugar and sage; cook, stirring frequently, 2 minutes more. Return pork chops to skillet just to heat through.
