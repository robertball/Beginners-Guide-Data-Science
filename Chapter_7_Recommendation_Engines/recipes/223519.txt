Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole-wheat flour
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons lavender flowers
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup 1% milk
1/4 cup canola oil
1 egg, beaten
1 cup fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
Combine all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, lavender, and salt together in a bowl. Mix bananas, milk, canola oil, and egg together in a separate bowl. Add banana mixture to flour mixture; stir until just combined. Fold in blueberries. Spoon batter into prepared muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool muffins in tin for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

Description: 
These muffins are some of the best I've ever tasted. The lavender gives the flavor a slightly fresher taste, bringing out the vibrancy of the blueberries. You've got to try it! Serve warm with soft butter, if desired.
