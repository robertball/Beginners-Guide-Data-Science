Ingredients:
Cake:
1 (18.25 ounce) box Betty Crocker® SuperMoist® yellow cake mix
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
Tray (18x16 inches)
Frosting and Decoration:
3 drops green liquid food color
2 cups Betty Crocker® Rich & Creamy creamy white frosting
Betty Crocker® black decorating icing
Betty Crocker® green decorating icing

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F for shiny metal or glass pan (or 325 degrees F for dark or nonstick pan). Spray bottom only of 13x9-inch pan with baking spray with flour. Grease 1-quart ovenproof glass bowl with shortening; coat with flour (do not use baking spray).
In large bowl, beat cake mix, water, oil and eggs as directed on box. Pour 1 1/2 cups batter into 1-quart bowl and remaining batter into 13x9-inch pan.
Bake 13x9-inch pan 25 to 30 minutes and 1-quart bowl 30 to 35 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pan and bowl to cooling racks (place cake from bowl with rounded side up). Cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Cut domed top off 13x9-inch cake so top is flat. Cut off uneven bottom of cake from bowl so it will stand flat. Freeze cakes 1 hour.
On tray, place 13x9-inch cake. Stir food color into 1 1/2 cups of the white frosting; spread over cake.
Spread remaining 1/2 cup white frosting over rounded side of other cake for soccer ball. Place ball on green field. Use black decorating icing to create soccer ball design. Use green decorating icing to make tufts of grass. Store loosely covered at room temperature.
