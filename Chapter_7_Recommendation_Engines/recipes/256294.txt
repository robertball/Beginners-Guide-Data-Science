Ingredients:
4 red or yellow bell peppers, seeded and halved
1 yellow banana pepper, seeded and halved
1 poblano pepper, seeded and halved
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and halved
1 large onion, quartered
4 large garlic cloves, peeled
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 quart chicken broth
1 bunch cilantro, chopped, plus leaves for garnish
1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 (14.5 ounce) cans Hunt'sÂ® Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes, undrained
Salt to taste
Garnish:
Crumbled Cotija cheese
Cilantro leaves
Lime wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper.
Place peppers, onion and garlic on prepared pan; drizzle with olive oil. Roast in preheated oven until peppers are soft and slightly charred, about 20 minutes.
Heat broth in a large soup pot. Add chopped cilantro, oregano, cumin, sugar, freshly ground pepper, and Hunt's Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes. Bring to a simmer.
Add roasted peppers, onions and garlic to the tomato mixture. Using a hand held immersion blender, puree the soup until smooth. Simmer over low heat until hot, about 10 minutes.
Serve garnished with Cotija cheese, cilantro and drizzled with lime juice.
