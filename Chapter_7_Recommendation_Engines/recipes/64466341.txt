Ingredients:
10 oz. frozen spinach
1/4 lb. crumbled feta
fresh ground pepper
dash nutmeg
dusting of flour
1 sheet puff pastry
2 cloves pressed garlic

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 F.
Thaw spinach and drain it, squeezing out the excess liquid. Mix spinach, pepper, feta, garlic and nutmeg in a bowl.
Dust a counter top with flour and lay the pastry sheet flat on it. Flour the top of the dough and roll it out until it is about half as thick and about 1' by 2'. Cut into 3" strips, making (32) 3" squares. Make sure they are well-floured and stack them in a pile.
Fill a dish with tepid water. Place a few teaspoons of filling on the top half, moisten the edges with water. Fold the bottom half to meet the top. Use a fork or any other sharp, pointy object you have nearby to seal the edges.
Place on a baking sheet and cook for 15 minutes until golden brown and fluffy. Serve warm.They will be all the rage at your next party!
