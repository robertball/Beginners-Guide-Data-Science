Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, cut into serving-sized pieces
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 ounces small shallots, peeled
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, cut in quarters
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup SwansonÂ® Beef Stock
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1 lemon
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Season the beef with the salt and black pepper.
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until well browned on all sides. Remove the beef from the skillet. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat.
Add the shallots to the skillet. Cook for 10 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, mushrooms and flour and cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes.
Stir the stock, vinegar and brown sugar in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth.  Stir the stock mixture in the skillet and heat to a boil.  Return the beef to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 1 1/2 hours.
Uncover the skillet and cook for 30 minutes or until the beef is fork-tender and the vegetables are tender.
Grate 2 tablespoons zest from the lemon. Stir the lemon zest and parsley in a small bowl.  Sprinkle the lemon zest mixture over the beef mixture.
