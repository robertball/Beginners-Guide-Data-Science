Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 pounds boneless beef sirloin steak or top round steak, 3/4-inch thick, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups PaceÂ® Chunky Salsa, any variety
1/2 cup water

1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 (15 ounce) can red kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 6-quart saucepot over medium-high heat. Add the beef in 2 batches and cook until it's well browned, stirring often. Remove the beef from the saucepot.
Add the remaining oil and heat over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it's tender. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.
Add the salsa, water, chili powder and cumin. Heat to a boil. Return the beef to the saucepot. Stir in the beans. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 1 hour. Uncover and cook for 30 minutes or until the beef is fork-tender.
Sprinkle with the cilantro, if desired.
