Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package jumbo pasta shells
⅓ cup grated carrot
¼ cup shredded zucchini
3 tablespoons chopped onion
1 (8 ounce) container tofu
½ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
½ cup ricotta cheese
1  egg white
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper
2 (8 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
⅓ cup tomato paste
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon minced garlic

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat combine carrot, zucchini and onion.  Pour in just enough water to cover; cook until tender and drain.
In a large bowl, mash the tofu with a fork.  Stir in carrot mixture, Monterey Jack cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, egg while, salt and pepper.  Mix well and set aside.
In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, garlic powder and garlic.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.
Stuff each cooked pasta shell with about 1 rounded tablespoon of the filling.  Place shells in an un greased 2-quart baking dish.  Pour sauce over shells.
Cover and bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until heated through.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.
