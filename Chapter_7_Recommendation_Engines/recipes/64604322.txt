Ingredients:
1 24oz can Hunts Spaghetti sauce (I used Traditional)
6oz can tomato paste
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic salt
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon chili flake

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and whisk together, simmer over med-low for about 10 minutes to allow the herbs to absorb moisture and the sauce to absorb the herb flavors.
Spread on your favorite pizza dough or refrigerate up to 5 days before using.  (better if made a day ahead)  Makes enough for 8 to 10 medium pizzas.
freezes well, too!  Store airtight and freeze for up to 4 months.
