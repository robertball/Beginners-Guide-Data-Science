Ingredients:
1 large onion, chopped (about 2 1/2 cups)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 yellow or red pepper, diced
2 tablespoons garlic
1 cup water
1 can diced tomatoes not drained
2 tablespoons ketchup (or tomato paste)
2 teaspoons Worcestershire (or A-1) sauce
2 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 (15 1/2-ounce) cans black beans (not drained)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 bunch cilantro
1 tablespoon lime juice
Green onions for garnish
Sour cream, for garnish
Chihuahua cheese, grated, for garnish

Directions:
Add onions and olive oil into large soup pot. Cook, stirring, until they start to turn translucent. Stir in the garlic and yellow pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add water, tomatoes (with juice from can), ketchup, Worcestershire (or A-1), and chili powder. Stir in the black beans (and juice from can), turn the heat to high and bring to a boil. Turn down heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Add red pepper flakes and season with salt and pepper.
Chop the cilantro coarsely and stir it into the soup. Blend with immersion blender until smooth, but still slightly chunky.  Place back on medium heat and cook until the soup is thickened. Stir in the lime juice and top with sour cream, cheese, and green onions.
