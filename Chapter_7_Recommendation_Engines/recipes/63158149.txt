Ingredients:
5-6 pounds corned beef brisket
5 black peppercorns
2 tablespoons pickling spice
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 onion, peeled and left whole
2 bay leaves
1 pinch salt
1 small head cabbage, cored and cut into wedges
1 small turnip, cut into cubes
6 large potatoes, quartered
4 large carrots, peeled and sliced
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
In a 6 quart Dutch oven, Place the beef brisket, peppercorns, pickling spice, garlic powder, onion, bay leaves and salt. Fill pan with water to cover everything plus one inch. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes. Skim off any residue that floats to the top. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 2 to 3 hours, until meat can be pulled apart with a fork.
Once the meat is done, add the cabbage, potatoes, turnip and carrots, pressing them down into the liquid. Simmer for an additional 30 minutes or until the turnips and potatoes are tender. Skim off any oil that comes to the surface. Stir in the butter and parsley. Remove the pot from the heat.
Remove meat from the pot and place onto a serving dish and let rest for 15 minutes. Also remove vegetables to a bowl and keep warm. Slice meat on the diagonal against the grain. Serve meat on a platter and spoon juices over meat and vegetables.
