NA
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2  onions, diced
4 cloves garlic, peeled
2 tablespoons garam masala, or to taste
1 tablespoon paprika
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
2 tablespoons tomato paste
4 (6 ounce) packages fresh spinach

Directions:
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, season with salt and pepper, and cook until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add onions, and grate in garlic. Cook and stir until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir garam masala, paprika, and a bit more salt into the skillet. Stir in tomatoes and tomato paste. Add a couple handfuls of spinach; cook until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat until all spinach is incorporated into the sauce. Cover and simmer until flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
Our family loves Indian food, but many authentic Indian recipes are complicated and time-consuming, with a zillion ingredients and millions of steps. This recipe is simple and straightforward. While it may not be authentic, it satisfies our Indian cravings in a pinch! Serve over basmati rice with a side of naan.
