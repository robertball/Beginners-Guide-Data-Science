Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups sugar
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 1/4 cups mashed bananas
3/4 cup orange juice
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the sugar, oil and eggs; mix well. Stir in bananas and orange juice. Combine the dry ingredients; add to banana mixture, beating just until moistened. Stir in walnuts. Pour into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 325 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I like this recipe because the orange juice gives the nut bread such a unique flavor and also makes it moist.
