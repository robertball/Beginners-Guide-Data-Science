Ingredients:
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 large egg whites at room temperature.
2 large egg whites
3/4 cup milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/8 teaspoons cream of tartar

Directions:
Place oven rack at the middle level and preheat to 350 degrees.
Butter the bottom of two 9-inch round pans. Line bottom with parchment paper.
Mix together flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar for about 3 minutes, add 2 egg whites and vanilla extract and beat until light and fluffy.
Add about 1/3 of the flour mixture to the butter mixture then add half the milk. Continue to alternate beginning and ending with flour mixture. Scrape the bowl and beater often.
In a separate bowl, beat the remaining egg whites until foamy using only medium-low or medium speed.  Add the cream of tartar and increase the speed to medium-high and then to high until the stiff peaks form. With a rubber spatula stir a little of the whites into the batter to lighten it, then fold in the remaining whites until combined.  Do not over-mix the batter or it will deflate.
Pour the batter into prepared pans and smooth top with metal spatula. Bake about 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center emerges clean.
Cool in pan on rack for 5 minutes, then turn out onto a rack, remove paper and let cool completely.
