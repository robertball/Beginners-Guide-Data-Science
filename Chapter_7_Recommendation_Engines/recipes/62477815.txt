Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - chopped
1/2 pound adouille sausage, thinly sliced
1 cup butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons minced garlic
3 quarts low sodium chicken broth
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
6 stalks celery, diced
4 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
1 sweet onion, sliced
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, with liquid
3 jalapenos, seeded and diced
1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped
1/4 cup Cajun seasoning

Directions:
Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat, and cook chicken until no longer pink and juices run clear. Stir in sausage, and cook until evenly browned. Drain chicken and sausage, and set aside.
In a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat, blend butter and flour to create a roux. Stir constantly until browned and bubbly. Mix in garlic, and cook about 1 minute.
Gradually stir chicken broth and beer into the roux mixture. Bring to a boil, and mix in celery, tomatoes, sweet onion, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, jalapenos, parsley, and Cajun seasoning. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer about 40 minutes, stirring often.
Mix chicken, sausage, and shrimp into the broth mixture. Cook, stirring frequently, about 20 minutes.
Place large scoop of rice in bowl, ladle gumbo over the top.
