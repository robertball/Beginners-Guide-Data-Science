Ingredients:
2 large russet potatoes, scrubbed
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Poke each potato with the tines of a fork. Place the potatoes in a microwave oven, and cook on high power for about 5 minutes. Check about halfway through, and turn potatoes over for even cooking. Slice each potato in half the long way and cook potatoes another 2 minutes on high power.
Preheat a grill for medium heat.
Brush the potato tops with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Cook on prepared grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once.

Description: 
These are like a baked potato, but better! This recipe is so simple and makes a delicious side dish, a 'baked' potato that is soft in the middle and perfectly grilled on the outside.  We dip ours in sour cream and green onions!
