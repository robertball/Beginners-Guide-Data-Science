For the Green Empress Dressing:
1 (8.5 ounce) can sweet peas, drained
1 cup fresh herb leaves (parsley, chive, basil and/or mint)
2 scallions, trimmed and coarsely chopped
2 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup low-fat buttermilk
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons white, distilled vinegar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Kosher salt, to taste
For the Salad:
3 large ripe tomatoes, each cut in 6 slices
2 small avocados, pitted and peeled, each cut in 9 wedges
18 slices low-fat mozzarella
Kosher salt and ground black pepper, to taste
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
To make the dressing, puree all of the dressing ingredients in a blender or food processor until smooth.
Alternate the tomato slices, avocado wedges and mozzarella slices on a serving platter or 6 individual plates. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle half the dressing over salad and garnish with lemon wedges. Serve the remaining dressing on the side.
