Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 cup chilled butter, diced
1 1/4 cups whole milk

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a bowl.  Cut in the cold butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add milk a little at a time, stirring lightly between additions.
Drop the batter by spoonfuls onto a cookie sheet, and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the tops are golden.
