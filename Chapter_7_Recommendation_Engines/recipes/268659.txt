Ingredients:
1 baguette, cut into 1/2-inch slices
3 tablespoons yellow mustard
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 1/2 pounds Swiss cheese, sliced, divided
4 ounces dill pickle slices
1 pound honey ham, sliced
1 pound cooked pork loin, sliced
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a cooling rack on a rimmed baking sheet.
Mix yellow and Dijon mustards together and spread evenly over baguette slices. Top 1/2 of the bread slices with 1/2 of the Swiss cheese and place on the rack on the baking sheet. Top each with pickle slices, ham, pork loin, and remaining cheese. Top sandwiches with remaining baguette slices.
Spread mayonnaise over the tops of the sandwiches and sprinkle with garlic powder. Spray the bottom of a second baking pan with cooking spray and place upside-down on top of the sandwiches.  Weigh down the top pan with a heavy, oven-safe item such as a cast iron skillet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove top pan and bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes more.
