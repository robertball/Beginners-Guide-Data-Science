Description: 
This is a play on two of the favorite Indian dishes, chicken tikka and tandoori chicken. A random person at a South Asian grocery store gave me this idea, and it's a hit. We just had a potluck at work and I got excellent reviews on the overall taste of this dish. However, I received mixed reviews on the spiciness of this dish, so cater it to your taste buds.
