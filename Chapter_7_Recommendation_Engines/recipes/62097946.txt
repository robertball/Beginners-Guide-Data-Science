Ingredients:
4 cups fresh baby spinach
2 cups halved grape tomatoes
1 cup (or to taste) thinly sliced red onion
1/3 cup pine nuts
1/4 cup crumbled French Feta (or goat cheese)
1 1/2 cups freshly made croutons (instructions below)
1 TBSP extra virgin olive oil
(salt/pepper/garlic powder to taste)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Cut grape tomatoes in half and place cut side down on a lightly olived oiled cookie sheet or baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper & garlic powder. Roast for 10-15 minutes or just until tops are shrivled. Pour over spianch, toss.
In the meantime saute onion and pine nuts over low/medium heat until pine nuts are lightly browned and onion is translucent and soft, tossing frequently. Pour over spinach, toss.
To make croutons: Slice about 3-4 slices of sour dough bread then cube. Place in ziploc bag, drizzle with olive oil (about a tablespoon or so) then sprinkle with salt, pepper & garlic powder. Preheat frying pan over medium heat, cook cubes until lightly browned, tossing frequently. When done, pour over spinach, toss.
Crumble cheese, pour over spinach, toss.
Drizzle 1 TBSP olive oil over salad, toss.
If you time it right, each phase will be done right after the other. Usually I start the tomatoes, then the onions/pine nuts, then the bread. Keep in mind that all of these ingredients can be lessened or increased to be the perfect amount for your personal taste.
