Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
2 cups peeled and cubed potatoes
2 carrots, grated
1 small onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cubes beef bouillon, crumbled
1 pound ground beef
2 1/2 cups milk, divided
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 pound processed American cheese, cubed
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine water, potatoes, carrots, onion, bell pepper, jalapeno and garlic.  Sprinkle salt and bouillon over the mixture.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, until potatoes are tender.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook beef until brown; drain.
Stir cooked beef and 2 cups milk into the soup and heat through.  Combine remaining 1/2 cup milk with flour, stirring until smooth; stir into soup.  Bring to a low boil and cook, stirring, until thickened, 3 minutes.
Reduce heat to low and stir in cheese until melted.  Season with cayenne.

Description: 
Wonderful soup for those cold, rainy or snowy days!  My family absolutely loves this hearty soup. The warming zip of cayenne gives it a taste all its own.  This is also excellent to reheat in the microwave for a fast meal.
