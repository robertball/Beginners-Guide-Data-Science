Scant 1/8 tsp baking powder
Scant 1/8 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 (1 stick)softened butter
1/3 cup (21/2 oz) light brown sugar
3 tbls (11/4 oz) sugar
1 egg
Scant 1 cup (31/2 oz) rolled oats
Crust:
Crumbled cookie for crust
1/4 (1/2 stick butter)
11/2 tbls (3/4 oz) brown sugar
1/8 tsp salt
Filling:
11/2 cups (101/2 oz sugar)
3/4 cup plus scant 3 tablespoons (7 oz) light brown sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/3 cup plus 1 tsp (3/4 oz) milk powder
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, melted
3/4 cup plus a scant 2 tbls heavy cream
1 tsp vanilla extract
8 egg yolks
2 prepared crusts
Powdered sugar, garnish

Directions:
This pie calls for 2 (10inch) pie tins. You can substitute 9 inch pie tins but the pies will require additional baking time, about 5 mins due to the increased thickness of the filling.
Cookie for crust:
Heat oven to 375 degrees.
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
In the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using and electric mixer, beat the butter, brown sugar and sugar until light and fluffly.
Whisk the egg into the butter mixture until fully incorporated.
With the mixer running, beat the flour mixture, a little at a time until fully combined. Stir in the oats until incorporated.
Spread the mixtue onto a 9x13 inch baking sheet and bake until golden brown and set, 20 mins. Remove from heat and cool to the touch on a rack. Crumble the cooled cookie to use in the crust.
Crust:
Combine the crumbled cookie, butter, brown sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse until evenly combined and blended (a little of the mixture clumped between your fingers shous hold together).  Divide the crust between the two pie tins.  Press the crust into each shell to form a thin even layer along the bottom and sides of the tins.
Filling:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, brown sugar, salt and milk powder.  Whisk in the melted butter, then whisk in the heavy cream and vanilla.
Gently whisk the egg yolks, being careful not to add too much air.  Divide the filling evenly between the 2 pie shells.
Bake the pies, one at a time for 15 mins, then reduce the heat to 325 degrees and bake until the filling is slightly jiggly and golden brown (similar to a pecan pie), about 10 mins.  Cool on a rack.
Refrigerate until well chilled. Serve cold.  Dust with powdered sugar
