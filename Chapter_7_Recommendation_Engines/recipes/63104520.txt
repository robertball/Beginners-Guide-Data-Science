Ingredients:
1 1/2 tsp oil
3/4 cup onions, minced
1 pound lean ground beef
1 pound lean ground turkey
1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs
1 large egg
1 large egg white
2 cups beef broth
1/4 tsp salt
1/8 tsp ground black pepper, to taste
8 oz sliced mushrooms
2 tbs all purpose flour
2 tbs tomato paste
1 tsp red wine vinegar
2 tsp worchestershire sauce
1/2 tsp mustard powder
1/4 cup water
chopped parsley for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Saute onions in oil over medium heat until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine half of the sauteed onions, ground beef, ground turkey, bread crumbs, egg, egg white, 1/4 cup beef broth, salt and black pepper.
Shape into 8 oval patties.  In a large deep skillet over medium-high heat, brown both sides of patties.  Set aside on a dish.  Add mushrooms to the skillet, season with salt and pepper and saute 2-3 minutes.  Return patties to the skillet with the mushrooms.
In a small bowl, blend flour and remaining broth until smooth.  Mix in remaining onions, tomato paste, vinegar, water, worchestershire sauce and mustard powder.  Pour over meat and mushrooms in skillet.
Cover and cook on low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
