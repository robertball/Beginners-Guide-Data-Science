1 teaspoon baking powder
3 eggs

Melt butter in 9x13-inch baking dish.
Trim broccoli and cut into florets. (frozen broccoli and spinach can be used; cook according to package instructions.) Steam partially cooked, about 5 minutes. Transfer to food processor or blender and chop finely.
Beat eggs well in large bowl. Add flour, milk, salt and baking powder and mix thoroughly. Stir in cheese, broccoli and onion.
Spoon into prepared dish, spreading evenly. Sprinkle with paprika.
Bake until set, about 30-35 minutes.
Let stand 5 minutes before cutting into bite-size pieces.

Description: 
Some might call this recipe a souffle.  I am ok with that.  It is a nice way to present broccoli as an appetizer.
