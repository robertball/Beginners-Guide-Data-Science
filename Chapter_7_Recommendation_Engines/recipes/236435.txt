2 cups chopped baby carrots
1 large onion, chopped
4 stalks celery, chopped
2 tablespoons dried thyme

1 teaspoon ground black pepper
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, chopped
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated biscuit dough, separated and chopped

Directions:
Combine water, carrots, onion, celery, thyme, rosemary, salt, and black pepper in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Add chicken to soup and cook until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
For a cold night or if you have a cold! My mom's Southern chicken and dumplings simplified with biscuit dough (preservative-free!) and boned chicken. It's also healthier with skinless chicken and added mirepoix. Adjust seasonings as necessary.
