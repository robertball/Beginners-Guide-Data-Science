Homemade Italian Sausage Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
1 to 2 Tablespoons chopped fresh garlic
2 Tablespoons ground paprika
2 teaspoons granulated onion (or onion powder)
2 teaspoons fennel seeds
1 teaspoon salt
10 to 12 grinds of fresh black pepper
2 heaping Tablespoons chopped fresh basil
2 heaping Tablespoons chopped fresh Italian flat leaf parsley
1 Tablespoon chopped fresh Greek oregano
A pinch or two of red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
In a medium bowl, use a wooden spoon or your clean hands to mix all the ingredients together until well combined. To taste, heat a few drops of oil in a small skillet and fry up a little bit of sausage. Try not to fry up too many samples.
Chill several hours or overnight if you have time. Use on pizza, tossed with pasta, or in any recipe that calls for Italian sausage. When I put it on pizza, I like to brown the sausage in a frying pan first so some of the pieces get nice and crunchy on the edges.
