Description: 
Stinging nettle is one of the most nutritious foods native to North America. I absolutely love it in soup, in place of basil in pesto, or simply steamed with butter. This is one of my favorite ways of preparing nettles, though. With cream and cheese, how can one go wrong? Serve as a side dish with fried oysters or in a small bowl on its own. A dollop of creme fraiche or ricotta cheese on top would be classy.
