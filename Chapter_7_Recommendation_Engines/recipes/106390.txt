Ingredients:
Cake
1 3/4 cups sifted cake flour
1/2 cup SPLENDA® Sugar Blend
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup butter, softened
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1/3 cup 1% low-fat milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Custard
1 tablespoon SPLENDA® Sugar Blend
1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup 1% low-fat milk
2 egg yolks, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Glaze
6 tablespoons whipping cream
4 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, finely chopped

Directions:
Cake Directions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease and flour 2 (8-inch) cake pans. Set aside.
Combine flour, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture with a fork or a pastry blender until crumbly. (This procedure may be done with a mixer at the lowest speed. Cover mixing bowl with a clean tea towel to prevent spattering).
Combine eggs, milk, and vanilla in a small mixing bowl; add 1/3 of the egg mixture to flour mixture. Beat at low speed of an electric mixer until blended. Beat at medium speed for 30 seconds or until batter is smooth, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl. Repeat procedure 2 times.
Spoon batter evenly into prepared pans.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pans on wire racks 10 minutes; remove from pans, and cool on wire racks.
Custard Directions: Combine SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, cornstarch, and salt in a heavy saucepan, mixing well. Gradually whisk milk into SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend mixture. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and bubbly. Remove from heat.
Beat egg yolks until thick and pale. Gradually whisk 1/2 cup of hot custard mixture into yolks; return to remaining hot custard mixture, whisking constantly. Cook over medium heat for 1 minute or until mixture comes to a boil, whisking constantly. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla. Cover with plastic wrap, gently pressing on filling. Cool slightly.
Glaze Directions: Heat whipping cream in a small saucepan until cream is thoroughly warmed; stir in chocolate. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until chocolate melts.
Spread custard filling between layers. Spread Chocolate Glaze over top.
