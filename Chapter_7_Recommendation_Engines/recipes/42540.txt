1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

3 tablespoons cold butter or margarine, divided

Jelly (optional)

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in peanut butter and 2 tablespoons butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Beat the eggs and milk; stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full.
Bake at 400 degrees for 15-17 minutes or until muffins test done.
Melt remaining butter; brush over the tops of muffins. Sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. Cool for 10 minutes; remove to a wire rack. Serve with jelly if desired.
