Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups margarine
1 1/4 cups white sugar
4 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup cornstarch
1 cup ground hazelnuts
6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.
Cream margarine and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Mix flour, cornstarch, hazelnuts, and cocoa powder in a separate bowl and quickly mix into the margarine mixture. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely before dusting with confectioners' sugar.
