Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1  onion, minced
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon dry mustard
8  tomatoes, diced
4 cloves garlic, crushed
2 teaspoons garam masala
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup frozen peas
Â¼ cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, curry powder, and dry mustard in the hot oil until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, garlic, garam masala, cumin, and salt; simmer over medium-low heat until tomatoes have broken down and ingredients have blended, about 40 minutes.
Cook and stir chicken into tomato mixture until chicken is cooked and no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. Add peas and cook for 1 more minute. Remove from heat. Sprinkle with cilantro.
