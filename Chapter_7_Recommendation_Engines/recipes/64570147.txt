Ingredients:
1 (24 ounce) package frozen shredded hashbrown potatoes
½ large onion, chopped
1 (10.5 ounce) can cream mushroom soup
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 (8 ounce package cream cheese
¼ cup butter (half stick)
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine potatoes, onion, soup, and cheddar cheese. Stir to combine.
Place the mixture in a lightly greased slow cooker.
Place cream cheese, butter, and salt & pepper on top of potato mixture.
Cook on low for 4-6 hours, stirring occasionally (I never stir more than once per hour). 4 hours will give you a slightly more runny and gooey Crock pot Cheesy Hash-brown Casserole, as pictured. 6 hours will give you a slightly more crispy dish.
Serve warm.
