Ingredients:
16oz frozen green peas
2c cooked red lentils
2c cooked red rice
1c diced celery
2 chopped scallions
canola oil
curry
salt
hot red pepper flakes
cilantro
dill weed
garlic powder
ginger

Directions:
Place peas, celery, and scallions in a large frying pan with just enough oil to coat them and the bottom of the pan but to leave no excess.  Place this on high heat.
Once the peas have defrosted & warmed, turn the heat down to medium heat.  Add in the lentils and rice, stirring rapidly with a metal spoon until the red lentils are no longer in clumps but rather evenly spread throughout.
Add to taste: curry (generously), salt, red pepper flakes, cilantro, dill weed, garlic powder, and ginger (sparingly).  Leave on heat for an additional 5-10 minutes, then remove and serve.
