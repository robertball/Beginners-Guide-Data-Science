Description: 
Quick and easy, yet good enough to win a couple pie baking contests, or be raffled off at a spaghetti dinner! I ask for this every year for my birthday cake (= As always, you can make this more diet friendly by subbing nonfat milk or sugar free, fat free pudding [I always do!]. You may also use crunchy peanut butter, or different [i.e chocolate] flavors of pudding, if desired. My preference is always creamy peanut butter and vanilla pudding!
