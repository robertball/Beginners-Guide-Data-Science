Ingredients:
1 cup sour cream
3/4 cup whole milk
2/3 cup superfine sugar
3 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup chopped canned pears
1 cup canned crushed pineapple, drained
1 (16 ounce) can sweet potatoes, drained and cut into chunks
4 cups French bread cubes
1/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon freshly grated orange zest
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 1 quart casserole dish.
In a large bowl, whisk together the sour cream, milk, sugar, eggs, baking powder, ginger and vanilla. Stir in the pears, pineapple and sweet potatoes just to coat, then add the bread cubes and mix until evenly distributed. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, stir together the brown sugar, flour and orange zest. Briefly stir in the butter and pecans. Sprinkle over the top of the bread pudding.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until evenly puffed up and browned.
