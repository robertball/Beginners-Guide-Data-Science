Description: 
This is a quick and easy dessert with canned pie filling and white cake mix that I've made for years. You can make a cherry version by substituting cherry pie filling and yellow cake mix. Serve warm with vanilla bean ice cream and enjoy! Walnuts may be used instead of pecans, if desired.
