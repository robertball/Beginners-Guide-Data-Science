Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter, divided
1 shallot, minced
1/2 red pepper, diced
1/2 green pepper, diced
1 green onion, sliced
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 zucchini, diced
2 cups sweet corn, fresh or frozen
2 tablespoons water
4 teaspoons Cajun or Creole seasoning, divided
1/3 cup half and half
20 jumbo shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed

Directions:
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallot, red and green peppers, and green onion. Season with salt and pepper, and saute until soft, about 5 minutes.
Add zucchini, sweet corn, water and 2 teaspoons Cajun or creole seasoning to the skillet. Cook until zucchini is tender, about 2 minutes. Add half and half, and stir. Turn off heat.
Meanwhile, season shrimp with remaining 2 teaspoons Cajun or creole seasoning. Melt butter in a separate skillet and cook shrimp in four batches, about 2 minutes on each side, or until curled, pink and cooked all the way through. Do not overcook.
Divide corn mixture between four plates. Top each plate with 5 cooked shrimp, and serve immediately.

Description: 
A spicy Southern dish, Shrimp & Sweet Corn Maque Choux is satisfying and ready in under 30 minutes. This is my recreation of the Emeril Lagasse dish we had his restaurant, NOLA, in New Orleans. Fresh vegetables are the key to this recipe, which cook quickly and retain their bright, crisp flavors.
