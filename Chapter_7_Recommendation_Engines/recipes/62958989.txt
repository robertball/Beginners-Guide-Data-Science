Ingredients:
3 cups fresh pumpkin seeds, cleaned & dried
3 T butter
3 ½ tsp. vanilla bean sugar
3 tsp. cinnamon
½ tsp. sugar
½ tsp. pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Heat your oven to 275°.
Melt the butter in your microwave and place the seeds in a mixing bowl.  Pour the melted butter over the seeds and stir to coat well.  Add 1 tsp. of vanilla bean sugar, 1 tsp. of cinnamon, all of your regular sugar, & the vanilla extract.  Stir again, to coat evenly.
Spread the seeds evenly over a baking sheet (I use a ¼ sheet pan), and sprinkle another teaspoon of the vanilla bean sugar & cinnamon over the seeds, and set in to the oven.
After 30 minutes, remove the seeds, stir around & spread evenly once more, sprinkle with another teaspoon of vanilla bean sugar & cinnamon, then return to the oven for 30 more minutes.
Remove your seeds from the oven and sprinkle the last ½ tsp. of vanilla bean sugar on top, return seeds to the oven for 5 more minutes.
Take your seeds out of the oven for the last time, and serve warm.
