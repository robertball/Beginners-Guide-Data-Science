Description: 
My kids love the drinkable yogurt drinks, but they're so expensive. These taste the same for a fraction of the price and couldn't be any easier to make. You can substitute fresh or frozen fruit for the jam if you like, but this does affect the texture some and if your kids are picky like mine are, every little change is a potential issue. You can experiment with using more or less jam depending on your own personal taste. If your family is very picky about texture, you can just add about a tablespoon or so of DRY gelatin powder (any flavor) INSTEAD of the jam and you'll get the absolute smoothest shake (plus you'll have that lovely artificial color that some kids seem to think is necessary).
