Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter, or as needed
1 ½ cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1  onion, chopped
2 cups chicken stock, divided
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
2 cups plain Greek yogurt
4 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese, cut into pieces
½ pound shredded cooked chicken, or more to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms and onions in hot butter until soft and caramelized, about 5 minutes.
Pour 1/2 cup chicken stock into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
Gradually stir flour into mushroom mixture; cook and stir until light golden brown, about 30 seconds. Add remaining chicken stock to mushroom mixture; simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
Stir yogurt into sauce; add cream cheese and stir until cheese melts and sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir chicken into sauce and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
The Greek yogurt gives the same tang as sour cream and the low-fat cream cheese adds thickness. My family didn't know the difference. Just made sure your yogurt is plain and not strawberry like I almost got. Serve over noodles or rice.
