1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
2 carrots, peeled and shredded
1 mango - peeled, seeded, and diced
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1/3 cup nonfat plain yogurt
2 tablespoons reduced-fat mayonnaise
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon agave nectar
salt and black pepper to taste
1 dash habanero hot sauce, or more to taste

Directions:
Toss the cabbage, red bell pepper, red onion, carrots, mango, and cilantro together in a large bowl.
Whisk the yogurt, mayonnaise, mustard, cider vinegar, agave nectar, salt, pepper, and hot sauce together in a small bowl; pour over the cabbage mixture and toss to coat. Allow the slaw to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to combine.
