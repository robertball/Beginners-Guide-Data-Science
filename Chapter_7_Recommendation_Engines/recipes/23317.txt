Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans red beans, with liquid
1 (15 ounce) can red beans, drained
1/2 pound smoked ham hock
5 1/4 cups water, divided
2 cups uncooked long-grain rice
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
5 tablespoons lard

Directions:
In a 2 quart saucepan combine 1 drained can of bean, 1 undrained can of beans, ham hock and remaining 1 1/4 cup water.  Simmer on medium heat for 1 hour, until the meat starts to come away from the bone.  Remove from heat and cool until meat can be handled to be removed from bone.
In a saucepan bring  4 cups water to a boil.  Add rice and stir.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
In a food processor combine meat, beans and the liquid in which they cooked.  To the mixture add onion powder, garlic salt, red pepper, salt, black pepper and lard.  Process for 4 seconds.  Beans should be chopped and the liquid thick.
To the food processor add the third can of drained beans.  Process for 1 or 2 seconds, so that most of the beans remain almost whole.  Pour mixture back into saucepan and cook slowly on low, stirring often, until heated through.
Serve over cooked rice.

Description: 
Believe it or not the secret to many bean dishes is lard.  Red beans are simmered, slowly, with ham hock.  Then the beans and meat are processed in a food processor with spices and lard.  The beans are reheated and served over rice.
