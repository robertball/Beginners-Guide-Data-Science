Description: 
If you like cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower, you're sure to like Romanesco too! It has a slightly sweet, nutty taste. The fact that it looks so beautiful is a bonus. In this recipe it is simply blanched in boiling water, then pan-fried in butter and flavored with garlic and parsley.
