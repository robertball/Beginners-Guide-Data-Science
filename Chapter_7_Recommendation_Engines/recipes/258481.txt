Ingredients:
1 zucchini, grated
1 carrot, grated
salt, or to taste
3 slices bacon
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1 egg
1/4 cup almond flour
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 tablespoons coconut oil

Directions:
Sprinkle zucchini and carrot with salt and drain in a colander.
Place bacon in a skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble into small pieces.
Cook and stir onions in the same skillet over medium heat until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Rinse zucchini and carrot; remove excess liquid by squeezing through cheese cloth or paper towels.
Place zucchini, carrot, bacon, egg, onion, almond flour, garlic, and Italian seasoning in a large bowl. Mix evenly. Form a 1/2-inch thick patty using 1/4 cup of the mixture. Repeat with remaining patty mix.
Heat coconut oil over medium-high heat and cook patties until browned, about 4 minutes per side.
