Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups sugar
1 quart whole milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 cup
1 stick of cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup chopped pecans
whole pecan halves (about 24 for garnish)
a buttered pan (9 x 9) and set aside

Directions:
Place sugar, milk, vanilla, baking soda, and cinnamon stick in a large heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring continuously.  Place a candy thermometer in the pan and cook until thermometer reaches soft ball stage or until you can see the bottom of the pan when you stir the candy. Candy needs to be well-cooked(but not burn) in order for it to harden properly. After about 20 minutes remove the cinnamon stick. Once the candy is ready remove from heat, add chopped pecans and beat with mixer for about 5 minutes.  Pour candy into pan. Press pecans onto top of candy while still hot. Allow to cool, then cut into pieces. Makes 1 pound. Store in air tight container.
