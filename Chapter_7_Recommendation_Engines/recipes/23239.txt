Ingredients:
2 tablespoons LAND O LAKESÂ® Butter
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh garlic
8 (1/2-inch thick) pork chops
1 (28 ounce) can whole tomatoes, undrained, cut up
1 teaspoon dried basil leaves
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 medium green bell pepper, cut into rings
1 medium onion, cut into rings

Directions:
Melt butter in 4-quart saucepan until sizzling; stir in garlic.  Add 4 pork chops.  Cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until browned on both sides (4 to 6 minutes).  Remove from pan; set aside. Repeat with remaining pork chops.
Return pork chops to pan.  Stir in tomatoes, basil, salt and pepper.  Cook over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a boil (3 to 4 minutes).  Reduce heat to low.  Cover; cook, stirring occasionally, until pork chops are no longer pink (50 to 60 minutes).  Remove pork chops; keep warm.
Stir together water and cornstarch in small bowl.  Stir cornstarch mixture into hot tomato mixture in pan with wire whisk.  Add green pepper and onion.
Increase heat to medium-high.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thickened and vegetables are crisply tender (5 to 6 minutes).  Serve sauce over pork chops.
