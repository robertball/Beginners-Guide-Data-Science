Ingredients:
2-3 pounds smoked turkey necks
2-3 bunches collard greens
1 Tblspoon dried Red pepper seeds
1/2 Cup Basalmic vinegar
1/4 Cup olive oil
1 Tblspoon dried or botted roasted garlic
1 Tblspoon sea salt flakes, or to taste

Directions:
Parboil the turkey necks for about 30 minutes and rinse well with cold water.
Rinse collards to remove sand/soil. Then trim and tear the collard greens into large pieces. Rinse again and use the clean water on the greens instead of adding extra water.
Alternate layers of greens with turkey necks until the slow cooker is full. Add the vinegar, olive oil, pepper seeds and garlic.
Cover, and bring to a boil on High.
Stir to mix in seasonings. Add more liquid if needed. (see footnotes)
Reduce heat to Low, and cook for 8 to 10 hours.
