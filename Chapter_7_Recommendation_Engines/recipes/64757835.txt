Ingredients:
2 boxes chocolate cake mix
2 small boxes of instant chocolate pudding mix
2 1/2 cups espresso infused water or cool coffee
2/3 cup oil
6 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tubs vanilla frosting
2 packages Oreos
1 package gummy worms(optional)

Directions:
Place all boxes of cake and pudding mixes into a large mixing bowl and blend together with a whisk.
Add espresso water (or cool coffee), oil, eggs and vanilla into dry mix and stir fully blended.
Split evenly into two 8" wide by 3" high pans, that have been buttered and lightly floured. Bake at 350Â° for 50/55 minutes.
Check with toothpick in center for doneness. While baking prepare frosting.
Pulverize one package Oreos(either by placing into large ziplock bag, tightly closing then using rolling pin to crush or a food processor) and mix with two tubs of frosting.
Cool cakes after they are done on a wire rack. Level cakes with a serrated knife for stacking ease.
Place first cool cake on cake cardboard circle, put a dab of frosting on bottom beforehand to insure no slippage while decorating.
Add Oreo frosting to middle approximately one inch thick.
Place second cooled cake on top.
Take the last vanilla frosting tub and crumb coat the cake then place in fridge to harden for about 20/30 minutes.
Add the rest of the Oreo frosting to top and sides of cake.
Add green food coloring to remaining normal vanilla frosting and pipe "grass"  around border.
Pulverize second Oreo package and top cake with "dirt".
Take handfuls of "dirt" and press lightly onto sides.
Add gummy worms to top if desired.
