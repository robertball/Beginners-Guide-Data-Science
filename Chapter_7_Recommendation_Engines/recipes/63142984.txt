Dash crushed red pepper

Directions:
1. Get a large pot of hot water heating and begin cooking the macaroni as per the directions on the macaroni package.

Description: 
Rachael Ray has nothing on my mother. As far as this family is concerned, my mom invented healthful, delicious comfort food that one can cook in 30 minutes or less. This hamburger and macaroni dish has been served in our house at least twice a month for the last 45 years. We even have a special name for it - HMO (HamburgerMacaroniOnions). Dad gets a song in his voice when he announces that we're having HMO for dinner. And it only takes 20 minutes to make.
