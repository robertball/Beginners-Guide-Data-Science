Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon cold water, or more as needed

Directions:
Beat butter in a bowl in a stand mixer until smooth and creamy.
Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt together in a bowl. Slowly add flour mixture to butter and beat using the paddle attachment. Add just enough cold water to mixture until dough pulls away from the side of bowl.
Form dough into 3-inch balls and flatten each with a press or between 2 small plates covered in plastic wrap.
Heat a skillet over medium heat and cook dough until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

Description: 
Light blend of whole wheat and all-purpose flours make a light, lower fat, and easy alternative to a basic flour tortilla. 
This recipe came together one afternoon when I ran out of tortillas midway through a dish I was making. The family enjoyed them so much, I will make them from scratch from now on.
