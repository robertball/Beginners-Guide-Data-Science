Ingredients:
5 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup shortening
1 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
3/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 cups lukewarm buttermilk

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Allow to stand until mixture is frothy.
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and soda.  Add shortening and work until crumbly.  Mix in yeast mixture and buttermilk.  Store, well covered, in a greased bowl in the refrigerator.  Don't worry if it is a little sticky; it will firm up as it chills.  Dough can be stored up to 2 weeks.
When ready to make rolls, take out amount needed.  Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface, and knead for 2 or 3 minutes.   Roll out, and cut rolls.  Place in greased muffin cups.  Let rise for 30 minutes.
Bake in a preheated 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) oven for 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
