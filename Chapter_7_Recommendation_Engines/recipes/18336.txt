Description: 
Yummy sauteed zucchini with other veggies you can find in your fridge!! Very tasty and healthy!! I sometimes add a drop of wine to give it a little more taste. Note: you can add as many vegetables as you like, but this dish can also be tossed in with pasta, if tossing with pasta, just add a lot more olive oil.
