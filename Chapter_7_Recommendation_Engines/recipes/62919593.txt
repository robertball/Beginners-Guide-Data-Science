Ingredients:
2 Tbsp butter
3 chicken leg quarters
3 baking potatoes, peeled and quartered
1 onion, sliced (optional)
1/8 tsp dried thyme
1 bay leaf
10 peppercorns
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 celery stalk cut in large pieces
Juice of 1 lemon
2 C chicken broth
1 Tbsp cornstarch
1/2 C chicken broth

Directions:
Heat butter in a large pot or Dutch oven, over medium-high heat. Briefly brown chicken pieces in batches.
When all of the pieces have been browned, return them all to the pot and cover with a layer of sliced onions, and then potatoes.
Add broth, garlic, peppercorns, celery, thyme, and bay leaf.  Squeeze lemon juice over all.  Cover and simmer on low heat for 45 minutes, pushing potatoes down into the liquid occasionally.
Once chicken is done and potatoes are tender, remove them from pan and set aside.  Strain broth and return it to pan.
Add cornstarch to 1/2 C cold or room temp broth and mix well.  Then add to pan, stirring constantly until mixture thickens and boils.
Serve gravy over chicken and potatoes.
