Ingredients:
1 cup cranberry sauce, or more to taste
1 cup cooked and mashed sweet potatoes
3 eggs
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup raisins, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 4 mini loaf pans.
Combine cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes, eggs, white sugar, oil, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Add flour, nutmeg, allspice, baking soda, and baking powder; mix well. Fold raisins into the batter.
Divide batter evenly among the loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Place loaf pans on a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Uses up these two holiday leftovers. It has a festive flavor and is so moist! I made this up based on another recipe and made it specific to what I had on hand. You can do the same. I love the combo of nutmeg and allspice... it just says holidays!
