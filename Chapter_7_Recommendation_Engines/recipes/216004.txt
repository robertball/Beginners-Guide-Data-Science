Ingredients:
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
2 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus
2 teaspoons granulated sugar
2 ounces Ghirardelli 60% Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar
2 tablespoons milk, plus
2 teaspoons milk
1 egg yolk
2 egg whites
Powdered sugar for dusting

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Brush two 1 1/2-cup or four 1/2-cup ovenproof ramekins with butter; dust bottom and sides with 1 tablespoon granulated sugar. In double boiler over hot water, melt chocolate with milk and 1 tablespoon sugar. Cool for 5 minutes.  Whisk egg yolk into chocolate mixture.  In large bowl with electric mixer, beat egg whites until soft peaks form; add remaining 2 teaspoons granulated sugar and beat until stiff but not dry.
With rubber spatula, fold one-fourth of egg whites into chocolate mixture, then fold in remaining egg whites. Divide between prepared ramekins. (Souffles may be prepared ahead up to this point and refrigerated for up to 2 hours. Bake straight from refrigerator, adding 3 minutes to baking time.) Bake 20 minutes for large ramekins and 15 minutes for small ramekins. Remove from oven; dust tops of souffles with powdered sugar.
