Ingredients:
1 (.6 ounce) package sugar-free lime Jell-OÂ®
1 cup boiling water
1 (15.25 ounce) can pear halves in juice
1 (3 ounce) package reduced-fat cream cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups reduced-fat frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Whisk together the lime gelatin and boiling water in a large bowl until the gelatin dissolves. Pour the mixture into the container of a blender, and add the pear halves and cream cheese. Cover and blend until smooth. Pour back into the bowl, and gently whisk in the whipped topping. Transfer to a mold or serving bowl, cover and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours. To unmold, dip the mold briefly into hot tap water to loosen the gelatin, then invert onto a plate.
