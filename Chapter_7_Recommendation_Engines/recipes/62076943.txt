Add the rest of the ingredients, mix well, then pour into a (QUART SIZE FREEZER), Press out all the air and zip-lock it.
Put the bag into boiling water for 13 minutes, remove and unzip, turn bag upside down and let the omelet fall onto the plate. Warning: the inside of the omelet will be Very HOT, cut in half to let the steam out.
Great taste. If more than one omelet is needed, Mark the bags with magic marker with the ppls names. If different ingredients are used.  Can all be cooked at the same time.
A table spoon of mayo gives the omelet a zesty taste.
