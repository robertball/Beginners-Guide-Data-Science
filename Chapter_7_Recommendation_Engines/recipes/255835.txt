Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds white sugar
8 egg whites

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine white sugar and egg whites in a saucepan over low heat; cook, stirring constantly, until well blended and heated through, about 10 minutes.
Pour white sugar and egg white mixture into a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.
Scoop beaten egg whites into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe into small swirls onto a baking sheet, spacing them 1 inch apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 15 minutes. Turn off oven and keep baking sheet inside as oven cools, about 15 minutes.
