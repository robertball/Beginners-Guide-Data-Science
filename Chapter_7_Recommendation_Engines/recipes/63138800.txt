Ingredients:
1 box of yellow or white cake mix
3 eggs
1/3 cup oil
1 cup water
and
2 sm boxes of instant chocolate pudding mix
4 cups milk

Directions:
Preheat oven and bake the cake, following cake mix directions using a prepaired 9x13 cake pan.
Cool cake for 10-15 mins.
While cake is still warm poke holes with the end of a wooden spoon about an inch apart all over cake.
Mix milk and pudding and pour into holes right away (before it thickens)
Once holes are filled the pudding will start to thicken, spread the rest of the pudding all over the top of the cake and refrigerate for about an hour.
Serve and store chilled.

Description: 
How can you go wrong with cake topped with pudding...so yummy and so easy... We made this when I was a kid, many years ago... I have seen lots of versions over the years... I tend to like the plain and simple one we made best...
