Ingredients:
1-2 lb stew meat
1 head of cabbage, chopped
3 or 4 potatoes, cubed
3 or 4 carrots, sliced
3 or 4  ribs of Celery, sliced
1 small onion, diced
1 32 oz carton beef broth
6 cups of water, more or less
1 12 oz bag frozen corn
1 12 oz bag frozen green beans
1 12 oz bag frozen peas
1 28 oz can petite diced tomatoes
2 46 oz cans tomato juice
Salt to taste (I estimate I used about 2-3 Tbsp)
Pepper to taste (I estimate I used about 3-4 Tbsp)
Granulated garlic to taste (I estimate I used about 1 Tbsp)

Directions:
Sprinkle stew meat with season salt and sear in a cast iron skillet until rare to medium rare.
Remove meat from skillet and allow to cool.
Add cabbage, potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, beef broth and enough water to barely cover it all in a large soup pot.
Boil vegetables until tender.
Chop meat into small pieces and add to the pot.
Add all other ingredients to soup pot and allow it to simmer for at least 30 minutes.
I moved the soup to slow cookers and let it cook on low for 2 hours, and then warm for 6 so that the flavors really mixed well.
