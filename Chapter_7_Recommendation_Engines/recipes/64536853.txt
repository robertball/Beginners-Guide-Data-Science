Place split spaghetti squash into microwave safe dish with 1/4c water. Microwave on high for 7 minutes or until squash is done.
Saute garlic and sausage in oil. Keep separate in pan if possible to easy to scoop garlic out later. Or not, doesn't matter.
When squash is cooked through, use fork to remove flesh from rind into a bowl. While hot, add in butter and salt/pepper to taste. Add sauteed garlic from pan to the squash as well.
Once garlic is removed from pan, throw in walnuts with a dash of oil and salt. Heat until crunchy, remove from pan when ready.

Plate the buttered spaghetti squash. Pour sausage/alfredo mixture over squash, and top with crunchy walnuts. Sprinkle with sage/parsley and parm cheese for presentation.
