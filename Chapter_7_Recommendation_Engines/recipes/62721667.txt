Description: 
My best friends mother was from Mexico, and she made a great dish that was similar to this but would not give me the recipe! So I took the basic ideas from her dish, and added my own twists to it. Now trust me.... this is so good that you will want to, and can, eat it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!
