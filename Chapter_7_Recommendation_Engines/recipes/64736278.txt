Ingredients:
4 - 5 medium yellow summer squash; coarsely chopped in chunks
1 large white onion; chopped (for a sweeter tang use a Vidalia onion)
2-3 slices toasted white bread; cubed
2 eggs; slightly beaten
2 teaspoons granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons margarine (use real butter for richer flavor - watch the calories though)
1/2 cup skim/low fat milk (again use regular whole milk if choose but watch the calories).
Options:
fresh dill to garnish
a dash of Frank's Hot sauce if you want a little kick when serving.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large mixing bowl, combine chopped squash, chopped onion and cook covered in microwave until tender (approximately 10 mins on high).
Drain squash and onion mixture well add back into large mixing bowl.
Mash and add margarine to mix until melted.
Add toasted bread cubes, milk, salt, sugar and lightly beaten eggs and mix well.
Turn mixture into a casserole dish and bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.
Serve hot and garnish with some fresh dill and if you like a dash of Frank's Hot sauce for a "lil" more kick.

Description: 
I love yellow squash (heck any squash at that) and this recipe has been handed down to me from my beloved mum. Not sure of the history before her but this casserole is so easy and tasty that I have doubled the recipe on many occasions only to find at gatherings there are still NO leftovers (enter emoji of sadness)...just means making more again!
