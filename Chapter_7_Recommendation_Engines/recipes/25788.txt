1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup corn syrup
1 cup peanut butter

1 cup roasted Spanish peanuts
4 (1.5 ounce) bars milk chocolate candy bars

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over medium high heat, combine the white sugar, brown sugar and corn syrup. Bring the mixture to a rapid boil, then remove from heat. Stir in the peanut butter until well blended. In a large bowl, stir together the cornflakes and peanuts. Stir the peanut butter mixture into the cornflake mixture and mix until evenly distributed. Press the mixture into a greased 9x13 inch pan.
In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt chocolate candy, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat and spread over the tops of the bars. Let cool before cutting into bars.
