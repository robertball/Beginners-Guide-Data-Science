Ingredients:
2 smoked turkey legs
8 cups water
4 cubes chicken bouillon (such as KnorrÂ®)
1 onion, quartered
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 small inner stalk of celery with leaves, chopped
1 cup baby carrots, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 teaspoon curry powder (optional)
1 cup uncooked wild rice
1 quart half-and-half

Directions:
Place the turkey legs, water, bouillon cubes, onion, celery, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, thyme, marjoram, and curry powder in a soup pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
Stir in the wild rice. Simmer the soup at least 1 hour. Remove the turkey legs and strip the meat from the bones and tendons. Chop the meat and return it to the soup. Pour in the half-and-half and heat to just below a simmer; cook on low heat for about 30 more minutes.
