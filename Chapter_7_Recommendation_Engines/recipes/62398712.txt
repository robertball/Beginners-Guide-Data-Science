Ingredients:
Water-balloon sized balloons (blown up so the biggest part is about the size of a large pear), washed and dried
No-stick cooking spray
Semi-sweet chocolate, white chocolate or confectionery coating, melted and cooled a bit
Wax-paper lined cookie sheet(s)
Prepared Instant Pudding (2 boxes) or your favorite homemade pudding
Whipped Topping
Sprinkles

Directions:
Spoon a small amount on a wax-paper-covered baking sheet.
Then take one of your prepared balloons and dip it in the chocolate. Dip it in enough so the chocolate makes a bowl shape around the balloon.
Remove from the chocolate and place the balloon gently on top of the chocolate waiting on the baking sheet.
Repeat until chocolate is used up.
You can place the tray of balloon bowls in the refrigerator to speed up the drying time.
Once cooled, pop the balloons with a pin.
Gently remove the balloon carnage from the inside of the cups and they are ready to go.
Fill with pudding; top with with whipped topping and sprinkles.  If you want, you can also serve other treats in them like ice cream, dirt cake or candies.
