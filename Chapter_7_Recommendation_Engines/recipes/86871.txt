Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dry penne pasta
6 slices bacon
¾ pound broccolini, cut into 1 inch pieces
12 cloves garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the penne pasta, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, place the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat. Turn frequently to cook until browned and crisp. Drain on paper towels.
Add half of the garlic to the bacon grease, and cook over medium-low heat for 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the broccolini, and continue to cook and stir for 3 or 4 minutes, or until the broccolini is tender but still bright green. Stir in the remaining garlic, salt and pepper. Add the pasta to the skillet, and stir to coat. Remove from the heat and mix in the Parmesan cheese, and crumble in the bacon. Toss again, and serve!

Description: 
A simple, delicious dinner using up the glut of wintered-over broccoli from my parents' garden.  You may use sausage or veggie sausage instead of bacon, substituting olive oil for the bacon fat.
