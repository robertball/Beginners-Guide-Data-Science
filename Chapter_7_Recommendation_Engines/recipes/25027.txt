Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups shortening
3/4 cup margarine
1 cup white sugar
2 cups brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 eggs
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
4 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening, margarine, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Mix in the vanilla and eggs until well blended. Combine the flour, baking soda and baking powder; stir into the creamed mixture until just blended. Mix in the chocolate chips. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets. Cookies should be at least 2 inches apart.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until edges are golden. Let cookies cool for an hour or so before eating. You can try them fresh from the oven, but they will crumble and fall apart.
