Ingredients:
1 lb   Sugar, confectioners'
6 tbls Whole Milk
6 tbls Corn Syrup, light
1 tsp  extract
Food coloring

Directions:
With a whisk, combine sugar and milk until smooth Then stir in corn syrup and extract.
You will use this same recipe for both glazing and piping. The way it is right now is the consistency you want for glazing. It’s smooth and thin. It easily runs off the whisk in a pretty thin drizzle.
To prepare the icing for piping, you just add more powdered sugar. Just eyeball it. You can’t really mess it up because if it’s too thick you just add more milk and if it’s too thin, you add more powdered sugar. I add it in small amounts until it’s a good consistency. For me, it’s when it gets to a point where it’s relatively hard to whisk it by hand. When I pick up the whisk, it still runs off, but in a very slow.
Add food coloring.
