Ingredients:
1/2 cup light butter
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup egg substitute
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon grated lemon zest
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornmeal
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Lightly oil a cookie sheet and set aside.
Blend together butter, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and vanilla in a medium sized mixing bowl until butter is softened.  Add egg substitute, lemon juice and zest.  Mix briefly.  Add flour, cornmeal, baking powder and nutmeg.  Mix using a hand mixer on low speed (or by hand) until dough is formed.  Do not over mix.
Remove dough from bowl and divide in half.  Roll each half into a log approx. 1 inch thick in diameter. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze 1-2 hours, allowing dough to chill and become firm.
Remove dough from freezer, unwrap and cut into slices approximately 1/4 inch thick.  Place cookies on prepared cookie sheet.
Bake in a preheated 325 degrees F oven 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned.
