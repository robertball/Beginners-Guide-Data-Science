Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
12 ounces white chocolate, finely chopped
2 cups sugar
1 cup evaporated milk (100g)
2 tablespoons milk powder
28 to 30 Regular marshmallows
6 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons cocoa, for dusting

Directions:
1. Mix vanilla and white chocolate in a large mixing bowl and set aside.
2. Toast marshmallows over an open flame until they are melting and slightly browned on edges, which gives a smoky flavour.  Put the large marshmallows on a baking sheet, broil on low, I browned (sometimes blackened) the top. Remove the top, set aside and do again, 3 - 4 times. Could add more marshmallows.
3. In a medium saucepan mix sugar, evaporated milk, milk powder and half the butter.
4. Bring to full rolling boil over a medium-heat, stirring constantly to prevent burning, until a candy thermometer reaches 110’C (233’F).
5. Add the toasted marshmallows and remaining butter and stir until ingredients are melted and the mixture is smooth.
6. Bring to the boil then pour over chocolate and mix continually to melt chocolate through mixture.
7. Pour fudge into tin, sprinkle with cocoa, then set to room temperature before cutting into squares.
* Or use toasted marshmallow fluff.

Description: 
Adapted from Morsels and musings.  My new favorite fudge.  This makes a very small quantity. The little bits of burnt / toasted marshmallow add to the whole flavor experience.  Delicious, who doesn't love toasted marshmallows.  If desired, smooth the top using another sheet of parchment and gently tap the top.
