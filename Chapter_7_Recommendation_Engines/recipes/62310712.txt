Description: 
This is a great way to use pumpkins in a dessert, showing the Thai tendency to make desserts slightly savory. The pumpkin is soaked in hydrolyzed lime water, a technique that ensures the pumpkin will stay firm during the cooking process. This step can be left out, but the pumpkin will be very soft.
