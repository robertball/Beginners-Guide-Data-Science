Pierce potatoes; rub skins with oil. Place in a baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 50 minutes or until tender. Allow to cool to the touch. In a mixing bowl, combine Monterey Jack, sour cream, cream cheese, onions, basil, garlic, salt and pepper. Cut potatoes in half; carefully scoop out pulp, leaving a thing shell. Add pulp to the cheese mixture and mash; stir in bacon. Stuff potato shells.  Broil for 7-8 minutes or until heated through.

Description: 
I've used these rich potatoes as both an appetizer and side dish. Guests seem to enjoy the distinctive taste of Monterey Jack cheese and basil. These satisfying mouthfuls are perfect for a late-afternoon or evening get-together when something a little heartier is needed.                                          -- Susan Herbert, Aurora, Illinois
