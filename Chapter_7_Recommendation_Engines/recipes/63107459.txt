Ingredients:
3 Tablespoons oil (olive or mac nut)
2-3 onions, small dice
1 teaspoon cayanne pepper
2 pounds ground beef
1 1/2 cups red wine
1 (28 oz) can tomatoes (diced or whole)
1 (6 oz) can tomato paste
3-4 carrots, finely diced
1/2 celery bunch, finely diced
1 (6 oz) can olives, finely diced
Paprika
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
Use the largest pan you have.
Add oil and heat pan over medium high heat.  Add onions and cayanne pepper.  Cook until onions are semi-transluscent.
Add hamburger and brown, breaking into small pieces as it cooks.
Once beef is completely browned, add wine, tomatoes, and tomato paste.  Stir to completely combine, then simmer for about a half hour, watching for consistency.  Once you reach the right consistency, put a lid on the pan.  If you find you've gotten too dry, you can add some water or tomato juice to moisten the sauce back up.
Finely dice carrots, celery, and olives.  Add after sauce has been simmering about a half hour.  Let sauce simmer again for another half hour.
Add paprika, salt, and pepper to taste, simmer for a bit longer or until consistency is right and flavors are well blended.
Garnish with finely chopped parsley or with a gremolata.
