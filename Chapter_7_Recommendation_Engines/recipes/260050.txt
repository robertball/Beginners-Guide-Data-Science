Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 yellow onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
4 slices tempeh bacon (such as LightLife® Fakin' Bacon®), diced
1/4 cup dry white wine
1 canned chipotle chile, drained and chopped, or more to taste
4 cups vegetable broth
3 cups peeled and cubed sweet potatoes
3 cups water
1 cup dry red lentils
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 (6 inch) corn tortillas, cut into strips

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; saute until softened and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tempeh bacon, wine, and chipotle chile. Cook and stir until combined, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium. Add broth, sweet potatoes, water, and lentils. Cook stew until lentils fall apart and potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in cinnamon; season with salt and pepper.
Place tortilla strips in a small skillet over high heat; cook until crispy, 3 to 5 minutes.
Ladle stew into bowls; top with toasted tortilla strips.
