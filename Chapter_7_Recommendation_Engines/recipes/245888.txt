Description: 
This dish uses a classic Thai preparation method of protein. It might not sound like much, but it's a very satisfying dish, especially made with shrimp that's shell-on. We eat the shrimp shell and all, as to not miss out on any flavor. It's also a very kid-friendly dinner dish. Serve with lots of rice.
