Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cups vegetable oil
3/4 cups applesauce
1 container baby food peaches
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 cups peeled, pitted, and chopped peaches
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 16 muffin cups.
In a large bowl, mix the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, mix the oil, applesauce, baby food eggs, vanilla and sugar. Stir the oil mixture into the flour mixture just until moist. Fold in the peaches. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups.
In a small bowl, mix brown sugar, flour and cinnamon. Cut in butter until mixture is like coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over tops of mixture in muffin pan.
Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely.
