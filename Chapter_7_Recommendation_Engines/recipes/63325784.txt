Description: 
This is a mix of ideas and ingredients using several recipes here on AR.  Needed to adjust for ingredients I had on hand. I grilled the first 12 meatballs in my meatball grilling basket, and they were delish, but decided it would take too long to make all 4 dozen that way.  Baked the last 3 dozen in oven.
