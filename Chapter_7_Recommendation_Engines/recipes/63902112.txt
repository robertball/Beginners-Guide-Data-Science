Ingredients:
4 sm-med potatoes, cubed
2 cups cooked ham, cubed
½ pkg frozen chopped broccoli
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel MEX corn, drained
1/4 cup finely minced fresh parsley
CHEESE SAUCE
1/4 cup chopped onions
two stalks of celery (sliced)
1/4 cup butter
1/3 cup of flour
2 cups of milk
few good shakes of pepper
½ tsp of garlic powder
½ tsp of cayenne
cup of shredded cheddar cheese sauce.
1½ cups of cheddar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Boil (microwave) and then saute cubed potatoes
Combine potatoes, ham, corn and parsley; set aside.  For the sauce, I cooked 1/4 cup chopped onions and two stalks of celery (sliced) in the 1/4 cup butter. To that, I added 1/3 cup of flour, 2 cups of milk, a few good shakes of pepper, maybe 1 minced clove of garlic powder and ½ tsp of cayenne. I also added around a cup or so of shredded cheddar to make it a nice tasty cheese sauce.
I mixed the sauce with the other ingredients, poured into a greased 9x13 dish, and topped with another 1½ cups of cheddar
