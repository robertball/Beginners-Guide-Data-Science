Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 sweet onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, crushed
5 small zucchini, sliced
cayenne pepper to taste
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute onion and garlic until tender and lightly browned. Mix in the zucchini. Continue to cook and stir until zucchini is tender. Season with cayenne pepper. Sprinkle with vinegar. Reduce heat to low, cover skillet, and continue cooking 2 to 3 minutes. Remove cover, and taste. If not at desired 'vinegar' flavor, add another splash, cover, and simmer for another minute.
