Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon instant coffee granules
1 teaspoon warm water
1 egg
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, melted and cooled
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
3 tablespoons shortening

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter, shortening and sugars. Dissolve coffee in water; add to creamed mixture with egg and melted chocolate. Mix well. Combine flour, cinnamon and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture (dough will be sticky). Shape into two 6-1/2-in. rolls; wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 4 hours or until firm. Unwrap and cut into 1/4-in. slices. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until firm. Remove to wire racks to cool.
In a small saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate chips and shortening. Dip each cookie halfway; shake off excess. Place on waxed paper to harden.

Description: 
These coffee-flavored cookies are so delicious most people can't believe they're made in my own kitchen instead of a gourmet bakery!
