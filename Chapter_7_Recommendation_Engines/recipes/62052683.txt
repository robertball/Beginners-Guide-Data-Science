1/2 cup light brown sugar
3 TBSP prepared mustard
1 TBSP Dijon mustard
1/4 cup ketchup

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together and simmer in saucepan about 20-25 minutes.  Yummy!  When
using slow cooker, I added a large sliced onion and let it cook with the meat.  I think It was excellent.

Description: 
I was trying to pep up the bottled sauce I had one day and came up with this.  It was a big hit.  I put it over country style pork ribs and cooked them in a slow cooker and even the non-meat eaters ate this because they liked the sauce.
