Ingredients:
1 pound baby Yukon Gold potatoes, halved
cooking spray
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 cup salsa
4 lime wedges
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place potatoes on the prepared baking sheet; coat generously with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until starting to brown, about 15 minutes.
Combine oil, chili powder, and cumin in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 1 minute, stirring after 30 seconds. Add potatoes and salsa to the bowl; toss. Return to the baking sheet.
Continue baking until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes more. Squeeze lime over potatoes and sprinkle cilantro and salt on top.
