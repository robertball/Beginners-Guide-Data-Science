Ingredients:
12 corn tortillas ( I used white corn)
1 cup shredded cheese ( We like to use cheddar or colby jack)
salsa for serving

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Lay tortillas on baking sheets in a single layer. Sprinkle cheese on tortillas.
Bake for 2-3 minutes or until cheese is starting to melt and tortillas are softened.
Remove from oven and carefully roll each tortilla up.
Return to oven and bake for 6-8 minutes or until crisp. Serve with salsa.
