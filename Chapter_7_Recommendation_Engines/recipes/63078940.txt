Ingredients:
5 lbs. plus 4 cups flour
2 tbs. salt
6 packages rapid-rise yeast
7 c. warm water
2 1/2 lbs. boiled potatoes, mashed & cooled
1 1/2 c. milk
4 eggs
1-12 oz. can frozen orange juice, thawed
2 tbs. anise oil (not extract)
4-3 lb. cans of Crisco (be sure to use *Crisco* brand!)
3 lbs. confectioners' sugar (approximately)
Cinnamon

Directions:
Mix flour, salt, yeast, and warm water. Place dough in a large pot or bowl (we use a 16 quart stock-pot). Cover dough with greased wax paper. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled, about an hour.
Beat milk and eggs together. Use hands to incorporate this mixture into dough alternately with potatoes and orange juice, adding small amounts at a time. Then add anise oil and mix well.
Melt enough Crisco to cover 2" deep in a pan or deep-fryer; heat until a small amount of batter dropped in oil sizzles and starts to color. Drop batter by tablespoons into hot oil and deep fry until golden.  Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Dust with confectioners' sugar and cinnamon.
