Ingredients:
Tart Shells
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 cup butter, softened
Filling
2 1/4 cups chopped pitted dates
1 cup water
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Icing
1/4 cup butter
2 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk
1 teaspoon maple extract

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Tart shells: Sift together flour and 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar in a bowl. Cut in 1 cup butter; knead until well blended. Form dough into 3/4 inch balls. Press evenly into 1 1/2 inch tart cups on the bottom and up the sides to form a shell.
Bake in preheated oven until pale gold, about 16 minutes. Let shells cool in the pan. Gently loosen and remove them from pan using a knife.
Filling: Combine dates, water, brown sugar, and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; boil gently for about 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Mash dates with a fork as they cook. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Allow mixture to cool before spooning into tart shells.
Icing: Cream 1/4 cup butter in a small bowl with an electric mixer. Gradually add 1 cup of the sugar while continuing to mix. Add the milk, remaining 1 1/4 cups sugar, and maple extract. Beat at high speed until smooth. Icing should be thick enough to pipe. Spoon mixture into pastry bag with a small round or star-shaped tip. Pipe a swirl of icing on each tart.

Description: 
The name of this recipe is a little misleading; there is no pork in these sweet treats! A crisp cookie tart shell, a sweet date filling, and maple icing make these tarts a unique and delicious Cape Breton treat! Use more or less icing on each tart, depending on how sweet you like them.
