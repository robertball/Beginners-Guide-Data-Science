Ingredients:
4  thick center-cut pork chops
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch®)
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
¼ cup chicken broth, or more as needed
3 tablespoons sweet Marsala wine
3 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Sprinkle pork chops with ranch dressing mix.
Heat butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork chops and cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium and cook, flipping occasionally, until chops are barely pink in the centers, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Transfer chops to a warm platter; spoon on all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan. Pour broth, wine, and lemon juice into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off the bottom with a wooden spoon. Simmer until sauce is reduced to desired thickness. Spoon over the chops to serve.
