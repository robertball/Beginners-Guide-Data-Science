Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter flavored shortening
2 tablespoons cold water
FILLING:
2 cups sliced plums
9 1/4 teaspoons sugar, divided
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 egg, lightly beaten

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt; cut in the shortening until crumbly. Gradually add water, tossing with a fork until a ball forms. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1-1/2 hours. On a lightly floured surface, roll pastry into a 9-in. circle. Transfer to a foil-lined 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan.
In a bowl, combine the plums, 3 tablespoons sugar and flour. Place on the center of pastry. Bring edges of pastry over filling, leaving 3-1/2 in. of filling uncovered. Brush crust with egg white, then sprinkle with remaining sugar. Bake at 375 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until bubbly and crust is golden brown.

Description: 
We have a plum tree in our yard, and some years it's so full of fruit that its branches have to be propped up. I always make one or two tarts to freeze for later.
