Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons brown sugar
1 pound lard
1 egg
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1 cup water

Directions:
Beat the egg in a measuring cup.  Add the vinegar and enough cold water to make one cup of liquid.
In a large bowl combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and brown sugar.  Cut the lard up into small cubes, and add to the dry ingredients.  Blend with two knives, or a pastry blender, until the mixture is crumbly.  Add the liquid ingredients, mixing with a knife.  Do not use your hands as it tends to soften the lard too much.  Add additional water, if required, to make a soft ball of dough.  If the weather is warm, refrigerate your dough for 1/2 hour to chill it before rolling.  Warm dough doesn't roll as well, and requires too much flour, which makes it less flaky.

Description: 
This pie crust has been passed on for 3 generations.  If you're looking for great tasting pastry, this is the recipe for you. While the debate between shortening and lard continues, I recommend using lard as it makes a flakier dough. Since this recipe makes so much I often roll out some extra pie shells or freeze it in small amounts, and defrost it when I need it.  Great when you're in a rush! If necessary, use up to a 1/2 cup more water.
