Ingredients:
1 quart olive oil for frying, or as needed
5 tablespoons milk
1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 egg
2 tablespoons almond flour
3 teaspoons honey
1/4 teaspoon guar gum
2 Tbsp powdered sugar
2 Tbsp ground cinnamon

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep fryer or in a large saucepan to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Whisk milk, all-purpose flour, egg, almond flour, honey, baking powder and guar gum together in a bowl using a fork or whisk until batter resembles thick pancake batter.
Drop batter using a tablespoon rubbed with a drop of oil (to keep the batter from sticking), working in batches, into the hot oil; fry until donuts are dark brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove donuts with a slotted spoon and allow to rest on paper towels to drain the excess oil.
Dust with powdered sugar and cinnamon mixture.

Description: 
An adapted version of Michelle2s' Gluten-Free Donuts on AR. I think this is a lighter version, giving the donut a chewier texture like a yeast donut.
