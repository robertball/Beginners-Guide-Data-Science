Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup milk
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup fresh pitted and quartered sweet cherries
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Mix flour, 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Whisk oil, milk, egg, and almond extract together in a small bowl. Pour into flour mixture; stir gently until incorporated. Fold cherries into the batter.
Spoon batter into the muffin cups, filling each 2/3 of the way full. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar on top.
Bake muffins in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
