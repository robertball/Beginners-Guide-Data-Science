Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

3/4 cup milk, or as needed
DILL BUTTER:
1/4 cup butter (no substitutes), melted
1/2 teaspoon dill weed
1/8 teaspoon garlic salt

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first four ingredients. Add cheese. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in milk just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 3/4-in.-thick square. Cut into 12 squares. Place 1/8 in. apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Combine butter, dill and salt; brush over hot biscuits. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
My husband grew up in the South, where biscuits are practically daily fare. So early in our marriage, I began adding variety to this ordinary quick bread. These are good with seafood, beef and pasta dishes.
