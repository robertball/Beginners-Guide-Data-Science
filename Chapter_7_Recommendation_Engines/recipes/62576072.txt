Description: 
This recipe is created by chefs Slade Rushing and Allison Vine Rushing of the Longbranch in Abita Springs Louisianna.  I've substituted long grain white rice for arborio rice and reduced the amount of minced vegetables called for in the original recipe. This rice has a festive look with the chopped vegetables, and the lemon zest and juice give it a subtle and delicate flavor.
