Ingredients:
Earthborne Great Plains Feast Dog Food (See Footnote)
Doe's Run Powdered Goat Milk (See Footnote)
Dyne Calorie Supplement (See Footnote)
Nupro Supplement (See Footnote)
Raw Ground Beef (See Footnote)
Salmon Oil (See Footnote)
Large Eggs (See Footnote)
Cayenne Pepper (1 tsp.)
Water (to texture)

Directions:
Combine the Goat Milk, Nupro, Salmon Oil, Eggs & Dyne into the dogs feeding bowl.
Mix in enough water to create a slightly thick gravy (usually about 2-3 cups of water).
Add the Beef, Dog Food & 1 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper (helps with blood flow).
Slightly shake the bowl to stir the ingredients and then let your dog chow down!
Do this for 2 months or until desired weight is reached than decrease the amount of Goats Milk & Nupro  you use to 1/2 that listed and 1 or 2 Eggs to feed your dog regularly which should maintain his/her weight!
Special Note: For a lean and more muscular look to your dog, just walk it once a day for 1 to 2 hours or play with it for 30 minutes to an hour and he/she will have a lean slightly chiseled look like Mr. Scarfo!

Description: 
An all natural mix of dog food, supplements, beef and eggs to help your dog gain and maintain it's weight. This recipe is what I use for my American Pitbull Terrier Mr. Scarfo who has gained 10-20 lbs of lean muscle and fat in the 2 months I have had him, but it will also work for other dogs (especially those of the bully and mastiff breeds). Ultimately though as with everything, you should check with your vet to be sure this recipe will be right for your dog because what works for Mr. Scarfo may not work for your dog!
