Ingredients:
2 2/3 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/3 cups long-grain white rice
1 pound ground pork
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup diced red onion
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
1/2 cup diced carrot
1/2 cup chopped water chestnuts
3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
1/3 cup low-sodium teriyaki sauce
1/2 tablespoon honey
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk
1 tablespoon lime juice
12 romaine leaves
2 limes, cut into wedges
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Bring water and salt to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Add rice. Reduce heat, and simmer, covered, until water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, brown pork in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring to break up lumps, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate; drain grease from the skillet.
Heat oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in onion, bell pepper, carrot, water chestnuts, and ginger; cook, stirring, until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in pork, teriyaki, and honey; cook, stirring, until liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes.
Fluff cooked rice with a fork, then fold in 1/4 cup cilantro, coconut milk, and lime juice.
Top lettuce leaves with pork mixture and rice. Garnish with lime wedges and chopped fresh cilantro.
