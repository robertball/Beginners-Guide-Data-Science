Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons water
2 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped

4 pounds beef tri tip, cut into 1/2 inch slices

Directions:
In a large, non-reactive bowl, blend the soy sauce, olive oil, water, garlic, and pepper. Place the beef tri tip in the marinade. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.
Grill the beef slices 3 to 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. Discard remaining marinade.

Description: 
A great way to quickly grill large cuts of tri-tip beef. You can even make it on a busy weeknight! I've also made this for BBQ parties. It's better than buying a bunch of steaks!
