Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh asparagus
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup of water

Directions:
Wash and break your asparagus stalks. You want to snap each one where it wants to break on the lower 1/3 of the stalk.  This will give you the best parts of the asparagus and will avoid the tough part.
In large skillet over medium-high heat drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Once oil is hot add asparagus spears; cover and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add water, cover to kind of steam it and keep it from drying out.  Continue cooking for another 5 minutes or until asparagus is tender.
