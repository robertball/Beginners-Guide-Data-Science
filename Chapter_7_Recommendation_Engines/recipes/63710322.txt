Ingredients:
2 eggs, beaten with a little water
4 tbsp flour
A pinch of Spanish paprika (Pimentón de la Vera)
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper
1 cup of milk
1/2 lb of jamón serrano, diced
1/2 onion, minced
2 cups of bread crumbs
Olive oil for frying

Directions:
Heat the oil in a pan and sauté minced onions until transparent. Stir in the flour and cook it briefly, then whisk in the milk. Cook, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens. Season with salt, pepper and paprika. Stir in the jamón and spread the mixture into a dish. Refrigerate until solid.
Place the beaten eggs in one dish, the bread crumbs in another. With moistened hands, form the chilled mixture into balls or cylinders. Dip each croqueta first in bread crumbs, then in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs again, taking care that they are well covered. Chill breaded croquetas in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Heat olive oil in deep fryer and fry the croquetas a few at a time, until golden, about 3 minutes.
