Description: 
Finally found a recipe for tuna salad that I liked.  Thank you Barbie!  Grandma passed away along time ago, and I will always miss her and the 'fish sandwiches' she would make me.  That being said, I had to man it up a little.  Tuna salad without eggs and Tabasco, well, this country boy couldn't have that.  So now you get the 'KEN' part of the recipe.  The curry is what sealed the deal!  Thank you, Barbie!Modified from: Barbie's Tuna Salad
