Ingredients:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons mango lime seasoning blend
1 large avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
2 tablespoons lime juice, or more to taste
2 tablespoons hot salsa (optional)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste
1 tablespoon garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 head romaine lettuce, leaves separated

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Coat chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle mango and lime seasoning on both sides. Place in a shallow baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes.
Chop chicken into small pieces and place in a large bowl. Add avocado, lime juice, salsa, cilantro, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper; mix well to combine. Serve on top of lettuce leaves to make wraps.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite family recipes now. Quick, easy, and super yummy! We even did a night of making a large batch of the avocado chicken and then divided it up into 4 separate bowls and added a different flavor or ingredient to each bowl and then had a buffet-style dinner. So fun and kid-friendly!
