Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 tablespoons sriracha sauce, or to taste
1 tablespoon honey
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper (optional)

Directions:
Stir butter, sriracha sauce, honey, garlic, salt, and pepper with a rubber spatula in a bowl until smeared and blended together.
Scoop butter mixture onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Roll up into a log; twist ends of the plastic together to tighten up the log. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 1 hour. Slice into 1/4-inch pats and place on a chilled plate.
