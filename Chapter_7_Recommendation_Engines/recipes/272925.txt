Ingredients:
Harissa:
10 dried red chile peppers
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground caraway seeds
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
Stew:
1 bunch fresh cilantro, or to taste
1 1/3 pounds ground beef
1 onion, finely chopped
1 fresh red chile pepper, finely chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (16 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken stock
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 links Merguez sausage, cut into pieces

Directions:
Soak dried chile peppers in hot water for 30 minutes. Drain. Remove stems and seeds.
Blend chiles with 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor. Add coriander, caraway seeds, and cumin; blend to form a smooth paste. Transfer to an airtight container. Drizzle about 2 tablespoons olive oil on top to keep fresh.
Chop 1/2 of the cilantro and stem the rest. Combine chopped cilantro with beef, onion, cilantro, fresh chile, cumin, and cloves. Add egg and sea salt; mix to combine. Form into about 26 small meatballs, each about the size of a walnut.
Heat olive oil in a large frying pan. Fry meatballs in batches until browned all over, about 5 minutes. Remove meatballs and add 2 tablespoons harissa to the pan; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add tomatoes, chicken stock, and cinnamon. Simmer for 15 minutes.
Return meatballs to the pan and stir in sausage. Simmer until sausage is heated through and no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. Stir in remaining cilantro.
