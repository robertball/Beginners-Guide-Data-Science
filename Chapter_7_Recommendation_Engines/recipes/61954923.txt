Ingredients:
butter for greasing
6 slices firm bread(EX. sourdough)
5 eggs
1 1/2 cups lowfat milk
2 tsp. vanilla extract
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/8 tsp. ground nutmeg
......................
4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, softened
1/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts

Directions:
Generously butter a 12x7x2-inch baking dish(such as a rectangular Pyrex).
lay the bread slices in the dish, cutting slices to fill the spaces.
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Beat in the milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Pour over the bread, making sure it is submerged. Cover the dish and refrigerate overnight.
To make the topping, combine the butter, brown sugar, and walnuts in a small bowl. Keep at room temperature until you are ready to bake the French toast.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. With a knife, spread the topping all over the bread. Bake 40 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Let sit 10 minutes before cutting. Cut into squares and serve with maple syrup.
Leftover French toast is delicious reheated; just bake until hot.
