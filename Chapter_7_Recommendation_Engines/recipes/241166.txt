Ingredients:
cooking spray
10 eggs, beaten
2 (16 ounce) packages cottage cheese
1 pound shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
1/2 cup butter, melted (optional)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cooked crumbled bacon (optional)
1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a 10x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Mix eggs, cottage cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, green chiles, butter, flour, bacon, and baking powder together in a large bowl; pour into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center of the casserole comes out clean, about 30 minutes more.

Description: 
This is the easiest and best egg casserole I have tried so far. My sweet mother-in-law shared this recipe with me. I make 3 or 4 at the time and keep them in the freezer to take to gatherings, feed guests, or surprise kids. Green chilies make it pop!
