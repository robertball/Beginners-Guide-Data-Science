Ingredients:
1  whole chicken
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 sprigs rosemary
3 cloves garlic, peeled
1  lemon, halved

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Pat chicken dry and sprinkle salt on all sides and inside the cavity. Sprinkle with black pepper. Pluck the leaves from 1 spring of rosemary and sprinkle on the chicken. Place the other whole sprig inside the cavity along with garlic and lemon.
Place the chicken on a roasting rack set inside a roasting pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
