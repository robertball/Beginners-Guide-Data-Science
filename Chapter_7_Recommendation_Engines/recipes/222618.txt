Ingredients:
1 egg
3 egg whites
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 cup diced green onion
2 tablespoons finely chopped red bell pepper
1 cup torn fresh spinach
1/2 cup diced fresh tomato

Directions:
Beat egg and egg whites in a small bowl. Mix in Parmesan cheese, Cheddar cheese, salt, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, nutmeg, and pepper.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, green onion, and bell pepper until tender, about 5 minutes. Place spinach in skillet and cook until just wilted. Stir in diced tomato and egg mixture; as eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. Cook until egg mixture sets, 10 to 15 minutes; cut into wedges and serve immediately.
