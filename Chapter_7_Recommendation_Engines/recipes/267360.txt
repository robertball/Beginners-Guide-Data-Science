Ingredients:
2 packets CARNATION BREAKFAST ESSENTIALS® Rich Milk Chocolate High Protein Powder Drink Mix
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup vegetable shortening
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 eggs (optional)
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup sweetened shredded coconut
1 (12 ounce) package miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat white sugar, butter, shortening, and brown sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add milk chocolate powder and mix until well blended. Beat in eggs.
Gradually add flour, almond extract, baking soda, and salt to the butter mixture. Beat until well blended. Stir in coconut and fold in chocolate chips. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheets. Transfer cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely.
