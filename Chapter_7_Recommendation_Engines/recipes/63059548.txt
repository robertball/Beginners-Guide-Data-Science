1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
Whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl. Whisk vegetable oil, egg, milk, and applesauce together in a small bowl until smooth. Slowly stir the liquid ingredients into the flour mixture until moistened. Fold in the blueberries. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them to the top of the liner.
Bake muffins in the preheated oven until they rise and the tops are golden brown, about 20 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin should come out clean.
