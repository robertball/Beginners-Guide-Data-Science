Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 small onion, finely chopped
2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
2 cups uncooked orzo pasta
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a saucepan over medium heat. When it is not getting any hotter, pour in the olive oil. Add the garlic and onion; cook and stir until tender, about 3 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, and stir to loosen any bits from the bottom of the pan.
When the broth comes to a boil, stir in the orzo pasta. Reduce heat to low, cover the pan, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until pasta has absorbed all of the liquid. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking, especially towards the end. Season with salt and pepper before serving.
