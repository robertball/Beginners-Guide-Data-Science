4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander

Sprinkle the cumin, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, garam masala, salt, sugar, and hot curry powder over the onion and garlic; continue cooking until the seasonings are fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Pour the pureed tomatoes into the skillet; cook until the excess liquid evaporates and the oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken to the mixture and cook about 10 minutes. Stir the cream and paneer into the mixture and simmer another 5 minutes. stir gently so the paneer does not break apart.. Garnish with cilantro to serve over jasmin rice.
