Ingredients:
1/2 cup old fashioned oats
1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 ounces, 1/8 cup, chopped nuts
6 ounces plain or vanilla non fat greek yogurt (or sour cream)
1/3 cup skim milk
1 large egg or 1/4 cup egg substitute
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup canola oil (or could use applesauce or mashed banana)
1/3 cup raisins or cranberries or chocolate chips (or other mix-in of choice)
Cooking Spray
Maple syrup or honey, for drizzling

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients, the first 7, in a bowl. In a another bowl, mix the wet ingredients, the next 5.  Mix the wet ingredients into the dry until just combined, then fold in your favorite mix-in such as raisins.
Heat a griddle over medium heat and spray with cooking spray.  Spoon 1/4 to 1/3 cup batter onto the hot griddle.  Try not to let them get too large or thick in the middle as that will make them more difficult to turn.   Cook a few minutes until bubbles form on the top, then carefully turn.  Keep pancakes tented with foil as they come off the griddle to keep them hot. Serve with butter or margarine and drizzled maple syrup.
