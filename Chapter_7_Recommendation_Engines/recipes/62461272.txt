Ingredients:
1 large can (28 oz) petite diced tomatoes
1 cup water
8 ounces spaghetti noodles, broken into 1 1/ inch pieces
1 medium potato, peeled and cut into bite-size cubes
1 green pepper, seeded and cut in chunks
1 large zucchini, thinly sliced
3 carrots, peeled and cut in quarters
3 to 4 celery stalks, for about 2 cups chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 teaspoon hot red-pepper flakes
1/ teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 Tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Place all of the ingredients, in the order listed, in a large soup pot or Dutch oven, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  As the mixture boils and the veggies begin to cook down, add up to another 2 cups of water (or more - I added 4 more cups) if necessary.  Boil 10 minutes, or until the pasta and vegetables are tender.  Simmer on low until ready to serve.
