Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 green chile pepper, seeded and minced
10 fresh curry leaves (optional)
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 large red onion, chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
20 green beans, finely chopped
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
2 cups cold water
2 cups quick-cooking oats
1/3 cup frozen peas
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add chile pepper, curry leaves, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, salt, and turmeric. Mix to combine. Stir in red onion, carrot, and green beans. Cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds. Pour in water, cover, and bring to a boil.
Remove lid and stir in oats and peas. Remove from heat, cover, and allow to rest until all liquid is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in cilantro and lemon juice.
