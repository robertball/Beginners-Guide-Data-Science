Ingredients:
cooking spray
Macaroni layer:
2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
1/2 cup butter
2 (12 ounce) cans evaporated milk
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
3 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 pinch paprika, or to taste (optional)
Topping:
3 tbsp butter
20 coarsely crushed ritz crackers
3/4 cup shredded cheddar
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F
Spray a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
Prepare macaroni, cooking for approximately 8 minutes.  (Still firm)
Melt butter over low heat in a pot. Stir in evaporated milk, salt and black pepper; cook until heated through.
Whisk eggs in a bowl until smooth; whisk about 1/2 cup of the evaporated milk mixture into the eggs, 1 tablespoon at a time, until thoroughly blended. Whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan with evaporated milk mixture. Continue to heat gently, whisking constantly, until the evaporated milk mixture almost comes to a simmer and the sauce thickens.
Spoon 1/4 of the macaroni mixture in a layer into the bottom of the prepared casserole dish and top with 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese. Repeat layers three more times; top last with macaroni.
Topping:
Coarsely crush crackers in a large ziplock bag.  Melt butter in microwave.  Add butter to bag and toss.  Add cheeses and toss n bag until well mixed.  Sprinkle  over macaroni.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, about 20 minutes.
