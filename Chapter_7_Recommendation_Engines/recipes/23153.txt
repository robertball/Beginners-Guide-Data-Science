Ingredients:
6 potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, peeled
3 cups chicken broth
1 cup water
1 cup whole milk
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place potatoes in a shallow roasting pan and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Sprinkle with pepper; stir to coat. Bake for 25 minutes, or until potatoes are browned.  Reserve 1 cup of roasted potatoes.
In a 3 quart saucepan heat remaining oil; saute onions for 5 minutes.  Add potatoes and garlic and stir in broth and water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes.
Spoon half of broth mixture into a blender; blend until nearly smooth.  Repeat with remaining mixture; return all to pot.  Stir in milk and season with salt to taste.  Ladle into bowls and top with reserved roasted potatoes.
