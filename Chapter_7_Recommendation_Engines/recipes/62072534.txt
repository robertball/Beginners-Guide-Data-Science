Ingredients:
1 cup cooked spaghetti
1 tbsp butter

Directions:
Melt butter in 8" skillet over medium heat.
Add spaghetti, and spread it out to edge of skillet.
Cook without stirring until golden brown and slightly crispy on the bottom, about 3 minutes.
Flip and cook other side about 2 minutes.
Serve immediately. Good as is, or add butter and syrup, or salt and pepper, or whatever you like!
Note: To make 4 servings in a larger pan, cut speghetti in fourths just after adding to the skillet, or make 4 individual "pancakes".
