https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/783051.jpg
Ingredients:
1 cup instant brown rice (such as Minute brand brown rice)
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon black pepper (optional)
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
In a microwave-safe dish with a cover, add your rice, parsley, and pepper (if using).
In a measuring cup, add butter and lemon juice.
Fill the rest of the way with chicken broth. This will be slightly less than 1 cup of broth since you've already counted butter and lemon juice toward the total volume.
Add butter/lemon juice/broth mixture to rice and herb mixture. Shake or stir briefly to moisten all ingredients.
Microwave for 7 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes, fluff with fork, and serve.

Description: 
This is a mild-tasting, fast rice recipe suitable as a side dish to chicken or fish. You can switch the butter out for oil or omit it entirely, but the dish isn't as tasty without it!
