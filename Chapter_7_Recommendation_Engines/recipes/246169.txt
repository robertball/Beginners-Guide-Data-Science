Ingredients:
cooking spray (such as Pam®)
1 (14 ounce) package deluxe macaroni and cheese dinner mix (such as Kraft®)
1 (12 ounce) can luncheon meat (such as Spam®), cut into 1/4-inch cubes
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup Italian-style bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Place macaroni, cheese, cubed luncheon meat, and milk in a large bowl; mix well to combine. Turn out into casserole dish. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 15 minutes.
