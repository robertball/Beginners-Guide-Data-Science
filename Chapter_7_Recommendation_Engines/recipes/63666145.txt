Ingredients:
4 oz. soba buckwheat noodles or whole-wheat spaghetti
5 oz. asparagus, cut in thirds
Cooking spray
1 (6-oz.) salmon fillet, skin off, cut into 8 pieces
1 TBSP toasted sesame oil
Zest and juice of 1-2 limes (3 TBSP juice)
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp fresh pepper
4 oz. cucumber, skin on, cut into medium pieces
1/2 small avocado, cut into bite-size pieces

Directions:
Cook noodles in boiling water until soft. Transfer with tongs to strainer. Add asparagus to same boiling water. Cook until al dente (about 2 minutes); rinse under cold water.
Heat a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Coat lightly with cooking spray. Cook salmon until cooked through, turning pieces (2-3 minutes per side). Reserve.
Make the vinaigrette: Whisk together sesame oil, lime zest and juice, and salt and pepper in a small bowl. Combine noodles, asparagus, and vinaigrette in a medium serving bowl.
Add the cucumber and avocado; toss to coat. Just before serving, add salmon. Serve warm or at room temperature, or make up to 4 hours ahead and keep refrigerated in an airtight container.
