Ingredients:
1 cup pitted green olives
2 plump, moist cloves garlic, peeled, halved,
1 cup fresh mint leaves (remove the stems)
the zest of one lemon
1/3 cup starch-thickened broth*
Freshly ground black pepper
1 pound imported Italian spaghetti (I use more like 3/4 pound, and I use whole grain thin spaghetti)

Directions:
Mix 1 T starch into cold broth and cook til thickened, either in a small saucepan or in a cup in the microwave (stir often if using microwave) In a food processor or a blender, first blend thin outer lemon peel and garlic. Add the olives, mint, broth. Pulse to create a roughly chopped, not smooth, sauce. Season with pepper. Transfer to a shallow bowl large enough to hold the sauce and the pasta and toss gently.
Cook your spaghetti, drain, and immediately toss with the olive sauce.
