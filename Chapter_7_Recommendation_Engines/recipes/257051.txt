Ingredients:
1  egg, beaten
1 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs (such as Progresso(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
2  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
¼ teaspoon Cajun seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 cup olive oil
3 cups chopped lettuce
1  tomato, cut into wedges
2  carrots, grated
2  hard-boiled eggs, halved
6 tablespoons ranch dressing

Directions:
Beat egg in a shallow dish.
Mix bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese together in a shallow dish.
Season chicken with Cajun seasoning. Dip chicken into beaten egg and dredge in bread crumb mixture, pressing lightly to coat evenly.
Heat olive oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook breaded chicken in the hot oil until golden brown, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain chicken on paper towels. Slice into strips.
Divide lettuce, tomato, carrots, and hard-boiled eggs between 2 large pasta bowls. Top with sliced chicken; drizzle salad dressing on top.

Description: 
This is a quick dinner salad. I prefer mine with a honey mustard dressing and my husband likes his with ranch dressing. Use the dressing of your choice.
