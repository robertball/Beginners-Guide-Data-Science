Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups milk
3 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
1 cup shredded coconut
1/2 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Pour cold water into a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin on top of water and allow it to soften for 5 minutes.
In a medium saucepan, mix together 1/2 cup sugar, flour, and milk. Cook over medium heat until mixture thickens and boils, stirring constantly. Boil and stir 5 minutes. Cool slightly. Stir in gelatin mixture and allow to cool completely.
In a large glass or metal bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar. Continue to beat while gradually adding 1/2 cup sugar, until stiff peaks form. Fold in whipped topping, coconut, and almond extract.
Pour cooled milk mixture into pastry shell. Top with meringue mixture. Refrigerate pie for at least 2 hours before serving.

Description: 
This creamy pie with a coconut meringue topping is a tradition in my family.  My grandmother started making this pie one Christmas and it was a standby from that point on. This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.
