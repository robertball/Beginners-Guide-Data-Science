Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
1 small onion, finely chopped
2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup ketchup
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon prepared mustard
2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meatis no longer pink; drain.
In a small bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, combine the ketchup, milk, butter, eggs and mustard;
stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in the beef mixture and cheese.
Fill greased miniature muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake at 425Â° for 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers. Yield: 5 dozen. I bake in regular sized muffin pans and make double the recipe.

Found this recipe at Taste of Home.  My grandsons think it's great.  Keeps well in freezer.  Grampa enjoys taking them when he goes fishing.
