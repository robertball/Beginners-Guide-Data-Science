Ingredients:
2 cups lentils
6 cups water
1 big onion, chopped
2 big carrots, peeled and diced
2 big stalks celery, diced
3 cloves garlic, cut in half
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 tsp salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
2 bay leaves
1.5 tsp mint
1/2 tsp oregano (optional)
1/2 tsp parsley (optional)
8 ounces crushed tomatoes

Directions:
In a large pot place your lentils and more than enough water to cover them and allow them to soak for 4-8 hours. You can skip this step if you extend the boiling time of step 2.
Throw soaking water away, and add the 6 cups of water in the pot. Boil for 30 minutes on medium heat, or until chewable but firm.
Add onion, carrots, celery, garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, pepper flakes, bay leaves, mint, tomatoes, and oregano and/or parsley if using. Lower heat and allow to simmer for 30 -45 minutes or until lentil is soft.
When ready, remove bay leaves, as they tend to give off a bitter taste. Enjoy!
