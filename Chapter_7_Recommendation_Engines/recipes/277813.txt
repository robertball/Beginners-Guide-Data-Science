Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds red potatoes, cubed
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 pinch paprika

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a large baking pan.
Place potatoes into a large bowl.
Whisk oil, onion powder, garlic salt, pepper, and paprika together in a small bowl. Pour over potato cubes, hand-tossing to coat. Place potatoes into the prepared pan, spreading them so that they are evenly dispersed.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Stir. Continue to bake until potatoes are crispy brown and tender, 10 to 20 minutes.

As a kid growing up, I always loved these slightly spicy, yet crispy, roasted potatoes. If only I had known then how easy they were to make!
