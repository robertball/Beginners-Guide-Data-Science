Ingredients:
1 Tbsp kosher salt
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp granulated onion
1 tsp granulated garlic
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp Adobo powder
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp ground mustard
1 broiler/fryer chicken (3-1/2 to 4 pounds)
1 can (12 ounces) beer

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix the first eight ingredients. With fingers, carefully loosen skin from chicken; rub seasoning mixture under and over skin. Tuck wings under chicken. Refrigerate, covered, at least 1 hour.
Take 9" pie pan and cover with foil.  Place a beer-can chicken rack securely in pan. Remove (drink) half of the beer from can. Using a can opener, make additional large holes in top of can; place can in rack.
Stand chicken vertically on rack; place on grill rack. Grill, covered, over indirect medium heat 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours or until a thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh reads 170°-175°.
Carefully remove pan from grill; tent chicken with foil. Let stand 15 minutes before carving
