Ingredients:
1/2 cup margarine
1 cup water
1 cup all-purpose flour
4 eggs
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
3 cups milk
2 (3 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix
1 (16 ounce) package frozen whipped topping, thawed
1/4 cup chocolate syrup
1 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan.
In a saucepan or in the microwave, bring water and margarine to a boil. Mix in the flour, then beat in the eggs, one at a time. Spread mixture in the prepared pan; bake in preheated oven until puffed and golden, about 25 minutes. Press down any large bubbles with a wooden spoon. Cool cream puff before filling.
For the filling: Beat the cream cheese until fluffy. Stir in the milk and pudding mix. Beat until mixture is thick, then spread over cream puff.  Top with whipped topping, drizzle with chocolate syrup and sprinkle with almonds.  Refrigerate 24 hours before serving.

Description: 
I love cream puffs but hate making them. This gives you all the great flavor with very little fuss. Allow dessert to chill overnight before serving.
