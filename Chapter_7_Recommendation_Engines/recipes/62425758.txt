Ingredients:
1 pound cleaned shrimp
1 Tablespoon olive oil
2 Teaspoons hot paprika
2 Teaspoons cumin
1 Teaspoon cayenne
1/2 Teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 lime, juice only
16 ounces cheese (I used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella.)
1/4 red onion, sliced
8 medium-large tortillas

Directions:
Once your shrimp are defrosted add them to a bowl with all your spices along with lime juice, and olive oil.
Let this sit for about 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 400 degrees, and slice the red onion.
Cooking the Shrimp. Once your shrimp have been marinating for a few minutes, add them to a pan over medium-high heat.
Once they are cooked through give them a quick chop on a cutting board.
Once your shrimp are cooked and chopped, itâ€™s a pretty easy process to assemble these.
Just lay out some tortillas on a baking sheet, add some cheese, add your shrimp and onions, and then top with a bit more cheese.
Add the top tortilla and cook these for about 8-10 minutes at 400 degrees.  Then take out your baking sheet and carefully flip each quesadilla with a spatula.
Return them to the oven for another 5-6 minutes and then they should be ready to serve!
