Ingredients:
1 (24 ounce) carton cottage cheese
3 eggs, beaten
1 cup sour cream
2 cups evaporated milk
2 cups cubed cooked ham
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
7 uncooked lasagna noodles, or as needed

Directions:
Mix together the cottage cheese, eggs, sour cream, evaporated milk, ham, salt, and pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Pour about half of the mixture into the bottom of a slow cooker. Layer the noodles over the cottage cheese mixture, breaking as needed to fit; top with the remaining cottage cheese mixture.
Cook on Low until the noodles are cooked through, 5 to 6 hours.

Description: 
Being Russian Mennonite, I grew up eating Verenike (Cheese Pockets). I recently was given this great recipe for the slow cooker so I don't have to spend the time to make the yummy goodness.
