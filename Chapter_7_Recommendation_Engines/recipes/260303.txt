Ingredients:
4 egg whites
1 cup white sugar
2 cups unsweetened coconut flakes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form. Gradually add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue beating. Fold in coconut flakes with a spatula.
Use 2 teaspoons to place little mounds of coconut mixture 2 inches apart onto the baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of the cookies. Allow to cool on baking sheet for a few minutes, then carefully transfer onto a wire rack to cool completely.
