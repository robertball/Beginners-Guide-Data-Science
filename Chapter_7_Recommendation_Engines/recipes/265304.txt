Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
2 eggs
2 slices multigrain bread
1 ripe avocado, pitted, peeled
1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper
sea salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Crack eggs into the skillet side by side and cook until eggs are white on the bottom layer and firm enough to flip, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip eggs, trying not to crack the yolk, and cook until egg reaches desired doneness, 2 to 5 minutes more.
Meanwhile, toast bread slices to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes.
Mash avocado in a bowl; stir in lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and sea salt. Spread avocado mixture onto toast. Top with fried egg and season with sea salt and pepper.

Description: 
I love avocado toast, and if you add an egg to it you have a full meal. Sometimes I use balsamic vinegar to flavor the avocado instead of the lemon juice. You can make the egg any way you like, but I like it best fried or poached.
