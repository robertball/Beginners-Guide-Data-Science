Ingredients:
12 ounces lean boneless pork loin, sliced into 1/4 inch thick strips
1 onion, thinly sliced
1/4 cup minced fresh ginger root
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups thinly sliced bok choy
1 red bell pepper, sliced
10 large white mushrooms, julienned
4 cups bean sprouts
1/4 cup sake
3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Wrap tortillas in foil.
Heat a large skillet over high heat until very hot. Add pork, onion, ginger, and garlic; cook  and stir until pork is brown and onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in bok choy, red bell pepper, and mushrooms; cook and stir until bell pepper is tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.  Remove pan from heat.
Place tortillas in oven for 8 minutes, or until warm.
Meanwhile, return pan to high heat source, and mix in bean sprouts, sake, and hoisin and soy sauces; cook and stir until bean sprouts are tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.
Remove tortillas from oven. Divide pork mixture among tortillas, and roll up. Serve immediately.
