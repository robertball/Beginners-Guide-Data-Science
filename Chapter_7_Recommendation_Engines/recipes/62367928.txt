Description: 
I stumbled upon this recipe when I was gifted with my first slow cooker. It has remained a favorite of mine ever since. I've made a few changes to better suit my tastes - and I think my version is even better than the original! I like to serve this easy meal with Caesar Salad Supreme and Garlic Bread Fantastique, two of my favorite recipes from this site. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do. Bon appetit!!!
