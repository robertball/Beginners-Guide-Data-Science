Ingredients:
8 oz Cavatappi Pasta (large spiral straw pasta)
2 quarts water
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon Olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup onion, finely chopped
1 pound ground beef
1 Tablespoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 15 oz can tomato sauce
1 15 oz can seasoned black beans (undrained)
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, fresh ground

Directions:
In a large pot, bring water to a boil.  Add Salt.  Add pasta and cook over medium-high heat until al dente.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook onion and garlic in olive oil over medium heat until the onions are somewhat transparent and soft.  Increase temperature to medium-high and add ground beef.  Break up and stir ground beef.  Cook until completely brown, stirring occasionally.  Once the meat mixture is brown, drain grease and return the skillet to the heat.
Add chili powder, cumin, and tomato sauce to meat mixture.  Cook over medium heat for 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, drain and rinse the pasta.  Add the pasta to the meat mixture and stir, coating the pasta with the meat sauce.  Add the beans and black pepper.  Cook over medium low heat for five minutes to allow the flavors to combine.
Top with cheese (optional) and serve.

Description: 
This very easy recipe uses two pans and has pantry written all over it.  It tastes like what you would expect if Hormel and Chef Boyardee shared a kitchen.  Perfect for kids.  Substitute the cavatappi with any full-bodied pasta, such as bow-tie, wagon-wheel, or mostaccioli.  You can even sneak in some frozen corn for a little tex-mex feel.  Top it with cheese when serving.
