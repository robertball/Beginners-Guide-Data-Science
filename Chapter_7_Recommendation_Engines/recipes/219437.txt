Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups butter, softened
1 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
1/3 cup white sugar
4 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder

Directions:
Cream together butter, sweetener, and sugar in a large bowl, until smooth. Beat in eggs and vanilla extract. Stir in flour and baking powder. Cover and chill dough for at least one hour or overnight.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Roll out dough on floured surface 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick. Cut into shapes with any cookie cutter. Place cookies 1-inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until golden, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cool completely.

Description: 
These sugar cookies are amazing but I wanted to try to cut some calories so I replaced some of the sugar with a sugar-like sweetener. They still taste great and now they are pretty guilt free. If you decide to ice them, I would keep it light -- maybe some cute dots!
