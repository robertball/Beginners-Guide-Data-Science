Ingredients:
1 pound white potatoes(i use yukon gold or russet)
1 teaspoon salt
2eggs
10oz.of flour.
(more if needed)

Directions:
Peel the potatoes and boil them in salted water on medium heat.Use even sized potatoes so they cook evenly.When tender,drain and while still hot mash and put them on a board.Make a well in the middle of the potatoes and put in the salt and eggs.Then pour on the flour and mix well to get a firm dough that does not stick to your hands.The amount of flour will depend on how moist the potatoe mixture is.Keep more flour on hand,as sometimes you use more.Knead the dough for 5-8 minutes.Cut off a piece of dough and roll into a sausage shape on a floured board.Cut off 1 inch slices,roll into balls and flour well.Take a grater and roll the dumpling up the small holed part.Put a large pan of water on to boil,when boiling put in a few at a time so they don't stick together,When they float to the top remove with a slotted spoon and keep warm in a casserole dish do this till all are cooked.Pour over the gnocchi hot tomatoe sauce,and toss gently with a wooden spoon so the do not break.Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

I have used Robin Hood Gluten Free Flour  successfully in this recipe.
The potatoes can also be baked instead of boiled. Make sure they are cool enough to handle...
