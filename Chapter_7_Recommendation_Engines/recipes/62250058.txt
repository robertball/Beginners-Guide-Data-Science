Ingredients:
5 eggs
1/2 cup sugar
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 tsp almond extract
1 cup light sour cream
1 box cake mix (yellow, chocolate, white, etc)
1/2 cup flour
1/2-3/4 pkg melted white chocolate chips
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup water
1/2 tsp almond extract
1 package frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 and spray a large bundt pan or 2 cupcake/mini pound cake pans with cooking spray that has flour in it.
Place the eggs in a bowl of warm water until they are warm. Beat eggs well, then add sugar and beat together.
Add 1/2 cup sugar, oil, almond extract, sour cream, cake mix, flour, and white chocolate, beating well between ingredients. (Now is the time to add extras if you so choose).
Pour batter into pan/pans and bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour for large pan and 20-30 min for mini cakes (checking to see if it's done with a toothpick inserted into the center).
Once cake is done, take it out and punch little holes with a toothpick or fork, then make a glaze with the cup of sugar, water, and almond extract: bring ingredients to a boil in a small saucepan, pour over cake, and allow to cool.
Drizzle melted frosting over cake.

Description: 
A friend from school brought these to a party and I absolutely HAD to get the recipe from her... your friends will be begging you for the recipe too! It's a really great basic recipe that you can add anything to - mix in chocolate chips, canned pumpkin, cinnamon, bluberries, orange or lemon flavor, etc - just get creative!
