Ingredients:
2/3 cup low-sodium beef broth
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons chili-lime powder
2 teaspoons minced onion
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 pounds flank steak
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 serving cooking spray (optional)
10 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend, or to taste
1/2 cup sour cream, for topping

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
Combine beef broth, lime juice, 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, vinegar, chili-lime powder, onion, and cumin in a bowl. Whisk together until marinade is completely blended.
Heat remaining oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Pat flank steaks dry and season with salt and pepper. Sear until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove from heat, pour the marinade on top, and cover.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly pink center and fork-tender, about 2 hours. Drain liquid from the pot and shred beef with 2 forks.
Heat a skillet on the stovetop over medium heat and coat with cooking spray.
Lay a tortilla in the pan. Add desired amount of shredded steak and Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese on top of tortilla and cover with another tortilla. Heat until both sides of quesadilla are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining tortillas, steak, and cheese.
Cut quesadillas into eighths and top with sour cream.
