Ingredients:
1 3/4 pound spanish onions
5 ounces gruyere cheese
4 slices wholemeal bread
2 ounces butter
1 level tsp sugar
4 cups good meat or chicken stock
salt and pepper

Directions:
1.  switch on the oven at a low heat and dry out the slices of bread, without toasting them.  Melt the butter in a large casserole then add the finely-sliced onions and seaseon with salt and pepper.  Cover the casserole and cook slowly for a quarter of an hour.  Remove the lid, and continue cooking gently for 30 minutes, stirring the onions frequently with a wooden spoon.
2.  Now add the sugar, and caramelise for 2 or 3 minutes.
3.  Finally, pour over the stock, bring to a boil and simmer for a quarter of an hour.
Note:  At this point the soup is ready.  But if you wish to serve it in the Lyons manner, that is Au Gratin, five minutes before serving pour into four ovenproof porcelain soup bowls, covering each with a slice of bread broken into two or three pieces which you should press lightly into the soup.  Sprinkle with grated cheese and toast in the oven for 5 minutes.
