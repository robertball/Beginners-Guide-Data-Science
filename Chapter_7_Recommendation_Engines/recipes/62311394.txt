Ingredients:
400g Thai sticky/ glutinous rice
250ml (1 cup) coconut milk
100g white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
6 ripe yellow (preferably champagne) mangoes
2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted

Directions:
Soak the sticky rice for 5-8 hours, or overnight.
Drain the rice and steam in a sticky rice steamer. Steam until done, following the Thai sticky rice cooking procedure.
Put 3 tablespoons of the coconut milk into a small pot and cook until hot. Set aside.
In a bowl, mix the remaining coconut milk, sugar and salt until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Add the cooked sticky rice and fold the coconut milk in until mixed well. Let the rice stand, covered, for about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut the mango off the pits and skin. Slice the mango into strips and place on a platter.
When the rice is finished resting, scoop the rice onto the platter next to the mango.
Sprinkle the rice with the toasted sesame seeds and 3 tablespoons cooked coconut milk. Serve and enjoy!
