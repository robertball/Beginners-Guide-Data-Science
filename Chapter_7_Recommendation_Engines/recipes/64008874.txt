Ingredients:
5 (6.5 ounce) cans minced clams (or baby clams)
6 strips diced bacon
1 cup minced onion
1 cup diced celery
2 cups cubed potatoes
8 oz clam juice or clam broth
3/4 cup butter
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 quart half-and-half cream
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook bacon until crisp, remove and then saute the onions, celery, and potatoes in the leftover bacon grease.  Once onions are softened, drain cans of clams into pan.  Add clam juice or clam broth to cover, and cook over medium heat until tender.
Meanwhile, in a large, heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth. Whisk in cream and stir constantly until thick and smooth. Stir in vegetables and clam juice. Heat through, but do not boil.
Stir in clams just before serving. If they cook too much they get tough. When clams are heated through, stir in vinegar, and season with salt and pepper.  Top with diced bacon.
