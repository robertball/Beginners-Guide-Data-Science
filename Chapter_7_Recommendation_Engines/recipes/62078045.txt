Ingredients:
1 lb pasta (Any shape will do, I usually use farfalle, rotini or ziti)
1/3 C butter or margerine
1 1/2 C cream or half and half
2 garlic cloves peeled
1 C Parmesan cheese
black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions.
Meanwhile in small saucepan, melt butter on low heat. Add cream and garlic cloves. Keep on low heat until warm, then turn off heat to keep from boiling.
When pasta is cooked, drain and then return to pot it was cooked in. Remove garlic cloves, discard. Pour cream butter sauce into the pasta and stir. Add black pepper and mix. Finish up with adding the parmesan cheese. Taste before serving, the parmesan cheese is salty and will probably provide enough saltiness without having to add salt.
NOTE: If using canned parmesan cheese (green can) you need to use cream in the sauce. If you use regular milk, the parmesan will clump together into one piece.
