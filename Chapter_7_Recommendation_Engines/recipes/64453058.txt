Ingredients:
1 bag 26 oz. frozen hash browns
12 eggs
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon ground mustard
1 16 oz. roll sausage (maple, sage, Italian or regular sausage)
Salt and pepper
16 oz. bag shredded cheddar cheese *or use your favorite shredded cheese*

Directions:
Spray crock pot (with a non stick spray) and evenly spread hash browns at the bottom.
Crack 12 eggs in a large bowl. Mix well (and slowly) using a whisk. Add the milk.
Add the ground mustard to the egg mixture, it will add a great flavor.  Add salt and lots of fresh pepper. Mix well and set aside.
Cook the sausage on high heat, drain and set aside.
Add sausage on top of hash browns.
Is this enough cheese? Maybe? Throw the whole big bag in there.
Mix it up well. Or good, depending on where you're from.
Pour the egg mixture over everything in the crock pot. Using a wood spoon, even everything out so it's spread evenly.
Turn the crock pot on low for 6-8 hours.

Description: 
Cook breakfast while you sleep! It takes a little meal prep the night before, and you'll wake up to a cooked meal. Perfect for entertaining house guests/busy moms. Experiment with bacon & ham instead of sausage. Make it meatless by using a can of diced tomatoes, onions and garlic. Experiment by using a variety of different cheese and herbs. Ham/Swiss, Meatless Tomato/Italian blend are both winning combinations.
