Ingredients:
2 pounds flounder or sole fillets
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
3 tablespoons chopped green onions
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Coat a piece of heavy-duty foil (about 14 in. x 14 in.) with nonstick cooking spray. Place fillets on foil; brush with lemon juice. Crimp foil, forming edges. Place foil flat on the grill (do not seal). Grill, covered, over medium-hot heat for 4 minutes. Combine Parmesan cheese, butter, mayonnaise, onions and salt; brush over fillets. Grill 3-4 minutes longer or until fish flakes easily with a fork.

Description: 
'When my grandparents lived in the Florida Keys, Grandpop went fishing every day,' recalls Tammy Sanborn of Alto, Michigan. 'They ate fish often, so Grandmom had to find creative ways to serve it. The Parmesan cheese in this fast recipe adds just the right flavor.'
