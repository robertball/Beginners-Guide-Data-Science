1/4 cup olive oil
4 cups zucchini quartered lenghthwise and sliced thin
1/2 cup diced onion
1 clove of minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 pound spaghetti, cooked al dente
3/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese
10 eggs

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 12" non-stick skillet.  Add zucchini, onion, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook until soft.  Add spaghetti and toss together.
Beat the eggs and cheese together and add the mixture to the skillet.
Slide a spatula between the sides of the pan and the egg mix letting the uncooked egg overflow into the skillet.  Cook on medium heat until the eggs are no longer runny.
Flip the frittata on to a large platter or pan and slide back into the skillet with the uncooked side on the bottom.  Cook until golden brown on the bottom.
