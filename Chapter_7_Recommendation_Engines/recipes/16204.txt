Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 large boneless pork chops, that can be butterflied
3 tablespoons butter
2 sweet apples of your choice, peeled and chopped
1 1/2 cups crumbled gorgonzola cheese

Directions:
Butterfly each pork chop by slicing horizontally through the center with a sharp knife. Leave them attached on one side so they can be flipped open to create a butterfly shape.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add pork chops, reduce heat to medium and cook slowly for 5 to 7 minutes each side, or until they are done to your liking. Set aside.
Melt butter or margarine in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add apples and saute until tender, then turn off heat and add cheese to skillet. Mix together slowly to form a creamy thick sauce.
Place reserved chops on serving plate and stuff each one with 1/4 of the apple/cheese mixture. Serve hot.

Pork chops with a wonderfully different zing. Easy to make, yet it appears as though you slaved all day long! This dish is great served with any type of potato.
