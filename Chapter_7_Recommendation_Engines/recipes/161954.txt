Ingredients:
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup NAKANO® Natural Rice Vinegar
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo or cannellini beans, drained
1/2 medium red onion, sliced into thin lengthwise slivers (use less onion if strong)
2 tablespoons minced fresh mint
2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon minced fresh Italian (flat) or curly parsley
10 pitted kalamata olives, cut in half (optional)
1 (12 ounce) can solid white albacore tuna in water, drained

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk together oil, vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper; set aside dressing. In a medium bowl, toss beans, onion, mint, cilantro, parsley, and olives, if desired. Add tuna and enough dressing to lightly coat; toss gently (refrigerate leftover dressing, if any, for another use). Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cover; refrigerate at least 15 minutes (or up to 24 hours). Serve with crostini (toasted Italian bread), if desired.
