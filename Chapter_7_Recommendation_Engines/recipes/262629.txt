Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon brown sugar, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix sweet potato slices, oil, sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Arrange slices evenly on a baking sheet, preferably all laying flat.
Bake in the top third of the preheated oven until tops are barely browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Flip over each slice. Continue baking until toasted on top, 10 to 15 minutes more. Immediately unstick slices from the pan. Serve warm or cool.

Description: 
I was looking for a healthier alternative to the chewy/crunchy/gooey/yummy part of traditional candied sweet potatoes and stumbled upon these. This low-sugar version of sweet potatoes (also known as a superfood for its high nutritional value) can be eaten as a side dish or snacked on straight out of the fridge (even better, I think). Great for kids, too.
