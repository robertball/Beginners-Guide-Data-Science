Ingredients:
1/2 pound extra lean ground beef
1 cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt
1 cup salsa
1/2 (16 ounce) can chili beans, drained
1/2 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
1 cup shredded 2%-fat Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Mix ground beef, yogurt, salsa, chili beans, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, and black olives together in an 8-inch square baking dish. Sprinkle cheese over the beef mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until bubbling, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe for a mixture you prepare and bake. Then serve with chips for dipping or as a filling for a tortilla shell. It is a little runny, but it makes it really good! This only makes enough for 3-4 people for a main dish for dinner. I would suggest doubling it if you have a larger group or hungry group of folks!
