Ingredients:
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 1/3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 3/4 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 box (8 ounces) elbow macaroni
1 tsp salt
1/2 cup breadcrumbs
1 1/2 teaspoons melted butter

Directions:
Butter an 8x8 baking dish.  Set aside.
Preheat oven to 375
In a heavy 2.5 quart saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.
After foam subsides, whisk in flour.
Cook for 2 minutes, whisking constantly.
Add milk, 1/4 cup at a time while continuously whisking.  Initially, this will form a solid mass.  Just keep whisking and adding the milk.  Once the mixture is smooth, add the rest of the milk.
Using a slotted wooden spoon, stir in a figure eight pattern for 8-10 minutes, until the sauce is thickened.
Remove from heat and add the salt.
A bit at a time, add the cheddar cheese, stirring until it is melted.
While making the sauce, cook the pasta according to package directions, except only cook it for about 2/3 of the recommended cooking time.  Drain and set aside.
Pour the cooked pasta into the sauce and stir well.
Pour the mixture into the prepared pan.
Mix together the melted butter and the breadcrumbs.
Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the pasta mixture, covering it completely.
Bake for 25 minutes.

Description: 
This does take more effort than blue box mac n' cheese, but it is so worth the effort.  Great comfort food that everyone asks for seconds of.  Very creamy and cheese flavored.
