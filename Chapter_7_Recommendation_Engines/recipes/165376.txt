Ingredients:
1 pound pizza dough
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 large white California nectarine or peach, pitted
1 large red California plum, pitted
3 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar
3 tablespoons honey
3/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
1/4 cup chopped toasted walnuts
Snipped fresh chives

Directions:
Divide pizza dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll each out on a lightly floured board to make 6-inch circles. Place dough circles on a baking sheet and brush both sides with oil. Transfer dough circles to grill and cook over medium heat for a few minutes on each side until dough is cooked through and lightly marked by the grill. Remove and let cool. Cut each piece of fruit into 8 slices. Cook on a well-oiled grill for a few minutes on each side to lightly char. Remove from grill and arrange fruit on pizza crusts. Stir together balsamic vinegar and honey and drizzle over fruit. Sprinkle with blue cheese and walnuts; place pizzas back on grill, cover with lid and cook for a few minutes more to melt cheese. Sprinkle with chives.
