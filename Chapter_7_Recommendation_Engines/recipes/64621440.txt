Ingredients:
1/4 Cup flour
1/4 cup oil
1 small onion diced
3 minced garlic cloves
1/2 cup diced celery
1/2 cup diced green pepper
2 tbs chopped parsley
1 can diced tomatoes
1 package frozen gumbo vegetables (or can use frozen okra and corn)
2 cups fresh black-eyed peas
6 cups chicken broth
2 cups fresh collard greens
2 cups diced ham
2 tsp cajun seasoning
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Make a roux by whisking the flour and oil (can use bacon drippings or Crisco) together in a large dutch oven over medium-low heat to form a smooth mixture. Cook the roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.
Saut√© onion, garlic, celery, green peppers, ham and parsley in oil.  Add the roux to this mixture.  Add chicken broth slowly, black-eyed peas and Cajun seasoning.  Bring to a boil and then simmer until peas are tender (about 30 Min). Add gumbo vegetables and collard greens and simmer 10 minutes.
