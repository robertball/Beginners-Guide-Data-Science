Ingredients:
2 pounds fresh strawberries
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup water
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 (9 inch) deep-dish graham cracker pie crust
1 (8 ounce) tub whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®)

Directions:
Slice 3/4 of the strawberries and place in a bowl.
Puree remaining strawberries in a food processor until smooth and transfer to a saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, water, cornstarch, and lemon juice and bring to a boil, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Stir continuously until as thick as jam, about 5 minutes more. Pour mixture over sliced strawberries in the bowl and stir to combine filling.
Pour filling into pie shell and refrigerate until set, about 3 hours. Slice and serve with a dollop of whipped topping.

Description: 
This strawberry pie recipe was inspired by my grandpa's famous (at least famous among our family and friends) pie recipe. He made strawberry pies every summer and always put the filling in a graham cracker crust and topped it with Cool Whip®.
