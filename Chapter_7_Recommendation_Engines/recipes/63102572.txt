Ingredients:
12 ounces Pearl Onions
1 cup Heavy Cream
2 Bay Leaves
1 T chopped flat-leaf Parsley
1 Garlic Clove, smashed
1/2 tsp Fresh Grated Nutmeg
Salt and Pepper, to taste
1 cup Chicken Broth

Directions:
Blanch the pearl onions by placing them into a large pot of rapidly boiling water. Cook them for about 1 minute. Remove the onions from the water with a strainer, then plunge into an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Drain them, then remove the skins.
Put the onions in a 3-quart saucepan and place over low-medium heat. Add the cream, bay leaves, parsley, garlic and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and let simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Then, remove the cover and add stock. Season again. Allow to cook down for 5 minutes to tighten up the cream sauce. Discard the garlic clove and bay leaves before serving.
