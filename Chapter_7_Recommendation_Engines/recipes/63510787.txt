Ingredients:
1 Tbsp peanut oil
1 large onion, halved and sliced into medium slices
1 stalk celery, sliced
1 red or orange pepper, sliced
1/2 tsp ginger powder
1 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground coriander seed
1/4 cup water
2 chicken breasts, sliced and cut into silver-dollar pieces
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
4 cups chicken broth
1 14oz can light coconut milk
Juice from 1 lime
1 Tbsp fish sauce
2 tsp Sriracha sauce
1 Tbsp tomato paste
2 kafir lime leaves
1 small clove garlic, crushed
2 tsp dried basil
2 oz vermicelli noodles
4 oz bamboo shoots (1/2 can), sliced into thin strips
1 green onion, chopped

Directions:
In a medium pot saute the onion in half the peanut oil, on medium heat until the onion begins to brown.
Add the celery, red pepper, ginger, cumin and coriander, and cook the vegetables until softened. Set aside in a bowl.
In the same pot add the water to deglaze the pot and evaporate. Add the other half of peanut oil and quickly saute the chicken on medium-high heat, letting it brown nicely on either side. Season with salt and pepper while cooking.
Add the vegetable mixture back into the pot, and add the chicken broth, coconut milk, Sriracha sauce, lime leaves, garlic and basil.
Allow to come to a gentle boil. Reduce to a simmer. Add the vermicelli noodles and stir occasionally to loosen. When the noodles are soft, about 3 or 4 minutes, add the bamboo shoots and green onion. Serve.
