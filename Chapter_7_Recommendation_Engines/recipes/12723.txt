Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups dry white wine
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
36 clams in shell, scrubbed

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook garlic in butter briefly. Stir in wine, and season with oregano, parsley, and red pepper flakes.
Place clams in the wine mixture. Cover, and steam until all the clams have opened: discard any that do not open. Serve in soup bowls, and ladle broth generously over them.
