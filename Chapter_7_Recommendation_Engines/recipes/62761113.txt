Ingredients:
1 lb potatoes, peeled and quartered
2 T light sesame oil
1/2 T cumin seed
6 to 8 curry leaves, chopped
1/2 T ginger paste
1/2 c onions, finely minced
2 green chilies, minced
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/2 tsp curry powder
1 c besan (chickpea flour)
1 T rice flour
1 tsp ground red chili
pinch of asfoetida (hing)

Directions:
Prepare and measure all ingredients in advance and keep ready at hand.  Besan, rice flour, ground red chili, and hing may be mixed together.
Boil or microwave potatoes until they are soft and completely cooked, then smash (not quite to the extent of actual mashed potatoes).  Use a fork or pastry blender to smash the potatoes.
Heat the oil over med-high heat, then add cumin seed and let them brown, stirring occasionally.
Add the chopped curry leaves and when they start to release their aroma, add the finely minced onions, the minced chilies, and the ginger paste.  Stir until the onions have softened, lower heat, and stir in turmeric and curry powder.
Add the smashed potatoes and stir very well to mix thoroughly.
Mix the besan mixture with just enough water to form a thick, pancake-like batter and let it rest about 15 mins.
Roll the potato mixture into balls about the size of golf balls.
Dip in the batter and deep fry.
Serve as an appetizer with chutney.
