Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, diced
1/2 cup quinoa
1 ounce taco seasoning mix
1 cup water
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; saute onion in hot oil until slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in quinoa and taco seasoning; saute until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour water into quinoa mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the saucepan with a lid, and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir beans and tomatoes into quinoa mixture, cover the saucepan again with the lid, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, about 5 minutes more. Stir Cheddar cheese into quinoa, spoon into bowls, and top each with a dollop of sour cream.

Description: 
I was craving Mexican, but didn't have a whole lot in the house, rather than go shopping I threw this together and liked it so much I figured I should share the recipe. Next time I'm going to try adding corn with the tomatoes and kidney beans, perhaps a Mexican cheese blend, and Greek yogurt rather than sour cream. Also, I used the Allrecipes top-rated recipe for taco seasoning rather than a packet from the store.
