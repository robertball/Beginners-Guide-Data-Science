Shortbread Recipe

Ingredients:
225 grams plain flour
75 grams caster sugar; makes all the difference to find caster (or "superfine") sugar
1 vanilla bean pod; must use beans - extract won't work well
150 grams unsalted butter; room temperature
granulated sugar; as needed for dusting after cooking

Directions:
Sift the flour into a large bowl.
Add caster sugar.
Slit the vanilla bean pod lengthwise and scrape out the seeds into the bowl.
Add the room temperature butter.
Rub the butter into the flour and sugar mix. As the dough forms, you can start to shape it into a large ball.
You can make your shortbread in two ways... Method 1: Roll the dough out onto a lightly floured surface until about 1cm thick. Cut into 12 equal sized rectangles or squares.
If you're like me and aren't very good at rolling dough, here's an alternate way that works great... Method 2: Use a small square or rectangle silicon mold (like Flexipan) that is 1 cm deep and 5cm on a side (1/2 inch deep and 2 inches on a side). Sprinkle the molds lightly with flour. Use the molds to shape your shortbread and pop out.
Preheat oven to 350F. Place shortbread on a cookie sheet lined with a silicon mat or parchment. Bake for 20 - 25 minutes, turning once halfway through baking.
It is very easy to overcook shortbread - take out as soon as your shortbread is a light golden brown.
Sprinkle with the granulated sugar as soon as you remove from the oven. Let cool on the cookie sheet.
Makes 12 - 24 shortbread cookies depending on what size mold/cookie you make.
