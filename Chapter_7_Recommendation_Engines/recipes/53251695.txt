Ingredients:
1 prepared rotisserie chicken - meat pulled
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
4 flour tortillas
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (10 ounce) can enchilada sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute chicken and stir in diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, soup and broth. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat, cover skillet, and simmer for 20minutes
Remove chicken from skillet, and shred when cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, allow skillet  mixture to simmer and reduce to about 2 1/4 cups. In a medium bowl, combine shredded chicken and about 1/4 cup skillet mixture (just enough to make a paste like mixture).  Pour remaining 2 cups of skillet mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Warm tortillas in microwave for approx. 15 seconds.  Spoon about 1/3 cup chicken mixture onto each tortilla. Top chicken mixture with half the shredded cheese, and roll up tortillas. Place rolled tortillas in baking dish, seam side down, and drizzle with enchilada sauce. Cover with remaining shredded cheese. Bake uncovered in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbling.
