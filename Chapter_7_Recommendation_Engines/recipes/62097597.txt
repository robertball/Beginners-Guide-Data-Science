Ingredients:
3 lbs white potaotes and sweet potatoes
1 sliver hot pepper (optional)
2 meddium-sized onions, minced
6 tbsp cooking oil
3 tbsp butter
1/4 medium-sized red pepper, minced
1/2 stalk celery, minced
1/2 c tomato sauce
2 heaping tsp chopped parsley
1/4 tsp thyme
Dash black pepper
3-4 tbsp brown sugar
1/4-1 c milk
1/4 c raisins
1/4 c prumes- pitted and chopped (optional)
4 eggs

Directions:
Peel potatoes and boil in salted water; mash when cooked. While potatoes are boiling, heat oil and butter in a frying pan on low heat, being careful not to burn it. Add onions, celery, and red pepper; saute until tender. Add tomato sauce, parsley, thyme, black pepper, and sugar. Cook 5 minutes.
Add sesoning mixture to mashed potatoe and mix thoroughly. Add milk ( a little at a time), raisins, prunes and eggs. The resulting mixture should be a little more moist than you would make for ordinary mashed potatoes. If not sufficiently moist, add a little more milk and butter. Bake in a greased 9x13 baking dish at 325 F for about 45 minutes. The top should be golden brown when done.
