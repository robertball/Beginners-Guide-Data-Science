Ingredients:
1 French baguette, cut into 1/3 inch thick slices
-OR- 1 box of Wheat Thins crackers
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1/2 cup finely chopped white onion
1 tablespoon butter
2 (6.5 ounce) jars marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1 cup grated Romano or Parmesan cheese, divided
6 tablespoons mayo
2 (4 ounce) cans of diced chiles
1 diced tomato
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons parsley

Directions:
Preheat broiler on low. Brush olive oil onto the baguette slices, then put in broiler for 2-3 minutes until they start to brown around the edges. Remove from oven and set aside.
Saute garlic and onion with butter in a medium skillet over medium heat.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine artichoke hearts with cheese (set aside 1/4 cup), mayo, chiles, tomato, salt and parsley. Add in onion and garlic when onions become translucent.
Top each baguette slice with a spoonful of artichoke heart mixture and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Arrange in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Broil for 2 minutes, or until toppings are bubbly and lightly browned.
If using crackers: skip steps 1 and 4, put mixture into 8x8 baking dish, sprinkle with remaining cheese and cook at 375 for 15 minutes until bubbly (or microwave for 8-10 minutes).

Description: 
This is a great artichoke dip, which is a blend of a couple different recipes. It's creamy, cheesy and full of flavor. Bake it over bruschetta slices, or eat it as a dip with crackers.Modified from: Artichoke Bruschetta
