Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups chicken stock
3/4 cup old fashioned grits
1/4 cup heavy cream, plus more as needed
1 cup shredded smoked Gouda cheese, or more to taste
1/4 cup butter
8 slices bacon, chopped
3 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon minced shallot
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 splash white wine
1 pound jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 cups chopped spinach
1 cup chopped portobello mushrooms
1/4 cup sliced green onions
2 cups heavy cream
1 dash hot pepper sauce, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a saucepan over high heat.
Slowly pour the grits into the stock while stirring constantly.
Reduce heat to low; simmer until the grits are tender and thick, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir in 1/4 cup heavy cream to thin the grits.
Stir in the Gouda cheese and 1/4 cup butter until melted and smooth.
While the grits are cooking, place the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium heat; cook until the bacon fat is rendered, about 3 minutes.
Stir in the shallot and garlic; cooking and stirring until the shallots are tender, about 5 minutes.
Pour in the white wine and stir in 3 tablespoons butter, cooking and stirring until the butter has melted.
Drop the shrimp in the skillet; cook and stir until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 3 minutes.
Stir in the spinach, mushrooms, and green onions; cook and stir until the spinach wilts, about 2 minutes more.
Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon.
Stir in 2 cups heavy cream. Simmer until the cream is reduced by about a third, about 10 minutes.
Season with hot sauce, salt, and pepper.
Return the shrimp to the skillet to heat through.
Serve shrimp and sauce over the prepared grits.
