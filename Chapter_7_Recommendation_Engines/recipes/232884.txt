Ingredients:
14 quarts water
2 (5 pound) whole chickens, skinned and trimmed of fat
4 pounds carrots, cut into chunks
3 pounds celery, cut into chunks
3 large sweet onions, cut into chunks
6 leeks, trimmed and chopped
14 tablespoons sea salt
3 tablespoons chopped garlic
3 tablespoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons crushed dried rosemary
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried thyme
1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Combine water, chicken, carrots, celery, onions, leeks, sea salt, garlic, garlic powder, rosemary, dried parsley, and dried thyme in a large stock pot; partially cover pot with a lid. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until chicken is fully cooked and falling off the bone, about 2 hours.
Remove chicken from pot. Stir in fresh parsley until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove broth from heat and allow to cool slightly. Strain broth into freezable 2 to 4 cup containers. Use immediately or freeze.
