Spicy Pulled Pork Pushover Recipe

Ingredients:
Seasoning
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp Keens mustard powder
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp cayenne
2 tsp ground chipotle
2 tsp hot smoked paprika
1 tbl cumin
2 tbl kosher salt
7 tbl brown sugar
Paste
2tsp liquid hickory smoke
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tbl olive oil or butter
2 tbl white onion flakes
2 tbl yellow mustard
2 tbl molasses
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1 can tomato paste (13oz)
1.5-2.0kg of pork (I used a 1.7kg Pork Shoulder and it was perfect)

Directions:
Blend ingredients for paste until consistency is that of paste – I generally find this works better if you only add like half the tomato paste to start, and then blend in the rest afterwards.
Now combine paste with seasoning, mix thoroughly, what you’ll get will have an even thicker paste consistency. What you have now could be used to season any number of things; I suspect it would make a good BBQ sauce too.
Combine with pork shoulder in slow cooker, and cook on high for about 4 hours.
After 4 hours, attempt to break up pork, and remove bone, let it simmer on low for another hour or two. If you are keeping it simmering longer put it on “keep warm” or your lowest heat setting. Because of the amount of sugar, and the molasses if you are not careful this recipe will burn VERY easily, so keep an extra wary eye on it.
