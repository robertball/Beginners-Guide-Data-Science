Ingredients:
10 egg whites
6 eggs
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed, divided
1/2 (16 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
1/2 pound ground turkey
1 cup chopped red onion
6 slices hickory ham (such as FarmlandÂ®), diced
1 1/2 cups shredded fat-free Cheddar cheese
10 low-carb, high-fiber tortillas, warmed

Directions:
Whisk egg whites and eggs together in a large bowl.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir hash browns until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer hash browns to a large bowl.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in the same frying pan over medium heat. Add turkey, onion, and ham. Cook and stir until turkey is crumbly and onion softens, about 5 minutes. Add eggs; stir until scrambled and set, 5 to 7 minutes. Add cheese and let melt, about 3 minutes. Pour mixture into the bowl with the hash browns. Mix everything together.
Plate tortillas. Add about 3 tablespoons of filling to each tortilla. Fold opposing edges of a tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling, creating a burrito. Repeat for remaining tortillas.
