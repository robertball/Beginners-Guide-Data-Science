Ingredients:
3 Tablespoons butter
1 Large onion, chopped,
2 Cloves garlic, minced
4 Cups vegetable broth
1 Butternut squash, seeded and chopped into large chunks
1 Acorn squash, seeded and chopped into large chunks
1 Tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 Teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 Teaspoon ground ginger
2 Teaspoons salt
1/4 Teaspoon ground black pepper
1 Cup heavy whipping cream
2 Scallions, chopped

Directions:
Heat large saucepan and saute onion and garlic in butter until tender. Stir in the broth, both squash, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt, black pepper and bring to a boil. Cover the pan, reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes or until the squash is soft.
Let it cool a bit and transfer the mixture into a food processor. Don’t overfill the processor. I usually blend half of the mixture at a time. Process until creamy and smooth. Transfer the pureed mixture back into the saucepan. Stir in cream and let it cook for another 2 minutes
Top with chopped scallions and serve.

Description: 
Charlie Brown, cinnamon, squash, soup... these things say it’s fall and winter is ready to snatch your warm sunny days for bitter cold, ice and snow. When I can see my breath while walking my dog, it’s time for Charlie Brown’s butternut and acorn squash soup. I usually pair it with rustic buttery toasted bread and fresh steamed vegetables.
