Ingredients:
2 cups pumpkin puree
2 cups white sugar
2/3 cup applesauce
1/3 cup safflower oil
3 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup shelled, raw pumpkin seeds (optional)
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 3 muffin pans.
Mix pumpkin, sugar, applesauce, oil, and eggs together in a bowl until well blended; fold in pumpkin seeds. Mix flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, salt, and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into pumpkin mixture until just combined; pour batter among prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
This is a delicious pumpkin muffin that is very moist, with pumpkin seeds mixed into the batter. A great twist on pumpkin muffins. Pumpkin seeds are also very good sprinkled on top of the muffins before baking. I also add about two tablespoons of flax seed meal when making the recipe. If the batter seems too thick, more applesauce can be added to achieve the desired consistency.
