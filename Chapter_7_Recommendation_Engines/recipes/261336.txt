Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) bag broccoli florets
5 baking potatoes, peeled and diced
1 quart chicken broth
1 onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until just tender, 2 to 4 minutes.
Combine potatoes, chicken broth, onion, and garlic in a pot over medium heat. Simmer until softened, 20 to 30 minutes. Mash about half the potatoes in the broth. Combine cream cheese and milk in a bowl; stir into the broth until incorporated. Reduce heat to low. Add Parmesan cheese gradually, stirring until melted after each addition. Add cooked broccoli.
