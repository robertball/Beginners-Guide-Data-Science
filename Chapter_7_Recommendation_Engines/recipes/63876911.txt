Ingredients:
10 sun-dried tomatoes
1 boxe, 5.9 oz couscous
2 cup chicken broth
1/2 lb crumbled feta cheese
1/2 cup sliced ripe olives, chopped
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded and chopped
1/2 tsp minced garlic
1/2 tsp all purpose Greek seasoning
1 14 oz. can garbanzo beans, rinsed and well drained
2 tsp capers, rinsed and drained
2 stalks celery, chopped
fresh ground black pepper to taste
1/4-1/3 cup Greek salad dressing
Dressing:
2 fresh garlic cloves, minced then crushed
1/4 tsp seasoned salt (optional)
2 tsp dijon mustard
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
juice from 1 fresh lemon
1/2 tsp sugar
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 tsp basil leaves
1/4 tsp oregano leaves

Directions:
Soak dried tomatoes in hot water, 10 - 15 minutes until soft, drain and dice.
Heat the broth to a boil, place couscous in a small dish, pour boiling broth over, cover and allow to stand 10-15 minutes while prepping the remaining ingredients.
In a medium size bowl, add the garbanzo beans, olives, capers, onions, cucumbers, sun dried tomatoes, celery and seasonings; stir to combine; add black pepper to taste.
Make the dressing: mix all ingredients in a bottle and shake. Take needed amount and set aside.  Refrigerate remaining dressing.
Mix in the cooked couscous and cheese; drizzle with 1/4 cup dressing and stir to thoroughly combine. Don't add all dressing at one time, it maybe too soupy.  You can always add more later but taking it out is kind of hard to do. Eat or store in refrigerator until ready to serve.

Description: 
This salad can be eaten warm or chilled, add enough dressing if the couscous soaks it up too much, but you don't want it swimming in the dressing. The broth adds extra flavor but you can use just water or better still, the water used to soak the tomatoes. If fresh tomatoes are in season, substitute for dried.
