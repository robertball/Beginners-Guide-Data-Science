Ingredients:
2 Jars spaghetti sauce
1 pound Ziti or Penne pasta (I used barilla plus)
1 lb Hamburger
15-16 oz ricotta or lowfat cottage cheese (I used lowfat cottage cheese)
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese (I used shredded and it worked just fine)
2 TBS dried parsley
1 egg
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/4 tsp pepper
3/4 tsp salt
8 oz shredded mozzarella cheese (I used parmesan romano instead)

Directions:
Cook noodles, drain, set aside.
In a small bowl, mix the ricotta cheese or cottage cheese with the egg, parsley, garlic powder, oregano, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. Set aside.
In dutch oven brown hamburger, drain, add spaghetti sauce, add cooked pasta and mix well. Spoon half of the mixture in a 9 x 13 inch pan. Spread the entire amount of the ricotta mixture over that, then top with the remaining pasta mixture. Top with 8 oz of mozzarella cheese. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until bubbly.
