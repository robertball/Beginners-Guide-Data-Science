Ingredients:
4 large carrots, halved
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed
3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
¼ cup chopped toasted hazelnuts
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
¼ cup clarified butter

Directions:
Steam the carrots in a steamer basket over 1 inch of boiling water for 7 to 10 minutes, or until tender but still firm. Cool, and grate with a large holed grater. Mix together the grated carrots, honey, apple juice concentrate, parsley, and hazelnuts. Season with garlic powder, nutmeg, salt and pepper.
Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the carrot mixture in the hot butter until heated through.
