Ingredients:
1 c. butter, softened
2 c. sugar
2 c. unsweetened applesauce
2 t. baking soda
4 c. flour
1 t. cinnamon
1 t. cloves
1 t. allspice
2 c. pecans, (1/2 chopped and other half not)
2 c. raisins
1 large container red candied cherries, cut in halves
1 large container candied mixed peel, diced small
1 small container green candied cherries, cut in halves
1 small container candied pineapple, diced small

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 for at least 30 min.
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar with mixer until light and fluffy.  Add applesauce and baking soda and beat well.
In a separate bowl, sift together the flour and spices. Add the chopped nuts, raisins, candied fruit and peel; stir until all are well-coated with flour.
Add flour mix to the applesauce mixture and stir until thoroughly combined. Batter will be thick.
Arrange the pecan halves in the bottom of a well-buttered and floured bundt pan or 2 loaf pans. Spoon in the batter carefully.  Bake 1 hr or until toothpick barely tests clean; do not overbake.  Cool in pan(s) 15 minutes before removing.  When completely cool, wrap in foil until ready to serve.

Description: 
My mother made fruitcake using an applesauce cake as the base, with added fruits, nuts, and spices.  I am not a fruitcake fan, but this one is delicious.  It has no eggs or milk - this is not a misprint.
