Ingredients:
4 (5 -6 ounce) fish fillets
1/4 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup pecans (finely ground in blender or processor)
3/4 cup breadcrumbs
3 garlic cloves (minced or pressed)
2 tablespoons fresh parsley (minced)
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch cayenne

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375Â°F; lightly oil a baking pan.
Rinse the fish and place it in a shallow dish.
Pour the buttermilk over the fillets.
In a separate shallow dish, combine the pecans, bread crumbs, garlic, parsley, thyme, paprika, salt, and cayenne.
One at a time, remove the fillets from the buttermilk, allowing the excess to drain off, and then dredge in the pecan mixture to coat all sides. Place each coated fillet in the baking pan.
Bake for 30 to 45 minutes, depending upon the thickness of the fillets, until the topping is lightly browned and the fish is tender and flakes easily with a fork.
