Ingredients:
1 lb ground turkey
1 cup uncooked quinoa
2 (10-ounce) cans red enchilada sauce
1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15-ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes in their juices
1 cup corn kernels, fresh or frozen
1 red bell pepper, cored and diced
1 green bell pepper, cored and diced
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1 tsp garlic powder

Directions:
Heat large skillet on medium high.
Spray with cooking spray and add the turkey and onion.
Cook and stir, breaking up the turkey as you go, until the turkey is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
Transfer to the bottom of a large slow cooker.
To the slow cooker, add the quinoa, enchilada sauce, black beans, tomatoes, corn, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, garlic powder, and 1/2 cup water.
Stir to combine, then cover and cook on high for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or low for 5 to 6 hours, until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is tender.
Remove the lid and stir.
Taste and adjust any seasonings as desired.
Serve hot with any desired toppings. For serving: sprinkle with Mexican blend cheese, chopped fresh cilantro, diced avocado, chopped green onion, corn chips, sour cream or plain Greek yogurt
