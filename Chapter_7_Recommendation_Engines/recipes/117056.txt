Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin cut into 1-inch thick slices
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup sliced green onions
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tablespoon butter
2 medium apples, cut into wedges
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2/3 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup unsweetened apple juice

Directions:
Flatten pork to 1/2-in. thickness. Combine the thyme, paprika, salt and pepper; sprinkle over both sides of pork. Place on a broiler pan. Broil 3-4 in. from the heat for 3-4 minutes on each side or until juices run clear; keep warm.
In a nonstick skillet, saute onions and garlic in butter until tender. Add apples; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until crisp-tender. Combine the cornstarch, broth and apple juice until smooth; stir into apple mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with pork.
