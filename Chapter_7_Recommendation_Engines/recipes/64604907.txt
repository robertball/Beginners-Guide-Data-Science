Ingredients:
3/4 cup all natural almond butter
1 cup uncooked rolled oats (gluten-free)
1/3 cup raw honey, or pure maple syrup *Note: Sometimes I add a bit LESS sweetener & they are still WONDERFUL!
1 tsp vanilla or almond extract
2 scoops chocolate or vanilla whey protein powder
1 Tbs unsweetened cacao powder
2 Tbs slivered, or crushed almonds (optional)
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
1 Tbsp melted, unrefined Coconut oil (optional)
1/2 cup dark chocolate/cacao chips (optional). I love Lily's brand sweetened with stevia found on Amazon: CleanFoodCrush.com/lilys

Directions:
Combine ingredients in large bowl.
Use your hands to combine well, and form into 1 inch round balls.
Keep them refrigerated or frozen. - I prefer these frozen!
