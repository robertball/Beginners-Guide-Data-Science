Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 eggs
12 NILLA Wafers
1 1/2 cups BAKER'S ANGEL FLAKE Coconut, tinted green
36 small jelly beans
12 (4 inch) pieces shoestring licorice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add eggs; beat just until blended.
Place wafer on bottom of each of 12 paper-lined medium muffin cups. Spoon cream cheese mixture evenly over wafers.
Bake 20 minutes or until centers are almost set. Cool. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. Top evenly with coconut and jelly beans just before serving. Bend each licorice piece, then insert both ends into each cheesecake to resemble the handle of a basket. Store leftover cheesecakes in refrigerator.
