Ingredients:
¼ cup butter, melted
10½ ounces mini marshmallows
5½ cups Rice Krispies
1½ cups milk chocolate chips
½ cup peanut butter

Directions:
Melt butter in a 6 quart kettle,add marshmallows. Melt completely over low heat. Add the Rice Krispies.
Mix well. Spread evenly into a greased 10½ x 15½ baking sheet. In a microwave safe bowl combine chocolate chips and peanut butter. Melt at 1 minute intervals until completely melted, stirring after each minute. Spread on top of Rice Krispies mixture. Let set in a cool place till chocolate mixture sets up. Be careful not to let the chocolate get too hard, it will not make a neat roll if you do.
Loosen all around with a metal spatula. Roll, starting on the long side. Sprinkle the roll with seasonal sprinkles if desired. Slice and enjoy! Can be wrapped in Saran Wrap for storage if needed.
