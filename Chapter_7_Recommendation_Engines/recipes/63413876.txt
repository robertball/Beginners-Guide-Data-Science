Ingredients:
6 (4 ounce) links Sweet Italian sausage (costco)
1 tablespoon garlic flavored olive oil
Pinch Italian Pepper flakes
1 Orange bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips
1 red bell peppers, seeded and cut into strips
1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips
1 (14.5 ounce) can Tomato Sauce
1 Cup Good Dry WHite Wine
1 tablespoon Dry Basil
1.5 teaspoon Dry Oregano
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 large onion, rough chopped
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons Good Italian Olive Oil

Directions:
Slice each sausage link into 4 pieces. Heat the garlic oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and pepper flakes, and cook until browned, turning as needed.
Drain excess grease, then add the orange, red and yellow peppers, tomato sauce, wine, basil, oregano, onion and garlic and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover, and let simmer for 20 to 30 minutes minutes.
Remove the lid, and stir. Drizzle the Olive Oil over the sauce and remove from heat.
Serve with fresh pasta and sprinkle with Parmesan and mozzarella cheese.

Description: 
This recipe reminds me of the authentic Sauasage and Peppers you can get through out the Northeast in little Mom and Pop Italian Restaurants. A light subtly sweet sauce that compliments the sausage and peppers perfectly.  Che bello!Modified from: Daddy's Sausage and Peppers
