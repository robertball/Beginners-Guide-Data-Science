Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
dash cayenne pepper
6 (12 ounce) 1 inch thick rib-eye steaks

Directions:
In a large resealable bag, combine the first 11 ingredients. Add the steaks. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 6 hours or overnight.
Drain and discard marinade. Grill steaks, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 8-10 minutes or until the meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).

When spring comes to our house, out comes the grill! My husband does a great job cooking these steaks to perfection. They taste so terrific, we often have them once a week. -Sonja Kane, Wendell, North Carolina
