To the pan add butter and melt; saute onion, garlic and mushrooms until onions are transparent.  Stir in 1 cup wine, brown sugar and vinegar.  Cook, stirring, until hot and bubbly; add chicken and carrots.
Reduce heat to medium and cook 30 minutes, until chicken is well cooked and carrots are tender crisp.
