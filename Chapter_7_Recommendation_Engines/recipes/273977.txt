Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 (4 ounce) can fire-roasted diced green chilies, with their juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
2 (14.5 ounce) cans whole new potatoes - rinsed, drained, and diced
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen corn, thawed
4 cups vegetable broth
1 cup half-and-half
1/4 cup tortilla chips, or to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon grated Cheddar cheese, or to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon sour cream, or to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon sliced green onions, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil over medium heat in a stockpot. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add chilies, garlic, paprika, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir for 2 minutes.
Stir potatoes, corn, vegetable broth, and half-and-half into mixture. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and let simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
Blend soup using an immersion blender to desired consistency, leaving some chunks of potato and corn. Top with tortilla chips, Cheddar cheese, sour cream, and green onions.
