5 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
½ cup diced pepperoni
2 bunches broccoli rabe, trimmed
salt, to taste
4  hard Italian rolls, split
8 slices provolone cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Stir garlic into the oil; cook and stir until softened but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the crushed red pepper and pepperoni; cook and stir to blend flavors, about 1 additional minute.
Stir in the broccoli rabe, coating the leaves well with oil. Cover and cook until broccoli rabe is fully wilted and soft, about 15 minutes. Season with salt.
Place a piece of cheese on cut side of each roll; fill with the broccoli rabe mixture. Serve warm.
