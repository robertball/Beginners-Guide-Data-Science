Ingredients:
2.5 c Water
1 c Red/Inca quinoa
1 bunch kale, chopped to 1" lengths
(I'm lazy - bought the pre-cut bag)
3 mild Red Peppers, roughly diced
1 lemon - zested and juiced
1/2 Sweet Onion, roughly diced
2 tbsp Minced Garlic (I buy BIG jars of this stuff!)
3 tbsp Coconut Oil
1/4 c slivered almonds, toasted
1 tbsp Olive Oil
1/2 c Feta cheese (crumbled)
Sea Salt and fresh cracked Pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the water to a boil. Add the quinoa and peppers, cover on low heat for about 10 minutes, then add the kale and replace lid. Cook for about another 5 minutes or so, then turn off the heat and allow to set.
While the quinoa and kale are cooking, heat up coconut oil, add onion and garlic, and saute (love the smell)until onion is translucent.  Remove from heat and zest lemon, followed by juicing the lemon.
Add zest, lemon juice, olive oil, toasted almonds and Feta cheese to a large serving bowl. Add the onion and garlic mix to the bowl and combine.
When the quinoa and kale are done, add to the serving bowl.  Season with sea salt and cracked pepper, mix, and serve!

Description: 
We love quinoa ... especially red quinoa.  I like kale (the kids weren't so sure about kale). The kids loved this dish!  Everyone had seconds, even my picky eater.  The combination of salty, sweet, and savory was awesome ... keeping in mind that I do the pinch-here-pinch-there style of cooking, this is easily adjusted to your personal taste.
