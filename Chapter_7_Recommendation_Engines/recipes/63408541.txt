Ingredients:
1 1/2 Cup white rice flour
1 1/2 Cup almond meal
2 Teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 Teaspoon salt
8 Very ripe bananas
2 Eggs
6 Tablespoon sugar (we like organic cane sugar)
2 Teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 Cup refined coconut oil (or other oil)
1/4 Cup chocolate chips (or to taste)

Directions:
Step 1:
Mix all dry ingredients together, and wet separately; combine the two together and be careful not to over-mix. Note: If using coconut oil, use a water bath to melt the oil. Lastly, add chocolate chips, as little or as much as you like. We find 1/4 C works perfect.
Step 2:
Bake at 350F degrees for approximately 15 minutes until golden brown-- when touching the center, it should bounce back.
