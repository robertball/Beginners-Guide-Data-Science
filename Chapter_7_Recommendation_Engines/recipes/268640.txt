Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 pounds cubed beef stew meat
1 large onion, roughly chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cinnamon stick
2 bay leaves
1 sprig fresh rosemary
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 cup red wine
2 tablespoons vinegar
2 tablespoons ketchup, or more to taste
1 pound baby shallots, peeled

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat and cook beef, onion, and garlic until meat is browned on all sides and onions are soft, 6 to 8 minutes. Add tomatoes, nutmeg, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, rosemary, salt and a good pinch of black pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until ingredients blend, about 3 minutes. Add wine and vinegar and stir to combine.
Turn slow cooker to Low setting. Pour beef mixture into slow cooker and stir in ketchup.
Cook on Low until beef is tender, 6 to 8 hours.
Meanwhile, heat remaining olive oil in a skillet and cook shallots until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cooked shallots to stew for the last 1 to 2 hours of cooking.
Remove and discard cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and rosemary sprig before serving.

Description: 
Stifado is a Greek beef stew and my all-time favorite Greek dish. Chunks of tender beef are cooked with shallots in a rich aromatic tomato sauce. Serve with boiled rice and a good supply of crusty bread to mop up the rich sauce!
