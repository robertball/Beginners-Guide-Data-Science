2 c cottage cheese
1/2 c chopped onion
1/2 c chopped pecans or walnuts
1/2 c stick butter, melted,
4 eggs
2 tsp chicken bullion granules (opt)
Sliced jellied cranberry sauce, one can

Directions:
My vegetarian friend was so excited to make it for me once that I thought I would politely choke it down so as not to hurt her feelings..BUT...it is super yummy! It is called Special K Loaf and my family loves it: 4 cups Special K cereal, 2 cups cottage cheese, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup chopped pecans or walnuts, 1/2 stick butter melted, 4 eggs, 2 tsp chicken bullion granules, mix altogether. Pour into a 7x11 pan and bake at 350 for 1 hour. Serve with sliced jellied cranberries. (We put it right on top.) I know it sounds strange, but give it a try!!
