Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 cup butter
1/2 cup HERSHEY速'S Cocoa Powder
2 cups white sugar
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
3/4 cup sour cream
2/3 cup REESE'S速 Peanut Butter Chips
1 teaspoon shortening
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup HERSHEY速'S Cocoa Powder
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (10.5 ounce) package HERSHEY速'S Jolly Jellies Sweet and Fruity Candies

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 F.  Line 13x9x2-inch baking pan with aluminum foil; grease and flour sides and bottom.
Place water, butter and cocoa in medium saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture boils; boil 1 minute.  Remove from heat; set aside.
Stir together sugar, flour, baking soda and salt in large bowl.  Add eggs, sour cream and cocoa mixture; beat just until blended (batter will be thin).  Pour into prepared pan.

Place peanut butter chips and shortening in small microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave at HIGH (100%) 30 to 45 seconds or until mixture is melted when stirred.  Place mixture in  recloseable small plastic bag; cut off tiny section of corner.  Squeeze mixture onto cake, forming grids like top of grill: allow to firm up before cutting.  Top with "burgers" and "shish kabobs", if desired.
To make Cocoa Fudge Burgers:  Beat 1/4 cup softened butter or margarine in medium bowl; add 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup Hershey's Cocoa, 2 tablespoons milk and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.  Beat until all ingredients are moistened and consistency to form patties; add additional milk or powdered sugar, if necessary, to get proper consistency.  Form "patties"; place on top of cake.
To make Shish Kabobs:  Place red, green, and tan colored jelly candies on plastic decorative skewers to form shish-kabobs, if desired.  Place on top of cake.
