Ingredients:
4 cups oats
1 cup wheat germ
1 cup chopped walnuts or slivered almonds
1/2 cup sesame seeds
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup water
1 6 oz. package dried sweetened cranberries or dried cherries

Directions:
Heat oven to 300Â°
In a large mixing bowl, stir together the oats, wheat germ, nuts, sesame seeds, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Make a well in the dry ingredients and add the oil, honey and water. Toss until well combined.
Spread the mixture evenly on a cookie sheet, and bake for 40 minutes or until lightly browned, stirring every 10 minutes to keep the mixture from sticking.
Let it cool, then stir in the cranberries.
Store in an airtight container.
