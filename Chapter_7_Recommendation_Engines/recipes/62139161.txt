Description: 
This is the real deal.  I don't know where the other people get their recipes from but the REAL Zip Sauce doesn't have all those herbs.  My father-in-law used to play poker with the owner of one of the famous steakhouses in Detroit that served this sauce and one night  he divulged the recipe to him.  Here it is!!
