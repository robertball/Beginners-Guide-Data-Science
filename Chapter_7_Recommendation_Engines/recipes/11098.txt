Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter or margarine
2 eggs
1 1/4 cups packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup flaked coconut
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup maraschino cherries, chopped
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, stir together 1 1/4 cup flour and 1/3 cup brown sugar. Rub in 1/2 cup butter using your hands or a pastry blender. Press into an ungreased 9 inch square pan.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned at the edges. Set aside. In a medium bowl, beat eggs until light.  Mix together the brown sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the eggs. Mix in the coconut, nuts, and cherries; spread the batter evenly over the baked crust.
Return to the oven, and bake for 25 minutes, or until brown. Set aside to cool. In a small bowl, mix the confectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, vanilla, and water until smooth. Add more liquid if necessary to make a more spreadable mixture.  Spread over cooled bars before cutting into squares.
