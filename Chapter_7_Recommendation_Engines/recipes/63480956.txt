Description: 
This recipe came from my Great-Great-Great Grandparents and is handed down. My 3 1/2 yr old Grandson helps me make it. He likes to mix the meat.
  I put ribbon and bows and give for food gifts at Christmas, and take to parties. It is gone VERY quickly, so I make extra for me and my family.
