Ingredients:
3-4 lb Sirloin Tip Roast
4 guajillo chiles
3 chile de arbol chiles
3 ancho chiles
3 cascabel chiles
1 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 tsp mexican oregano
1/4 tsp ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground thyme or 2-3 sprigs
6 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon salt
1 onion, minced
2 tablespoons vinegar
1 cup of water
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped cilantro
Corn tortillas

Directions:
Toast chilies on cormal or griddle.  Remove stems and seeds.  Place them in a bowl of warm water (not to hot!) and let them soak about 15-20 minutes.  After done soaking place the chilies into blender with vinegar and make a paste, you may need to add a little of the chilies water to this.
Mix the salt, pepper, cloves, oregano, cumin, cinnamon and thyme.  Rub this mixture over meat very well.  Take half of the chili paste and spread over meat.  Place meat into fridge to marinate overnight.
Fill a Dutch oven with water. Add the chopped onion, bay leaf, garlic and the remaining chile sauce to the water. Place meat on a rack that sits just above the water. Place lid on and bake for 4 hours at 350 degrees.
Remove the meat and place into serving bowls.  Let the liquid cool slightly and remove the bay leaves.  Blend the liquid and add enough hot water to make at least 2 cups. Ladle the liquid over the meat and top with chopped onion and cilantro. Serve with warm corn tortillas.

Description: 
I like to make this dish for Cinco de Mayo!  The traditional birria is served with goat instead of beef.  If you can find goat, feel free to sub it in this dish.  Dont forget the corn salsa and rice on the side.
