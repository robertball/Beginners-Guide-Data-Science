Description: 
This peach jam uses only real ingredients, no store-bought pectin. The apple provides natural pectin (especially the seeds and peel) and gives the jam a nice, firm consistency. The color is beautiful, too. Feel free to exchange the peaches with other stone fruits or berries. This makes great gifts, too. Of course, the best jam is made from Texas peaches, but I'm sure any sweet, fresh peaches will be just dandy.
