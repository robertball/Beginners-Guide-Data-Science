Ingredients:
1 t vegetable oil
1 garlic cloves, minced
3/4 cup fresh corn kernels (about 6 ears)
1/2 cups diced peeled ripe mango (about 2 pounds)
1/4 cup chopped red onion
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 & 1/3 T fresh lime juice
3/4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 of a  drained canned chipotle chile in adobo sauce, chopped
1 (8-ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
2 cups gourmet salad greens

Directions:
Browning corn in a skillet gives it a nutty, caramelized flavor that contrasts with the tartness of the mango. But brown it good--corn likes it that way.
1. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic; cook 30 seconds. Stir in corn; cook 8 minutes or until browned, stirring occasionally. Place corn mixture in a large bowl. Add mango and remaining ingredients except greens; stir well. Arrange 1 cup greens on each of 8 plates. Spoon 1 cup corn mixture over greens.

Description: 
I will make this one over and over again! (And the bonus is it's soo easy! I used frozen mangos I had on hand from Trader Joe's - just defrosted and cut them up into smaller pieces, and I also used frozen corn which I defrosted, and then cooked per the recipe directions. I also left out the chipotle, only because I served it with the Chipotle-Lime marinated flank steak, and I thought it would be chipotle OD! And we didn't serve it over greens, just by itself. Easy, easy, easyModified from: Roasted Corn, Black Bean, and Mango Salad
