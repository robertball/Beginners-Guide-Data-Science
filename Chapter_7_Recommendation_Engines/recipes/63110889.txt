Very slowly pour milk into the butter/flour mixture and whisk until thickened

Description: 
My family LOVES these potatoes. I don't make au gratin potatoes in the oven anymore.  Don't take any special pains with this recipe and add garlic or use a different type of potato or cheese if you want.  Enjoy!
