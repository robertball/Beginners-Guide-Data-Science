Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
3 cups mashed potatoes
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup grated Swiss cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a shallow 1 1/2-quart baking dish.
Spread mashed potatoes in the prepared baking dish.
Whip heavy cream in a bowl until stiff; fold in Swiss cheese and add salt and pepper to taste. Spread over the potatoes.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is delicately brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
Baked chantilly mashed potatoes with a cheese topping. You can add a variety of cheeses, bacon, or chives. I use homemade mashed potatoes, but instant work just as well.
