Ingredients:
3 large potatoes
1 (8 ounce) package turkey hot dogs OR bologna OR two cooked chicken breasts
3 eggs
3 large dill pickles, chopped
1/2 bunch green onions, chopped
1 (8 ounce) can baby peas, drained
salt & pepper to taste
sprinkling of dill
1 cup mayonnaise (or less) - Salad should be creamy
Serve extra mayo for adding to individual servings

Directions:
Place the potatoes in a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until a fork can be easily inserted and removed, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool slightly. During the last 10 minutes, boil eggs (and hot dogs, if using). Drain everything, and set aside to cool.
While still warm, peel the potatoes, and cut into cubes. Chop meat. Place everything in a large bowl, and mix in the mayonnaise, pickles, onions, eggs, peas, and seasonings to taste.  Add mayonnaise and salt to individual servings, as desired.

Description: 
This is no ordinary potato salad. This salad consists of potatoes, chicken, pickles, scallions, hard-boiled eggs, and sweet peas. All of the ingredients are finely chopped and dressed with mayonnaise.  This salad has been in my family for four generations.  Enjoy!Modified from: Russian Potato Salad
