Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
- 2 - 15 ounce cans of Van Kamp's Baked Beans
- 1/2 cup Ketchup
- 1/2 cup Dark Brown Sugar
- 1 Tbsp Yellow Mustard
- 3-4 pieces pre-cooked bacon (chopped)
- 1/2 average size onion (chopped)

Directions:
Drain both cans as best you can and dump into at least a 1.5 qt casserole dish.  (I don't like soupy baked beans.  If you like them more moist, drain less of the juice). Combine with listed ingredients.  Cover and bake at 350 for 90 minutes.

This easy recipe has been a favorite at family dinners and pot lucks for years.  Where ever she brought these beans, someone always raved about them!  She never understood why because it's so easy to make!
