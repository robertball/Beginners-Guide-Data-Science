Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
2 cups frozen peas and carrots mix
1 cup corn
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 3/4 cups chicken broth
2/3 cup milk
4 (9 inch)  unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
In a saucepan, combine chicken, carrots, peas, and corn. Add water to cover and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain and set aside.
In the saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir in flour, salt, and pepper. Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
Place the chicken mixture in bottom pie crusts. Pour hot liquid mixture over. Cover with top crusts, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This recipe is delicious but I had to make some changes so that my kids would eat it. I replaced the celery and onion with corn. I used frozen carrots, the kind that are tiny cubes, and made them into mini pot pies (you can buy mini pot pie foil tins at the local grocery store). The result is just as delicious and my kids love them! I also like to add little more love by making cute designs with the extra dough.Modified from: Chicken Pot Pie IX
