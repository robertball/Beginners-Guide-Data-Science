Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh Brussels sprouts
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Trim ends off Brussels sprouts. Quarter large ones and halve smaller ones. Place in a large bowl; drizzle with olive oil and mix well. Pour onto a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with garlic powder and seasoned salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, 30 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
These Brussels are roasted on a lower heat so you get both soft and tender and brown and crispy sprouts. I like roasted sprouts but found high-temp recipes left me with really charred results, and some of the sprouts were still hard. If I was making these for myself, I'd drizzle some balsamic reduction on top to finish, but my family wouldn't care for that.
