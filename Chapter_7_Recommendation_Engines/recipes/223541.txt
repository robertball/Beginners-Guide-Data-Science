Description: 
I have taken this to potlucks in the past and people really love it! My family loves it too. Not the stuff of 5-star restaurants, but for my family this is comfort food! Take care with the type of hot dogs you buy because some of the really inexpensive ones have so much water in them it will make the sauce very thin.
