Ingredients:
1 pound grape tomatoes, halved
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
5 fresh basil leaves, chopped
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place tomatoes onto a large square of aluminum foil. Drizzle olive oil over tomatoes and top with garlic, basil, thyme, and salt. Wrap the foil around tomato mixture sealing tightly to keep juices inside.
Bake in the preheated oven until tomatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Cool slightly.
