Ingredients:
1 lb. fresh or frozen raw shrimp
1/2-1 lg. cucumber-peeled and diced
2 roma tomatoes-diced
1/3 onion-diced
1 jalape√±o-seeded and diced (leave the seeds for extra spice)
2-3 fresh limes-juiced
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Very simply throw all the ingredients into a bowl, pour or squeeze in lime juice, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and mix. Cover with aluminum or plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
*Do not leave the spoon in the seviche as the acid in the lime will tarnish it and make the whole dish taste like metal.*
I know this sounds like obvious advice, but alot of people have done it!

Description: 
Very simple and takes no time to make this. The hardest part is leaving it in the fridge overnight to marry the flavors. My husband cant keep his fingers out of it!
