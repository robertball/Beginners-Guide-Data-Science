Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 green bell peppers, diced small
1 onion, diced small
1 clove garlic, minced
2 1/2 pounds ground beef
3 quarts water
2 (29 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 (28 ounce) cans petite diced tomatoes in juice
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup beef base
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups water
2 cups brown rice

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir bell pepper, onion, and garlic in hot oil until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Break ground beef into small chunks and add to the pot; cook and stir until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes more. Drain excess fat and return pot to heat.
Stir water, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, ketchup, beef base, brown sugar, salt, and pepper into the beef mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until the flavors marry, about 30 minutes.
While the soup simmers, bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes; stir into the soup.

Description: 
I gave some of this soup to a neighbor who said that her husband probably wouldn't eat it as it had onions in it. She said he tried it, loved it, and asked me for the recipe. I have used instant brown rice, and it worked fine.
