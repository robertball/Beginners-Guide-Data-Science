Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) container refrigerated pizza crust
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1 clove garlic, minced
3 roma (plum) tomatoes, sliced
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Roll out pizza dough, and place on a baking sheet. Mix mayonnaise, Parmesan, basil, and garlic in a small bowl. Spread mayonnaise mixture on pizza crust; top with sliced tomatoes. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until crust is golden brown and cheese is bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Cut into squares to serve.

Description: 
This is so simple.  Reminds me of a Margherita Pizza.  Very flavorful.  I also think the sauce would also taste great on a panini sandwich, though I've never tried it.
