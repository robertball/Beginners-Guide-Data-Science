Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
6 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
10 tablespoons unsalted butter or margarine, at room temperature
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup flour
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
3 large eggs, at room temperature
1 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries thawed, puréed in blender
Fresh raspberries, optional
1/2 cup heavy cream, softly beaten
Fresh mint sprigs, optional
Confectioners' sugar for dusting, optional

Directions:
Spray inside 6 individual soufflé dishes or custard cups with nonstick cooking spray; set aside. In small heavy saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate, stirring until smooth. Add butter and sugar; stir until melted.
Pour chocolate mixture into large bowl. In small bowl, mix together flour, cocoa, and baking powder.
With electric mixer at medium-high speed, beat chocolate mixture; add eggs and flour mixture; beat about 6 minutes until thickened. Divide mixture evenly among prepared dishes; cover with plastic wrap. Freeze at least 2 hours or overnight.
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.
Remove and discard plastic from frozen cakes. Bake 15 to 18 minutes, until edges are set and center is moist. Cool cakes slightly before inverting onto serving platters.
