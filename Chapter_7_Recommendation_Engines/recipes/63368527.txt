Ingredients:
8 oz package Country Style Chicken Breakfast Sausage slice into 1/2" pieces
3 pieces Phyllo Dough 13 x 18" cut into 6" squares
1 Each Cooking Spray, canola, butter, 1/3 sec spray
1/2 Cup scallions, tops & bulb, fresh, chopped
4 oz chopped spinach, defrosted and squeezed dry
6 large eggs
1/3 Cup low sodium cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F
Spray 6 custard cups or a standard muffin pan (6 oz capacity) with cooking spray. Line each cup with 3 layers of phyllo dough and spray with the butter cooking spray between each layer.
In a small bowl mix the chicken sausage, scallions and spinach. Divide the mixture between cups. Break 1 egg into each cup, sprinkle with pepper and top each with about 1 tablespoon of the cheese.
Bake in the oven for 18 minutes or until the yolks are set. Serve either in custard cups or gently remove (let the egg cups cool 3 minutes before trying to remove).
