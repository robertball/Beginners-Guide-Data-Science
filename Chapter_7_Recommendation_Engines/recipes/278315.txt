Description: 
My husband has been begging me for a soft homemade meatball for years. This recipe turned out amazing, they are nice and tender, but won't fall apart. One batch makes 50+ meatballs (depending on size). These can be simmered in sauce, frozen for later, etc. I freeze them after cooking to use as needed for quick meals.
