Ingredients:
3/4 cup brown rice flour
3/4 cup almond flour
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup carob powder
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 banana, mashed
2 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan.
Combine brown rice flour, almond flour, milk, carob powder, honey, vegetable oil, banana, eggs, vanilla extract, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; whisk together until well-mixed. Pour into prepared cake pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. If the middle is not baked through, lower the oven temperature to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C) and continue baking, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
Just made this cake on the fly because I was supposed to make pancakes but we went out for breakfast and I already had a bowl with some flours mixed together. It is the best gluten-free carob cake I have ever made. It's somewhere between super-moist awesome cake and banana bread. Serve with your fave ice cream or fruit. It can even be a sweet treat for breakfast if you wish. Hope you try it out.
