Ingredients:
1	teaspoon  garlic powder
1/2	teaspoon  paprika
1/2	teaspoon  salt
1/2	teaspoon  pepper
1/4	teaspoon  cayenne pepper
1	cup  all-purpose flour
4	bone-in rib or center-cut pork chops . about 3/4 inch thick

Cut 2 slits about 2 inches apart through fat on edges of each chop. Season both sides of chops with spice mixture, then dredge chops lightly in flour (do not discard flour). Transfer to plate and let rest 10 minutes.
2. RENDER BACON Meanwhile, cook bacon in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until fat renders and bacon is crisp, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel-lined plate and reserve for another use. Do not wipe out pan.
