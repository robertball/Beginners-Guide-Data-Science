Ingredients:
- 1 Peppermill House Puff Pastry Dough
- 1 whole brie
- 1 egg mixed with 1 Tbsp water
- 1/2c Sliced Almonds
- 3/4c Dried Cranberries
- 1/2c Apricot Preserve Jam

Directions:
Let dough thaw overnight or for at least 2 hours at room temperature. Once dough is thawed, with a rolling pin flatten dough out til about 14in. square. With a knife or pizza cutter trim the corners to make a circle (Touch the dough as little as possible)
Spread the jam throughout the dough leaving 1 inch margin around the edge, sprinkle the almonds and cranberries, then place the brie in the middle of the dough. Brush the edges of the pastry with the egg mixture.
Fold 2 opposite sides of the pastry over the cheese cut off 2 inches from the top and bottom dough, then fold remaining dough on top, covering the brie completely press the edges with your finger forming a seal (Remove any excess jam that leaks out) Place the wrapped cheese on a nonstick baking sheet folded side down. Brush on more of the egg mixture on top of the dough to create a nice golden brown top.
Place in preheated oven 400 degrees, make for 20min or until top is golden brown. Let it stand for 30min before serving, set out with a knife and dig in!
