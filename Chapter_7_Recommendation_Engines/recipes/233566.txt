Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) package wide egg noodles
1 (12 ounce) can white tuna in water, drained
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives
1 (10.75 ounce) can  low-fat cream of mushroom soup
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
5 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 (15 ounce) can asparagus spears, drained and cut into thirds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain.
Stir noodles, tuna, black olives, and cream of mushroom soup together in the bottom of a casserole dish. Add 2/3 cup Cheddar cheese, hot pepper sauce, and black pepper to the noodle mixture; mix. Gently fold asparagus into the noodle mixture. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar cheese over the dish.
Bake in preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
