Ingredients:
3 tablespoons peanut butter
2 tablespoons strawberry jelly
2 tablespoons marshmallow creme
4 slices bread
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Stir together peanut butter, strawberry jelly, and marshmallow creme until just combined. Spread the peanut butter mixture on 2 slices of bread, and top with the remaining 2 bread slices.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat, and fry sandwiches, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from heat, cut in half, and serve.
