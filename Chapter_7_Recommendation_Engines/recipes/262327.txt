Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
3  carrots, sliced
3 stalks celery, sliced
½ large onion, diced
1 tablespoon dried basil
3 dashes red pepper flakes
sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste
3 cloves garlic, chopped
3 quarts chicken broth
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1  bay leaf
2 cups frozen corn
2  zucchini, sliced
1 (12 ounce) package firm tofu, crumbled
½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms, or to taste
¼ cup chopped kale, or to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add carrots; saute until well coated in oil, 3 to 5 minutes. Add celery, onion, 1/2 the basil, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Saute until just soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, diced tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, bay leaf, and remaining basil. Bring soup to a boil.
Stir corn, zucchini, tofu, and mushrooms into the pot with the soup. Season with salt and black pepper. Bring back to a boil and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until flavors blend and vegetable are fork-tender, about 1 hour. Add kale, cover, and simmer until wilted, about 15 minutes more.

Description: 
Tasty vegetable tofu soup I threw together one cold afternoon. You could, of course, add as few or as little veggies as you like. Topping it with some shredded Parmesan cheese really makes it yummy.
