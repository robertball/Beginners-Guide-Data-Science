Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 large onion, minced
4 large carrots, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves
1 (16 ounce) package linguine, cooked and drained
Grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook the beef, onion, carrots and garlic in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat.  Pour off any fat.
Stir the tomatoes with juice, soup and water in the skillet and heat to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low.  Cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the basil.
Place the linguine into a large bowl.  Add the beef mixture and toss to coat.  Serve with the cheese.
