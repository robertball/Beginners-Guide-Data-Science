Ingredients:
Meatballs
This yields approximately 30 1-ounce meatballs.
1½ pounds of ground beef (24 ounces)
¼ pound of ground Italian sausage (4 ounces)
2 eggs
½ cup Bread crumbs
¼ cup Heavy Cream
¼ cup Marinara sauce, made from San Marzano plum tomatoes
3 tablespoons of Parmesan Cheese
1 teaspoon of minced, fresh garlic
Pinch of salt, pepper and Italian seasoning

Directions:
Bring 12-16 ounces of marinara sauce to simmer.
Combine ingredients in bowl and mix.
Shape meat into 1-ounce balls or to desired size. Brown all sides of meatballs in saute’ pan in extra virgin olive oil. Drain excess oil.
Add marinara sauce to meatballs. Simmer until meat is cooked all the way through, around 20 minutes.
Chef Tips From Chef Robert Smith:
Marinara sauce in the meatball mix keeps the meat from drying out during the cooking process.
When combining your ingredients, don't over mix it, because it will get tough.
Mix in one direction so everything will incorporate evenly.
For a healthier option, bake your meatballs on a cookie sheet at 350 degrees, until they brown.
Then you can mix them in the sauce in a sauté pan to simmer for 20 minutes, or until they are cooked all the way through.
