Ingredients:
3 bananas, ripe
2 cups rolled oats
1/3 cup almond milk (I prefer unsweetened vanilla)
2 tbsp. almond butter
1 tsp. vanilla extract
dash of salt
1/8 tsp. pumpkin spice
turbinado sugar (optional)
sliced almonds (optional)
chocolate chips or raisins (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. In a medium bowl, mash the bananas.
Add the rolled oats, almond milk, almond butter, vanilla extract, salt, and pumpkin spice in a bowl with the bananas and mix.
(optional) add chocolate chips or raisins into the mixture.
Using a spoon, scoop up mixture and place into a greased cooking sheet. The cookies will not grow while baking so you can place them close to each other.
(optional) Sprinkle turbinado sugar and sliced almonds on top of each cookie.
Bake for 12-14 minutes

Description: 
This is the perfect cookie for those of us who love cookies but are trying to be healthier. This recipe is dairy-free, sugar-free, and fat-free! I was a bit worried that since it doesn't have the unhealthy components that it wouldn't taste good, but my husband loved it!
