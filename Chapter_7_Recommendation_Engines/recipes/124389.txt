Description: 
I'VE PREPARED this dish for a tableful of people, but it's easy to fix for just two. All the ingredients can be adjusted to satisfy the appetites to be served. If you like different vegetables, simple cook them right along with the other ingredients. My side dishes for this meal are bread and a toasted salad.                                                      --Shirley Lazor                                                      Colorado Springs, Colorado
