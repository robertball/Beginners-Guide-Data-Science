Ingredients:
4 Cups AP Flour
3 Cups Water
1/4 Cup Milk
1/4 Cup Active Culture Yoghurt
1 tsp Sugar
Farmhouse and Gueuze Beer dregs (See Directions)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl, cover loosely and leave to ferment.  When starter falls, transfer to a sealed container and leave at room temperature for several days.  Refrigerate.  After each use, replace lost volume with equal parts flour and water, wait for fermentation to complete and return to fridge.
Recommendations for sourdough cultures;
Yoghurt and Milk are good sources for Lactobacillus and Streptococcus.
Dregs from varous beers also bring some amazing character to the starter.
Farmhouse ales = Yeasts, Lacto and Pediococcus
Gueuze/Lambic = Yeasts, Lacto and Brettanomyces
The trick here is to keep in mind that some of these critters are a bit tempramental and you may have to reintroduce regularly to keep them going.  Remember that filtered beer is essentially sterile in the bottle, so don't bother.  Enjoy some real beer and then you'll have some tasty dregs for your starter.

Description: 
Most sourdough starters I've encountered are merely a bread sponge left to get funky.  Results vary greatly.  Why not stack the odds in your favor by bringing the correct beasties to the party and enjoy a few beers while you are at it?
