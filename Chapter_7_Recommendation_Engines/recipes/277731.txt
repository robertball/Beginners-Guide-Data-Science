Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 (4 pound) leg of lamb
1 large sweet onion, sliced
5 cups water
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add lamb and cook until outside is browned, about 5 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and add onion to the oil in the skillet. Saute until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Place onion in the bottom of a slow cooker pot and place the lamb roast on top. Mix water, soy sauce, garlic, and onion soup mix together and pour over the roast. Cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours.
Remove roast, cover lightly with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes before carving. Mix butter and flour into a paste. Add small pieces of this paste to the hot cooking liquid, mixing well to incorporate. Cook until sauce reaches desired thickness, 5 to 6 minutes.
Slice roast thinly and serve with gravy.

Description: 
We adore Australian or New Zealand lamb, which has more flavor than the blander US lamb. So I was happy to have been given this simple recipe using a Crock-PotÂ®. Great served with mashed potatoes.
