Ingredients:
1 cup pecan halves or pieces
1 1/3 cups light brown sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup shortening
2 eggs, at room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
3 cups gluten-free oats
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Toast pecans in the preheated oven until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Chop coarsely.
Combine brown sugar, butter, and shortening in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time. Beat in vanilla extract.
Sift gluten-free flour, 1 packet plus 2 teaspoons gelatin, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and ginger together in a bowl. Mix into the brown sugar mixture on low speed. Mix pecans, oats, and raisins into the dough.
Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 13 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
