Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup white sugar
3 egg yolks
2/3 cup butter, softened

Directions:
Put flour in a large bowl, and make a  hole in the middle.  In the hole, place the salt, sugar, egg yolks, and softened butter.
Mingle the ingredients in the middle, adding flour little by little, and stopping as soon as you achieve a homogeneous mixture.
Shape the dough into a ball and cover it in cellophane wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
  It is a typically French pie crust also known as Pate Sablee.  I hope it helps you and anyone else looking for pie dough. Use real butter and fresh eggs for best results. Note: The dough is generally cooked at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 20 minutes. The dough will work well with tarts, large and small, and pies. Don't forget to prick the dough with a fork just as you would with other doughs.
