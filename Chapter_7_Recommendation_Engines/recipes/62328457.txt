Ingredients:
*  1 1/2 pounds small chicken cutlets (8 to 12)
* kosher salt and pepper
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 1/2 pints grape or cherry tomatoes
* 3/4 cup dry white wine (such as Sauvignon Blanc)
* 4 scallions, sliced
* 2 tablespoons fresh tarragon leaves, chopped

Directions:
1.  Season the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches, cook the chicken until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side; transfer to plates.
2. Add the tomatoes to the skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until they begin to burst, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Add the wine and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the scallions and tarragon and serve with the chicken.
