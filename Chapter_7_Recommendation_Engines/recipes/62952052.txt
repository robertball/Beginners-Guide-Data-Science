Ingredients:
3 small russet potatoes
1 head of garlic (12-14 cloves)
1/3 cup of fresh lemon juice
1/2 tbsp. salt
1/2 cup canola oil or olive oil

Directions:
Peel three small russet potatoes and boil in water until soft. Mash the potatoes and let cool.
Crush and peel a whole head of garlic (about 12 large cloves). Place raw garlic in a heavy duty blender or food processor with 1/2 tbsp. of salt and juice of two large lemons (about 1/3 cup). Pour 1/2 cup of oil into a measuring cup and pour a small amount of oil from cup onto garlic (just enough for a light layer). Puree the garlic, salt and lemon juice on "High" and begin pouring a slow, steady stream of oil through the blender's handle hole until everything has mixed completely!
Add the mashed potatoes, about 2-3 tablespoons at a time. Add more potato after the sauce becomes consistent, and keep adding until all is incorporated in the sauce.
Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool completely in the fridge. Chill for at least one hour or over night.
