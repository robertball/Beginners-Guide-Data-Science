Ingredients:
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 small zucchini, very finely diced
1 roasted red bell pepper, finely diced
1/2 cup corn kernels
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh oregano (or 1 teaspoon dry)
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 1/2 pounds extra lean ground beef
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
1/2 cup shredded light Mexican blend cheese
3/4 cup ketchup
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon chipotle in adobo, minced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the zucchini, season with salt and pepper and cook until the almost soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saut√© an additional 30 seconds to one minute. Remove from heat and stir in roasted red pepper, corn and cayenne. Set aside to cool.
Whisk the egg, oregano and cilantro together in a large bowl. Add beef, panko, cheese, 1/2 cup ketchup, and vegetable mixture. Mix until just combined.
Press the mixture into a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Whisk the remaining 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and chipotle in a small bowl. Pour the ketchup mixture over the top of the meatloaf. Bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Let rest 10 minutes before slicing.
