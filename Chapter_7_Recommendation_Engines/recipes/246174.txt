Ingredients:
1 pound boneless chicken breasts
4 cups water
2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles (without flavor packet)
1 ½ cups frozen peas and carrots
2  egg yolks
¼ cup chopped scallions, or to taste
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 cup kimchi

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil; cook chicken until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain water and shred chicken using a knife and fork.
Bring 4 cups water to a boil; add noodles and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add chicken, peas and carrots, and egg yolks; cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until soup is heated through, about 5 minutes. Add scallions and soy sauce; cook for 2 minutes more.
Transfer soup to bowls and serve with kimchi on the side.
