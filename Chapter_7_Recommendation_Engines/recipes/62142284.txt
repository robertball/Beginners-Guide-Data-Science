Ingredients:
6 Chicken Breasts
1 cans Black Beans
1 can pinto Beans
1 16 ounce jar Salsa Verde
2 cans Sweet Corn
2 tsp ground red pepper
3 cans Diced Tomatos
1 pkg Taco seasoning
3 tsp Cilantro
1 teaspoon Ground Cumin
1/2 cup of soft cream cheese

Directions:
Place chicken breasts in bottom of slow cooker.
Add all remaining ingredients, except cream cheese.
Cook on low for 8-10 hours.
Remove some of the liquid to make the dish a thick stew. Otherwise, leave all the liquid if you want a soup.
Add the cream cheese (whipped style is best because it is soft and will blend best), cook on warm setting for approx another 15 minutes, then stir and serve.

Description: 
My old roommate, who was latino, gave me this recipe about 8 years ago.  Recently I was cleaning out a cookbook and found the recipe tucked away.  This is extremely delicious.  I don't know what it was called, she just said it was something her mom use to make when she was younger. Depending on how Spicy you like it, you omit or ramp up any variety of hot spices you like.  This is great served over rice with shredded cheese and sour cream. Or even with corn bread. It is really versatile.
