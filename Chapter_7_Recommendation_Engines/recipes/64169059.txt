Ingredients:
Ingredients:
Servings: 1
1 large potato, per person
1/4 cup chopped celery, per person (include leaves)
1/4 cup chopped onion, per person
1/4-1/2 cup milk or 1/4-1/2 cup half-and-half or 1/4-1/2 cup cream
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Peel and cube potatoes.
Put in a saucepan along with the onions and celery.
Add water, but don't quite cover the vegetables.
Bring to a boil, lower heat, cover and simmer for 25 minutes, or until all of the vegetables are very tender.
Using a potato masher, coarsely crush the potatoes, but don't mash them--you want chunks left.
Add enough milk or cream to thin to desired thickness and add salt& pepper to taste.
(It will take a lot of salt!).
