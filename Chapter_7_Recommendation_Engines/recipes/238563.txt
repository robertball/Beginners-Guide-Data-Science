Stir pork and beans, brown sugar, ketchup, barbeque sauce, bacon, and dry mustard together in the prepared baking dish.

Description: 
I have been making this for almost 40 years. The original recipe calls for all ketchup; it was my idea to make that half ketchup and half barbeque sauce. I do love spicy. I have never had a baked bean recipe that was this good and also this easy. Nobody will know you didn't spend all day on it.
