Ingredients:
4 cups course-ground whole wheat flour
4 cups white flour
3 tsp salt
1 Tbl baking soda
3 to 4 cups buttermilk

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add 3 cups of the buttermilk. Start mixing with a wooden spoon and then with hands to get a soft dough. Add more buttermilk if needed until dough is soft but not sticking to hands. Turn onto a floured surface and knead for several minutes into a circular shape about 3 inches thick. Make two shallow cuts in the top to form a cross. Put into a 12 inch cast iron skillet and bake at 475 degrees for 20 minutes. Reduce oven to 400 degrees and bake an additional 20 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when tapped. Let cool 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
Even though I'm German, I drink like an Irishman, so I needed to bake like one too. This bread covers that need and helps in celebrating St. Patrick's Day.
