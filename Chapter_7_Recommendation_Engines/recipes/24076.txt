Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 1/2 cups water
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 pinch dried basil
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
4 ounces uncooked spaghetti

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef with the onion until all pink is gone; drain.
Stir in tomato sauce, water, salt, parsley, basil and pepper; mix well.  Heat until sauce boils. Break spaghetti in half and drop into sauce a little at a time. Cover and turn to low.
Cook until spaghetti is tender, approximately 20 to 25 minutes.  Stir occasionally to keep from sticking to pan and from noodles sticking together. Add water, 1/2 to 1 cup, if it starts to dry out and noodles are not cooked.
