Ingredients:
5 potatoes
6 eggs
1 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup dill pickle relish
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1 tablespoon dijon mustard
ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup mayonnaise
3/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Peel potatoes and dice. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil; cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool slightly, peel and chop. While the eggs and potatoes are cooking, combine the celery, onion, relish, garlic salt, celery salt, mustard, pepper, mayonnaise and sour cream. Mix with potatoes and eggs while warm for best results. Refrigerate until chilled.
