Remove it from the oven and open to half. Remove seeds from peppers and place them in a bowl with enough water boiling to cover them. Let stand for 30 minutes and remove them from the water. Despise not the water. You scrape the pulp from the inside of the peppers and discard the shells. (Note: the shell gives a bitter taste to the sauce). Returns the pulp to water and reserve.
