Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour, Unbleached
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
3/4 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup sugar
2/3 cup packed golden brown sugar
1/2 cup orange marmalade
1/2 cup orange juice
3 cups peeled and grated carrots
3/4 cup toasted chopped walnuts
FROSTING
4 packages cream cheese, (8-oz packages), room temperature
2 cups powdered sugar
1 1/4 cups orange marmalade
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, (3/4 stick), room temperature
2 teaspoons Grated orange peel
1 1/4 cups Finely chopped toasted (about 6 oz) walnuts

Directions:
FOR CAKE: Preheat oven to 350-degree F. Butter and flour two  9-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides.  Sift first 5 ingredients  into medium bowls.
Beat eggs, oil, sugars, marmalade and juice in large  bowl until blended.  Stir in dry ingredients.  Fold in carrots and nuts.
Divide batter between cake pans.  Bake until tester inserted into centers  comes out clean, about 40 minutes.  Transfer cakes to racks; cool 15  minutes.  Turn out cakes onto racks; cool completely.
FOR FROSTING: Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar in large  bowl until smooth.  Add 3/4 cup marmalade, butter and orange peel and beat  just until smooth.  If necessary, cover and chill until firm enough to  spread.
Place 1 cake on plate.  Spread with 1/4 cup marmalade.  Spread 1 cup  frosting over.  Top with second cake.  Spoon 2 cups frosting into pastry  bag fitted with large star tip.  Spread remaining frosting smoothly over  top and sides of cake.
Pipe frosting in 4 parallel lines atop cake in opposite direction, forming  lattice.  Press 1 cup nuts onto sides of cake.  Pipe ring of frosting  around top edge of cake.
Stir 1/4 cup marmalade to loosen; spoon some into  1 row of lattice diamonds.  Spoon some remaining nuts into next row of  diamonds.
Repeat, alternating marmalade and nuts, filling rows completely.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover with cake dome and chill.)
