Ingredients:
6 tbsp gluten free or whole wheat flour
6 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
1/8 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
1 tbsp unsalted butter or coconut oil, melted and cooled
1 large egg
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp plain, non-fat greek yoghurt
1/4 cup pure maple syrup, room temp

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 F and lightly coat a 6" square baking pan with non-stick cooking spray. You can also grease the pan with butter or line it with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the butter, egg, and vanilla. Stir in the greek yoghurt and mix until no large lumps remain. Then stir in the maple syrup.
Add the flour mixture to the bowl and stir until just incorporated.
Spread the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 10-14 minutes (the longer it is left to cook, the more firm the brownies will be.)
Cool the brownies to room temperature in the pan and let sit overnight for a full fudgy flavor.
