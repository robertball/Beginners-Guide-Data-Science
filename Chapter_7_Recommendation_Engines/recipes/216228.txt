Ingredients:
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix (such as Lipton®)
1 small onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (2 1/2 pound) boneless beef chuck roast
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper
1 (10 ounce) bag baby carrots
1 (16 ounce) package baby red potatoes, cut in half
3 stalks celery, cut into 3-inch pieces

Directions:
Mix beer, cream of mushroom soup, onion soup mix, onion, and garlic together in a slow cooker. Season beef chuck roast with salt and pepper, and place in the slow cooker. Arrange the carrots and potatoes around the meat.
Cook on Low for 6 hours, then add the celery. Continue cooking until the roast falls apart easily and the potatoes are softened, about 2 hours more. Serve the meat and vegetables with the remaining gravy on top.
