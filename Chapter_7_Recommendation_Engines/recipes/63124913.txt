Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts cooked and chopped
1/2 cup celery, chopped
1 1/2 cups blue cheese dressing (Marie's Super Bleu Cheese recommended)
1/2 cup Frank's Red Hot Sauce
1 cup ricotta cheese
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 cups mozzarella cheese
1/2 package no-boil lasagna noodles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine bleu cheese dressing and hot sauce in a bowl, set aside.  In another bowl stir together the ricotta cheese and egg, set aside.  Combine the chicken an celery in another bowl.  To compose the lasagna, coat the bottom of a small baking dish with a thin layer of dressing mixture.  Place two lasagna noodles side by side over the sauce.  Spread 1/3 of the ricotta/egg mixture over the noodles.  Scatter 1/2 of the chicken and celery mixture over the ricotta.  Drizzle 1/4 of the dressing mixture over the chicken.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese over the sauce.  Place two more lasagna noodles in the pan and repeat the layering process.  Top the final lasagna noodles with the remaining sauce and cheese.  Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 45 minutes.  Remove the foil and bake 10 minutes longer.  Cool for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
