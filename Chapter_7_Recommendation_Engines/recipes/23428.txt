Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 onion, shredded
1/2 cup uncooked white rice
2 tablespoons dried parsley
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 carrot, shredded
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup all-purpose flour for coating
2 eggs
1/2 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Fill a large soup pot three-quarters full with water and bring to a boil.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine beef, onion, rice, parsley, dill, olive oil, cumin, mayonnaise, carrot, salt and pepper.  Form into small meatballs and coat each meatball in flour.  Ease the meatballs into the boiling water, cover and reduce heat to low.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, until meatballs are no longer pink and soup has thickened slightly, 15 minutes.
In a small bowl, beat eggs with lemon juice.  Stir a spoonful of hot soup into egg mixture and beat well.  Then pour egg mixture into soup and stir.  Serve hot.

Description: 
Serve hot as a main dish with maybe some yogurt added in the bowl.  Try substituting mint for the dill in the meatballs or cooking them in beef broth instead of water for variety.  Add a couple of chile peppers if you're feeling daring.
