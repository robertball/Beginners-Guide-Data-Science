Ingredients:
2/3 cup flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 tsp cinnamon
kosher salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and diced
4 stalks rhubarb, trimmed and cut in 1/2-inch slices
3 cups strawberries, trimmed and quartered
3/4 cup sugar
3 tbsp cornstarch
2 tsp Grand Marnier (or lemon or orange juice)
1 tbsp lemon or orange zest
1/4 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375°.
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, oats, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of kosher salt. Cut and dice the 6 tablespoons of chilled butter. Using a pastry blender (or, if you don’t have one, rub the butter in with your fingers) cut and mix until crumbly. Place the mixture in the refrigerator.
Grease one 9×9-inch pan with butter or butter flavored cooking spray.  Set aside.
In another medium bowl, combine the rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, cornstarch, Grand Marnier, zest, and another 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of kosher salt.  Spoon the mixture into the prepared dish. Spread the chilled topping over the strawberry-rhubarb mixture.
Bake for 30 minutes.

Description: 
All seasons have a fruit for a crisp. Berries in the summer, apples in the fall, pears in the winter. As for spring, its rhubarb and its combination with strawberry that makes a delicious dish. This spring version of a crisp highlights the wonderful flavor combination of the two. And of course, the oat, butter, sugar and cinnamon speckled topping is given. If you've never worked with rhubarb before, this is the perfect first.
