Ingredients:
1 Family Size Pkg Chiquita Bites Peeled Apples
1 Pastry Crust
1/4 cup butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 tsp cinnamon
3/4 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup pecans chopped

2. Bake mini pastry shells in oven for 12 minutes or until the shell is no longer raw but still pale. Remove sheet from oven and reduce heat to 350 degrees.
3. In pan over medium heat, melt butter. Add apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger and salt. Coat apples and simmer about 2-3 minutes. Add pecans and continue to simmer for 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.
$. Scoop a little of the mixture into the pastry shell until each is filled. Bake 25-30 minutes or until slightly golden brown.
Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
