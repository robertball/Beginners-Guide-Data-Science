Ingredients:
3 cups young arugula leaves, rinsed and dried
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 dash fresh lemon juice
sea salt to taste
1/2 cup young arugula leaves, rinsed and dried
4 (8 ounce) fillets tilapia
1 tablespoon grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
Combine 3 cups arugula, garlic, pecans, olive oil, 1/4 CUP Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, black pepper, and lemon juice in a blender and blend until it reaches the consistency of a pesto sauce.
Spread 1/2 cup arugula on the prepared baking pan. Place the tilapia fillets on the arugula. Spread the remaining pesto generously on top of fillets. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese on the pesto.
Bake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Having lived in the culinary paradise known as Vietnam for a few years has inspired me to experiment with a variety of Asian fusion dishes; this is one of my favorites. Most of these ingredients are abundant in the US as well as in Vietnam. This unique pesto gives the Tilapia a tantalizing flavor.  Hope you enjoy!
