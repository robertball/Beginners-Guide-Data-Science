Ingredients:
3 slices bacon, diced
1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
2 cups diced celery
1 white onion, diced
5 ounces shredded carrots
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt
1 head cabbage, shredded
1 sweet apple, diced

Directions:
Cook and stir bacon in a Dutch oven over medium heat until browned and crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper-towel lined plate and drain grease from Dutch oven.
Cook and stir Italian sausage in Dutch oven until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour beef broth into Dutch oven and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
Stir celery, onion, carrot, Italian seasoning, coriander, garlic, black pepper, and sea salt into beef broth mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until vegetables are tender and liquid is reduced, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir cabbage, apple, and cooked bacon into vegetable mixture; cook until cabbage and apples are tender and desired consistency is reached, 30 to 45 minutes.
