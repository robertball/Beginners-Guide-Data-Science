3.5 c ground almonds
_________

1 c ground almonds
1 c powdered sugar

***Do not flatten cookie dough***See picture***
Place three sliced almond pieces into a star triangle, each with one end in the center, radiating outward.
Press in the center-end of almond slices to create an indentation in the
center of each cookie.  Sides of cookie will be high, center will be low.
Bake at 325·F exactly 15 minutes. Cookies will be light colored, and are done.  Longer baking times result in a harder, dryer cookie.
Allow to rest, in situ, to cool 10 minutes.
Finish cooling on rack.
Store in airtight container.
We absolutely adore these biscuits.  Bon Appetit!

Description: 
Wonderful for a tea, as a dessert with espresso, or dunking into milk. These little biscuits hold their shape, while being divinely chewy.  The flavor and texture of freshly ground almonds prevails long after you've finished one!  So dainty, making a lovely house warming gift all year long.
