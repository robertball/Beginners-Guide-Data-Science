Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
1/4 cup Nutella chocolate hazelnut spread
1 pear, chopped
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Combine two crescent roll triangles by overlapping the seams, creating a square. Repeat with remaining dough to form 4 squares total.
Spread 1 tablespoon Nutella in the center of each square; top each with pieces of chopped pear. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon atop pear slices.
Fold one corner of a square over to completely cover the fillings, or simply roll up the contents in the dough; seal the edges together. Repeat with remaining squares. Arrange pear rolls on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake on the preheated oven until dough is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
