In a big bowl mix 2 1/4 cups flour, shortening, butter and salt. Using a pastry knife, continue mixing until particles are size of small peas. Add water, a tablespoon at a time until all particles are moistened. Use only enough water to make pastry form a ball. Cut in half to make two balls. Roll out between wax paper. Flip one pastry into pie dish/pan, patching with any fallen pieces. Pour pear mixture in and dot with butter. Top with the second pastry, crimp edges, cut vents, sprinkle top with a Tbsp of white sugar. Bake at 400F for 50 minutes.
