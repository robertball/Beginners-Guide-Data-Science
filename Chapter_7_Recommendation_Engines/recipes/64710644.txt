Ingredients:
1/2 head cauliflower, grated (about 2 cups)
1/2 c. shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese
1/8 c. chopped green onion
1 lg. egg, beaten
1/4 c. panko breadcrumbs
3/4 t. salt
1/4 t. ground black pepper
1/4 t. smoked paprika
1 T. Extra Virgin Olive oil

Directions:
1. Mix all of the ingredients together, except the olive oil.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until hot.
3. Using an ice cream scoop, scoop the mixture into your hands and make a ball. Pat the mixture into a flat disc. The mixture is very crumbly, but it will come together in the pan as the cheese melts and the egg cooks. Gently place the patties in the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Continue to cook for 5 minutes per side. Remove to platter and serve immediately.
