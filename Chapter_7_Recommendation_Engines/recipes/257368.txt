Ingredients:
Spice Mix:
2 teaspoons ground ancho chile powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground fennel seed
Filling:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 small onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 1/2 cups cooked brown or green lentils
3 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons water, or as needed
2 canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, seeded and minced
adobo or hot sauce (optional)
Tacos:
8 (6 inch) vegan corn or flour tortillas
1 cup shredded lettuce
1 cup chopped tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 cup guacamole
1 lime, cut into 8 wedges

Directions:
Combine ancho chile powder, cumin, coriander, oregano, salt, and fennel in a small bowl.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add spice mixture and cook, stirring, until toasted, about 30 seconds.
Reduce heat to medium and add cooked lentils, tomato paste, a few splashes of water, and chipotle peppers. Cook, mashing lightly with a fork and adding water if necessary, until lentils are heated through and hold together, about 5 minutes. Season with additional salt if needed and adobo or hot sauce.
Lightly toast tortillas in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Spread about 1/3 cup filling down center of each tortilla. Top with lettuce, tomatoes, and cilantro. Serve with guacamole and lime wedges.
