Spoon them into greased muffin pans or mini donut pans. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes for the muffins and 10 minutes for the mini donuts.
While the donuts are baking, melt 1/2 cup butter. Set aside.

Enjoy with coffee and a crossword!

Description: 
The baked apple doughnuts are tender, sweet and studded with pieces of tart apples. The trick is to coat the dough in lots of cinnamon sugar, and then baked them so they are still soft on the inside and have a wonderful sugar crust on the outside. So take a look at our delicious baked apple donuts recipe with easy to follow step-by-step details.
