Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage
1 tablespoon crushed garlic
3/4 cup vegetable broth
1 1/2 cups 35% whipping cream
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 cup fresh or frozen small green peas
1 cup Canadian ricotta cheese
Salt and freshly ground pepper
1 pound fresh pasta
1/2 cup freshly grated Canadian Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil or mint

Directions:
In a large skillet, combine butter and sage; heat over medium-high heat, stirring constantly until butter melts and sage starts to sizzle. Add garlic; saute, for about 1 minute or until butter and garlic start to brown. Gradually pour in vegetable broth, cream and lemon juice; cook stirring occasionally for about two minutes or until it comes to a boil. Add peas; return to boil, cook stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes or until slightly thickened. Stir in Ricotta cheese and cook stirring until combined. Remove from heat.
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package directions or until desired doneness. Drain.
Add pasta to cream sauce in pan; toss to coat. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and basil; toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
