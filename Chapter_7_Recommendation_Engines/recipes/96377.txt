Ingredients:
1/2 (20 ounce) package JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE® Ground Turkey
1 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup diced green bell pepper
3/4 cup diced red bell pepper
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 (15 ounce) can pinto or red beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added stewed tomatoes, undrained
2 canned chipotle chilies in adobo sauce, minced
1 teaspoon adobo sauce from canned chilies, or to taste (optional)
1 cup low-sodium reduced fat shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 (8.5 ounce) package corn bread mix
1/3 cup low-fat (1%) milk
1 large egg white

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cook turkey, onion, bell peppers and garlic in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat 8 minutes or until turkey is no longer pink, stirring occasionally. Drain fat, sprinkle mixture with cumin. Add beans, tomatoes with juice, chilies and adobo sauce; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in cheese and cilantro.
Spray 8-inch square baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon turkey mixture evenly into prepared dish, pressing down to compact mixture. Combine corn bread mix, milk and egg white in medium bowl; mix just until dry ingredients are moistened. Spoon batter evenly over turkey mixture to cover completely.
Bake 20 to 22 minutes or until corn bread is golden brown. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
