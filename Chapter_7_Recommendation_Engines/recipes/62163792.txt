Cup Cakes:
3 oz. white baking chocolate, chopped
2 tbs. Vodka
3 tbs. coffee liquor (Kahlua)
1 cup all purpose flour
3/4 cup cake flour
3/4 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/4 tsp. salt
2 3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
3 eggs
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 (8 oz.) package cream cheese
1/3 cup apricot preserves
Frosting:
1/2 cup shortening
1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. coffee liquor (Kahlua)
1/4 tsp. Vodka
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
3 tbs. warm water
1 (16 oz.) package powdered sugar
white chocolate shavings or chips for decoration

Directions:
Cup Cakes:
Prepare cup cake pans with paper liners. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Over a double boiler, melt white chocolate with Vodka and coffee liquor. Set aside to cool.
Beat together sugar and butter until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, blending well. Add in cooled melted chocolate mixture and combine.
Sift together flours, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
Alternately add flour and buttermilk to the butter mixture.
In a separate bowl, combine apricot preserves and cream cheese.
Fill cup cake liners a little less than half way with batter. Next, spoon a small amount of the cream cheese mixture on top of batter. Follow with a topping of the cup cake batter, filling liners 2/3 to 3/4 full.
Bake for 20-25 minutes. Let cool on racks for 15-20 minutes before frosting.
Frosting:
In a large bowl, beat shortening, liquor, Vodka, vanilla, water, salt and powdered sugar until light and fluffy.
Divide evenly among cup cakes using a pastry bag or knife.
Decorate with white chocolate shavings or chocolate chips and enjoy!
