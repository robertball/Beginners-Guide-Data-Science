Chocolate Gingerbread Cookies Recipe

Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon Baking Cocoa, or Dutch-process cocoa
1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup molasses
1 cup semisweet chocolate mini chips
5 tablespoons Swedish pearl sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, or grease lightly.
Combine the flour, baking soda, spices, salt, and cocoa.
In a separate bowl, beat the butter with the sugar until light and creamy.
Add the molasses and beat until combined.
Beat in the dry ingredients, then stir in the chips.
Scoop the dough a tablespoon at a time; a tablespoon cookie scoop works well here. Roll the top portion of each dough ball in pearl sugar.
Place the unbaked cookies 1 1/2" apart, sugar side up, onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, until their surface begins to crack. Remove from the oven, cool on the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer the cookies to a rack to cool completely.
The ingredients and directions above produce a cookie that is soft and slightly chewy and crunchy. For that perfectly chewy cookie, decrease the amount of flour to 1 3/4 cups and reduce the oven temperature to 325°F.
For a cookie that’s chewy and crunchy, keep the baking temperature at 350°F, and use 1 3/4 cups of flour.
If a soft and chewy cookie is what you’re after, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F and keep the flour at 2 1/4 cups.
