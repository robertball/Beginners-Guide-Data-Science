Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups sugar
1/2 cup baking cocoa
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 eggs
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
3 cups grated zucchini
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Combine the eggs, oil, butter and extracts; mix well. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in zucchini, pecans and raisins. Pour into three greased and floured 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from the pans to wire racks.

Description: 
You'd never guess zucchini is the 'secret ingredient' in this easy-to-assemble bread - it has such big chocolate taste! Charlotte McDaniel, from Williamsville, Illinois, informs, 'I freeze extra zucchini from my garden in summer and make this bread to give as gifts all winter long.'
