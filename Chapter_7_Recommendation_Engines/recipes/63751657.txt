Ingredients:
4 large Idaho potatoes, scrubbed and cut into eight wedges
Â¼ cup olive oil
1 large garlic clove, crushed and peeled
Sea salt
2-3 Tbsp. fresh thyme, chopped
2-3 Tbsp. fresh rosemary, chopped
1 tsp. garlic salt
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Early in the day, place the crushed garlic and chopped fresh herbs in the olive oil and let sit for a few hours.
Place the potatoes into a large pot with water to cover. Bring to a boil. Once the water is boiling, liberally salt the water with sea salt and cook over medium-high heat for about 8-9 minutes, or until mostly tender.
Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Drain potatoes and toss with the olive oil mixture (garlic removed), garlic salt & black pepper.
Place the potatoes skin-side down over direct heat on the grill and reserve the oil. Grill for 10 minutes. Move the potatoes to indirect heat another 5-10 minutes, or until they are completely cooked through. Using the leftover oil mixture, you can brush it on the potatoes while grilling, or pour over the potatoes when they come off the grill.

Description: 
We just started cooking with a 30-inch gas grill after DECADES of using a Weber charcoal grill. While we still use the charcoal grill, the extra space allotted to us on the gas grill has made us really branch out with different sides. I created this one knowing we could put the potatoes directly on the grill and not have to make a foil packet to make it fit!
