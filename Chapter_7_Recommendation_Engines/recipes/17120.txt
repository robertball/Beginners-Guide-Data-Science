Ingredients:
8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
8 slices ham
8 slices Swiss cheese
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup white wine
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (6 ounce) package herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken breasts in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Lay a ham slice, then a cheese slice on top of each breast.
In a medium bowl combine the soup, sour cream, wine, garlic powder, parsley, salt and pepper. Mix well and pour mixture over chicken/ham/cheese pieces. Top all with the dry stuffing mix to cover.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.

Description: 
Chicken breasts baked with ham and Swiss cheese, topped with an unusual mixture of sour cream, white wine, creamy soup and spices. This is a bit different than normal Chicken Cordon Bleu, but everyone seems to like it much better!
