Ingredients:
Cake
1 1/4 cups cake flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon table salt
1 cup sugar
5 large eggs (2 whole and 3 separated), room temperature
6 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
2 Tbsp water
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Strawberry Filling
2 pounds fresh strawberries (medium or large, about 2 quarts), washed, dried, and stemmed
4-6 Tbsp sugar
Pinch table salt
Whipped Cream
8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon table salt
2 cups heavy cream

Directions:
Cake
1. Preheat oven to 325Â°F. Grease & flour round 9x2-inch cake pan or 9-inch spring form pan & line with parchment paper. In large bowl whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar (minus 3T) in mixing bowl. Whisk in 2 whole eggs and 3 yolks (reserving whites), butter, water, and vanilla until smooth.
2. Beat remaining 3 egg whites until frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually add remaining 3T sugar, & beat until soft peaks form, 60 to 90 seconds. Stir 1/3 of whites into batter to lighten. Add the remaining whites and gently fold into batter until no white streaks remain. Pour batter into prepared pan & bake 30 to 40 minutes. Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing from pan.
Filling:
3. Half 24 of berries & reserve. Slice remaining berries; macerate in 4 to 6 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Strain the juices from berries & reserve (about 1/2c). Mash thoroughly; set aside.
Simmer reserved juices until syrupy & reduced to about 3 tablespoons, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour syrup over macerated berries & toss to combine. Set aside until cake is cooled.
Whipped cream:
4. When cake has cooled, whisk cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, & salt until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add heavy cream in slow, steady stream; beat until mixture holds stiff peaks.
Assembly:
5. Slice cake into three even layers. Arrange ring of 12-20 strawberry halves on bottom layer, cut sides down and stem ends facing out, around perimeter of cake layer. Pour 1/2 of berry mixture in center, spread to cover exposed cake. Gently spread ~1/3 of whipped cream over berry layer, leaving 1/2-inch border from edge. Place middle cake layer on top and press down gently. Repeat for middle layer. Spread remaining cream on top & decorate w/ remaining berries.
