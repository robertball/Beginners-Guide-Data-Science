Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup orange juice
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 3/4 pounds beef tenderloin, cut into 1-inch cubes
3/4 pound cherry tomatoes
1/2 pound fresh whole mushrooms
2 large green peppers, cubed
1 large red onion, cut into wedges
Hot cooked rice (optional)

Directions:
In a resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container, combine the first five ingredients and mix well. Reserve 1/2 cup for basting and refrigerate. Add beef to remaining marinade; turn to coat. Seal bag or cover container; refrigerate for 1 hour, turning occasionally. Drain and discard the marinade.
On metal or soaked wooden skewers, alternate beef, tomatoes, mushrooms, green peppers and onions.
Grill, uncovered, over medium heat for 3 minutes on each side. Baste with reserved marinade. Continue turning and basting for 8-10 minutes or until meat reaches desired doneness. Serve meat and vegetables over rice if desired.
