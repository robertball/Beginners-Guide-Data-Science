Ingredients:
1. 100 g ciabatta bread
2. 80 g mortadella
3. 4 cloves of garlic, peeled
4. ½ bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
5. 400 g lean ground beef
6. 400 g lean ground pork
7. 2 large eggs
8. 30 g Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
9. sea salt
10. freshly ground black pepper
11. olive oil
12. 1 onion, peeled
13. ½ a fresh red chilli, deseeded
14. 1 x 450 g jar of roasted red peppers in brine
15. 50 ml white wine
16. 2 x 400 g cans of plum tomatoes balsamic vinegar
17. 150 g smoked mozzarella
18. 12 soft bread rolls

Directions:
Step 1. Preheat oven to 425ºF.
Step 2. Throw away the crusts from the ciabatta bread. Use your fingers to divide the rest of the bread into bite-sized chunks. Pour cold water over these and set them aside to soak.
Step 3. Mix together the mortadella, mince, eggs, two of the garlic cloves, parsley, and Parmesan cheese. Remove the ciabatta from the water and squeeze out the excess. Add it to this mixture.
Step 4. Get your hands wet and use them to squish the above mixture together until everything is evenly incorporated. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
Step 5. Role the mixture into 12 balls and space them evenly on a baking tray. Spoon a small amount of olive oil over each before putting them in the refrigerator for approximately 10 minutes.
Step 6. Chop two garlic cloves, chili, and onion. Drain the roasted peppers and chop them as well.
Step 7. Transfer the meatballs from the fridge directly into the oven. Roast them for 15-20 minutes until slightly browned. Then, transfer them to a large pan over low heat on the stovetop.
Step 8. Pour in the wine and simmer until it reduces. Add onions, chili, and garlic. Cook for 3-5 minutes until the onions brown slightly. Add peppers and the brine from the pepper jar, chunks of plum tomato, seasonings, and a small amount of balsamic vinegar.
Step 9. Place the pan back in the oven for approximately 25 minutes until the meat is thoroughly cooked.
Step 10. Slice the mozzarella cheese into 12 pieces and put one on each meatball. Leave them in the oven just long enough for the cheese to melt.
Step 11. Serve the dish by putting one meatball on each roll with a dollop of tomato sauce and balsamic vinegar to finish.
