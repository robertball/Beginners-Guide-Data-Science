1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated piecrusts
1 cup sugar
1 cup light corn syrup

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
FIT 1 pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate according to package directions.  Trim pastry even with edge of pie plate. Cut remaining pie crust into leaf shapes using a small cookie or canape cutter. Attach leaves to rim of pastry using water, and press firmly to secure. Cover loosely, and freeze 30 minutes
COOK sugar, corn syrup, and butter in a medium saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves and butter melts; cool slightly. Stir in eggs, vanilla, and salt. Pour into crust. Arrange pecan halves in circles on top of pie.
BAKE at 325 degrees for 50 to 55 minutes.

Description: 
Freezing a piecrust before filling reduces shrinkage.  When time is short, fold piecrust edges under instead of trimming, and crimp or press with the floured tines of a fork.  For Toffee-Walnut Pie, substitute toasted, chopped walnuts for pecan halves, and add 4 (1.4-ounce) English toffee candy bars, crushed, to filling mixture.  For Mixed-Nut Pie, substitute 11/4 cups coarsely chopped mixed nuts for pecan halves.
