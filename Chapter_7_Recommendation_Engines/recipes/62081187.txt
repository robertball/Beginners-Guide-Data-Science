Description: 
Pronounced bor-en-young-us, it simply means brandy with raisins. This is a traditional Dutch recipe, and this drink is served most often at Christmas time, as an appetizer with cheese and crackers, or as a dessert drink. Please note that you must make this 3 months in advance! 
I have never made this recipe but when I read your question I went searching on the web for and answer. I hope this is of some help to you.
