Ingredients:
10 oz. pkg ground chicken breast
2 cloves garlic
1/2 tsp coarse kosher salt
1 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning (I use Bell's)
1 tsp dried thyme, crushed

1 tsp minced fresh rosemary
2 tsp fennel seeds, crushed
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp cayenne
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
Salt & pepper to taste
Olive oil or cooking spray

Directions:
Chop garlic; sprinkle with kosher salt.  Using side of a large knife, grind garlic and salt into a paste.
Add garlic and remaining seasonings to chicken. Mix until thoroughly combined.  Shape into patties, about 3" in diameter, less than 1/2" thick. (You should get about 8 patties)
Heat oiled skillet over medium high heat.  Cook patties about 3 to 4 minutes each side until golden brown.
