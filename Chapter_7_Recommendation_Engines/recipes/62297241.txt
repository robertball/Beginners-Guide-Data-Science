Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound ham, cubed
1 pound smoked sausage, sliced
1 large yellow onion, chopped
4 or 5 ribs celery, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth and 2 cans of water (broth and water equals a total of 5-1/3 cups)
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1 tablespoon Kitchen Bouquet
2 cups uncooked white or brown rice

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot, add ham and sausage and cook for about 5 minutes over medium heat. Add yellow onion, celery, green pepper and green onions and cook for about 10 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
Add beef broth, water, black pepper, cayenne pepper, Cajun seasoning, Kitchen Bouquet and rice. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until most of the liquid is absorbed (30-40 minutes for white rice and 50-55 minutes for brown rice) stirring often.
Turn off heat and let pot sit, covered, for at least 30 minutes. Rice will continue to cook and absorb liquid as it sits.

Description: 
My Aunt Mary, who was born and raised in Louisiana, is a fantastic cook but rarely uses a recipe. As I watched her make jambalaya one day, I wrote down the ingredients and directions. It's delicious and surprisingly simple to make.
