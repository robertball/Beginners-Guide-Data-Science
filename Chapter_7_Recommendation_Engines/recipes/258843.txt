Ingredients:
8 cups fresh strawberries, halved
2 tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste
1 1/3 tablespoons almond extract, divided
1 pint heavy whipping cream
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 cup sour cream, almost room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (9 inch) angel food cake, cut into 1-inch cubes

Directions:
Reserve 1/4 cup strawberries for garnishing; leave them halved or slice to your preference. Slice the remaining 7 3/4 cups strawberries; place in a bowl with white sugar and 1 tablespoon almond extract. Stir to combine.
Pour heavy whipping cream into a bowl; beat until stiff peaks form.
Mix cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, sour cream, vanilla extract, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract into the whipped cream. Fold cake cubes gently into the cream mixture.
Cover the bottom of a trifle bowl with a shallow layer of the strawberry-sugar mixture; follow with a layer of the cream mixture. Continue layering until bowl is full; top with reserved strawberries. Chill for 2 hours.
