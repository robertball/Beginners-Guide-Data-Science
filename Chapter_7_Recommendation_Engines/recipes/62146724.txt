Ingredients:
12-15 large tomatoes
2 heads garlic
2 medium onions
1 small zucchini
1 cup chopped fresh basil
1/4 c. olive oil
1/4 c. apple cider
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper
1/2 tsp. chili powder or cayenne pepper

Directions:
Chop tomatoes into small pieces for stewing, first discarding the seeds and juice.
Dice onions, mince garlic.
In large pot, saute onions and garlic in olive oil/apple cider until onions are just translucent and soft.  Add in tomatoes, basil, and chopped zucchini.
Let stew on medium heat for 1/2 hour, stirring occasionally.
When tomatoes have softened into a "mush", bring just to a boil, then add salt and pepper and simmer on low for one hour.  Serve chunky or puree with immersion blender.
