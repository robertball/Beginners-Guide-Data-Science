12 Brussels sprouts
4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 medium zucchini, diced
1 medium yellow squash, diced
Salt and black pepper to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring a large and small pot of water to a boil.
In the smaller pot, boil Brussels sprouts for 8 minutes until cooked through. When cool enough to handle, slice.
In a large skillet, heat olive oil and saute garlic until slightly yellow in color, 1-2 minutes. Add zucchini, squash and sliced Brussels sprouts; season with salt and pepper and saute for 5 additional minutes.
In the large pot, cook pasta one minute less than package directions. Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the water.
