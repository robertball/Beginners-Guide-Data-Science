Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups boiling water
1 1/2 cups bulgur
5 cups water
1 1/2 cups dry lentils, rinsed
1 cup diced green onion
1 cup diced sweet red pepper
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1/2 cup minced fresh parsley
DRESSING:
1/3 cup cider vinegar
1/3 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon dill seed
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3/4 cup feta cheese

Directions:
In a large bowl, pour boiling water over bulgur; let stand until the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add lentils. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. In another large bowl, combine bulgur and lentils; cool completely.
Add the peppers, onions and parsley. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the vinegar, oil, basil, dill, salt and pepper. Pour over salad; toss to coat. Crumble feta cheese over top; toss again. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or until serving.
