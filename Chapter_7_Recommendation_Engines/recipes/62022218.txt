Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1 cup butter or margarine, at room temperature
2 Tbsp Key lime juice
2 tsp lime rind, finely grated
1 tsp vanilla extract
5 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup sour cream
2 cups flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
***Glaze***
1/2 cup confectioner's sugar
1 Tbsp key lime juice, plus 1 teaspoon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F.  In large bowl of electric mixer, cream together sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Beat in key lime juice, lime rind, and vanilla.  Add eggs in 3 additions, mixing well after each.  Add sour cream, mixing well.  Sift flour and baking soda into butter mixture.  Mix to blend thoroughly.  Spoon batter into greased 10-inch fluted or plain tube pan.  Bake until a skewer inserted in center comes out clean (1 hour to 1-1/4  hours).  Cool on wire rack 15 to 20 minutes before turning cake out of pan.
Meanwhile, mix together confectioners' sugar and key lime juice until smooth.  Drizzle over warm cake and let cool completely.
(You can use two 8 1/4" loaf pans in place of the Bundt pan.)
