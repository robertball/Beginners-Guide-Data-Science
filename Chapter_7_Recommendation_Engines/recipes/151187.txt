Ingredients:
1 large onion, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
1 green bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
2 cups chicken stock
1 clove garlic, minced
2 1/2 cups chopped smoked turkey
1 cup chunky-style red or green salsa
3 cups vegetable juice (e.g. V-8)
1 drop hot pepper sauce, or to taste
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place a heavy pot over high heat. Add the onion and bell pepper; cook 2 to 3 minutes without stirring until browned. Immediately pour in the chicken stock, and stir to release vegetables from the bottom of the pot. Reduce heat to low. Stir in the garlic, turkey, salsa, vegetable juice, hot pepper sauce, and lime juice. Simmer over medium heat until heated through, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

This is a great winter soup. Make it as spicy as you want. It's also a great way to get rid of leftover Thanksgiving turkey.
