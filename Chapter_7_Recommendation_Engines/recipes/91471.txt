Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 medium potato, peeled and diced
1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish
1 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard, or to taste
1 pinch paprika, for garnish

Directions:
Place the eggs in a pan of cold water and bring to a boil. Once they boil, remove from the heat, cover and let stand for 10 minutes. Drain, cool and peel.
Place the potato in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender. Drain.
Cut the eggs in half lengthwise, and remove the yolks; reserve for other uses or discard. Place the potatoes in a medium bowl. Mash with a whisk until smooth, then mix in the relish, sugar, mayonnaise and mustard. Spoon into the egg whites, and dust with paprika. Refrigerate or serve.
