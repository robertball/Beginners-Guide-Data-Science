Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 ripe bananas
2 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup maple syrup
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan with nonstick spray.
Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl. Set aside.
Mash bananas until mostly smooth but some chunks remain. Add eggs, oil, maple syrup, sugar, and vanilla extract; mix with a wooden spoon. Add flour mixture and walnuts. Mix just until flour is moistened. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven, rotating pan halfway through, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Invert bread onto the wire rack to cool completely.
