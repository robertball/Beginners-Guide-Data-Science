Ingredients:
2 Pounds Butter, Unsalted
1 Pound Sugar
2 Cups Espresso Coffee, brewed
1.5 Pounds Semi-Sweet Chocolate
8 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
16 Eggs

Directions:
Over a low heat, melt the butter, sugar and brewed espresso together.
Add the chocolate to the hot mixture, stir until completely melted, remove from heat.
Beat the eggs to blend and then temper with some of the hot chocolate mixture.
Pour into a prepared, lined 10" cake pan and bake at 350F for 45-55 minutes.  The top will form a slight crust and feel dry to the touch.
Cool and chill until completely set (about 2 hours, but can sit over night).
Serve with whipped cream, fruit coulis, or peanut butter sauce (for any of my Buckeyes out there).

Description: 
When I worked as a pastry chef, I would use this recipe for my gluten free clients. It can be temperamental, but when I get it right, you can be sure I do a happy dance... that is when I'm far enough that my cake won't fall :)
