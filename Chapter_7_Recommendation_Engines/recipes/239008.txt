Ingredients:
1/4 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1/2 cup egg whites
1/4 cup cold water
1 tablespoon oil
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 cup pumpkin puree

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 6 muffin cups with paper liners.
Beat cake mix, egg whites, water, oil, cinnamon, and cloves together in a bowl using a electric mixer on low speed until batter is slightly mixed, about 10 seconds. Add pumpkin puree to batter and beat batter until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Fill cupcake liners 2/3-full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 22 minutes. Cool cupcakes in the muffin cups for 5 minutes before removing to wire rack to cool completely.
