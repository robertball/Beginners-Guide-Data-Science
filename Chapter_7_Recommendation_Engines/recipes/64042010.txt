Ingredients:
(IF YOU DON'T HAVE 32 GREEN TOMATOES, THIS RECIPE WILL STILL WORK)
Ingredients:
4 quarts of Green tomatoes: chopped (about 32 medium)
1 Large Head of cabbage; chopped
2 Large Red Bell Peppers; copped
2 Large Gold Bell Peppers;chopped
2 Large Orange Bell Peppers; chopped
2 large Red Onions; chopped
2 Cups Celery; chopped
3/4 Cup Canning Salt
2 Tbsp Mustard Seed**(Ground up)
2 Tbsp Celery Seed**(Ground up)
3 Tbsp Pickling Spices**(Ground up)
2 Cups Firmly Packed Dark Brown Sugar
4 1/2 Cups Apple Cider Vinegar
1 large pot with cover about 20 quarts in size

Directions:
The best method to get all of these veggies chopped, is to have a food processor.....
After all of the veggies are chopped, put all of them into the large pot...
Sprinkle with the canning salt, & mix thoroughly.
Spread ice cubes all over the top of the veggies, place the cover onto the pot & put it into the fridge (if the pot won't fit in the fridge with the cover on, place a large piece of heavy duty foil over the top of the pot)
Keep the veggies in the fridge for  24 hours.
Take the mustard seed, celery seed, & pickling spices, & place them into a "small coffee grinder" that's used to grind up whole coffee beans. Grind up the spices until they look almost like powder, let the spices sit in the grinder until you're ready to use them.
When the veggies are ready to take out of the fridge,
put them into a big colander, & rinse thoroughly, & let them drain well.
When the big pot is empty, rinse it out.
Pour the apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, & spices into the big pot, mix well, & simmer for about 15 minutes.
Add the veggies into the liquid, bring to a boil, & turn the heat down to simmer, so they don't burn on the bottom.
Pack the hot veggies into "STERILIZED HOT PINT CANNING JARS", leaving about 1/2 inch head space.
Wipe off the top of the jar, & adjust the 2 piece caps on the jars.
After each jar is filled & the 2-piece cap is on, place it into
the hot, "NOT BOILING WATER"  canner.
Fill enough jars, to fit into the boiling water canner, which is about 7 jars.
Place the top back on the canner, bring to a boil & boil for 15 min.
After 15 min. is up, carefully take each jar out & place on racks in a draft free area, to completely cool, you will hear a "pop", when each jar seals as they cool.

Description: 
I love to make this relish, it is great, and it doesn't have any preservatives, corn syrup, or food coloring.
It can be added to any food, or  salad that relish would be added. I get 14 pints of relish  which lasts just about all year. 
It's great for a gift also!!
