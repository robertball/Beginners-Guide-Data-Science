Description: 
This soy sauce- and sesame-flavored dip is great for egg rolls, fresh or fried spring rolls, grilled meats, or poultry.  Chill or heat before serving. This is also a great dressing for coleslaw -- just toss the slaw with the dressing and chill for up to 3 days. Add some shelled sunflower seeds and some crunchy chow mein noodles right before serving.
