Ingredients:
2 Tbsp stone-ground mustard
2 Tbsp maple syrup
1 tsp minced fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
8 boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 1-1/2 pounds)

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix the first five ingredients. Moisten a paper towel with cooking oil; using long-handled tongs, rub on grill rack to coat lightly.
Grill chicken, covered, over medium heat 4-5 minutes on each side or until a thermometer reads 170Â°. Brush frequently with mustard mixture during the last 4 minutes of cooking.
Note: These can also be made under the broiler if you can't grill.
