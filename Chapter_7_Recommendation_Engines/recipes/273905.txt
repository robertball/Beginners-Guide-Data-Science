1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 lemon, zested
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Topping:
1 cup old-fashioned oats
1/4 cup brown sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine rhubarb, sugar, flour, lemon zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl. Fold in raspberries.
Beat eggs, half-and-half, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Mix into the fruit; pour into an 8x8-inch baking dish.

Description: 
I grow rhubarb and raspberries in my garden and found this to be an amazing way to incorporate both of them! The flavors are just perfect with the sweetness of the raspberries and tartness of the rhubarb and lemon zest. Enjoy! And don't forget to add a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.
