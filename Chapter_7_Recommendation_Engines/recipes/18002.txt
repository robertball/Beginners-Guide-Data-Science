Ingredients:
2 (11 ounce) cans mandarin oranges
2 (3 ounce) packages orange flavored Jell-OÂ®
1 cup boiling water
8 ounces sour cream
1 pint orange sherbet, softened
1 cup pineapple chunks

Directions:
Lightly grease a ring mold or 9x9-inch square pan.
Drain the mandarin oranges and reserve juice.  Add cold water to the juice, if necessary, to make 1 cup of liquid.
In a mixing bowl, combine the boiling water and 1 cup mandarin orange liquid. Dissolve gelatin in this mixture, and refrigerate until it begins to set. Using an electric mixer, beat in sour cream and softened sherbet at medium speed until fluffy and well-blended. Gently stir in mandarin oranges and pineapple chunks. Pour mixture into ring mold or prepared pan and chill overnight.
