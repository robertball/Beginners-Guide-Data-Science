2 cups Graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 tbsp sugar
4 (8 ounce ) packages cream cheese, softened
1 3/4 cup sugar
7 large eggs
3 (8 ounce) cartons of sour cream
1 tbsp vanilla

Directions:
Combine first three ingredients, mix well. Press mixture firmly onto bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch springform pan. Chill well.
Beat cream cheese at high speed of a heavy duty electric mixer until fluffy. Gradually add 1 3/4 cups sugar, beating well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add sour cream and vanilla, beat at low speed until smooth. Pour into prepared crust. Bake at 300 degrees for 1 hour and 25 minutes. Turn off the oven, and leave the cheesecake in the oven for 4 hours. Do not open oven door.
Remove from oven and cool completely on a wire rack. Cover and chill 8 hours. Remove sides of springform pan and transfer cheesecake to a serving plate. Cut into eight wedges, and top as desired.
