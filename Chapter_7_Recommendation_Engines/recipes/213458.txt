Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package caramels, unwrapped
2 tablespoons fat-free half-and-half or fat-free milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
6 cups KELLOGG'S® RICE KRISPIES® cereal
Canned frosting or decorating gel
Food coloring
Assorted candies

Directions:
In large saucepan combine caramels and half-and-half. Cook and stir over medium-low heat for 5 to 10 minutes or until smooth. Remove from heat.
Stir in vanilla. Add KELLOGG'S(R) RICE KRISPIES(R) cereal. Stir until well coated.
Using buttered spatula or wax paper, evenly press mixture into 15 x 10 x 1-inch pan coated with cooking spray. Cool. Using cookie cutters coated with cooking spray cut eight 2 1/4-inch circles, eight 1 3/4-inch circles, eight 1-inch circles and twenty-four 3/4-inch circles.
For each teddy bear place one 2 1/4-inch circle adjacent to one 1 3/4-inch circle. Gently press together. Halve one of the 3/4-inch circles and use for ears. Attach two 3/4-inch circles for feet. Place one 1-inch circle on the 1 3/4-inch circle for nose. Decorate with frosting and/or candies. Best if served the same day.
