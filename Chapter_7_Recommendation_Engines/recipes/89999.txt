1/3 cup diced onion
12 slices pepperoni sausage, diced

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cut zucchini in half lengthwise. With a metal spoon, scoop out most of the insides and place into a skillet. Transfer the zucchini shells to a baking sheet.

Bake in preheated oven for 12 minutes.
