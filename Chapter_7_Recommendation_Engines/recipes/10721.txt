1/2 cup butter flavored shortening
1 cup white sugar

Measure out tablespoonfuls of dough and roll into balls.  Place 3 inches apart on lightly greased cookie sheets. Make criss-cross pattern with fork.
Bake in a pre-heated oven at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) 8-10 minutes until set, but not hard. Do not overbake. Leave on sheets for 2 minutes before removing. Cool, and store in covered container.

My husband loves all of my cookie recipes, but this one is his all time favorite!! Very rich, and full of peanut butter flavor. When I bake these, the cookie jar empties out really fast!
