Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 flour tortillas
1 cup grated Cheddar cheese
1 small tomato, seeded and diced
1/2 cup onion, diced
3 slices cooked bacon, crumbled, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
1 teaspoon ranch dressing, or to taste (optional)
1 teaspoon buffalo ranch dressing, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a large cast iron skillet with cooking spray.
Place prepared skillet over medium heat for 30 seconds. Add 1 flour tortilla and cook until bottom is browned and hardened, about 1 minute. Top tortilla with 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, 1/2 of the tomato, 1/2 of the onion, and 1/2 of the bacon; season with salt and pepper. Cook until cheese starts to melt, about 1 minute.
Transfer skillet to preheated oven and cook until cheese is completely melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Top tortilla with 1/2 of the avocado slices, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Drizzle ranch dressing and buffalo ranch dressing in a zig-zag motion over the top.
Repeat with remaining ingredients.
