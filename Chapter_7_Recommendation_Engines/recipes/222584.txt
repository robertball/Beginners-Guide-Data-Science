Ingredients:
5 slices bacon
6 eggs
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 7x11-inch baking dish.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and crumble.
Beat eggs, milk, butter, salt, and ground pepper in a bowl; pour into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with onions, bacon, and Cheddar cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
