Ingredients:
-3-4lb. pork loin
-1-1/2lbs. thick sliced bacon
-4-6 slices prosciutto
-4-6 slices provolone
-Italian dressing

Directions:
-the night before cooking, or at least several hours before,  trim the silver skin and fat then cut the loin in a manner that "unrolls" it into a flat piece of meat
-place meat into a container, cover with Italian dressing, and place in fridge
-preheat oven to 400
-remove loin from fridge and lay it down flat
-lay slices of prosciutto and provolone across top of loin
-roll up tightly
-make a bacon weave that's the same size as loin
-wrap bacon weave around loin
-using cooking twine, tie loin/bacon together as tight as possible putting twine about every 2" across meat
-place loin on a greased pan and cover with foil
-bake for 45 min (internal temp should be around 145)
-remove foil and put back in oven for 15 more min (to get bacon a little crispy)
-remove from oven and let rest for 10-15 min covered
