Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter, softened

Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread. Arrange Brie on the unbuttered side of two of the bread slices. Top with chocolate, then the remaining two bread slices, buttered-side up.
Preheat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Place the sandwiches in the skillet. Cook sandwiches over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes or until bread is golden and cheese is melted, turning once halfway through cooking.
