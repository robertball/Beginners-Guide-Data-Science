Ingredients:
1 pound cod fillets, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 tablespoon canola oil
3 dried red chile peppers
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon wasabi paste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
8 large green cabbage leaves
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Pat fish dry with paper towels.
Heat canola oil with dried red chiles in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook fish in the hot oil until flesh is opaque and the edges of the fish are slightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Sprinkle fish with salt and black pepper. Remove from heat, drain, and discard peppers.
Stir mayonnaise, wasabi paste, and 2 tablespoons cilantro together in a bowl. Spoon several tablespoons of fish into a cabbage leaf and wrap leaf around fish; repeat with remaining leaves and fish. Garnish each roll with a sprinkling of cilantro. Serve with wasabi mayonnaise.

Description: 
Spicy white fish wrapped in cabbage with a tasty wasabi-mayonnaise sauce. A delicious and easy way to enjoy fish tacos on a low-carb diet! You can also add a quick fresh pico de gallo to this if your diet allows tomatoes. Delicious! I now enjoy this more than regular fish tacos. Try this also with halibut or tilapia.
