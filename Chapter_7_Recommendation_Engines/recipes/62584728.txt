Ingredients:
1 Tbspn butter or margarine
1 Green onion
1 Slice deli ham (optional)
2 slices Micro-bacon (optional)
3 Eggs
1/4 cup Shredded cheese

Directions:
Melt 1/2 of the butter in a medium sized skillet. Thinly slice the entire green onion into the skillet. Chop either a slice of deli-ham or 2 slices of cooked micro-bacon into the skillet. Stir or toss over low to medium heat until all items are warmed and the onion is tender.
Put the onion and meat on a plate and set aside.
Scramble the eggs in a bowl. Melt the remaining butter in the same skillet and add scrambled eggs. Cook over medium heat. Gently lift sides and allow uncooked eggs to fill the pockets. This will help cook the omelet quicker and prevent burning the eggs.
When the omelet is sold enough, flip to cook the uncooked side. Immediately add the cheese, onion and meat. Flip half of the omelet closed over the other half. Slide the entire omelet on a plate and enjoy!
