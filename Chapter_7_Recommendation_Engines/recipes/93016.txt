Ingredients:
6 frozen bean and cheese burritos
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup sour cream
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chile peppers, drained
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 medium tomato, chopped (optional)
1 avocados - peeled, pitted and sliced (optional)
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained (optional)
1/2 cup salsa (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the burritos in a row across the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, stir together the cream of chicken soup, sour cream and chile peppers. Spread evenly over the top of the burritos. Sprinkle with shredded cheese.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is slightly browned and burritos are heated through. Serve with tomato, avocado, olives and salsa.

Description: 
I usually keep frozen burritos stocked in my freezer just for this recipe.  It's so quick and easy, and tastes delicious.  Can be served with tortilla chips and a salad.  Or double the sauce, and serve over rice.
