Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup plain yogurt
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 large muffin cups.
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a large mixing bowl; stir Cheddar cheese into the flour mixture. Pour yogurt, eggs, and butter over the flour mixture; stir until the dry ingredients are just moistened. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops just start to lightly brown, 18 to 20 minutes.

Nice bread-like cheese muffins. Not overly cheesy, but feel free to add more. One of my favorites!
