Ingredients:
3 medium heads garlic
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut aluminum foil into 3 6-inch squares (large enough to wrap each garlic head).  Place 2 teaspoons of butter in each square of foil and place one garlic head into each square of foil. Fold the packets up, and arrange them in a 9 inch pie pan.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until the garlic is soft.

Description: 
Baked garlic is sweet and very yummy, as well as being very spreadable. Serve as an appetizer with a good crusty bread or with crackers. People can peel a piece of garlic off of the bulb and squeeze the soft, warm garlic our of its shell.
