Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package pizza dough
1/4 cup pizza sauce
4 ounces Farmland® Cubed Ham
4 ounces Farmland® Original Breakfast Sausage Links, cooked
4 eggs, lightly scrambled
2 roasted red peppers, sliced
1 cup fresh spinach

1 egg mixed with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.
Roll pizza dough into rough rectangle and place on parchment-lined baking sheet.
Spread pizza sauce over dough, leaving 1-inch border on 3 sides.
Top with ham, sausage, scrambled eggs, peppers, spinach, and Provolone cheese.
Brush edges with egg wash. Fold up sides about 1 inch and brush with more egg wash.
Roll up like a jelly roll lengthwise, starting along bottom edge of dough.
Place seam-side down, brush with egg wash, and top with parsley and Parmesan cheese. Gently cut slits along top.
