Description: 
A delicious alternative to potato salad; it uses no mayonnaise.  This is an excellent  way to  use arugula, roasting the potatoes adds a new dimension. I use rice vinegar instead of the white vinegar, at the end I drizzle with a little balsamic vingear to finish.
Serve with Pork Cutlets...Excellent!Modified from: Potato Arugula Salad
