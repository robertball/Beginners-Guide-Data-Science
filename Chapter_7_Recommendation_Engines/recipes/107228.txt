Ingredients:
1/4 teaspoon saffron threads or ground turmeric
6 cups boiling water
1/2 cup vegetable shortening
2 medium onions, chopped
2 (1 inch) pieces cinnamon stick
4 whole cloves
1 teaspoon ground ginger
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
10 cardamom seeds
4 1/2 cups long-grain white rice
1 cup plain yogurt
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Place saffron threads into boiling water, set aside to steep.
Melt the vegetable shortening in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Stir in the onions, and cook until golden, about 5 minutes.  Season with cinnamon sticks, cloves, ginger, cumin, garlic powder, and cardamom seeds.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes to release the flavor, stirring constantly.
Pour in the rice and cook for 10 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add the yogurt, saffron water, and salt.  Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low.  Cover pot with a cloth folded into 4 layers.  Place a lid over the cloth and cook until the rice is done, about 20 minutes.  Remove the cinnamon sticks, cloves, and cardamom seeds before serving.
