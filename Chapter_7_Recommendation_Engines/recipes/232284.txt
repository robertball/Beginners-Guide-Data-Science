Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) containers applesauce
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)
3 cups oats
1 cup dried cranberries
3/4 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Beat applesauce, butter, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla together in a bowl until smooth.
Mix flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into the applesauce mixture. Fold oats, cranberries, and chocolate chips into the batter; drop by oversized spoonful onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cookies cool on pans for a few minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
