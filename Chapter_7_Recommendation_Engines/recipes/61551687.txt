Ingredients:
1 (19.8 ounce) package brownie mix

1/2 cup water
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 pint heavy whipping cream
1 (8 ounce) container frozen French Vanilla whipped topping, thawed
1 (12 ounce) container frozen French Vanilla whipped topping, thawed
1/2 bottle of caramel topping (like ice cream topping)
1 (1.5 ounce) bar chocolate candy: Heath, chocolate chunks
Bailey's optional (add to pudding)

Directions:
Prepare brownie mix according to package directions or can add about half a bottle of caramel topping (as you would use on ice cream) in the brownie pan before baking in the oven. Cool completely. Cut into large crumbles or crumble into 1 in crumbles with hands.
In a large bowl, combine pudding mix, water and sweetened condensed milk. Add Bailey's if desired.
In a separate bowl, whip 1/2 pint heavy cream and 3 tbs sugar for about 10 minutes and then fold in the cream with the pudding/water until smooth and no streaks remain.
Add cut strawberries, chocolate chunks, peanut butter bits and toffee bits if desired.
In a trifle bowl or glass serving dish, place half of the brownies, caramel, candy, chocolate whipped cream pudding mix, and french vanilla cool whip. Repeat layers. Shave chocolate onto top layer for garnish. Refrigerate 8 hours before serving.
