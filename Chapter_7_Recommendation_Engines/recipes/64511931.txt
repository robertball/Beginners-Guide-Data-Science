Directions:
Preheat oven for 350 degrees
1.  Saute the onions, mushrooms, chicken, garlic and seasoning until the onions are translucent and the chicken is no longer pink.
2.  In a separate bowl combine the soups and milk. Whisk until well blended then add to the chicken mixture.
3.  Simmer all on a reduced heat for about 5-10 min. Taste it and add salt and pepper if needed (keep in mind that stuffing mixes can be salty)
4.  Transfer to a 9x13 baking dish.
