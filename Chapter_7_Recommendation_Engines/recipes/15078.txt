Ingredients:
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
24 pimento-stuffed green olives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a small mixing bowl, combine cheese and butter or margarine. Stir flour and cayenne pepper into the cheese and butter mixture. Blend well. Wrap a tablespoon of dough around each green olive. Arrange the wrapped olives on a cookie sheet.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown.

Description: 
Rich cheese dough surrounds a savory olive.  A great pick-up appetizer or snack. You can freeze the unbaked, dough-wrapped-olives and then bake them right out of the freezer, extending the baking time by a few minutes.
