Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup water
1 egg
2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon dry black beans
1 tablespoon dry lentils
1 tablespoon dry kidney beans
1 tablespoon barley
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup millet flour
1/4 cup rye flour
1/4 cup cracked wheat
2 tablespoons wheat germ
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons bread machine yeast

Directions:
Place milk and water into a microwave-safe glass measuring cup. Heat in microwave for 35 seconds. Pour mixture into bread machine. Add egg, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and honey.
Grind black beans, lentils, kidney beans, and barley in a coffee grinder until fine. Combine grounds, unbleached flour, whole wheat flour, millet flour, rye flour, cracked wheat, wheat germ, and salt in the bread machine. Add yeast.
Set bread machine on dough cycle.
Remove and punch down dough once bread machine beeps. Roll dough out onto a pastry cloth. Grease a loaf pan with remaining olive oil. Shape dough into a loaf and place into the prepared pan. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Uncover dough and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); bake until browned, 30 to 35 minutes more. Let bread rest in the pan for 10 minutes; remove and let cool until ready to slice.

Description: 
In Ezekiel 4:9 in the Bible, there is a description of bread that Ezekiel was to live on for 390 days. I have tried another recipe on Allrecipes which did not turn out for me; however I have developed one that turned out great. I would like to share it with you.
