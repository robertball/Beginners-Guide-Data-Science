Ingredients:
4 firm yet ripe figs
1 1/2 tsp. extra virginolive oil
10-12 oz of sweet gorgonzola cheese, rind removed and cut into 4 equal pieces
4 Tbsp of wild flower honey
12 Arugula sprigs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 475 degrees F
Snip off the pointed tips of the figs. Brush the fruit with olive oil. Arrange in a small baking pan. Put in the center of the oven and immediately reduce the heat to 425 degrees F. Bake until puffed and aromatic, about 10 minutes. Remove and let cool.
Cut an X in the top of each fig and fold the corners back to resemble a flower, or split it lengthwise in half. On each plate, arrange 1 piece of gorgonzola, 1 fig, and 3 arugula sprigs; drizzle with 1 Tbsp of honey. Serve immediately
