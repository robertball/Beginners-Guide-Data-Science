2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon white sugar
¼ teaspoon ground ginger
⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon

Description: 
The recipes I found for mango chicken seemed to overwhelm the mangoes with citrus juices. Here's my version, which I believe keeps the flavor of fresh mango in focus. Garnish with a sprig of fresh parsley and serve with plain white rice.
