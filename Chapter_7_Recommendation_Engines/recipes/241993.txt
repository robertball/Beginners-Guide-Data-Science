Ingredients:
1 baby eggplant, cut into 1/4-inch slices
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
1 loaf flat bread, sliced horizontally and cut into 4 equal pieces
1/2 (12 ounce) jar roasted red bell peppers, drained and sliced
4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup roasted garlic hummus

Directions:
Season eggplant slices with salt and pepper; let stand for 2 minutes.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute 1/2 of the eggplant until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining olive oil and eggplant.
Preheat a panini press according to manufacturer's instructions.
Layer eggplant, roasted red pepper, and mozzarella cheese, respectively, onto the bottom piece of each flat bread. Spread 1 tablespoon hummus on the inside of each top piece of flat bread and place over the mozzarella layer, creating a panini.
Grill each panini on the preheated panini press until cooked through and cheese is melted, about 7 minutes.

Description: 
This is a delicious sandwich which can be served for lunch or dinner. Paired with a green salad and a glass of red wine, it makes a good meal. Any type of flat bread can be used, however I chose one topped with portobello mushrooms and gorgonzola cheese.
