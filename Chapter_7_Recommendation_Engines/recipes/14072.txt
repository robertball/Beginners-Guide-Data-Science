Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander seed
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 1/4 cups dry jasmine rice
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dry lentils
3 cups water
1 potato, peeled and diced
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup green peas

In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onions, and cook, stirring frequently until they have softened. Sprinkle in the ginger, garlic, coriander, cardamom, nutmeg, and cumin. Cook for 3 minutes more, stirring frequently.
Pour the rice into the saucepan and saute the rice with the spices for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour the lentils and salt into the saucepan.  Pour 3 cups of water into the pan, stir.
