Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh kale, stems removed and leaves thinly sliced
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 pinch salt
5 slices bacon
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 clove garlic, crushed
1/2 cup sunflower seeds

Directions:
Place kale in a resealable plastic bag; add 1 teaspoon olive oil and salt. Mix thoroughly until leaves are coated. Seal bag and let sit for 30 minutes.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into small pieces.
Whisk 1/4 cup olive oil, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl until dressing is evenly mixed.
Transfer kale to a bowl; add dressing and toss to coat. Top salad with bacon and sunflower seeds.
