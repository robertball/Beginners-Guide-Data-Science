In a saucepan, combine turnips, carrots, ginger, water and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cover and cook over medium-high heat for 10-15 minutes or until vegetables are tender; drain and reserve liquid.

Description: 
Milk-tasting turnips and carrots are wonderfully enhanced by ginger, onion and a mouth-watering creamy cheese sauce in this super side dish. The serving bowl is always empty at the end of the meal.                                  -- Sandra Melnychenko, Grandview, Manitoba
