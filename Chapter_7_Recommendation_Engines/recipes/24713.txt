Description: 
When I was small we would always stop and get hot dogs smothered in a flavorful meat sauce on the way to Gram's. Dad worked and experimented, and finally came up with a sauce that tasted just as good. Be sure to spread the hot dog rolls with mustard and top them off with chopped onion.
