Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1 (1.4 ounce) package dry vegetable soup mix (such as KnorrÂ®)
1 cup radishes, sliced
1/3 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/3 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/3 cup chopped yellow bell pepper
1 cup broccoli florets
1 cup cauliflower florets
1/2 cup chopped carrot
1/2 cup chopped celery

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Spread crescent roll dough out into an 11x14-inch jelly roll pan; pinch perforations and seams together to make a crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool completely.
Mix cream cheese, mayonnaise, and vegetable soup mix together in a bowl. Spread cream cheese mixture over the crust. Sprinkle pizza with radishes, green, red, and yellow bell pepper, broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, and celery, pressing vegetables into the cream cheese mixture.
Cut pizza into squares, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight to blend flavors.
