Ingredients:
1/4 cup of butter
2 tblsp of fresh parsley chopped
1 clove of garlic chopped
1 tsp of Dijon Mustard
1 tblsp of parmesan cheese
dash of pepper
2 eggs
4 pieces of bread
bacon

Directions:
Lightly spread some of the butter on one side of the bread and grill.  Put the bread grilled side down on a baking sheet.
Mix together the rest of the butter, garlic, parsley, parmesan, pepper and dijon mustard.  Spread this mixture over the ungrilled side of the bread and put the baking sheet in the oven on broil (be sure to watch it so it doesn't burn).
Fry the bacon and cook the eggs over easy.
Once the bread is done put the bacon and egg on top and cover with the other piece of bread to create a sandwich and enjoy.
