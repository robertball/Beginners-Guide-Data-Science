Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 pound leeks, chopped
1 onion, chopped
2 quarts water (I use half water and half chicken stock)
3 large potatoes, chopped
2 large carrots, chopped
1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
1/3 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
3 teaspoons salt
1/2 pound fresh spinach
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the leeks and onion, and cook until tender.
Pour water into the pot. Mix in potatoes, carrots, asparagus, and rice. Season with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes, until vegetables and rice are tender.
Stir spinach and heavy cream into the soup mixture, and continue cooking about 5 minutes before serving.
