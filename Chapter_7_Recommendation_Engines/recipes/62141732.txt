Ingredients:
For the Stuffing:
1/2 C. Butter
3 Stalks Celery, diced
1 Large Onion, diced
3 large green apples, diced
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. Freshly cracked black pepper
1 T. fresh sage, diced
1 tsp. dried thyme
1 cup pecans, finely chopped
1/2 cup dried cranberries
16 oz. dried bread crumbs
1 Liter Homemade Beef broth
For the Heart:
1 Beef Heart
1 Head of Garlic, cloves separated and minced
8 strips of smoked bacon
3 C. Red Wine

Directions:
For the Stuffing:
1. Melt butter on medium heat, and add the celery, onions, and apples.  Cook until celery is soft, and onions are transluscent.
2. Mix  the cooked vegetables with all of the other ingredients, except the beef stock.  Add just enough stock to just barely soften or moisten the stuffing, without soaking it.
For the Roast:
1. Preheat oven to 350 F.
2. Stuff as much stuffing as possible into the cavities of the heart.
3. Place heart in roasting pan.  Scatter garlic over top of roast, then place bacon on top to cover.
4. Add red wine to bottom of pan, and tightly cover roast and pan with aluminium foil.
5. Roast covered for 90 minutes. Remove foil, and allow to brown for an additional 30 minutes.
6. Let rest for 15 minutes, then carve and serve!

Description: 
As far as organ meat goes, heart is probably some of the most tame you can try.  When I first had this, I honestly thought it was an elk roast, or perhaps moose.  It was that good!  Bear in mind that it is a very low-fat cut, so over cooking will dry it out quickly. This is one I have made a few times for a sunday roast.  When I didn't tell people what it was, they assumed it was just a beef or venison roast!
