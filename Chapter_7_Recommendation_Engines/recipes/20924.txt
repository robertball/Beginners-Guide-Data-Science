Ingredients:
8 apples
3 cups white sugar
1/2 cup white corn syrup
1/2 cup water
8 cinnamon red hot candies
1 teaspoon red food coloring

Directions:
Insert a wooden craft stick into the bottom of each apple.  Butter a baking sheet and set aside.
Combine sugar, corn syrup and water in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Heat, without stirring, to 270 to 290 degrees F (132 to 143 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard but pliable threads.  Remove from heat and stir in candies and food coloring until just mixed.
Holding each apple by its stick, quickly twirl in syrup, tilting pan to cover apple.  Lift out of syrup, turning to allow drips to adhere to apple.  Place apples on prepared baking sheet to cool completely.
