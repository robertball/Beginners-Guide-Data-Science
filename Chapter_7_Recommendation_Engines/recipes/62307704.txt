1 loaf French bread
8 eggs
1 1/2 cup half & half
1 cup milk
1 tsp vanilla
2 T. sugar
1/4 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 tsp. nutmeg
dash of salt
Praline Topping (prepared the next morning)
2 sticks butter, melted
1 cup brown sugar, packed
1 cup chopped pecans
2 T. corn syrup (I use dark, but light works as well)
1/2 tsp cinnamon (I use more, but do to taste.)
1/2 tsp nutmeg

Directions:
Slice break into 20 one inch slices.  Arrange in a generously buttered 9 X 13 Baking dish.  Arrange into two layers, overlapping slices.
In a large bowl combines, eggs, milks, sugar and spices.  Beat until blended, not bubbly.  Pour mixture over bread slices evenly.  Cover with foil and refrigerate overnight.
Next morning:  Prehead oven to 350 degrees.  Pour Praline Topping over bread.  Bake uncovered until gold brown - about 45 minutes.  Serve with maple syrup.  (my family does not use syrup...it is already decadently rich without it.)  Serves 12.
