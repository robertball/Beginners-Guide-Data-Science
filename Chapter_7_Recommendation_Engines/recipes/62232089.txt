Ingredients:
Devil's food cake mix
1-2 eggs (according to cake mix package)
oil (according to cake mix package)
8 oz. package cream cheese, softened
6 T. butter, softened
1 t. vanilla
1T. cream (or milk)
3 cups powdered sugar
White chocolate almond bark or 5 bags of Hershey's Melt-a-ways candies
Food coloring
Sprinkles
Lollipop sticks

Directions:
Bake chocolate cake, following the directions on the box.
After the cake has cooled, cut the cake into six huge chunks and chop them in a food processor until crumbly.
Make the cream cheese frosting by combining the cream cheese, butter, vanilla, cream (or milk), and powdered sugar.
Add the cream cheese frosting, a half cup at a time, to the cake crumbles (until all the cake was moistened with the frosting and was moldable like dough), combining well with a spatula.
Form the cake mixture into balls, put them on a plate and refrigerate.
While the cake balls are chilling, open white chocolate candy and melt in microwave or in a double-boiler.
After the chocolate is melted, add food coloring to desired color (separate for more colors if desired).
Insert lollipop stick or long wooden dowel into chilled cake balls and dip into melted chocolate; coat thoroughly.
Add sprinkles quickly before chocolate hardens.
Allow cake pops to harden in a tall glass or vase.
