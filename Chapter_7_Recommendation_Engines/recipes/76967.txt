Ingredients:
2 large cucumbers, peeled, halved lengthwise, seeds scraped out, then thinly sliced
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 medium red onion, thinly sliced
6 tablespoons sour cream
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon dried dill
Ground black pepper
4 (5 ounce) salmon fillets
Olive oil

Directions:
Place cucumbers in a colander and toss with salt; let stand until several tablespoons of liquid has drained, 30 to 45 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels and transfer to a medium bowl. Add onion, sour cream, vinegar, dill and a few grinds of pepper. Toss to coat. (Can be refrigerated several hours ahead.)
Meanwhile, heat gas grill, with all burners on high, until fully preheated, 10 to 15 minutes. Use a wire brush to clean grill rack, then brush lightly with oil. Close lid and let return to temperature. Brush salmon with oil and season with salt and pepper; grill until just opaque, about 3 minutes per side.
Set each warm or room-temperature salmon fillet on a plate; spoon cucumber salad over part of and alongside the fish.

Description: 
Cucumber salad perfectly accompanies a piece of grilled salmon. Salting and draining the cucumbers first intensifies their flavor and makes the salad less watery. Once the cucumbers have released some of their moisture, pat them dry on paper towels and dress them with sour cream, vinegar and dill. If you're not a dill fan, feel free to substitute basil or parsley, fresh or dried.
