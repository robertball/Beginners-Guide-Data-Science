Ingredients:
4 lb fresh pork butt
2 to 4 banana leaf
2 tablespoon Hawaiian or sea salt
1/4 cup tablespoons shoyu (soy sauce)
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
2 tablespoon liquid smoke
Hawaiian salt

Directions:
Set Crock Pot to low.  Place liner bag or pray crock pot insert with quality cooking spray, set aside.
In small bowl combine Hawaiian salt, shoyu, garlic, ginger and liquid smoke. Poke several holes into pork butt with paring knife. Rub spice paste over pork butt and into holes. Run banana leaf under very warm water to make plyable. Make sure banana leaf is food grade and has NOT been treated with pesticides. Line crock pot insert with banana leaf in a "X" letting leaf hang over side of insert. Place pork on banana leaf. Fold leaves over pork. Cover with lid.  At this point you can place insert in refrigerator overnight and start crock pot cooking in morning.  This gives spices time to marinate meat. When ready, place insert in crock pot and turn on low for 8 to 10 hours, high for 4 to 6 hours. Let stand for 15 minutes before opening. Remove to serving dish. Using 2 forks, shred pork adding hawaiian salt to taste. Spoon as much fat off liquid as you would prefer.  Pour sauce over shredded meat to keep moist.  This freezes well. For leftovers; chopped up 1 head of cabbage and 1 medium onion. Stir fry till cabbage is wilted and onion is translucent, add 2 cups kalua pig, stir till warmed through. Sticky white rice compliments this well. Serve with shoyu.
