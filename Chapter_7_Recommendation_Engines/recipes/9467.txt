Ingredients:
1 cup water
3 1/2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups light corn syrup
1 tablespoon almond extract
1 tablespoon red food coloring

Directions:
Lightly grease one 12x18 inch or larger baking sheet.
In a large heavy saucepan, combine the water, sugar and corn syrup. Heat over high, stirring constantly with a heat resistant spoon, until all sugar is dissolved. Stop stirring and bring to a boil.  Boil until a candy thermometer reads 310 degrees F (154 degrees C). Remove from heat.
When bubbling has ceased, stir in the flavoring and a food coloring. Spread into the prepared pan so that the candy is no more than 1/4 inch thick. Cool for 45 minutes in the refrigerator. Remove from refrigerator, crack into pieces and enjoy!

This candy is good any time of the year but it's especially festive at Christmas! Vanilla, lemon or walnut extract can be easily substituted for almond to add a little variety to your candies.
