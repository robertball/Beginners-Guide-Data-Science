Ingredients:
1 (10 inch) unbaked flaky pie crust
3 sprigs fresh oregano, leaves removed
3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed
1 1/2 tablespoons grainy Dijon mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons honey
1 teaspoon pressed garlic
6 tablespoons olive oil
3 tomatoes, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
1 sprig fresh oregano, leaves removed
1 sprig fresh thyme, leaves removed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch tart pan with butter.
Lay the pie crust into the prepared tart pan. Whisk leaves from 3 sprigs oregano and 3 sprigs thyme with Dijon mustard, honey, garlic, and olive oil to a creamy paste. Spread mixture over the bottom of the pie crust to completely cover. Lay tomato slices over the mustard mixture, covering the bottom of the crust. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the tart; top with leaves from 1 sprig oregano and 1 sprig thyme.
Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through, about 45 minutes. Serve warm or cold.

Description: 
I am an American living in France and have had a few experiences with making a traditional 'Tarte Tomate' recipe. I have never quite gotten it right, but this weekend I decided to break the rules and make it how I thought it would taste best, and it worked for me! Even if you don't usually love tomatoes I would recommend giving this a try. If you can use heritage (coeur de boeuf) tomatoes, do it! That is what I used today and it was great. I think the quality of the tomatoes will make a difference for the recipe.
