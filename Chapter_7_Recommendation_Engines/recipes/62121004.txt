Ingredients:
4 cans tiny shrimp, (puree 3 cans with a little liquid     from 1 can and leave 1 can whole)
1 cup Hellmann’s Mayonnaise
2 cans Campbell’s tomato soup
2 8oz. pkgs Philadelphia Brand cream cheese, softened
2 pkts Knox unflavored gelatin
3/4 cups each: celery and white onion, very finely chopped
Salt & pepper to taste
Garlic powder to taste

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt together tomato soup, mayonnaise, and cream cheese. Blend well, bring just to boil and remove from heat. Stir in remaining ingredients until well blended.
Pour mixture into a large mayo-greased mold, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 8 hours.
When ready to serve, a thin knife may be necessary around edges to loosen from mold. Place serving plate over top and flip onto plate.

Description: 
One of the best tasting dips I've ever eaten! So rich and flavorful, so easy to prepare, and so well-received everywhere I take it! Use pretty molds or an appropriately themed mold for get-togethers. This dip is best served with onion and sesame crackers, or a mixed vegetable tray. It can also be served warm like a fondue with bread by eliminating the gelatin and chilling step so it doesn't set.
