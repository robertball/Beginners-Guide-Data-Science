Ingredients:
8 large cucumbers, sliced
4 cups sliced onion
2 tablespoons pickling salt
2 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups white vinegar
1 tablespoon ground dried turmeric
1 tablespoon dry mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
2 quarts cold water, or as needed

Directions:
Place the sliced cucumbers and onions into a large bowl and sprinkle the salt over the top. Fill the bowl with enough water to cover the cucumbers. Let stand for 8 to 10 hours.
Drain and rinse the cucumbers and onion with fresh water. Sterilize 4 (1 quart) jars and lids.
In a 6 quart pot, stir together the sugar and flour. Whisk in the vinegar, turmeric, mustard powder and celery seed to make a smooth paste. Add the cucumbers and onions and fill with enough water to cover. Stir, and bring to a boil. Cook until thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
Pour into hot sterilized jars filling to within 1/2 inch of the top. Seal with lids and rings. Process for 10 minutes in a simmering water bath. Refrigerate any jars that fail to seal properly.
