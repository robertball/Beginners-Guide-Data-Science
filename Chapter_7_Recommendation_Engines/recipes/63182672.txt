Stir together cocoa and baking soda in large bowl; stir in 1/3 cup butter. Add boiling water; stir until mixture thickens. Stir in sugar, eggs and remaining 1/3 cup butter; stir until smooth. Add flour, vanilla and salt; blend completely. Stir in chocolate chips. Pour into prepared pan.
Bake 35 to 40 minutes for rectangular pan, 30 to 35 minutes for square pans or until brownies begin to pull away from sides of pan. Cool completely in pan on wire rack.
Ice Cream:
In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Add cocoa alternately with milk; mix well. Fold in whipped topping. Pour into a bowl large enough to contain ice cream. Once the ice cream is in bowl, cut up brownies and stir into the ice cream mix. Freeze for 8 hours or overnight.

Description: 
I've made this before, just as an experiment. It was amazing!! But I don't own either of these recipes, so thanks to Hershey's Recipes, for the brownies. And to Bonnie Scott for her Frozen Chocolate Pie Recipe, which is used as the ice cream.
