Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup butter
1 cup persimmon puree
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups unsweetened date pieces
1 3/4 cups rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Combine white sugar, brown sugar, coconut oil, and butter in a separate bowl; mix until creamy. Beat in persimmon pulp. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat until well combined, scraping sides of the bowl occasionally.
Stir flour mixture into persimmon mixture by hand until thoroughly combined. Add dates and oats; mix dough well.
Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool briefly; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
What does one do with an extra cup of persimmon puree and a couple of cups of date pieces? One comes up with a new cookie recipe! These turned out the mounded cookies that our family so loves. When my husband commented 'these might be the best cookies you've ever made,' I knew they were good enough to share.
