Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 1/4 cups ground walnuts
1/3 cup white sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon melted butter
2 tablespoons water
1/8 teaspoon maple flavored extract

Directions:
Sift together 1 1/3 cups flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons double-acting baking powder.  Set aside.  Cream 1/4 cup butter or margarine.  Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar, creaming well.   Blend in 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 teaspoon almond extract, 1/8 teaspoon salt and unbeaten egg.  Gradually add the flour and baking soda mixture, mixing thoroughly.
To Make Nut Filling:    Combine 1 1/4 cups walnuts or pecans, ground or chopped very fine, 1/3 cup sugar and 1/16 teaspoon salt. Add 1 Tablespoon melted butter, 2 Tablespoons water and 1/16 teaspoon maple flavoring.  Mix thoroughly.
Roll out dough on a floured surface to  1/8-inch thickness.  Cut with star-shaped cookie cutter.  Place a teaspoonful of Nut Filling in the center of each star.  Bring the 5 points upright; starting at the base, pinch sides together so points stand up, allowing filling to show.  Place on ungreased baking sheet.  Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) 7 to 10 minutes until light golden brown.

Description: 
Every year we host a New Year's Eve Party with a theme.  Last year was Starry, Starry Night.  Everything (food, dress and decorations!) related to stars.  This cookie was a hit with everyone. Try substituting pecans for the walnuts.
