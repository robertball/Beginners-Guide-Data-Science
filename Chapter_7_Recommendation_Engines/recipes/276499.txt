Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup Italian-style bread crumbs
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup freshly grated Romano cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1/2 cup minced onion
1/4 cup Cabernet Sauvignon
2 eggs
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound ground turkey breast
1 pound ground Italian-flavored turkey sausage
4 cups spaghetti sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a sheet pan with cooking spray.
Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, parsley, basil, oregano, and Cajun seasoning in a bowl; mix until herbs are evenly distributed. Combine minced onion, Cabernet Sauvignon, eggs, and garlic in a second bowl; mix until well combined.
Mix together ground turkey and ground sausage in a third, large bowl. Add cheese mixture and onion mixture and mix until all ingredients are well combined. Form mixture into 1-inch meatballs and place on the prepared sheet pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
Place spaghetti sauce in a large saucepan and stir in meatballs until coated. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until warmed through, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
I use these turkey sausage meatballs with my homemade spaghetti sauce instead of beef meatballs. The addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and freshly grated Parmesan and Romano cheeses makes it something wonderful.
