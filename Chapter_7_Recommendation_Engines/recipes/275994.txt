Ingredients:
1/2 cup dark beer
3 tablespoons honey
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 cup stone-ground spicy mustard
6 miniature multi-colored sweet peppers, halved lengthwise, seeds removed
5 links bratwurst, cut into 1-inch chunks

Directions:
Combine beer, honey, turmeric, and allspice in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until volume has reduced by half, about 8 minutes. Stir in mustard and let stand until ready to serve.
Place sweet peppers and bratwurst chunks in a single layer in the air fryer basket.
Cook in the air fryer at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), tossing once halfway through cooking, until peppers are tender and bratwurst edges are golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the brats should read 165 degrees F (75 degreed C). Work in batches if necessary.
Serve warm with mustard sauce.
