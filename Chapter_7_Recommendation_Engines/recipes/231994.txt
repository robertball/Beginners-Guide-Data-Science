Description: 
I had some fresh asparagus lying around and wanted to use it up. I always do the same things with asparagus and wanted to be creative, so I tried this out to see if it worked and I was pleasantly surprised. It reminds me of a vegetarian crawfish pie. 
Great for brunch or a main course at dinner!
