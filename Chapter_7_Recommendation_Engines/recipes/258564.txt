Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1/4 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed
1 serrano chile pepper, seeded and diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can HORMEL® Mary Kitchen® Roast Beef Hash
1 canned chipotle chile in adobo sauce, minced, or more to taste
3 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
8 corn tortillas
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
Garnish:
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 cup salsa
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil. Cook and stir onions and red bell pepper until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add corn and serrano pepper; cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute more.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Add HORMEL(R) MARY KITCHEN(R) Roast Beef Hash and chipotle pepper. Cook until the hash is heated and well mixed with the rest of the ingredients, about 2 or 3 minutes.
Heat tortillas in a skillet, turning once, until they are soft and can be folded without breaking.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat.
Spoon 2 tablespoons of the hash filling and 1 1/2 tablespoons of mozzarella cheese on each tortilla. Fold tortillas in half. Fry in vegetable oil until quesadillas are golden and crispy, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
Mix cilantro and onions together in a small bowl.
Serve the quesadillas with salsa, sour cream, onions, and cilantro. Enjoy!
