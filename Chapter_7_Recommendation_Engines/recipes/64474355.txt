Ingredients:
4 and 1/2-5  cups chicken broth(keeping it warm)
1 medium onion, finely chopped
8 oz. baby bell's mushrooms roughly chopped
2 cups Italian rice (also called Arborio rice)
Olive oil to coat the bottom of a heavy pan
1 glob about 1/4 cup Earth Balance (you could use butter)
salt and pepper to taste.
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese optional

Directions:
Place a heavy pan over medium heat.
Put enough olive oil in the pan to coat the bottom, add half the Earth Balance or butter.
Saute the onions until translucent.
Add the mushrooms and continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes.
Add the rice, mixing and turning until the grains are glossy.
Add 3 ladles of the warm chicken broth, this will steam and
mostly evaporate.
Continue stirring.
Add more broth a little at a time to keep the rice moist.
Keep doing this until the rice is al dente(firm/tender)about 20 minutes.
Remove from heat and add the rest of the Earth Balance or butter and the parm if desired.Serve hot.
