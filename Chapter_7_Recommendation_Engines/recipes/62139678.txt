Ingredients:
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
3/4 cup milk
1 box of frozen spinach, thawed
1 lbs lean ground beef
1 lbs ground pork
2 garlic cloves, minced
3/4 cup freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese
2 large eggs
Salt
Olive Oil
4 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into 25-30 cubes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375
1. In a medium bowl, soak the bread crumbs in the milk
2. Wring the spinach dry in a clean kitchen towel
3. Place the ground beef in a large bowl, and make a well in the ground beef
4. Add the spinach, garlic, egg, parmigiano-reggiano cheese, salt, and the bread crumb/milk mixture.
Mix until combined.  Place about 2 tablespoons of the meatball mixture in your hand and press a mozzarella cube into the center.  Form the meat around the cheese making a ball.  Repeat with the rest of the mixture and cheese.
Brown the meatballs in the olive oil, being careful not to over crowd the pan, then transfer to an 11X7 baking dish.
Pour the sauce over the meatballs and cover with foil.  Bake in the oven for 45 minutes to an hour or until baked through.

Description: 
Savory meatballs mixed with spinach and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then stuffed with a small nugget of Mozzarella.  I usually serve these with a tomato cream sauce, appetizer style.  They're a hit everytime, and my guests always ask for the recipe!!
