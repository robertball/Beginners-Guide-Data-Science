Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 shallots, thinly sliced
2 pears - peeled, cored and sliced
1/3 cup dry white wine
1/2 teaspoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
salt and pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) round loaf sourdough bread
1 (8 ounce) round Brie cheese
1/2 cup slivered almonds
Assorted crackers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add shallot; cook and stir for 1 minute to soften. Add thinly sliced pears; cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Pour in white wine, brown sugar, thyme, salt, and pepper; increase heat to medium-high and simmer  until the liquid has evaporated, and the pears have lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Set aside.
Cut a Brie-sized hole in the top of the sourdough bread to within 1/2-inch of the bottom. Cut the removed bread into pieces for serving, set aside. Score the Brie around it's edge, using a paring knife to cut 1/4-inch deep. Cut in half by looping an 18-inch piece of very thin string, or unflavored dental floss around the scored Brie and pulling the ends in opposite directions.
Place the bottom half of the Brie, cut-side-up, into the sourdough loaf. Top with 1/2 of the pear mixture and sprinkle with 1/2 of the slivered almonds. Place the remaining brie half on top, spread with remaining pear mixture, and sprinkle with remaining slivered almonds. Place on a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes or until soft and gooey. Serve with sliced sourdough bread and crackers.

Description: 
Brie baked in a round sourdough bread bowl makes this ultimately easy! You could substitute a sweet chutney for the topping for even easier prep. I microwaved the final product for a few minutes to speed up the cooking (couldn't wait for it to be ready!)
