Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
2 eggplants, peeled and sliced 1/8-inch thick
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound ground turkey
1 small yellow onion, chopped
1 cup quinoa
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (24 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce (such as Hunt'sÂ®)
1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (16 ounce) package shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend
1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry eggplant slices a single layer at a time, replenishing oil between batches, until golden brown and soft, about 1 minute per side.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add turkey and onion; cook and stir until turkey is crumbled and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in quinoa and season with salt and pepper. Pour in spaghetti sauce; cook until sauce is bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes.
Spread a layer of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Top with even layers of eggplant slices and Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese. Repeat layering sauce, eggplant, and cheese, ending with sauce on top. Spread mozzarella cheese evenly on top. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 45 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until top is golden, about 15 minutes more.
