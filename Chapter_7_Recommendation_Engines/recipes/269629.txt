Ingredients:
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 ½ pounds Bosc pears, washed
1  egg
¼ cup milk
1 cup whole wheat flour
¾ teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons cane sugar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes
2 tablespoons cornstarch
¼ cup cane sugar

Directions:








Submitter: 
Buckwheat Queen
Description: 
A rustic batter is dropped onto fresh pears before being baked for a healthier dessert. Using less sugar than most recipes I've seen, the crisp flavor of the pears is highlighted. My family and I enjoy this at breakfast. I leave 1 or 2 of the pears unpeeled to add a bit of color.
