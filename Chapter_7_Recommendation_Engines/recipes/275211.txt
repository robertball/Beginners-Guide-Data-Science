Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (3 pound) pork loin roast
salt and ground black pepper to taste
20 cloves garlic, peeled
1 cup diced onion
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
1/4 cup honey

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season pork with salt and pepper. Place pork in the hot skillet and sear until brown on all sides, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer pork to a 6-quart slow cooker.
Add garlic cloves to the skillet. Cook, stirring often, over medium-high heat until brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle flour over garlic and onion and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.
Pour chicken broth into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir in lemon juice, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper, and bring to a boil. Pour broth mixture and honey over the pork in the slow cooker.
Close the lid and cook on High for 3 hours or on Low for 6 hours, until pork is fork-tender. Transfer pork to a platter and let rest for 5 minutes. Pour cooking liquid into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Lightly mash the garlic cloves. Slice the pork, and serve with the mashed garlic cloves and sauce.
