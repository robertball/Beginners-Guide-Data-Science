Ingredients:
4 large eggs
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1 1/2 cups milk
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
ice

Directions:
Fill sink with several inches of ice water.
Beat eggs and cocoa powder in a bowl until well-blended and smooth.
Heat milk, evaporated milk, sugar, and cocoa powder mixture in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until custard comes to 180 degrees F (82 degrees C), about 10 minutes. The custard should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
Remove saucepan from heat and immediately transfer to sink to halt cooking. Continue to stir custard until cooled; stir in vanilla extract.
Pour custard into an ice cream maker once it reaches 40 degrees F (4 degrees C). Freeze according to manufacturer's directions until softly frozen. Transfer ice cream to a lidded container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer at least 2 hours to overnight.

Description: 
This is a pantry-friendly recipe for custard-style chocolate ice cream. No heavy cream or corn starch is necessary and it's successful with 2% milk, yet the results are still creamy and smooth! A digital kitchen thermometer is highly recommended while cooking to ensure you've reached the proper cooking temperature.
