Ingredients:
1 can drained Canneloni beans
1 can drained Garbonzo beans
2 roma tomatoes diced
2 stalks celery diced
1/2 onion diced
1/2 cup raisins

1 diced jalepeño
1 lemon zested and juiced
1/2 cup Ken's Steakhouse Apple Cider Vinegrette
1 tsp++ Greek blend seasoning for grilling

Directions:
Drain, chop and drop all ingredients. Best to chop everything about the size of the beans for uniformity.
Seed jalepeño if you want lower heat. Toss with Greek grilling seasoning, lemon juice and cider vinaigrette.
Be prepared to taste and season with extra Greek grilling seasoning because you want that flavor coming through.
Chill, re-toss and serve.
