Ingredients:
kosher salt to taste
2 eggplants, cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices
1 pinch ground black pepper
4 cups fresh spinach
1/2 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or to taste
1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1/2 cup ricotta cheese
1 1/2 cups marinara sauce
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Sprinkle kosher salt over eggplant slices. Let excess moisture drain from eggplant, 10 to 15 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels and transfer to baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with black pepper.
Combine spinach, onion, and garlic in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until spinach is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with Italian seasoning.
Mix Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and ricotta cheese together in a bowl. Stir in spinach mixture until well-combined.
Spread 2 spoonfuls of spinach mixture evenly over each eggplant slice. Roll up eggplant.
Spread 1/4 cup marinara sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange eggplant rolls seam-side down in the dish. Pour remaining marinara sauce over rolls. Cover with mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden, about 1 hour. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
