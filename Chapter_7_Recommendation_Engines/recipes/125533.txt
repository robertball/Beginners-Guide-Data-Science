Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1 cup sour cream
3 eggs
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 cups chopped fresh rhubarb
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie shell
1/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat 1 1/4 cups sugar, sour cream, eggs and  2 tablespoons flour in a large mixing bowl until smooth.  Stir in vanilla and salt.  Fold in rhubarb.  Pour rhubarb mixture into pie shell.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven.  Meanwhile, combine 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, and cinnamon in a small bowl.  Cut in butter with fork or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Set aside.
Remove pie from oven.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Sprinkle topping mixture evenly over pie.  Return pie to oven and bake until filling is set and crust and topping are golden brown, about 30 minutes.
