Ingredients:
1 c. quinoa
2 c. water
1 cube chicken bouillon (I use 1 tbsp. Better than Bouillon)
1 tomato, diced
1/2 small red onion, diced
1/2 cucumber, peeled and chopped
1 celery stalk, chopped
14 oz. cooked (canned) red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 tbsp. olive oil&
1 tsp. chili powder
1 tbsp. ground cumin
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tbsp. lime juice
1/4 tsp. hot sauce (Tobasco)
1/2 c. cilantro, chopped (I use scissors)

Directions:
In a sauce pan, heat quinoa over medium for 3-4 minutes (this brings out a slightly nutty flavor). Then add the water and bouillon and let simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed.
Meanwhile, chop/dice the veggies
When the quinoa is done, move it to a large serving bowl. Add the olive oil, veggies, beans (optional) and spices. (Adjust chili and hot sauce to your liking).
Serve warm or cold. Can be kept in the 'fridge for about 5 days.
