Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked whole-wheat pasta shells
1/3 cup frozen peas
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Fill a saucepan with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the shell pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Stir in the frozen peas, and cook for 1 more minute; drain well in a colander set in the sink. Return the pasta and peas to the saucepan.
Mix in the eggs, 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese, and black pepper; cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the eggs are cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve sprinkled with 1 teaspoon of Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This was a dish my mother made during Lent when we were kids and at other times to stretch our grocery dollars. It's easy to make and simple in taste. This recipe can be multiplied easily to serve the number of people eating.
