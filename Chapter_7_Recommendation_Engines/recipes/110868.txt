Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter at room temperature
3/4 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread, such as NutellaÂ®
1/2 cup white sugar
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 egg yolk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Beat the butter, chocolate-hazelnut spread, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Blend the whole egg into the butter mixture. Beat in the egg yolk and vanilla.
In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix the dry mixture into the egg and sugar mixture about 1/3 at a time until all the flour is incorporated. Gather the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Roll dough into large balls (about the size of a golf ball) and place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake until cookie is slightly firm on the outside, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on pans before removing.

Description: 
These cookies are great with a little milk, or all by their lonesome. A rich, chewy, nutty, dark chocolate taste that's more than just bittersweet. Enjoy.
