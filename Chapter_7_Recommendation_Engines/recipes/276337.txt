Ingredients:
6 cups rolled oats
2 cups pecan halves, broken into coarse pieces
1 cup slivered almonds
1/2 cup raw pumpkin seeds
1/2 cup raw unsalted sunflower seeds
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 cups golden raisins (optional)

Directions:
Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Stir oats, pecans, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds together in a large bowl. Add maple syrup, olive oil, vanilla extract, and salt; toss well to coat. Spread evenly between the 2 baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, rotating the sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through.
Remove from the oven and immediately divide golden raisins between the two sheets, stirring them in well so the hot granola plumps the fruit. Cool thoroughly.
