Ingredients:
Filling
1/4 cup butter
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 1/2 cups baby carrots, sliced in half lengthwise
3 tablespoons Robin Hood® Original All Purpose Flour
2 cups prepared chicken broth or water
1 (370 ml) can Carnation® Regular, 2% or Fat Free Evaporated Milk
1 tablespoon coarse mustard
1 (2 1/2 pound) rotisserie chicken, meat removed and shredded
1 cup grated Cheddar cheese
1 egg, beaten
Pie Crust
2 cups Robin Hood® Original All Purpose Flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup Crisco® All Vegetable Shortening
1 egg
2 tablespoons cold water
1 tablespoon white vinegar

Directions:
Melt butter in a large deep skillet on medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook for 3 minutes until soft and fragrant. Add carrots; continue cooking 3 minutes. Add flour, stirring frequently about 3 minutes. Stir in broth, evaporated milk and mustard. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently until sauce thickens. Stir in chicken. Cool while you make the pastry.
Pastry: Combine flour and salt in large mixing bowl. Cut room temperature shortening into flour with pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture is uniform and shortening resembles large peas. Beat egg, water and vinegar together. Pour all liquid evenly over flour mixture. Stir with fork until all of the mixture is moistened. Divide dough in half and shape each into a ball. Flatten each into a circle about 4" (10 cm). Wrap and chill 15 minutes for easier rolling.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Roll half the dough on a lightly floured surface into a circle 2" (5 cm) wider than 9" (23cm) pie plate. Transfer into pie plate. Trim pastry at edges of plate. Roll out remaining dough and set aside.
Place filling in pastry lined pie plate. Cover with remaining pastry. Seal pastry edges, trim and flute edges. Cut an X in the centre of pie. Brush with beaten egg.
Bake in preheated oven 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and continue baking 45 to 50 minutes until crust is golden brown. Cool on wire cooling rack for 15 minutes before serving.
