Ingredients:
36 ounces fresh Gluten Free Biscuit Dough
1 1/2 cup honey
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3/4 cup butter softened
1 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup chopped mixed raw trail mix (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9 or 10 inch square pan.
Mix butter, honey, brown sugar and cinnamon in a glass bowl, heat in microwave until liquidy. Make small round balls of dough and dip into your sweet mix. Arrange pieces in the bottom of the prepared pan. Continue until all biscuits are coated and placed in pan. If using raw trail mix, arrange them in and among the biscuit pieces on one side for those who don't desire fruit or nut.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes on a baking sheet. Let bread cool in pan for 15 minutes, spoon onto plate.  The bread just pulls apart.
