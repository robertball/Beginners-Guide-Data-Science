Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
6 fluid ounces evaporated milk
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup butter
3 1/2 ounces marshmallow creme
8 ounces cookie butter

Directions:
Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
Mix white sugar, evaporated milk, brown sugar, and butter in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring continually, until mixture is smooth and sugar is dissolved, about 8 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir marshmallow creme into sugar mixture until smooth.
Stir cookie butter into sugar-marshmallow mixture until evenly combined; pour into the prepared baking dish. Let fudge stand until cooled and solid, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
As a big fan of cookie butter, this seemed like a (not-quite) solution to my habit of eating spoonfuls from the jar. Now in a solid form, it's even more addicting!
