Ingredients:
1 pound toasted almonds, chopped
6 cups instant oatmeal
2 cups ketchup
1 (12 ounce) package frozen corn kernels, thawed
4 eggs, beaten
1 cup chopped mushrooms
1/2 cup red bell pepper, finely diced
1/2 cup minced red onion
6 green onions, thinly sliced
6 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine almonds, instant oatmeal, ketchup, corn, eggs, mushrooms, red bell pepper, red onion, green onions, olive oil, and horseradish in a bowl. Season with Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, basil, salt, and pepper.
Fold black beans into the almond mixture, being careful not to smash them. Scoop up 1/2 cup of the mixture; lightly flatten between the palms of your hands to form a patty. Repeat with remaining mixture.
Coat a skillet lightly with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Place patties in the hot skillet and cook until browned, about 7 minutes per side.
