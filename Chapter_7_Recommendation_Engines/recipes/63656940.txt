Ingredients:
•	4 medium baking potatoes such as russet, scrubbed clean
•	oil for brushing
•	2 cups cooked chicken, shredded or diced and warm
•	1 cup of cooked and crumbled bacon
•	1/2 cup hot sauce (such as Frank's Red Hot)
•	2 tablespoons butter, melted
•	salt and pepper to taste
•	1/4 cup sour cream
•	2 tablespoons butter, softened (for potato)
•	1 cup cheddar cheese
•	1/2 cup blue cheese, crumbled
•	2 green onions, sliced
•	1/4 cup blue cheese dressing

Directions:
1.	Prick the potatoes a few times with a fork and bake in a preheated 400F oven until tender, about an hour.
2.	Let the potatoes cool, cut in half and scoop out the middle leaving about 1/8 inch of potato on the skin. Reserve ½  the scooped out potato for another use like mashed potatoes. Put the other half into a large bowl to use with this recipe!
3.	Brush the potato skins all over with the oil and bake in a preheated 450F over for 10 minutes on each side.
4.	Mash the potato and add sour cream, milk and (softened) butter.
5.	Fill skins just under half way with potato mix. Sprinkle a small amount of cheese over.
6.	Mix the hot sauce and the melted butter and then mix in the chicken.
7.	Season the inside of the potato skins with salt and pepper, fill with the chicken and sprinkle on the cheeses.
8.	Broil until the cheese has melted, just a few minutes.
9.	Serve while still warm, garnished with green onions and with a side celery and carrot sticks and some blue cheese sauce for dipping.
