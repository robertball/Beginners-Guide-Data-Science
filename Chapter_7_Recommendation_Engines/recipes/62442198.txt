Ingredients:
1 medium to large pork fillet
50g/1¾oz prunes, chopped
50g/1¾oz soft dried apricots, chopped
2 tbsp paprika
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried thyme
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 tbsp coarse salt
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 lemon, cut into wedges, to serve

Directions:
Cut the pork open with a sharp knife and open the fillet out along its length, being careful not to cut all the way through the fillet.
In a bowl, mix together the prunes, apricots and parsley and insert along the length of the fillet. Season well.
Roll the fillet up and securely fasten with string.
Mix up the paprika, the remaining herbs, the garlic, the salt and the oil to make a thick paste. Spread over the surface of the meat, and leave it in the fridge, ideally overnight.
Preheat the oven to 200C/400C/Gas 6. Season the meat and sear on all sides in a heavy pan. Place in the oven for fifteen minutes.
Rest the meat before serving with lemon wedges.
