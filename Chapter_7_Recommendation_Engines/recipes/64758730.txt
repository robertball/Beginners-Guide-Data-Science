Ingredients:
1 can pumpkin puree
1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 - 1 grated carrot

Directions:
In a large bowl, add pumpkin and 1/2 cup or flour at a time.  Mix with spoon.  Add grated carrot.  Drop in small spoonfuls on to baking pan and flatten.  Bake at 350 for about 20 minutes.
You may substitute pumpkin with mashed banana or mashed cooked carrot.  I am sure other great ingredients would work too.  Get creative!
