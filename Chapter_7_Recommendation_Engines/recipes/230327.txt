Ingredients:
1 (5 1/2 pound) boneless leg of lamb, tied in netting
20 cloves garlic, or more to taste
garlic powder, or to taste
10 fresh rosemary sprigs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Cut 20 deep slits evenly spaced around the leg of lamb without cutting the netting. Stuff a garlic clove into each slit. Rub garlic powder over the lamb. Slice rosemary sprigs under netting evenly around the lamb. Place lamb into a roasting pan.
Roast in preheated oven until reddish-pink and juicy in the center for medium-rare, about 2-2 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Cover in aluminum foil; rest meat until thermometer reads 135 degrees F (57 degrees C) before carving.
