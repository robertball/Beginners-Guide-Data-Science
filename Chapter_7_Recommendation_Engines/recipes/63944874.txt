Ingredients:
2 sleeves stale saltines
water
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
3 Tbs shortening
1/2 cup maple syrup

Directions:
Place saltines in large bowl and cover with water.  Let stand 5 to minutes.  When saltines are soggy, squeeze out water by hand.  Combine (squeezed and drained) saltines, egg and vanilla and stir well with a fork.
In large skillet, melt shortening over medium-high heat.  When hot, drop spoonfuls of cracker mixture into skillet, shaping into 5-inch pancake.  Fry until brown and crispy on each side (about 3 minutes).  Add more shortening as needed.
Serve hot with maple syrup.

Description: 
According to grandma, back in the depression nothing went to waste. This was a way to use up stale crackers, because kids forgot to wrap them back up.  Don't skimp on the shortening to lighten them up.  A generous amount makes them nice and crispy.
