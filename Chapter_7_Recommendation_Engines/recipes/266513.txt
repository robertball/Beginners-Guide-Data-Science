Description: 
Save some money using garden-grown basil and almonds in place of pricey pine nuts. This recipe is easy, fast, and very tasty. Summer on a plate! Serve over warm pasta with a side salad and a nice loaf of bread. I also spread this on toast. If you have left over, put in a small jar and drizzle some olive oil over the top. Keep refrigerated.
