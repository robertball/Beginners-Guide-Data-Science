Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
5/8 cup unsweetened cocoa
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and cocoa. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the sour cream, water and vanilla.  Beat in the flour mixture just until incorporated. Stir in chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. When cake is cool, sift confectioners' sugar over the top.
