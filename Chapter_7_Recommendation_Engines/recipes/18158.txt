Ingredients:
1 pound pasta
1 pound lean ground beef
1 (32 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 1/4 cups Italian-style stewed tomatoes
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and reserve.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large skillet, brown the beef until no longer pink; drain off grease. Add spaghetti sauce, mushrooms, and tomatoes to beef and simmer for 10 minutes or until warmed through.
In a 9x13 inch baking dish, pour in beef and tomato mixture and add pasta; mix well. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until the cheese starts to bubble; serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a delicious pasta dish that is very easy to make.  I like to use spiral noodles, but this recipe can be made with any shaped pasta.  Serve with a salad and warm bread if desired.
