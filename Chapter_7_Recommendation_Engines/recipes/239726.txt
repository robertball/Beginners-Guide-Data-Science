Ingredients:
3 cups whole wheat flour
1/4 cup wheat bran (such as Bob's Red MillÂ®)
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 cups dark brown sugar
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
3 eggs
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
2 cups shredded zucchini

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4-inch loaf pans.
Mix flour, wheat bran, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer using the whisk attachment. Beat brown sugar, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; fold in zucchini. Pour zucchini mixture into flour mixture and mix well; pour into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a loaf comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool bread in pans on a wire rack for 20 minutes; remove bread from pans and completely cool.

Description: 
Mom's original recipe is great, but I wanted something I could a) feel a bit better about feeding my 2-year-old, and b) feel better about eating half a loaf of every day. This is my spin. The best thing about it: take out the zucchini and add something you like instead.
