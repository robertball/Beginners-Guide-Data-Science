Title:
Make-ahead Pie Crust Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
6 cups all purpose flour
2 tsp. salt
2 and 1/3 cups shortening

Directions:
Whisk the flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl.
Cut in half of the shortening with a pastry blender. Aim for large, course chunks at this point - if you end up with evenly pea-sized chunks you overdid it.
Cut in the remaining shortening. Crumb size will be uneven, which is fine, that's what we want. Place in airtight container and store in the refrigerator until ready to use. Some people even store it in the freezer. You will get enough crust mixture for several pies.
I have successfully stored this for several months in the refrigerator in a gallon size FREEZER ZipLoc bag.
TO USE: 2T of ice cold water to 1 c of the mix. Add water a little at a time - it may take a bit more, it may take a bit less.
Stir gently and quickly. Dough should be soft and not dry. Add a little more flour if too wet, or a little more water if dry.
Form the dough into a ball (or 2 balls if doing a double crust, one slightly larger than the other) and put in the refrigerator to chill while you prepare the filling and preheat the oven.
Use 2c of this mix for a single 9" pie crust, 3 c for a lattice crust, and 4c for a double crust (9").
