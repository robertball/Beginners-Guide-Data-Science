Ingredients:
2 Gala Apples
1 Large lemon or 2 medium lemons
5 oz. of blanched slivered almonds
1 Tbsp. Sugar
3/4 cup dried Craisins
1 scallion
3/4 cup grated feta cheese
pinch of salt

Directions:
If you cannot buy pre-grated feta cheese grate it now.
In a saucepan on a medium high heat, add the almonds. Do not use raw almonds as it will affect the taste. Stir or toss periodically to prevent burning. Remove from the heat when lightly toasted.
Place the craisins in a 1 cup measure and fill up with water. Stick in the microwave oven for 2-3 minutes.
Mix the lemon and sugar in a bowl. Set aside.
Wash the apples and remove any tags. Using a knife, cut large pieces off around the core, and dispose of the core. Cut into 1/4" chunks. As you dice the apple, roll it in the lemon juice and sugar mixture to avoid browning.
Finely SLICE, do not chop, the scallion with a sharp knife.
Remove the craisins from the microwave and drain off the liquid.
Add the other ingredients to the apples. Blend all by gently turning a few times with a wooden spoon. Chill for at least 30 minutes and serve.
