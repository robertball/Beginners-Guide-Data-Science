Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package strawberry cake mix
1 (5.1 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 cup sour cream
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1/2 cup warm water
1 (16 ounce) container prepared strawberry frosting, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan such as a Bundt(R) pan.
Combine the cake mix and pudding mix in a bowl. Thoroughly whisk together the sour cream, vegetable oil, eggs, water, and 1/4 cup frosting in a separate bowl, then stir into the cake and pudding mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared tube pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Frost the cooled cake with the remaining strawberry frosting.
