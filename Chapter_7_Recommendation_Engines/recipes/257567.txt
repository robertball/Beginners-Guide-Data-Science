1 1/2 cups baking mix (such as BisquickÂ®)
1/2 cup skim milk
1 egg

1 tablespoon lemon juice, or more to taste
1 tablespoon light cream cheese, softened

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Mix baking mix, skim milk, egg, raspberries, honey, lemon juice, and cream cheese in a bowl to make a slightly thick batter. Let stand for 5 minutes.
Spread 1/4 cup batter in the preheated waffle iron. Cook until browned and the iron stops steaming, 3 to 6 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
Excellent waffles that are quick and easy and delicious. These are so great with nothing on them, but you could top with low-fat whipped cream, ricotta cheese, vanilla glaze, powdered sugar, or good old maple syrup.
