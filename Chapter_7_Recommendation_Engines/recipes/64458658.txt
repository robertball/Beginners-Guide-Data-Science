Description: 
Because our favorite store-bought vanilla ice cream was removed from the stores for several months due to factory problems, I started experimenting with different homemade recipes. This hybrid ended our experimentation and is our family favorite for flavor and consistency. Note: adding heavy whipping cream, as opposed to only using whole milk, produced the best texture in ice cream stored overnight in the deep freeze.
