Ingredients:
5 lbs mussels
2 tbsp butter
2 shallots, finely diced
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1/2 cup dry vermouth
1 tsp concentrated chicken bouillon

Directions:
Wash mussels well in cold water. Remove any beards. Discard any mussels that do not close tight when washed or tapped on a hard surface.
In a large lidded saucepan melt the butter over medium high heat.
Add garlic and shallots and cook for 2 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients.
Cover with lid. Shake pan occasionally while cooking to ensure even cooking.  Mussels are done when shells open completely, about 8-12 min.

Description: 
Fresh mussels are delicious when cooked in a shallot vermouth sauce. Make sure to serve with some crusty bread to mop up the sauce.
