Ingredients:
1 1/2 (4 ounce) Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bars, divided
1/4 cup heavy cream
Cooking spray
1 stick unsalted butter
3 eggs
3 egg yolks
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup cake flour
Fresh raspberries
Whipped cream, or to taste

Directions:
To make centers, melt 2 ounces of chocolate (1/2 a baking bar) and cream in double boiler. Whisk gently to blend. Refrigerate about 2 hours, or until firm.
Form into 6 balls; refrigerate until needed.
To make cake, heat oven to 400 degrees F.
Spray six 4-ounce ramekins or custard cups with cooking spray.
Melt 4 ounces of chocolate (1 baking bar) and butter in double boiler; whisk gently to blend.
With an electric mixer, whisk eggs, yolks, sugar, and vanilla on high speed about 5 minutes, or until thick and light. Fold melted chocolate mixture and flour into egg mixture until just combined.
Spoon cake batter into ramekins. Place a chocolate ball in the middle of each ramekin.
Bake about 15 minutes, or until cakes are firm to the touch. Let cool for about 5 minutes.
Run a small, sharp knife around inside of each ramekin. Place a plate on top, invert, and remove ramekin. Garnish with raspberries and a dollop of whipped cream.
