Ingredients:
1/8 c. Almond Flour
1/8 c. Coconut Flour
1/4 c. Gluten Free All Purpose Flour
1/4 tsp. Guar Gum
2 tsp. Honey (or agave, if you are vegan)
1/4 c. + 1 tbsp. Coconut Milk
1 egg
Oil for frying
Optional:
1/2 c. Powder Sugar, to finish
OR
1/2 c. Cinnamon Sugar, to finish

Directions:
Heat oil to 280-300 degrees (F).
Mix all ingredients with a hand blender until just combined.  The mix will resemble thick pancake batter.
Drop by rounded teaspoon full into hot oil and cook for 3-5 minutes, depending on altitude and batter consistency.  Look for a golden to dark brown outside.
Roll in sugar and enjoy!

Description: 
I had so much trouble finding GF donuts that I had to play around in the kitchen to make one myself.  The consistency is light, airy, and resembles a yeast donut.  Enjoy!
