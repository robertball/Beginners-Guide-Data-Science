Ingredients:
3 cups water
3 cups uncooked instant rice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
2 carrots, peeled and very thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, undrained
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, undrained
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon lime juice
1 teaspoon chili powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup shredded Colby cheese

Directions:
Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a saucepan; stir in rice. Cover and remove from heat; let stand until water is absorbed, at least 5 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add onion, carrots, and garlic. Cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes.
Mix black beans, pinto beans, corn, cumin, lime juice, chili powder, salt, and pepper into the skillet. Reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, about 15 minutes. Serve bean mixture over rice; top with shredded Colby cheese.

Description: 
This is a simple yummy recipe I made for my husband and 2-year-old. Neither one cares for tomatoes, but they could easily be added to the recipe. This recipe is mild for the kids but can be kicked up with more spice. It's also good for families on a budget! Garnish each serving with fresh or dried cilantro.
