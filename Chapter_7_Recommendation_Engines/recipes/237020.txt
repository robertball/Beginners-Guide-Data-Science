Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
4 (4 ounce) lean boneless pork loin chops
3/4 teaspoon table salt, divided
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 small red onions, thinly sliced
12 dried apricot halves, sliced, divided
3/4 cup pineapple juice
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 cinnamon stick
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
Season pork chops evenly with 1/4 teaspoon salt and black pepper; cook in the hot skillet until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a plate, retaining drippings in the skillet.
Heat remaining teaspoon olive oil in the retained drippings; add onions and season with remaining salt. Saute onions until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Spread about half the cooked onions and half the sliced apricots into the bottom of a slow cooker crock. Lay pork chops atop the onion and apricots. Layer remaining onion and apricots over the pork chops; add pineapple juice, ginger, thyme, and cinnamon stick.
Cook on Low until the pork is fork-tender, 6 to 8 hours (or on High for 3 to 4 hours). Remove and discard cinnamon stick. Sprinkle cilantro over the mixture.
