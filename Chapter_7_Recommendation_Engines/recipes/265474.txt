Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
Dressing:
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic creme (reduced balsamic vinegar)
1 clove clove garlic, grated
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
4 tomatoes, cubed
2 (8 ounce) balls fresh mozzarella cheese, cubed
4 ounces sun-dried tomatoes, quartered
1 (6 ounce) can pitted Kalamata olives, halved
1 (5 ounce) package arugula
2 tablespoons freshly shaved Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and place into a bowl.
Meanwhile, combine olive oil, balsamic creme, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl.
Combine cooked spaghetti, tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and olives in a bowl. Pour olive oil dressing on top and mix well. Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours.
Mix in arugula right before serving and season with more olive oil, balsamic creme, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle with shaved Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This Italian-inspired spaghetti salad is one of my go-to recipes for any potluck. Just make sure to not mix in the arugula until right before serving. Leftovers can go in your lunch box.
