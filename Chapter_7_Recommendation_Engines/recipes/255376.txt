Description: 
Add persimmons, who'd-a-thought? Mom made this chili tonight with what she had in the house and it was phenomenal. I had to share. It was a perfect blend of sweet and spicy, warming us up right before the holidays. This fast and easy recipe is definitely one to consider when you are overloaded with all the persimmons someone brought into the office to share. It's simple, and I'm telling you it's amazing.
