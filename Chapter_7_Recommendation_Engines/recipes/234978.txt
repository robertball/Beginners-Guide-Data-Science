Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 McIntosh apples, peeled and coarsely chopped, or more to taste
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease or line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
Beat sugar and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth, about 2 minutes. Beat eggs and vanilla extract into sugar mixture until smooth, about 1 minute.
Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; beat into sugar mixture until batter is just combined. Fold apples and walnuts into batter; spoon into muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
Delicious, moist apple muffins with an unusual taste. Since they are very moist, these muffins require about 4 minutes more than standard for baking muffins. If you like them, you could add 1/2 cup raisins.
