Ingredients:
1 pkg (6 oz.)  Stuffing Mix for Chicken
1 doz egg s
3 Tbsp Real Bacon Bits
1/2 cup Shredded Colby & Monterey Jack Cheeses (or your cheese of choice)

Directions:
Heat oven to 400ÂºF.
Prepare stuffing as directed on package, omitting the stand time. Add the cheese. Press 1/4 cup stuffing onto bottom and up side of each of 12 muffin cups sprayed with cooking spray, forming 1/4-inch rim around top of cup. Place muffin pan on baking sheet.
Add 1 egg to each cup; top with bacon.
Bake 20 min. or until whites are firm and yolks are cooked to desired doneness. Let stand 5 min. before serving. Run knife around edges of muffin cups to make it easier to remove the baked stuffing cups from pan.
Prepare recipe as directed; cool completely. Refrigerate until ready to serve. To reheat, wrap 2 muffins in waxed paper; microwave on HIGH 15 sec. or just until warmed. Repeat with additional muffins as needed.
If you don't like hard yolks, make a "scrambled" version where you scrambled the eggs and mixed the cheese and bacon in together along with a bit of sour cream and poured into the cup
