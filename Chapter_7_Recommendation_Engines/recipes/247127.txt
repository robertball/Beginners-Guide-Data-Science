Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) box rigatoni pasta
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 red onion, chopped
3 cloves fresh garlic, minced
1 garlic scape, minced
3 large heirloom tomatoes, stemmed
1 sweet pepper, chopped
1 cup chopped broccoli
3 baby bella mushrooms, chopped, or more to taste
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 teaspoon white sugar
8 fresh basil leaves
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 dash ground cinnamon
salt to taste
1 (8 ounce) package soy chicken strips (such as Morningstar FarmsÂ®)
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add red onion, garlic, and garlic scape; cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Squeeze tomatoes into the pot. Add sweet pepper, broccoli, and baby bella mushrooms. Simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
Stir tomato paste, white sugar, basil, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, and salt into the pot. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook until broccoli is tender. Add chicken strips; simmer sauce for 20 minutes.
Stir rigatoni into sauce. Mix in Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, and feta cheese.
