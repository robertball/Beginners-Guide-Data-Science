3 cups fresh blueberries
1 cup organic cane sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 box cinnamon muffin mix (such as Betty Crocker Cinnamon Toast Crunch muffins)
3/4 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.  Spray a 13x9 inch baking dish with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, combine berries, sugar, and cornstarch.  Spoon into the baking dish.  Bake 15 minutes or until hot and bubbly.
In the meantime, in a medium bowl, stir muffin mix, milk, oil, and eggs until just blended.  Spoon over hot filling.  Sprinkle with streusal topping.
Bake another 25 minutes or until filling is bubbly and a toothpick inserted in the crust comes out clean.  Serve warm.
