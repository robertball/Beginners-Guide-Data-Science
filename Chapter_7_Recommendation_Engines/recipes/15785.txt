Ingredients:
Pastry Dough:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/8 cups unsalted butter
4 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Apple Filling:
4 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and chopped
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
4 ounces apricot jam (if using jam, use less sugar) (optional)

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together flour, 1 1/4 cups sugar, and salt. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Mix in eggs and vanilla extract until dough forms a ball. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour but not more than 1 day.
While the dough is chilling, prepare the apple filling.
In a medium bowl, toss diced apples with sugar and cinnamon. Mix in walnuts.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 16 3-inch tart pans. Remove tart dough from the refrigerator and let it stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before rolling out.
Knead dough briefly on a lightly floured surface. Cut into 16 equal portions. Roll each portion into a 6-inch circle, and carefully fit one circle into each tart pan.
Spoon an equal amount of apple mixture into each tart pan. Fold pastry over filling. Place filled tarts on a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Melt apricot jam and brush over finished tarts, if desired.
