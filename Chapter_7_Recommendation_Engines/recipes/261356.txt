Ingredients:
4 cups water
2 cups uncooked white rice
6 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 cup raw peanuts
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
4 green chile peppers, chopped
1/4 cup lemon juice
15 fresh curry leaves (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add peanuts, turmeric, and mustard seeds; cook and stir until peanuts are browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in green chile peppers, lemon juice, curry leaves, and salt.
Fold lemon juice mixture into the cooked rice.

Description: 
Rice lightly flavored with lemon. This is a favorite Indian dish. It is especially popular with children (compare to American mac and cheese.) It is very simple to make. Our family often eats it on Sunday nights after church. I put the rice in the rice cooker and then when we get home I do the rest of the cooking. It takes about 10 minutes total. Serve with hard-boiled eggs.
