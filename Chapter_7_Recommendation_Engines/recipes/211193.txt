Ingredients:
5 cups peeled, cored, and sliced tart apples
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the apples into an ungreased 7x11-inch baking dish and sprinkle them with the sugar and cinnamon. Stir to combine thoroughly.
In a bowl, mix together the brown sugar, flour, and softened butter until well combined; sprinkle over the apples.
Bake in the preheated oven for until the apples are bubbling and the topping is lightly browned, 45 to 60 minutes. Serve hot.

Description: 
The simplest apple crisp recipe proves that less is more when it comes to apples. I grew up with this recipe and it never fails to impress. If you have small casserole dishes, you can make individual serving sizes for the kids. I prefer the slightly tart Haralson apple for this recipe. Top with half-and-half, whipped cream, or ice cream.
