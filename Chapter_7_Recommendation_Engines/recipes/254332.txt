Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
1 pound ground beef
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch garlic powder (optional)
2 (10.75 ounce) cans cream of mushroom soup
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/2 cup milk, plus more to taste
1 (11 ounce) can diced carrots

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large dish.
Season ground beef with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add seasoned beef; cook and stir until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add cream of mushroom soup, cream cheese, and milk; cook and stir until cream cheese melts and mixture is saucy, about 6 minutes.
Pour mixture over noodles. Add carrots; stir until evenly combined.
