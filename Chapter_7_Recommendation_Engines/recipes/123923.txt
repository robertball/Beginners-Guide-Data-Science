Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees F)
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups butter
3 egg yolks, lightly beaten
1/4 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
confectioners' sugar
NUT FILLING:
3 egg whites
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 cups ground walnuts
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in water; set aside. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in butter with pastry blender or hands. Add egg yolks, sour cream and vanilla and yeast mixture. Mix well with hands (dough will not be sticky). For filling, beat egg whites until very stiff but not dry. Gradually add sugar and continue beating until stiff. Fold in walnuts and vanilla. Divide dough into eight parts. On a pastry cloth heavily covered with confectioners' sugar, roll one part into a 12-in.-diameter circle. Cut into 12 wedges. Spread 1 teaspoon filling on each wedge; tuck in edges of wide end and roll up toward narrow point. Repeat with remaining dough and filling, replenishing confectioners' sugar on pastry cloth to prevent sticking. Place on parchment paper-line baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until very light brown.

Description: 
My mother shared this recipe with me over 30 years ago. Nut horns are especially nice for buffets because they are easy to pick up and eat with your fingers. They also freeze well.
