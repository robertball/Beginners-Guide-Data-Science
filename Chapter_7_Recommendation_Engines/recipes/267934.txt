Ingredients:
4 1/2 pounds apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
1 lemon, juiced
1 1/8 cups unsalted butter
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla sugar
5 eggs
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a deep baking pan with butter or line with parchment paper.
Toss apple slices with lemon juice in a bowl and set aside.
Combine butter, sugar, and vanilla sugar in a large bowl and beat using an electric blender until pale and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, and mix well after each addition. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl and mix on low speed. Fold apple slices into the batter.
Spread batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
