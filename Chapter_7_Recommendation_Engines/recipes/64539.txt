Ingredients:
1 (28 ounce) can baked beans
2 (16 ounce) packages hot dogs, sliced
1 (7.5 ounce) package corn bread mix

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pour the can of beans into a 9x13 inch baking dish so they cover the bottom. Arrange hot dog slices so they cover the beans as completely as possible. If too much juice seeps through to the cornbread, it will take longer to cook. Prepare cornbread mix according to package directions. Spread the batter evenly over the hot dog layer.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until cornbread is cooked through. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.
