Ingredients:
1 (15.5 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and mashed
8 fresh basil leaves, chopped
1/4 cup oat bran
1/4 cup quick cooking oats
1 cup cooked brown rice
1 (14 ounce) package firm tofu
5 tablespoons Korean barbeque sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon dried sage
2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the mashed garbanzo beans and basil. Mix in the oat bran, quick oats, and rice; the mixture should seem a little dry.
In a separate bowl, mash the tofu with your hands, trying to squeeze out as much of the water as possible. Drain of the water, and repeat the process until there is hardly any water worth pouring off. It is not necessary to remove all of the water. Pour the barbeque sauce over the tofu, and stir to coat.
Stir the tofu into the garbanzo beans and oats. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and sage; mix until well blended.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Form patties out of the bean mixture, and fry them in hot oil for about 5 minutes per side. Serve as you would burgers.

Description: 
Use soy. No, use beans. No, use oats. No, use rice. Hey, why not use them all? This veggie burger is an alternative to eating its beefy cousin (and can be used together). It's high in fiber and as a stand alone patty, actually tastes pretty good. Once you layer the ketchup, the mustard, pickles, etc. you won't be able to tell the difference.
