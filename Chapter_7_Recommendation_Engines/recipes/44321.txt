1 (9 ounce) package frozen cut green beans
1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
1/4 cup water

Place the green beans in a medium saucepan, and mix in the garlic, water, and lemon juice. Cover, and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes, until tender but crisp. Drain, and transfer to a medium bowl.
