Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning, or to taste
olive oil
butter
1 lemon, thinly sliced
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
2 garlic cloves minced
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Season the tilapia fillets with salt, pepper and Cajun seasoning on both sides. Arrange the seasoned fillets in a single layer in the baking dish, drizzle w/olive oil and put afew pats of butter on top of fillets. Place a layer of lemon slices over the fish fillets. I usually use about 2 slices on each piece so that it covers most of the surface of the fish.
Bake uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
While the fish is baking, mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream, garlic, lemon juice and dill in a small bowl. Serve with tilapia.
