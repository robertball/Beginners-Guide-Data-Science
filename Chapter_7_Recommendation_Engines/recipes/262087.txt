2 1/2 cups blanched almond flour
1/4 cup agave syrup
2 tablespoons coconut butter, melted

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine almond flour, agave syrup, melted coconut butter, vanilla extract, baking powder, and salt in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until a soft dough forms. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out cookies with a cookie cutter; transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly golden, 12 to 14 minutes.
