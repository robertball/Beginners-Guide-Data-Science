Ingredients:
2 pounds red potatoes, cut into bite-size pieces
1 serving olive oil cooking spray
1/2 pound frozen French-style green beans, thawed
1 cup chopped red onion
4 cloves minced garlic
1/2 cup reduced-fat balsamic vinaigrette dressing
1 cup jarred roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
1 (8 ounce) package goat cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Place potatoes in a large bowl.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; grease with cooking spray. Cook and stir the green beans and onion until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute more.
Transfer the green bean mixture into the large bowl with the potatoes. Add the balsamic vinaigrette, roasted red peppers, and basil; toss lightly. Stir in the goat cheese.
