1 pound okra, finely chopped
1 cup finely chopped onion
1 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup water
1 egg
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Heat 1 inch of oil in a large skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix together the okra, onion, salt, pepper, water and egg. Combine the flour, baking powder and cornmeal; and stir that into the okra mixture.
Carefully drop spoonfuls of the okra batter into the hot oil, and fry on each side until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon, and drain on paper towels.
