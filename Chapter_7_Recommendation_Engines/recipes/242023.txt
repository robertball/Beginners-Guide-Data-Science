Ingredients:
1 cup almond milk
1 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups grated carrots
3/4 cup chopped pineapple, drained
3/4 cup raisins
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
3/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons molasses
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line muffin cups with paper liners.
Whisk almond milk and vinegar together in a small bowl; set aside until curdled, about 10 minutes.
Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl. Combine carrots, pineapple, raisins, and walnuts together in a separate bowl.
Whisk 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar, olive oil, molasses, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and cardamom together in a separate bowl. Mix curdled milk mixture and sugar mixture into flour mixture just until batter is mixed; fold in carrot mixture. Spoon batter into muffin cups until each is completely filled and domed.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
