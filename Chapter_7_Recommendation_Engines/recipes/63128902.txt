This recipe is SUPER easy and sooo good! It is very versatile and can be used multiple ways. Serve by itself as soup. Roll it up in tortillas with cheese on top and bake for a few minutes for delicious enchiladas. Mix with cheese and fill a tortilla and grill for tasty quesadillas. Serve it over rice. Or even mix with rice and stuff some bell peppers, top with cheese and bake until peppers are soft.
