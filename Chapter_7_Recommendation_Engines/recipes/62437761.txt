Ingredients:
1 cup All-purpose Flour
2 teaspoons Baking Powder
1/4 teaspoons Salt
7 Tablespoons Cocoa Powder, Divided
1-1/4 cup Sugar, Divided
1/2 cup Milk
1/2 cup Melted Butter
1-1/2 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
1/2 cups Light Brown Sugar, Packed
1-1/4 cup Hot Tap Water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
First stir together the flour, baking powder, salt, 3 tablespoons of the cocoa, and 3/4 cup of the white sugar. Reserve the remaining cocoa and sugar.
Stir in the milk, melted butter, and vanilla to the flour mixture. Mix until smooth.
Pour the mixture into an ungreased 8x8 baking dish.
In a separate small bowl, mix the remaining white sugar (it should be 1/2 cup), the brown sugar, and remaining 4 tablespoons of cocoa. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the batter.
Pour the hot tap water over all. DO NOT STIR!
Bake for 40 minutes or until the center is set.
Let stand for a five minutes if you can hold yourself back. Serve with homemade ice cream using the gooey sauce to spoon over all.
