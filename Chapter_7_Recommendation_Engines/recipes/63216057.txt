Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2 eggs
2 medium onion, finely diced
6 bacon strips, cooked crispy and crumbled
1 cup crushed saltines
4 teaspoons salt
3 pounds lean ground beef
1 pound ground pork
1 cup grape juice
1 cup apple jelly
1 cup ketchup
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Crumble beef and pork over mixture and mix well. Shape into 1-1/2-in. balls. Place in 2 greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dishes. Bake at 350 degrees for approximately an hour to an hour and 30 minutes, or until meatball taken from the middle of the pan is no longer pink inside. You can cool meatballs at this point and freeze them if necessary.
In a small saucepan, combine the juice, jelly, ketchup and tomato sauce. Cook and stir over medium heat until jelly is melted; remove from the heat.
Transfer meatballs to a serving dish, coat meatballs in the sauce and serve.
