Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
In a large bowl, blend butter and sugar until creamy.  Add egg and beat well.
In another bowl, stir together flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt; gradually add to butter mixture.  Add vanilla and blend thoroughly. Stir in the optional raisins.
Form dough into ball, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill until firm, about 1 hour.
Roll out dough on well-floured board to 1/4 inch thickness.  Cut with cookie cutters (2 1/2 inches in diameter) and place 1 inch apart on lightly greased cookie sheet.
Bake in 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 10-12 minutes or until edges are golden.  Store in airtight container.
