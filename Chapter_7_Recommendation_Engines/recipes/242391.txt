Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups white sugar
2 cups grated yellow squash
1 cup vegetable oil
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
1 cup chopped nuts (optional)
3 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
Mix flour, sugar, squash, oil, pineapple, nuts, eggs, vanilla extract, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl; pour into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool bread for 10 minutes in pan before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

This recipe is great for finding a use for all of the yellow squash that comes from the garden in the summer. It has an amazing sweet flavor! I got it from a good friend's mother.
