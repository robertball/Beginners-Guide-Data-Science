Description: 
This is what you call a wickedly delicious, vegetarian spaghetti sauce which tastes like a bolognaise but is really soybeans.  I also use this sauce with jacket potatoes (and if I'm really feeling naughty, add a bit of shredded mozzarella cheese on top), rice or even, 'cause it's so thick, just on its own.   For optimum flavor use dried soya, if available.
