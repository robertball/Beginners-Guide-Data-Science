Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 slices Swiss cheese
4 slices cooked ham
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Coat a 7x11 inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
Pound chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness.
Sprinkle each piece of chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.  Place 1 cheese slice and 1 ham slice on top of each breast. Roll up each breast, and secure with a toothpick.  Dip rolled up chicken in egg, and roll in breadcrumbs. Place in baking dish, and sprinkle chicken evenly with bread crumbs.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink. Remove from oven, and place 1/2 cheese slice on top of each breast.  Return to oven for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese has melted. Remove toothpicks, and serve immediately.
