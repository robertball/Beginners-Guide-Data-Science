Ingredients:
2 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon gluten-free baking powder
1 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
2 cups pitted and chopped fresh cherries (including any juice from chopping)
Streusel Topping:
1/4 cup gluten-free rolled oats
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Mix flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl. Whisk milk, vegetable oil, egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract together in a separate bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; pour in milk mixture. Stir until batter is just blended and slightly lumpy; gently fold in cherries and cherry juice. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full with batter.
Mix oats, brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and butter together in a bowl until crumbly; sprinkle oat mixture over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is an amazing gluten-free muffin recipe that can be adapted to almost any fresh berry or chopped fruit. The streusel topping sinks into the muffin as it bakes, giving it a lovely cobbler effect. Living gluten-free doesn't mean deprivation! Enjoy!
