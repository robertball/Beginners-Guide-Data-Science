Description: 
This super-easy breakfast casserole is actually good. You can make it the night before and keep the sausage/hash brown mixture separate from the egg mixture, then pour it over top right before it goes into the oven. You might need to cook it a little longer if its cold from the fridge. This is also great if you add a little onion.
