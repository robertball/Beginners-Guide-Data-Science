Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups diced butternut squash
1/4 cup finely diced onion
1 clove crushed garlic
1/2 cup diced ham
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup chicken stock
fresh parsley
fresh sage (optional)
1/4 cup parmesan
salt and pepper
1/2 package Catelli Smart Pasta spaghetti (approx. 200 g)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
Place diced butternut squash on parchment paper lined baking pan in a single layer.
Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and lightly season with salt and pepper.
Roast in the oven for 15 minutes or until squash just begins to brown but is still al dente.
Meanwhile, boil liberally salted water in a large pot and cook spaghetti for 8-10 minutes.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, saute ham with the onion, olive oil and butter until onion begins to caramelize.
Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds.
Add butternut squash and chicken stock.
Turn heat down to low, cover and simmer for a few minutes until squash is fully cooked.
Add heavy cream, parsley, sage and spaghetti.
If sauce has become too thick, add pasta water to thin it out.
Season to taste.
Top with parmesan just before serving.
