Ingredients:
3 cups Fresh or Frozen Vegetable of your Choice, washed and cubed
Water
Zip seal bags, sandwich size

Directions:
Be sure that your work surface is clean and sanitized. Wash hands thoroughly with soap. Place prepared vegetable in steaming basket.  Add 2 inches of water to pot and place steaming basket with lid on top of pot.  Place over medium heat until vegetables are tender (about 10 minutes depending on vegetable you choose).
Dump steamed vegetables into food processor and puree until almost smooth, scraping sides of food processor periodically.
Add 1/4 cup of the water from bottom of pot to the vegetables and puree until smooth.  Repeat this step until desired consistency is achieved.
Using a 1/3 or 1/2 Cup measuring cup (depending on your child's appetite), scoop one scoop of baby food into each zip seal bag. Be sure to get out excess air before sealing bags. Place sticky label on each bag stating contents and date. Flatten food in bags and store in freezer until ready to use. Thaw by running under water, placing in fridge for a day, or in microwave.
