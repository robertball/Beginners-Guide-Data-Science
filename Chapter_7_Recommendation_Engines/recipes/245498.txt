Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups chopped leeks, white and light green parts only
1/3 cup white wine
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 teaspoon hot Madras curry powder, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 pound monkfish fillets, cut into cubes

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in leeks, white wine, lemon juice, cumin, Madras curry powder, turmeric, paprika, coriander, ginger, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Cover pot and reduce heat to medium-low, stirring frequently until all liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Uncover pot, stir in coconut milk, and reduce heat to low; simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.
Place monkfish gently into pot; spoon leek mixture over monkfish. Cook and stir gently over low heat until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Monkfish has become my favorite fish. Its delicate flavor is complemented by the combination of leeks and carefully chosen spices. The amount of curry could be modified to your own taste. This dish could be served over rice, with mashed potatoes, or with fingerling potatoes.
