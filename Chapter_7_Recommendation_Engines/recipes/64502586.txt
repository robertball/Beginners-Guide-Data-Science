Ingredients:
2 cups apples, peeled, cored and sliced
1 cup peaches, peeled, pitted and sliced
1 cup pears, peeled, cored and sliced
1 cup plums, pitted and sliced
1 cup sugar
3 tbsp all purpose flour (use 4 tbsp if fruit is very juicy)
1/2 tsp cinnamon
pinch freshly grated nutmeg
1 tsp grated fresh ginger
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 pastry recipe for double crust pie

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Fit the bottom crust in a 9” pie plate.
Combine sugar, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg in a small bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the mixture over the pastry in the pie plate.
Combine the prepared fruit and grated fresh ginger in a bowl. Sprinkle with the lemon juice and stir to distribute. Place the fruit mixture in the pie plate, and sprinkle the remaining sugar mixture evenly over the fruit. Cover with the top pie crust, seal the edges, and cut slits in the pastry to vent the steam. Alternately, cover with a lattice top.
Bake at 425°F for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350°F and continue baking for another 35 to 45 minutes, until crust is golden and the filling has thickened.
Cool completely before serving.

Description: 
Apples, peaches, pears and plums; tell me when your birthday comes! How many times did I play this skipping game as a child, and never thought to combine those fruits until now. It's such a fresh-tasting combination of flavours. Great on its own, or enjoy a slice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.
