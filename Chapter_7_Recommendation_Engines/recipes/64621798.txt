Ingredients:
3 cups sugar
1/4 Teaspoons Salt
1/2 Cup Cocoa
1 Cup Milk
2 Tablespoons Light Corn Syrup
3 Tablespoons butter
1 Teaspoon Vanilla

Directions:
Combine sugar, salt, cocoa, milk and corn syrup in a large saucepan.
Cook until the sugar dissolves, stirring all the time.
Then cook and stir only a few times until the mixture reaches 234 degrees.
Remove from heat and add butter and vanilla, but don't stir while hot.
Let it cool to 110 degrees.
Beat cooled fudge steadily but not fast, when it loses its shiny look and thickens test it.
If a bit of fudge dropped from a spoon holds its shape it is done.
Pour into a pan but do not scrape the sides of the pan.
Cover and refrigerate until firm around 2 hours.
Enjoy
