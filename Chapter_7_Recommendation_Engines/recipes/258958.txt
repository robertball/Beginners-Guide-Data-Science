One Skillet Cheesy Hamburger and Egg Noodle Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1/2 cup sour cream
4 ounces processed cheese (such as VelveetaÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef, seasoning with salt and pepper, until no longer pink in the center, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain; reserve drippings in the skillet.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Pour chicken broth, chicken soup, sour cream, cheese, rosemary, and thyme into the skillet. Cook and stir, seasoning with salt and pepper, until well combined and the cheese is melted, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Stir in the egg noodles and ground beef; cook until evenly mixed, 3 to 5 minutes.

Easy to make, delicious hamburger recipe. The egg noodles instead of the traditional pasta make for a tastier substitute.
