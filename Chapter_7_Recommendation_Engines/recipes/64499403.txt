Ingredients:
8 ounces Neufchatel cheese, room temperature
1 red bell pepper, finely diced
1 jalapeno, seeded, finely diced
3  sun dried tomatoes, finely diced
1 small can black olives, finely dice
1 carrots ,finely dice
15 ounce can corn, drained
1 packet ranch seasoning

Directions:
Mix  everything into a medium bowl and  stir together. As the vegetables start to release a little of their water, the mixture will come together much easier. Continue stirring until well combined.
Serve immediately or store in the fridge, covered, for up to 24 hours. The longer the dip sets, the more water the vegetables will release.
Serve with woven wheat crackers (Triscuits) or pita chips.

Description: 
This dip is full of crunchy bell peppers, corn, jalapenos, and black olives. You could add in some black beans, if you swing that way.  Raw green beans? Maybe some celery! If it’s crunchy, it’d probably be delicious in this dip
