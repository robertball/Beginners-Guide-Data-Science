Title:
Eggs & Apples Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 T. Butter
2 Firm Tart Apples
1 T. Sugar
1-1/2 tsp. Cinnamon
3 Extra Large Eggs
1 T. Flour
1/2 Cup Light Cream
1/4 tsp. Salt

Directions:
Peel apples and slice thinly.
In an oven safe pan, melt butter on stove top over medium heat and add apples. Stir in sugar and cinnamon. Cover pan & reduce heat to low; allow to simmer until apples are done but still hold shape.
In a separate bowl, whip flour and sale into cream, add and whip in eggs. Pour over apples in pan. Stir gently, cover again & continue cooking until mixture is set on the bottom--about 5 min.
Put into 300 degree oven uncovered until eggs are set, about 10 mins.
Serve in pie-shaped wedges. (Note: if scaling the recipe up, the cooking times also increase. Treat like a quiche, it's done when a knife comes out clean.)

Description: 
A savory breakfast dish that tastes like Apple Pie with a light fluffiness from the eggs. I know it sounds funny, but trust me : ) I thought the same thing when I heard the title, but now it's my favorite. I love to to surprise people with this special breakfast treat!
