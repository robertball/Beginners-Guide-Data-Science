Ingredients:
1 lb fish remains
1 1/2 quarts of water
1/4 onion
2 to 3 fresh bay leaves
1 slice of lemon

Directions:
Put the fish in a deep stewing pan with water, onion, bay leave and lemon.
Simmer for 25 minutes or until the fish is tender, then remove from heat.
Discard the lemon, bay leaves and onion.
Lift out the fish with a slotted spoon and set aside for serving in pasta or with a tomato sauce.
Strain the stock through a fine seive or colander.
Use as directed for your main dish, or pour into containers or freezer bags to freeze.

Description: 
The Venetians like to use eel for this recipe, and it is very good indeed. But I think that catfish can be used just as well. In fact, any fish remains such as the tails, head and bones can be used for stock.
