Curly Chicken Recipe

Ingredients:
8 oz. dry egg noodles
1/4 c. olive oil
1/2 c. grated onion ( I grate it directly into skillet so as to get the juice, too.)
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 c. cooked chicken, cubed
1 tsp. cayenne pepper
2 c. chicken broth
1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut to 1 inch pieces
2 c. broccoli florets
3/4 c. homemade cream style soup mix~~see footnote for this
1/4 c. grated parmasean cheese
Add salt and pepper to your tastes. I only salt the water I boil my pasta in.

Directions:
In large pan, fill with enough water to cover noodles. Bring water to a boil. Adding salt to the water is optional, but I do it. It's the only opportunity to give the pasta some flavor.
Add noodles.
Boil til noodles are al dente (should still have a bite to them)
While waiting on the pasta...In a large skillet over low heat, add olive oil.
Grate onion directly over skillet into the oil.
Add in your garlic and saute til onion is soft. About 5-8 minutes.
Add chicken...if using raw chicken, cook til no longer pink.
Add cayenne pepper, chicken broth, asparagus and broccoli.
Cover and simmer til veggies are tender. About 8-10 minutes.
Add the soup mix and stir to combine. You may need to raise the heat a little, but not much.
Now add in your al dente egg noodles and stir. Cook a few minutes more.
Sauce will thicken and some will be absorbed by the pasta.
Lastly, grate the parmasean cheese over top and serve!
