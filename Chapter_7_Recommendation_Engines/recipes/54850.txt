Description: 
This scrumptious and hearty soup is perfect for those short on time or reluctant to tackle cumbersome fresh pumpkin and garlic prep. It makes a wonderfully satisfying and surprising meal for fall and winter dinner guests. I serve this delectable soup with crusty bread and grilled vegetables; it would also complement a roast.
