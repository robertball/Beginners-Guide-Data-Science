Ingredients:
1 package yeast
1/4 cup water
1 cup cottage cheese
2 tablespoons of sugar
1 tablespoon instant minced onion
1 tablespoon butter
2 teaspoons dill seed
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 egg
2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups flour

Directions:
To soften the yeast, combine the water, cottage cheese, and yeast in a small saucepan over the stove. Heat until warm. (Do not get it too hot or the yeast will die).
Put the cottage cheese mixture in a bowl. Add onion, butter, dill seed, salt, sugar, baking soda, and egg. Mix. Gradually add flour to form a stiff dough.
Cover and let stand in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size. Punch down the dough.
Turn the dough into a greased and floured casserole dish or bread pan and let rise for another 30 to 40 minutes.
Bake for 40-50 minutes at 350 degrees. When the bread comes out of the oven, brush it with butter and sprinkle with salt.

Description: 
A uniquely flavored bread that is a treasured family tradition. It isn't a holiday unless there is Dilly Bread on the table. It's best fresh out of the oven, but it also makes great toast!
