Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large onion, sliced thin
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
10 sprigs fresh cilantro, stems and leaves separated and minced
2 green chile peppers, sliced into thin rings
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 tomato, chopped
2 potatoes, peeled, halved, and sliced
1 large head cauliflower, cut into small florets
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
salt to taste
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons tomato puree

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion, garlic, and ginger in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir the cilantro stems, green chiles, and turmeric into the mixture. Mix the tomato into the mixture and continue cooking until the tomatoes are softened. Add the potatoes; cook and stir until the potatoes are completely coated in the mixture. Fold the cauliflower florets into the mixture; season with the cumin, coriander, garam masala, ground red pepper, sugar, and salt. Pour the water over the mixture and stir until evenly mixed.
Bring the mixture to a boil; cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the potatoes and cauliflower are tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Taste for desired seasoning. If you feel the sabji is not tart enough, add the tomato puree. Garnish with the cilantro leaves to serve.

Description: 
This is a very classic Punjabi sabji. I have eaten aloo gobhi in many homes and restaurants, and like most homey dishes, I have never eaten two versions that taste the same. This is my recipe for making aloo gobhi.
