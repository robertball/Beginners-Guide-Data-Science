1/4 c sugar
1 tsp salt
1/3 c powdered milk
3 c flour

In bread machine pan add the milk, egg, salt, sugar and butter.

Start the machine on dough setting. Remove the dough from the bread machine when completed. Divide the dough in half, covering the unused half with a moist towel in a bowl.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to 1/8-inch thickness (or a little thicker). With a sharp knife cut the dough into 2 1/2-inch squares. Can let the squares rise a little.
Meanwhile preheat the oil to 350 degrees F. Cook the beignets in small batches, frying on first side for 2 mins than turn over and fry the other side.
Remove from the hot oil and drain on paper lined tray and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve warm with Cafe Au Lait.
