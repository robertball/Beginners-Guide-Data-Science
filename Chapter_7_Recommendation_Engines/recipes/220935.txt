Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
7 tablespoons warm milk
1/4 cup olive oil
1 orange, juice and zest
2 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter.
Mix flour, sugar, milk, olive oil, orange juice, orange zest, eggs, baking powder, vanilla extract, and nutmeg in a large bowl until batter is well combined.
Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool before serving.

Description: 
This is a traditional Italian cake made during Carnivale AND Easter. Some call it a 'Spongy Orange Cake' but we think the texture is between that and a regular cake. It is by far my husband's favorite cake of all time. I've topped it with Avon's Warm Orange Sauce which takes this dump-and-mix cake from GREAT to SPECTACULAR!
