Ingredients:
1 or 2 box of Chicken stock

2 large yellow onions, sliced long Julian-style
6+ Roma tomatoes, seeded, roughly chopped (add more if you want more)
Add a "large sprinkle covering top of soup" with: Oregano, pepper flakes, cayenne. (fresh or dry) ..about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon
Add jar of line juice (best if can replace with fresh lime about 7-9 depending on how juicy they are and your desired lime flavor.)
Add 4-5 cups of pre-cooked chicken (yeah Costco!)

Directions:
Cook over medium heat for about 30-40 minutes (want the onions to be still al-dente so they keep their shape and crunch)
Garnish with monetary jack or pepper jack cheese
crushed chips
torn up cilantro
sprinkle little cayenne to add red look
