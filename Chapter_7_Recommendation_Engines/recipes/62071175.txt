Ingredients:
1 box german chocolate cake mix
1 jar caramel sundae topping
1 can sweetened condensed milk
Whipped cream for topping (optional)

Directions:
Prepare cake and bake as directed.  Heat caramel sauce in the microwave as soon as you take the cake out of the oven.  With a skewer, poke holes through top of the hot cake.  Pour caramel sauce and evaporated milk over cake, making sure to cover evenly; the cake will absorb the sauces.  Allow cake to cool completely and, if desired, top with homemade or store bought whipped cream.  Enjoy!
BTW: This cake is even BETTER after sitting in the fridge over night :)

Description: 
Amazing cake recipe from my mother-in-law that my entire family loves; it is the birthday request for everyone!  The corner pieces are the favorites in this dish because the caramel and sweetened condensed milk collect there!  Top with homemade whipped cream for an added treat.
