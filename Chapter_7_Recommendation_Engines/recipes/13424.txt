Ingredients:
1 large, meaty ham hock
4 slices bacon, diced
3 onions, chopped
3 carrots, diced
1 small head cabbage, shredded
3 tablespoons chili powder
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) package 15 bean mixture, soaked overnight
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the ham hock in a 5 to 6 quart slow cooker, and fill half way full with water. Set to High.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the bacon for a few minutes, then add onions, carrots, and cabbage. Cook, stirring frequently for about 5 minutes. Stir in chili powder and garlic; cook for 2 more minutes. Transfer the mixture to the slow cooker, and add beans, tomatoes, and sage.
Cover, and cook 2 hours on High. Reduce heat to Low, and cook for 6 to 7 hours, or until beans are tender. Transfer ham hock to a cutting board, remove meat from bone, and return meat to slow cooker.  Season with salt and fresh ground pepper to taste.
