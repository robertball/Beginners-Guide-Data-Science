Ingredients:
2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup seasoned bread crumbs
2 eggs
6-8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin with 'tails' sliced off and used for some other recipe. ;)
oil for deep frying

Directions:
Prepare each breast by slicing off the 'tails' and setting aside for some other 'diced chicken' recipe.  Pound breasts to 1/2 inch thickness. Sprinkle with garlic powder on both sides of breasts.
Beat eggs, and put bread crumbs in a seperate dish/plate.  Dip each breast in egg and then dredge in crumbs until evenly coated. I refridgerated overnight, layering the breaded chicken breasts in a cassarole dish with left over bread crumbs in between and on top.
Fry chicken in the deep frier  until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, place each piece as it's done (if your deep frier is too small to cook multiple pieces) and place on a cooling rack set on a cookie sheet in the oven set at 300 degrees to keep warm while the rest fry.
Enjoy.

Description: 
I love Italian Bread Crumbs for chicken frying. And admitidly, I used a deep frier to cook each breast up, so it would cook up evenly. It turned out fabulous and took as much time as the normal two batches in a skillet takes, with less standing there and babysitting. I simply put the cooked pieces in the oven to keep warm.Modified from: Garlic Chicken Fried Chicken
