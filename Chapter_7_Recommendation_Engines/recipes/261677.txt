Ingredients:
Pizza Dough:
3 cups spelt flour
6 1/2 tablespoons spelt flour
1 tablespoon instant yeast
1 teaspoon salt
olive oil, divided, or as needed
1 cup lukewarm water
Pizza Sauce:
1/2 onion, finely diced
3 cups tomato puree
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil, or to taste
1 2/3 (16 ounce) packages mozzarella cheese, shredded
salt to taste
olive oil, divided, or as needed

Directions:
Sift 3 cups plus 6 1/2 tablespoons flour, yeast, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil into a bowl with lukewarm water; mix into the dough at a steady rate, kneading with your hands until elastic.
Transfer dough to a bowl lightly greased with 1 1/2 teaspoons oil and cover with a towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.
Punch down dough; cover again and let rise, 30 to 45 minutes more.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomato puree and garlic; toss in basil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until simmering, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until flavors blend, about 15 minutes more. Reduce heat to low.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets with remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil.
Roll each dough half into a pizza crust, pinching up the edges of the dough if you like. Spoon sauce generously onto the pizzas, covering them completely. Divide mozzarella cheese between the pizzas.
Bake in the preheated oven, enjoying the romance of a secluded kitchen together, until mozzarella cheese is melted golden brown and the bottom of the pizza is browned, 10 to 20 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes before enjoying together.
