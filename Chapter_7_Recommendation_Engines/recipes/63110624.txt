Ingredients:
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg (Next time, I will boost this to ¼ or ½ teaspoon)
¼ teaspoon cinnamon (Next time, I will change to ½ teaspoon)
½ teaspoon sugar
½ teaspoon salt
Orange zest from one orange
5 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter
½ cup plus 2 tablespoons buttermilk
Freshly squeezed orange juice from 1 ½ oranges (just over ¼ of a cup)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450°F.
In large bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, sugar, salt, and orange zest.
Cut butter into small pieces (no bigger than the size of a pea) and combine with flour ingredients.
Add buttermilk and orange juice and stir with wooden spoon until combined. Knead about 1 minute with floury hands.
Plop clumps of dough with your hands onto parchment-lined baking sheet (I prefer my biscuits imperfect and clumpy in appearance, but others prefer to flatten the dough into ½ inch heigh and use a cookie cutter or cup to cut perfect circles – a matter of personal preference).
Bake until just lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Serve with honey to drizzle inside.

Description: 
These biscuits are fantastic; the orange flavor popped, but next time we might try adding even a little bit more nutmeg and cinnamon to try to get their spiciness to shine through as well
