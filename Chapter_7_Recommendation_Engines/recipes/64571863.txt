Ingredients:
1 Tbsp olive oil
8  skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 3 lb.)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1  small onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 Tbsp tomato paste
2  15-oz. cans chickpeas, rinsed
¼ cup harissa paste
½ cup  chicken broth
¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
Lemon wedges, for serving

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425°. Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Working in 2 batches, cook until browned, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to a plate.
Pour off all but 1 Tbsp drippings from pan. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until beginning to darken, about 1 minute. Add chickpeas, harissa, and broth; bring to a simmer.
Nestle chicken, skin side up, in chickpeas; transfer skillet to oven. Roast until chicken is cooked through, 20–25 minutes. Top with parsley and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.

Description: 
Harissa is a great shortcut ingredient to flavor, but no two jars (or tubes) are the same. Taste first—if it seems very spicy, use a bit less. You can always stir more into the chickpeas when the dish is finished.
