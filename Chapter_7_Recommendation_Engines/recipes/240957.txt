Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1 sweet onion, chopped
1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes

1 portobello mushroom, chopped
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 (16 ounce) package rigatoni pasta
1 (8 ounce) package fresh mozzarella cheese, cubed, or to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and fresh basil and bring to a simmer.
Heat remaining olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir eggplant, mushroom, and red bell pepper until softened, about 10 minutes. Add tomato mixture to eggplant mixture and simmer for 30 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain.
