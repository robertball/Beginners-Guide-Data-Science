Ingredients:
4 ounces unsalted butter, softened
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 cups powdered sugar
3 heaping tablespoons of Strawberry Jam or Preserves
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat together the butter and cream cheese with an electric mixer. With the mixer on low speed, add the powdered sugar a cup at a time until smooth and creamy. Beat in the vanilla extract and the jam.

Frugal Dusky
Description: 
This foolproof frosting keeps it simple. While very sweet, it's just the thing to balance the natural flavor of a homestyle scratch cake recipe. I used it the first time to lighten up a cake made with a heavy whole grain white flour. Uh-mazing!
