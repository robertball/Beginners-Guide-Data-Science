Description: 
I have taken the liberty of doubling this recipe because I have yet to meet a single person who didn't rave about the taste, eat too much of it, and then beg for the recipe! Now I am giving it to the world so I won't have to make it anymore. I think I have made it over 500 times...seriously. Serve hot with sturdy crackers.
