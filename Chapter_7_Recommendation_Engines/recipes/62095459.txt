Ingredients:
4 lbs ground beef
1 24 ounce Maull's bbq sauce
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped green pepper

Directions:
Cook beef in large skillet over medium-high heat until no longer pink. Add onions and peppers, stirring frequently for five minutes.  Drain grease.  Press down on beef with a fork so that you get pebble size pieces.  Transfer the meat mixture to your crockpot.  Add Maull's bbq sauce. Stir.  Cover and cook on low for 2-4 hours, depending on when the party starts.
Serve on buns.
(Depending on how you like your sloppy joes, you can add more bbq sauce if you really like them sloppy.)
