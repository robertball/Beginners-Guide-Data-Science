Ingredients:
Crust:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tbs. sugar
¾ cup cold butter
2 egg yolks, lightly beaten
¼ cup cold milk
Filling:
1 can (14 oz.) sweetened condensed milk
1 tsp. maple flavoring
½ tsp. ground cinnamon
¼ tsp. salt
2/3 cup coarsely chopped pecans
2/3 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
2/3 cup sliced almonds
1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
For crust, in a bowl, combine flour and sugar. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine egg yolks and milk; stir into flour mixture until blended. With lightly floured hands, press dough onto the bottom and 1-in. up the sides of a 12-in. tart pan with removable bottom. Line unpricked shell with a double thickness of aluminum foil. Place pan on a large baking sheet. Bake at 375 for 12-15 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Meanwhile, for filling, combine milk, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir in nuts. Pour into baked shell. Return to oven and bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire rack. When the tart has cooled completely, melt chocolate chips. Drizzle tart with melted chocolate. Refrigerate until chocolate has hardened and filling is firm.
