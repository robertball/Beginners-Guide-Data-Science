Ingredients:
6 large eggs
1 cup mayonaise
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3 teaspoons dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon white vinegar
1/4 cup celery, very finely chopped
1/4 cup red onion, very finely chopped
paprika, for garnish

Directions:
Boil eggs in a pot with cold water for ten minutes. Drain water and let eggs cool in the fridge on ice for fifteen minutes.
Mix mayonaise, garlic powder, dijon mustard, white vinegar, celery and onion in seperate bowl.
Take eggs out of the fridge and peel shells off. Slice eggs in halves vertically and carefully remove yolks.
Add yolks into bowl and mash together into mix. Stir, making sure the filling has a thick and creamy consistency.
Arrange egg whites onto a decorative platter as desired. Place filling into a plastic ziplock bag, use scissors to cut the corner and use as a pastry bag to disperse filling into the egg whites.
Sprinkle paprika over each egg for garnish. Allow eggs to chill in the fridge for another 20 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
