Description: 
This recipe was taken from The Evening Sun news article on Wednesday, June 17, 1992. One of my earliest and fondest childhood memories was baking this cake with my Oma in her kitchen. It has become a tradition in my family to whip up this recipe for any special occasion. I hope it will become one for your family as well!
