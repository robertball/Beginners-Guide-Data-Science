Ingredients:
14 ounces chicken wings
1 tablespoon sake (Japanese rice wine)
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 ½ teaspoons sesame oil
1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger root
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon dashi (Japanese seasoning)
2 cups vegetable oil for frying
3 tablespoons cornstarch
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken wings, sake, garlic, sesame oil, ginger, dashi, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to marinate, at least 1 hour.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place cornstarch in a shallow bowl. Dip marinated chicken wings in cornstarch and coat both sides.
Fry chicken wings until crispy brown and crunchy on the outside and no longer pink at the bone, 10 to 15 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt and black pepper before serving.
