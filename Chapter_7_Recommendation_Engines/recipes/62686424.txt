Ingredients:
1-2 1/2 LB. TO 3LB FRYER(CHICKEN) CUT INTO EIGHTS
3 EGGS SLIGHTLY BEATEN

IN A LARGE BOWL MIX THE WET INGREDIENTS TOGETHER/IN ANOTHER BOWL MIX ALL DRY INGREDIENTS TOGETHER.FIRST PLACE ALL THE CHICKEN IN THE WET INGREDIENTS. COVER AND CHILL FOR AT LEAST 2 HOURS UP TO 24 HOURS. FILL A FRYING PAN WITH THE PEANUT OIL(MAKES VERY CRISPY CRUST)
ABOUT HALF WAY. MAKE SURE NOT MORE THAN THAT OR THE OIL COULD SPILL OVER ON THE STOVE AND CAUSE A FIRE.DRAIN THE WET MIXTURE FROM THE CHICKEN AND COAT THE CHICKEN WITH CRUMB MIXTURE. HEAT THE OIL TO 365. WHEN THE OIL IS THIS HOT IT WILL NOT MAKE YOUR CHICKEN GREASY. PLACE CHICKEN PIECES IN HOT OIL MAKE SURE NOT TO CROWD THE PAN OR CHICKEN WILL STEAM INSTEAD OF FRY. COOK ABOUT 7-8 MINUTES ON EACH SIDE.PLACE CHICKEN ON A WIRE RACK THAT IS ON A BAKING SHEET. KEEP WARM IN THE OVEN UNTIL ALL PIECES ARE COOKED. THE RACK WILL KEEP YOUR CHICKEN CRISPY. ENJOY.

Description: 
I GOT THIS IDEA FOR SOME REALLY GOOD FRIED CHICKEN AFTER GOING TO OUR LOCAL FRIED CHICKEN RESTAURANT AND CAME HOME WITH BLAND, SOGGY FRIED CHICKEN. FOR  THE BEST RESULTS EAT THIS CHICKEN WITHIN 15 MINUTES AFTER IT COMES OT OF THE FRYER.IT WILL BE AT IT'S YUMMIEST. REMEMBER TO CLEAN THE CHICKEN BEFORE STARTING THIS DISH MAKING SURE TO CUT AWAY ANY EXCESS FAT.
TO GET THE MOST TENDER AND JUICIEST CHICKEN I USE HOT SAUCE AND EGGS TO SOAK THE CHICKEN.
