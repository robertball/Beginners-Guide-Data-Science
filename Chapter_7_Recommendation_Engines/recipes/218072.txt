Ingredients:
1 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon roasted red chili paste
6 (1-inch thick) pork chops

Directions:
Place the soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, cumin, and chili paste in a large, heavy plastic zipper bag. Smush the bag a few times with your fingers to mix all the ingredients thoroughly and dissolve the brown sugar; place the pork chops into the marinade, and seal the bag. Allow to marinate for 30 to 45 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Remove the pork chops from the marinade, and discard the marinade. Shake off excess marinade, and grill the pork chops until browned, the meat is no longer pink inside, and the chops show good grill marks, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This is one of my favorite marinades to use for grilled pork chops.  I usually just throw ingredients as I see fit, so the measurements are estimates.  The roasted red chili paste can be found in the Asian section of your grocery store.
