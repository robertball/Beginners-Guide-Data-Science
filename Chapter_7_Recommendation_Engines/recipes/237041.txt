Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 onion, minced
3 large cloves garlic, minced
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 (8 ounce) package fresh sugar snap peas
5 slices American cheese, or more to taste
1 1/2 cups frozen diced southern-style hash brown potatoes, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer ground beef mixture, using a slotted spoon, to a 2-quart casserole dish; retain drippings in the skillet.
Spread cream of mushroom soup over ground beef mixture.
Cook and stir mushrooms in the beef drippings over medium heat until tender and browned, 5 to 10 minutes; spread over soup layer in casserole dish.
Arrange snap peas over mushroom layer; cover with American cheese slices. Layer potatoes over cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and potatoes are browned and crisp, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a twist on Tater TotÂ® hot dish. This is an easy recipe to personalize. You can use any ground meat or a mixture of beef and pork. I often use smoked Gouda cheese, Havarti cheese, and I bet Swiss cheese would be good, too. The vegetable can be easily switched to any vegetable you like (string beans, broccoli, or mixed veggies). I would use fresh or frozen rather than canned if you can.
