Ingredients:
1 stick of margarine or butter
1/2 cup water
1 1/4 cup white granulated sugar
1 cup of milk
1 cup of self-rising flour, unsifted
1 can (21 oz) fruit pie filling of your choice

Directions:
In a 2 qt casserole dish, combine 1 stick of margarine, water, and only 1/2 cup sugar. Cook in microwave on high for 20 seconds or until margarine is melted. Remove from microwave and whisk until smooth.
In a separate bowl, combine milk, flour, and remaining sugar. Pour directly into the middle of the casserole dish that contains the butter mixture. DO NOT MIX OR STIR!
Pour fruit pie filling directly into the middle of the casserole dish. DO NOT MIX OR STIR! The dough mixture will rise as the cobbler cooks. This creates a distinct layer, leaving the fruit on the bottom of the dish.
Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for 40 minutes or until golden brown. As an added treat, dollop with whip cream or serve with vanilla ice cream.

Description: 
Believe it or not, I inherited this recipe from my dad. I've only seen him in the kitchen a handful of times in my life, but this is one recipe he does well. I've had other fruit cobblers where the bread part wasn't fluffy enough or the fruit part wasn't creamy enough. This recipe is easy, but don't let it fool you. It's the best I've ever tried and I am constantly being asked for the recipe. Whether you're going to a company lunch or family gathering, this is a dish that's sure to please!
