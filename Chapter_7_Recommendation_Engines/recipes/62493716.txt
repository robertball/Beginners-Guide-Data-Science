Ingredients:
1/2 cup softened butter
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 cup canned solid pack pumpkin
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)
1/3 all-purpose flour
1/3 cup brown  sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup cold butter
1/4 t. salt

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Beat 1/2 cup butter, 1/3 cup sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract together until blended. Mix in 1 cup flour until no longer dry. Press into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove and allow to cool for a few minutes. Reduce the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk together 1/3 cup flour, the baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Beat the eggs, brown sugar, pumpkin, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and the pecans together in a bowl until the pumpkin is smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until just incorporated and spread the batter over the parbaked crust.
Place 1 cup flour, 1/3 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup of cold butter into a bowl. Press the butter into the flour using a pastry blender or fork until no pieces of butter remain and the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle evenly over the pumpkin batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely in the pan. Cut into bars before serving.
Serve with fresh whipped cream (not the kind from a can!) whip with a T. of confectionary sugar, instant coffee grinds (just a pinch) and 1 t. vanilla.
