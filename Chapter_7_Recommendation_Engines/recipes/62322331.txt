* 4 pounds yautía
* 6 green bananas
* 1 tablespoon of salt

* 40 banana leaves (cut into approx. 10 in X 5 in rectangles)
* 20 Pieces parchment paper (cut into approx. 8 in X 4 in rectangles)
* 20 Pieces of kitchen string (Cut into 18 inch. lengths)

Directions:
PART 1 - MAKE THE STUFFING
1. Brown the pork pieces in a pan.
2. Add the rest of the stuffing ingredients.
3. Cook until the pork is no longer pink inside.
4. Set aside and let cool.
PART 2 - MAKE THE MASA DOUGH
1. In a large bowl, peel and grate the yautía and the green bananas together.
2. Stir in the salt and enough achiote oil to moisten the dough and add a little color. You are now ready to assemble and wrap the pasteles.
PART 3 - WRAP THE PASTELES
1. Set the dough aside and prepare a work surface to assemble and wrap the pasteles. If you have friends helping you, set up an assembly line.
2. Follow my step-by-step guide to assembling and wrapping pasteles as follows  Cut a piece of parchment paper about 10 inches by 5 inches.
Cut two pieces of banana leaf about 8 inches by 4 inches.
Lay the parchment paper on a flat work surface, so that it looks like a horizontal rectangle.
Place one of the cut banana leafs in the center of the parchment paper.
Brush a few drops of achiote oil onto the center of the banana leaf. This adds color and flavor while preventing the masa (dough) from sticking.
Place about 1 1/2 to 2 spoon fulls of masa onto the oil in the center of the banana leaf.Flatten and spread out the dough evenly, but do not go over the edge of the leaf. Place one spoon full of meat filling in the center of the dough.
Place another spoonful of masa (dough) on top of the meat filling. see footnotes for rest of wrapping directions.
3. Set aside the pasteles you are going to eat right away. You can freeze the rest.
PART 4 - COOK THE PASTELES
1.Bring a stock pot of salted water to a boil. There should be enough water to cover the pasteles.
2. Boil the pasteles for 1 hour.
3. Unwrap the pasteles before serving

Description: 
Making and serving pasteles at Christmas time is a Puerto Rican tradition. I grew up in a puerto rican household and loved these things. It's hard work, but well worth the effort. Get together a bunch of friends and make a day of it. Be sure to make enough for everyone to take home.
