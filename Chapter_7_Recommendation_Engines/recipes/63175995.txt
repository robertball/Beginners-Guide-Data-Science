Ingredients:
1 can of kidney beans, drained
1/4 lb bacon, cut into small pieces (feel free to use more, can never have enough bacon!)
1 lb hamburger (beef, not turkey, veal or lamb but beef!)
1 medium onion, chopped
1 LARGE can of Campbell's Pork and Beans. (THE very large can, not the normal sized can). Don't drain!
1 can of Pinto Beans, drained
1/2 c brown sugar
1/2 c ketchup (normal ketchup, not the salt free kind)
2 t/l white vinegar
1/2 salt

Directions:
Brown the bacon pieces, hamburger and chopped onion together. Drain when cooked.
Combine in a separate bowl the brown sugar, ketchup, white vinegar and the salt.  This is the sauce.
Combine the sauce with the meat mixture and mix very well.
Bake at 350 for about an hour, uncovered. Best to back in an actual bean crock or a tall glass baking dish. Don't bake in a shallow dish or they will dry out quickly in the oven.
