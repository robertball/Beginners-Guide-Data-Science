Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 kiwi, pureed
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons Mexican vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup toasted oat cereal (such as Cheerios Â®), smashed
2 cups milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets.
Cream together the butter, kiwi, brown sugar and white sugar in a large bowl, until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla extract. Combine flour, baking soda, and toasted oat cereal in a bowl; gradually stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until light brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
These cookies are amazing but I wanted to add some grains and cut the fat. By adding some cheerios and kiwi puree I have done just that. They taste great and have vitamins and antioxidants.
