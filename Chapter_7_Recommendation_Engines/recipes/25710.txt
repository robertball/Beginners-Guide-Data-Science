Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon seasoned salt
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons water
1 cup white wine
1 cup chicken broth
2 teaspoons chopped Italian herbs

Directions:
Season chicken breasts with salt, pepper and seasoned salt. In a small bowl, combine flour and water and mix until no lumps remain and the mixture is completely smooth.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add chicken and brown for 3 to 4 minutes each side. Remove chicken to a plate or platter.
Deglaze skillet with wine and broth and bring to simmer over medium low heat. When simmering, add herbs; whisk in flour mixture. Return to simmer, reduce heat to low and return chicken to skillet with juices.
Cover skillet and simmer gently for 20 to 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through (no longer pink inside), turning frequently.

Description: 
This simple dish is very low fat, but so tasty your family will ask for it again and again.  Serve it over fettuccini or egg noodles as a easy meal.  I've also served it over herb seasoned rice and it was fantastic.
