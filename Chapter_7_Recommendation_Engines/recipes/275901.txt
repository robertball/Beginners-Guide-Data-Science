Ingredients:
Filling:
1 tablespoon avocado oil
5 cups diced celery
5 cups finely chopped mushrooms
1/2 medium onion, diced
3 pounds lean ground turkey
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried thyme
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 cup almond flour
1 (8 ounce) can low-sodium tomato sauce
2 medium zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch slices
Topping:
4 (10 ounce) packages frozen cauliflower rice (such as Green GiantÂ®)
1/3 cup milk
2 tablespoons butter, divided
1/2 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Heat avocado oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Add celery, mushrooms, and onion; saute until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Crumble turkey into the skillet. Add parsley, thyme, garlic powder, pepper, red pepper flakes, and salt. Cook until turkey is no longer pink and has absorbed most of the liquid in the skillet, about 15 minutes.
Sprinkle almond flour over the turkey mixture and cook for 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce until combined; cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish and top with sliced zucchini.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook cauliflower rice in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until hot, about 5 minutes. Set 1 cup aside in a large bowl. Transfer remaining cauliflower rice to a food processor with milk and 1 tablespoon butter; blend until smooth. Mix with reserved rice for added texture.
Spread cauliflower mixture over the meat and zucchini. Cut remaining 1 tablespoon butter into small pieces and dot over the cauliflower. Sprinkle with paprika.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cauliflower topping has a golden hue, 30 to 35 minutes.
