Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) container fat-free sour cream
1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced-fat cream of chicken soup
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
cooking spray (such as Pam(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as <sup>&reg;</sup>O*TEL(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 cup shredded cooked chicken, or more to taste
1 cup chopped onion (optional)
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles (optional)
8  flour tortillas
2 cups shredded Colby-pepperjack cheese, divided

Directions:
Mix sour cream, cream of chicken soup, and cilantro in a saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray; add tomatoes with green chile peppers, chicken, onion, and green chiles. Cook and stir mixture over medium heat until onion is transparent, 5 to 10 minutes.
Place tortillas on a microwave-safe plate; heat in the microwave until warm and flexible, about 10 seconds.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x11-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla; sprinkle filling with about 1 tablespoon Colby-pepperjack cheese. Roll each tortilla around the filling and place seam side down into the prepared baking dish. Top tortillas with sour cream sauce; sprinkle remaining cheese over sour cream layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and cheese is melted, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
I have been looking for a great restaurant-quality sour cream sauce enchilada recipe and was handed this one from a friend's grandma. It was exactly what I wanted and so simple to make! If you don't like really spicy foods, the optional items listed can be removed from the recipe and the dish is just as yummy!
