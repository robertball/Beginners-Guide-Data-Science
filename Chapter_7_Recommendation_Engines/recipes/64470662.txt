Ingredients:
Chicken:
1 & ½ lbs chicken breast, cut into 1-inch pieces
Salt and pepper
1 & ½ cups cornstarch
4 egg whites
¼ cup canola oil
Sauce:
1 {14 oz.} can coconut milk {I use full-fat}
¾ cup granulated sugar
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. apple cider vinegar

Directions:
1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Preheat oven to 325ºF.
2. Salt and pepper your chicken pieces.
3. Place the cornstarch and egg whites in separate bowls.
4. Once oil is heated, dip a chicken piece in cornstarch, then in egg white, and then fry until chicken is golden brown, but not cooked through - about 30 seconds on all sides. Repeat with all chicken pieces.
5.Remove chicken from pan and place on a plate lined with paper towels. Pat chicken with another paper towel to remove excess oil.
6. Place chicken in a single layer in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Set aside.
7. In a medium bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, sugar, salt, and vinegar, until the sugar and salt are dissolved.
8. Pour the sauce over the prepared chicken and stir gently.
9. Place chicken in the oven and bake, uncovered, for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.
10. Let stand for 5 minutes to let sauce thicken. Serve with rice and veggies.
