Ingredients:
2 cups water
1/3 cup sugar + 1/2 teaspoon
2 black tea bags
1/4 cup heavy cream
Pinch of lemon zest -or- 1 teaspoon peach syrup*

Directions:
In a small saucepan or microwave, heat 1 cup of the water to a brisk simmer. Turn off the heat, add the tea bags, then cover and steep for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk 1/3 cup of the sugar vigorously into the remaining 1 cup of cool water. (Preventing the sugar from coming in contact with super hot water keeps your tea from having a bitter taste). Once 10 minutes has elapsed, remove the tea bags (squeeze them gently), then pour the mixture over the sugar-water mixture, stirring to combine. Pour the entire thing into a shallow pan (I used an 8x8‚Äù square baking dish), and place it in the freezer. Freeze for 1 hour, then scrape the entire mixture with a fork to break up the ice crystals. Return to the freezer for another hour or two, or until it freezes almost solid.
Meanwhile, beat together the heavy cream, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon sugar and lemon zest. If you're making the peach cream, omit the 1/2 teaspoon of sugar and beat in the peach syrup. Once soft peaks form, store it in the fridge until ready to serve.
To serve the granita, scrape it again with a fork into serving dishes and top it with the whipped cream.
