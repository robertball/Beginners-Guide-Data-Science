Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
3 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup oil
2 tsp vanilla
2 cups grated zucchini
1 cup raisins
1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Soak raisins in hot water, set aside.
Grease and flour one 9x5" loaf pan, two 8x4" loaf pans, or one standard-sized muffin tin. If making muffins, grease and flour muffin cups or use muffin liners.
Sift or mix well the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg.
Beat eggs and sugar, oil and vanilla in a bowl and beat into to the flour mixture. Rinse and dry raisins and then coat in some flour before adding to above mixture.
Add raisins, zucchini and nuts and mix well. Pour into prepared pans and bake until toothpick inserted in centre comes out clean: 60 min for two 8x4" loaf pans, 80-90 min for one 9x5" loaf pan, 20 min for one standard sized 12-muffin tin.
Cool 15-20 min before removing from pan and transferring to cooling rack.

Description: 
This recipe has been passed down for generations and tweaking it always fails it, as nothing tops the original. Using seasonal, fresh zucchini gives it its edge.
