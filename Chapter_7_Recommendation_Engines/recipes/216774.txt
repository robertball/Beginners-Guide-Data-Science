Description: 
A not too sweet, super-moist, deep golden brown, dense banana bread with a crispy sugary crust right out of the oven. It is enjoyed at our home hot with butter, and eaten like cake with a fork.  The kids don't let it make it to Day 2, so if you love it like we do, get it while it's hot! You'll never make another banana bread recipe again!
