Ingredients:
1/4 teaspoon anise seed
1/8 teaspoon crushed dried mint
1 1/4 cups water, divided
3/4 teaspoon honey
3 strips lemon peel
3 tablespoons butter, melted
2 pounds salmon fillets

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small saucepan, stir together anise seeds and mint. Stir in 1 cup water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil 5 minutes, then stir in honey. Continue to boil until most of the water has boiled off. Remove from heat, and stir in remaining 1/4 cup water.
Place lemon strips in a bowl, and pour melted butter over the strips. Let sit 5 minutes.
Place salmon on baking sheet. Brush thoroughly with anise sauce.
Place in a preheated oven, and bake until done, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and brush liberally with lemon butter.

SKRIE
Description: 
Skrie doesn't mean anything, but this fish sure deserves a cool name. The recipe calls for anise seed, but the taste is not overpowering. Instead, it complements the lemon flavor.
