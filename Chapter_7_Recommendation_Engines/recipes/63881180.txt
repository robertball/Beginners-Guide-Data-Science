Ingredients:
1 - 1 1/2 lb. Pork Tenderloin
1 lb. Fresh Kale, chopped finely
1/2 Large Onion, diced
2 cloves of Garlic, chopped
1/2 tsp. Salt
1/2 tsp. Crushed Red Pepper
3/4 cup Chicken Stock
4 slices of Prosciutto
1 cup Shredded Mozzarella
1/2 cup Grated Parmesan
3 Tbsp. Olive Oil
1/2 tsp. Salt
1/2 tsp Black Pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
In a large saute skillet, heat 2 Tbsp of the olive oil. Add the onion and saute for 5 minutes. Add chopped garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Reduce the heat to low-medium and add the chopped kale. Once the kale begins to wilt, add 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of crush red pepper and chicken stock. Allow the liquid to reduce to almost nothing, approximately 10 minutes cooking time. Remove from heat and drain of any excess liquid and allow to cool.
Meanwhile, butterfly the tenderloin, cover with plastic wrap and pound it out to about 1/4 inch in thickness, give or take. Line the pork with the prosciutto. Lengthwise, on one side of the pork, spoon the kale. Top it with the shredded mozzarella and grated parmesan. Roll pork lengthwise tightly and secure with kitchen twine. Rub remaining olive oil (1 Tbsp) all over the pork and season with salt and pepper.
In a hot skillet, sear all sides of the pork. Place the tenderloin on a nonstick baking sheet and bake in oven for 45 minutes or internal temperature reads 155 degrees.
Remove from the oven, tent with aluminum foil and allow the tenderloin to rest for 20 minutes. Slice on a bias and serve.
