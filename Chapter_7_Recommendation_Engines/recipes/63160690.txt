1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmegs
1 1/4 cups toasted walnuts (I used shredded coconut instead, which was one of the options Bloom suggested as well)
1 cup raisins (I substituted chopped dried cherries)
Cream Cheese Frosting from Essential Baker: (I doubled this recipe to make sure I would have enough. Now I spread the leftovers on EVERYTHING!)
