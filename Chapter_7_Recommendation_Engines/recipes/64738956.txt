Ingredients:
1 cup berries or diced fruit, fresh or frozen
1/4-1/2 tsp dehydrated lemon juice powder, such as TrueLemon (or just use 0.5-1 tbsp of fresh lemon juice)
approximately 1 tbsp of maple syrup or honey (optional, to taste)
1/2 tsp lemon zest (optional, to taste)
1/8-1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract (optional, to taste)
1 tbsp chia seeds

Directions:
Heat fruit in a saucepan on low-medium until it starts to soften and release juices.  Continue stirring and mash down with a potato masher, if desired.
Add lemon powder/juice, maple syrup, lemon zest, and vanilla extract.  [For one cup of fresh blueberries, I used 1/2 tsp lemon juice powder, 1 tbsp maple syrup, no lemon zest, and 1/8 tsp vanilla extract - it wasn't super sweet and had a tart lemon flavor]
Continue cooking and stirring at a low simmer until reduced, about 5-10 minutes.
Add chia seeds and continue stirring for another minute.  Remove from heat, let cool, and refrigerate for a few hours so the seeds can soak and thicken the jam.  Keep refrigerated for 1-2 weeks.

Description: 
Easy jam and fast, and the chia seeds make it healthier.  Berries seem to work well - blueberries and strawberries work great.  Cherries work well too, but it's a little harder to mash up the skins.  Peaches were hard to mash up and the light color didn't look as nice with the darker chia seeds.  I like using the TrueLemon in it because I don't have to worry about having fresh lemons on hand and saves a step of cutting and juicing a lemon.
