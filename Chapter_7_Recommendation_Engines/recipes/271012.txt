Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/2 cups crushed graham crackers
1/3 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Cheesecake:
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup Irish cream liqueur (such as BaileysÂ®)
4 eggs
1 cup sour cream
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan and wrap the bottom in 2 layers of aluminum foil.
Mix graham crackers, melted butter, sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Add more butter if the mixture seems dry. Press mixture into the bottom of the prepared springform pan.
Mix cream cheese and sugar together in a large bowl until smooth. Blend in Irish cream liqueur. Add eggs 1 at a time. Mix in sour cream, flour, and vanilla extract until batter is smooth. Pour batter into crust. Place filled springform pan into a large, deep baking pan. Add 1 inch of very hot water to the outer pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn off oven and leave cake in the closed oven for 2 hours to cool completely. Chill in the refrigerator before serving, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a variation on other cheesecake recipes that I have found here and incorporates 'suggestions' from the comments sections. I wanted to consolidate it all into 1 recipe. I have had great comments on this version and personally I believe it is absolutely delish.
