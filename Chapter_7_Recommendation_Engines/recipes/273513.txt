Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon Greek seasoning
1 lemon, juiced
2 cloves garlic, finely grated or minced
1 pound boneless chicken breasts, quartered lengthwise
6 tablespoons tzatziki sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1 head romaine, trimmed, washed and torn into bite-sized pieces
1/2 cup thinly sliced red bell pepper
1/2 English cucumber, sliced
8 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved

Directions:
Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, Greek seasoning, lemon juice, and garlic in a glass bowl; mix well. Add chicken to marinade and turn to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, but not longer than 4 hours.
Mix tzatziki, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and salt in a small bowl. Refrigerate salad dressing until needed.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place chicken pieces on the grill and cook for 5 minutes, turn, and grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Combine romaine lettuce, bell pepper, cucumber, and cherry tomatoes in a salad bowl. Drizzle with tzatziki dressing and toss to coat. Divide salad into 4 equal portions and top with cooked chicken.
