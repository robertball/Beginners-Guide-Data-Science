Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups freshly squeezed lemon juice
6 eggs, beaten
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup freshly grated lemon zest

Directions:
Combine lemon juice, eggs, butter, sugar, and lemon zest in a 2-quart saucepan; cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until curd is thick and just beginning to boil, about 8 minutes.
Remove curd from heat and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally to keep the surface soft, about 30 minutes. Pour curd into clean jars, seal, and store in the refrigerator.
