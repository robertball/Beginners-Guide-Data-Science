Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 carrots, diced
1 onion, chopped
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 1/2 cups water
1 1/2 cups uncooked couscous
1/4 cup raisins

Directions:
Heat the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the carrots and onion until the carrots begin to soften and the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and water, and bring the mixture to a boil. Stir in the couscous, mixing well to avoid lumps, cover, and remove from the heat. Let the couscous stand covered until the water is absorbed, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the raisins, and serve hot.

Description: 
I make this when I need a quick side dish for chicken or pork. If you make couscous (a Middle Eastern pasta) a pantry staple, you usually have all the ingredients on hand! Add other veggies (zucchini, corn, peas, etc.) to make it your own.
