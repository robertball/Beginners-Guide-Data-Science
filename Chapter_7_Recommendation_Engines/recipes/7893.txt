Ingredients:
1 cup raisins
1 cup dried currants
1/3 cup diced candies mixed fruit peel
1/3 cup candied cherries, quartered
2 tablespoons grated orange zest
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
4 eggs
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 ounce ground almonds
1/2 cup whole almonds
1 tablespoon corn syrup

Directions:
Combine raisins, currants, mixed peel, cherries, and orange rind.  Dredge with 1/3 cup flour.
Cream butter or margarine and sugar until fluffy.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time until light.  Combine 1 2/3 cups flour, baking powder, and ground almonds; fold into batter mixture.  Mix in fruit.  Spread in foil lined 8 x 3 inch round pan.  If using a different size pan fill 3/4 full.
Bake at 325  degrees F (165 degrees C) for about 1 1/2 hours, until an inserted wooden pick comes out clean.  Remove cake from pan.
Toast almonds in 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Heat corn syrup, and brush over top surface of hot cake.  Place almonds in whatever design you like.  After cooling, cake will not be sticky.
