Ingredients:
1 (16 oz.) package elbow macaroni
1/2 cup butter
Salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 oz.) package shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (5 oz.) can evaporated milk (See note below)
2 eggs, well beaten
2 cups whole milk
1 (10.75 oz.) can Campbell's Nacho Cheese soup or Cheddar soup
1 (15 oz.) jar Salsa Con Queso (medium or hot), or to taste
Paprika as desired (optional)

Directions:
1.) Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2.) Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.
3.) Add butter to pasta and stir until melted; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle about 1/2 the Cheddar cheese over pasta and stir.
4.) Whisk evaporated milk and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture.
5.) Whisk milk and cheese soup together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture. Mix the Salsa Con Queso and remaining cheese into the pasta mixture.
6.)  Pour into a casserole dish; garnish with paprika if desired and bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes.

Description: 
My 'secret' ingredient in this dish is (Shhhh, anyone listening?)... Salsa Con Queso. It adds creaminess and a lot of flavor and zip. I use the medium heat type, but it can be kicked up a notch by using the hot.
