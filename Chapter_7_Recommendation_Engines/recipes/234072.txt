Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 chili moritas, or more to taste
1 large white onion, diced
5 carrots, peeled and diced
2 stalks celery, diced
2 cloves garlic
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons red curry paste, or to taste
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
1 large butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and diced
1 quart chicken stock
1 quart water
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2 bay leaves

Directions:
Heat a large heavy-bottom pot over medium-high heat; add olive oil. Cook and stir chili moritas in the hot oil until chili moritas are puffed and softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir onion, carrots, celery, garlic, salt, and pepper into chili moritas and cook until onion is translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir curry paste and paprika into chili-onion mixture until coated. Add butternut squash; cook and stir until squash is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour chicken stock, water, and coconut milk into squash mixture; add bay leaves. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until squash is softened, about 1 hour.
Pour squash mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.

Description: 
Love Thai flavors and I felt they would be a perfect match to play off the richness of a butternut squash soup. Curry, coconut, spicy are a wonderful to balance the richness of the squash. The first time I made it was kind of an accident. I was trying to make the traditional soup but when I tasted it lacked something. I looked to see how I could punch up the flavor. First I added the curry, I had some leftover red curry paste I made, added coconut milk and I felt I had something special. Like many soups and stews the flavor is better the following day. Enjoy!
