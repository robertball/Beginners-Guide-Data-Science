Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 packet Taco Seasoning
1 cup crushed Tortilla Chips
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (10.5 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the ground beef with the onion in the hot skillet until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes; drain any excess fat. Stir the black beans, chili powder, cumin, and salt to the beef mixture; cook and stir until hot, about 5 minutes. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish.  Mix the tomatoes with green chile peppers and cream of mushroom soup together in a bowl; spread over the tortillas. Top with the Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and the cheese is melted completely, 25 to 30 minutes. Arrange the tortillas atop the meal
