Shrimp and Marinade:
In a mixing bowl, mix together olive oil, parsley, lemon juice, hot sauce, garlic, ketchup, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Reserve a small amount for basting later. Pour remaining marinade into a large resealable plastic bag with shrimp. Seal, and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
Preheat grill for medium-low heat. Thread shrimp onto skewers, piercing once near the tail and once near the head. Discard marinade.
Lightly oil grill grate. Cook shrimp for 3 minutes per side, or until opaque, basting frequently with reserved marinade.
Peppers mixture:
In olive oil, cook bell peppers, real bacon bits, and onion; cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally; keep warm.
Grits:
Combine milk and broth in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, and stir in grits. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, and cook for 5 minutes or until thick, stirring occasionally. Stir in cheese and garlic salt.
Serve shrimp and peppers over grits.
