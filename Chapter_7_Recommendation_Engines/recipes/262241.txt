Ingredients:
1 quart whole milk
1/2 cup powdered milk
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons plain yogurt, at room temperature
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream, at room temperature (optional)
3/4 teaspoon maple flavored extract

Directions:
Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until it begins to bubble. Stir powdered milk and sugar into the hot milk until dissolved. Remove from heat and let  cool until an instant-read thermometer reads 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).
Place yogurt in a bowl and add a small amount of warmed milk mixture; combine thoroughly. Pour yogurt mixture back into the saucepan with warmed milk in a thin stream, stirring constantly, until thoroughly blended. Add heavy cream and maple flavoring. Stir well to combine.
Pour milk-cream mixture into 7 individual serving jars. Process in a yogurt maker, according to manufacturer's instructions, for 8 hours. Chill at least 3 hours before serving.

Do you like Brown CowÂ® maple yogurt? Well, this is a very delicious homemade version that I created myself, after several frustrating attempts at getting homemade yogurt to taste like it's commercial gourmet counterparts! Trust me, after making this yogurt, you will never want to buy commercial yogurt again!
