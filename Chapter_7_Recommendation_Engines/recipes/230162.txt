Ingredients:
1 cup warm water (105 to115 degrees F/40 to 45 degrees C)
4 teaspoons honey
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Pour warm water into the pan of bread machine and stir honey into warm water until dissolved. Add yeast to the mixture and let stand until yeast begins to foam, about 10 minutes. Add flour, olive oil, and salt to the bread pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer.
Select soft setting if machine has that option; otherwise select regular setting and start the machine. Let finished bread cool before slicing.

Description: 
I played around with basic white bread recipes quite a bit and finally have come up with the perfect soft, fluffy, white bread with air pockets. Maybe a little too soft to slice right away. But if you let it cool a bit, it shouldn't be a problem.  Toasted with a little butter and jam, it is a slice of heaven!
