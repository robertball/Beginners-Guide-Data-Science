Ingredients:
1/3 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup white miso paste
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon dry white wine, or to taste
1 pinch red pepper flakes
2 (3 ounce) fillets salmon fillets
1 pound purple potatoes, cut into small chunks
1/4 cup 2% milk, or to taste
2 tablespoons butter, softened, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 pound French green beans, trimmed
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon butter

Directions:
Mix soy sauce, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, miso paste, brown sugar, white wine, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl to make marinade.
Place salmon fillets in a shallow dish. Add enough marinade to cover, reserving the remaining marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator, about 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly oil a cast iron skillet or grill pan and place in the oven while it preheats. (A countertop induction oven can be used in place of the oven. Preheat on the medium-high grill setting.)
Remove salmon from marinade, reserving the marinade, and place skin-side up on the hot cast iron skillet; cook until bottom of salmon is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip salmon and continue cooking until fish flakes easily with a fork, 8 to 10 minutes more. (For the countertop induction oven, add salmon to grill pan, reserving marinade, and cook, skin-side down, for 1 1/2 minutes. Flip salmon and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.)
Pour reserved marinade into a saucepan and heat until boiling; remove from heat.
Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted cold water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to the pot.
Heat milk and 2 tablespoons butter together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer. Pour milk mixture over potatoes, a few tablespoons at a time, and mash using a potato masher until potatoes are desired chunkiness.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add green beans and garlic; cook and stir until beans turn bright green and are lightly browned in places, about 5 minutes; stir in 1 teaspoon butter, salt, and pepper.
Serve mashed potatoes and green beans alongside salmon. Drizzle reserved cooked marinade over the top.
