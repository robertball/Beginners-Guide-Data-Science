Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork sausage, sage style
1/2 medium onion, chopped or diced
1 teaspoon mustard powder (may sub 1 tbsp prepared)
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
6 eggs, lightly beaten
2 cups milk
1 bag herbed crutons
3 slices white bread, toasted and cut into cubes
8 oz extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded & divided

Directions:
Crumble sausage into a medium skillet.  Add onion then cook over medium heat until evenly browned; drain and put aside.
In a medium bowl, mix together mustard powder, salt, eggs and milk. Add the sausage, bread cubes, and 1/2 of the cheese then stir to coat evenly. Pour into a greased 9"x13" baking dish.  Top with the other 1/2 of the cheese.  Cover with aluminum foil and chill in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Bake with the aluminum foil cover on it for 45 to 60 minutes.  Reduce temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and remove the aluminum foil cover.  Bake uncovered for an additional 30 minutes, or until set.
