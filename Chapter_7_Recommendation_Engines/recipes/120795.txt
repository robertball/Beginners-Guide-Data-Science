Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 1/3 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
1 cup mashed ripe bananas
1/2 cup sugar
1/3 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
5 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup chopped nuts

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the bananas, sugar, milk, butter, salt, eggs and 3 cups flour. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in nuts. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff batter. Do not knead. Spoon into two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
A friend gave me this recipe more than 30 years ago. She liked it because it requires no kneading but has the same terrific taste and aroma of traditional banana bread.
