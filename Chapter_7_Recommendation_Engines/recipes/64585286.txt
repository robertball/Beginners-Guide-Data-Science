Ingredients:
1 cup coconut butter
1/2 cup shredded coconut + 1/2 tsp for topping
1 tbsp coconut milk
1 tsp coconut oil
2 tsp turmeric

Directions:
Add the coconut butter and the shredded coconut to a mixing bowl and stir well to combine. You want the coconut butter to be soft, so depending on the consistency of yours, heat it up in the microwave for about 10 seconds if needed.
Add the remaining ingredients and combine.
Begin rolling the dough into balls about 1/4? in diameter, (or you can easily choose whichever size youâ€™d like) and place onto a plate.
If desired sprinkle about 1/2 tsp of shredded coconut on top of the bites.
Put the turmeric bites into the refrigerator and chill for a minimum of 30 minutes.
