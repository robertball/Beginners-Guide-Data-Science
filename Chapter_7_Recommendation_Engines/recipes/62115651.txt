Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons Butter or Margarine
1 teaspoon Italian Seasonings
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon grated parmesan
Optional: shredded cheese

Directions:
Preparation:
In a small bowl, mix all ingredients together by creaming them with a spoon, mix well.
Using spoon, smooth desired amount of spread onto your favorite type of bread.
Cooking:
There are a couple of options:
* If using sliced bread that will fit in the toaster, you can toast the bread for one cycle at your favorite setting.
* Any bread you wish to use can be toasted in a toaster oven (or regular oven) at 350 degrees for approximately 5 minutes or until toasted at desired level.  Place bread on the rack it self to get an even toasting.
Serve hot with your favorite meal!
Optional:  If you like cheesy garlic bread, then toast bread in a conventional oven or toaster oven, and add cheese about half-way through to keep cheese from getting over-cooked.
Note:   You can use whatever combination of herbs and spices you like, or even fresh roasted garlic, the works!
Other Ideas:  Try adding fresh chopped herbs and veggies; spread on top of anything from simply sliced white or italian bread, or specialty artisan breads.  Get creative!
