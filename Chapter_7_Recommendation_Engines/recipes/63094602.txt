Ingredients:
2 slices bacon
2 slices sour dough bread
1 tablespoon butter, room temperature
1/2 cup jack and cheddar cheese, shredded
2 tablespoons guacamole, room temperature
1 tablespoon tortilla chips, crumbled (optional)

Directions:
Cook the bacon until crispy and set aside on paper towels to drain.
Butter one side of each slice of bread, sprinkle half of the cheese onto the unbuttered side of one slice of bread followed by the guacamole, tortilla chips, the remaining cheese and finally top with the remaining slice of bread with the buttered side up.
Grill over medium heat until golden brown and the cheese has melted, about 2-3 minutes per side.
