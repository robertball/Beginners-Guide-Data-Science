Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 onions, chopped
2 cups chopped celery
5 carrots, sliced
2 cups chicken broth
2 cups water
4 cups tomato sauce
1/2 cup red wine
1 can kidney beans, drained
1 can cannellini (white kidney) beans
2 cups baby spinach, de-stemmed and chopped
3 zucchinis, quartered and sliced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
pepper to taste
1 cup seashell pasta
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese for topping

Directions:
In a large stock pot, over medium heat,  heat olive oil and saute garlic, onions, carrots and celery until onion is translucent, about 10 minutes.
Add chicken broth, water, red wine and tomato sauce, bring to boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low and add kidney beans, spinach leaves, zucchini, oregano, basil and pepper.  Simmer for at least 40 minutes, the longer the better.
Fill a medium saucepan with water and bring to a boil.  Add macaroni and cook until tender.  Drain water and set aside. Add cooked pasta to soup just before serving. Sprinkle fresh Parmesan cheese on top and serve.

Description: 
I created this soup after becoming tired of the excess salt and lack of veggies in canned minestrone.  I recalled a great bowl of minestrone that was overflowing with rich vegetables at the 'Sheepherder's Inn' in Sacramento, California.  Great with a hearty bread, romaine salad and a nice Merlot!Modified from: Jamie's Minestrone
