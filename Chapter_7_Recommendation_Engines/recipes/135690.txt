Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
Â½  onion, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style stewed tomatoes
4 cups water
1 (1 ounce) package French onion soup mix
20  frozen cooked meatballs, thawed
8 ounces fusilli pasta

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic, and cook until the onion is almost translucent. Add the mushrooms and the stewed tomatoes with liquid to the pan; use the back of a large spoon to break up tomatoes. Pour in the water; bring soup to a boil.
Sprinkle in the dry soup mix; add the frozen meatballs. Bring back to a boil, and stir in the pasta. Cook at a low boil until the pasta is done, about 10 minutes.
