Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups biscuit/baking mix
2 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
2 eggs
1 1/4 cups milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine biscuit mix and cheese. Beat eggs and milk; stir into cheese mixture just until moistened. Pour into four greased and floured 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans.
Bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes. Remove from pans; slice and serve warm.
