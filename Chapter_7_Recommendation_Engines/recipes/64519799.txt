Directions:
Mashed Potato Pie
2 C. leftover mashed potatoes
2 eggs
1/4 C. cottage cheese
1/4 C. sour cream
2 green onions, chopped
1 T. bacon bits
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 C. shredded cheddar jack cheese
In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs and add in the cottage cheese and sour cream. Stir to combine and add the potatoes and remaining ingredients. Mix together well and pour into a lightly greased (I used butter) baking dish. Bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes and then move the dish to the upper part of the oven and cook for another 6-7 minutes or until it begins to get golden brown. Let sit for a couple minutes before slicing.
