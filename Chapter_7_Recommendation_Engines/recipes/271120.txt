Ingredients:
8 ounces large elbow macaroni
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon spicy brown mustard
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon garlic granules
1 cup half-and-half
1 cup whole milk
12 ounces shredded aged Gouda cheese (such as Frisian Farms®), divided
4 ounces chevre (goat cheese)
1 1/2 ounces blue cheese (such as Maytag®), divided
1 cup diced corned beef, warmed
1/2 cup sauerkraut (such as Frank's®), warmed
1/4 cup Thousand Island dressing
6 slices rye bread

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk flour in gradually until smooth. Cook and whisk continually for 2 minutes. Add mustard, salt, pepper, cayenne, and garlic; stir to combine. Gradually whisk in half-and-half and milk. Cook, whisking continually, until thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 9 ounces Gouda cheese and stir. Add chevre and 1 ounce blue cheese and stir until smooth. Remove skillet from heat. Stir cooked macaroni into cheese mixture.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Divide macaroni and cheese into 6 greased 6-inch cast iron skillets. Top each with corned beef, sauerkraut, a drizzle of Thousand Island dressing, and equal amounts of remaining Gouda and blue cheeses.
Broil skillets in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
Toast rye bread in a toaster and cut each slice diagonally into points. Serve rye bread with Reuben mac.
