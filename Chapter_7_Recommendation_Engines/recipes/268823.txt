Ingredients:
6 ounces sour cream
2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons paprika
1 (14 ounce) package dry stuffing mix (such as Pepperidge Farm(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Herb Seasoned Stuffing)
8  thin chicken breasts
Â½ cup butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine sour cream, lemon juice, and paprika in a bowl until well combined. Place stuffing mix in a shallow bowl. Dip chicken breasts into sour cream mixture so both sides are covered, then dip into seasoned stuffing mix on both sides. Roll each chicken breast up and place into a glass baking pan.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat and drizzle over the chicken breasts in the baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and browned on the outside, and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

This is my 'making chicken great again' recipe! Do not substitute the butter - it's a key ingredient and adds a lot of flavor.
