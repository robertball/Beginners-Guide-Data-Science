Description: 
I created this dish after trying a similar dish (made with crab) at a restaurant.  It's wonderful! If you like, you can garnish with additional chopped tomato and chopped green onion. If you have the time, toasting the pine nuts will enhance the flavor.Modified from: Shrimp Linguine with Tomatoes
