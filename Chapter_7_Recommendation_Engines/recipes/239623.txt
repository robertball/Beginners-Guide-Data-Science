Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, or more to taste, cut into bite-size pieces
1 small onion, chopped
2 (28 ounce) cans baked beans
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
2 tablespoons minced jalapeno pepper
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon mustard powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat to render some fat, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir onion into the rendered fat and cook until the bacon is crisp and the onion is tender, 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir baked beans, ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, prepared mustard, minced jalapeno pepper, chili powder, and mustard powder together in a large bowl; add bacon mixture and stir. Pour the mixture into a 13x9-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the liquid has thickened, 45 to 55 minutes.

Description: 
Tangy and sweet old-fashioned baked beans with a little jalapeno. They're easy to make and great at a BBQ, hamburger night, a picnic, etc. My husband's favorite semi-homemade recipe. Says the sweetness and fire create a super depth of flavor. It's not strong enough to overwhelm the sweet home-style of baked beans.
