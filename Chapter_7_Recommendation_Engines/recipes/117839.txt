Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup butter, melted
2/3 cup finely chopped pecans
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
FILLING:
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2/3 cup sugar
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel
4 eggs, lightly beaten
TOPPING:
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 cup chopped pecans
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, butter, pecans and confectioners' sugar. Press into an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-24 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack.
In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add the milk, vanilla and lemon peel. Add eggs; beat on low speed just until combined. Pour over crust. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack.
In a saucepan, combine brown sugar and cream. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in pecans and vanilla. Pour over cheesecake. Refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Cut into squares.

Description: 
A smooth cheesecake layer, a nutty crust, and a praline-like topping make this dessert extra special. I fix these squares often for friends or when my big Italian family gets together.                                 -Barbara McCalley, Allison Park, Pennsylvania
