Ingredients:
2 cups peeled and shredded potatoes
1/4 grated onion
1/3 cup green onions/shallots
2 eggs, beaten
2 - 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoon of your favorite cajun seasoning blend - adjust to taste.
1 cup canola oil (this will vary on the size of the frying pan and should be a "shallow" amount of oil).

Directions:
Place the potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much moisture as possible. I purchase frozen shredded potatoes from the frozen food section and thaw them.
In a medium bowl stir the potatoes, onion, green onion, eggs, flour and cajun seasonings together.
In a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until hot. Place large spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick patties. Brown on one side, turn and brown on the other. Let drain on paper towels. Serve hot!
