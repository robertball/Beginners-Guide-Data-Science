Description: 
The first fresh asparagus is a delightful springtime treat. This light butter sauce lets the asparagus flavor come through, and the sprinkling of sesame seeds adds a delicate crunch. This is a simple yet delicious dish.                                               --Eunice Stoen, Decorah, Iowa
