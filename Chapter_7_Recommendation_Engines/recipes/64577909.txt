Ingredients:
16 oz box of elbow macaroni
46 oz can tomato juice
16 oz sharp cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Cut the cheddar cheese into small cubes
Pour the tomato juice into a 9x13 baking dish
Sprinkle the sugar into the juice and stir (reduces acidity)
Cook pasta as instructed in the box, but drain 2-3 minutes earlier than instructed because it will continue cooking in the oven
Stir in 3/4 of the cheese in the juice and pour in drained pasta, mix well
Sprinkle remaining cheese on top
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted on top.
Enjoy! This is a family favorite
