Ingredients:
2 eggs
2 cups of sugar
2 teaspoons of vanilla
1/2 cup of vegetable oil
2 cups of apples peeled and diced
2 cups of flour
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (or more to your taste)
1-1/2 teaspoons of salt
1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
In a mixing bowl, combine eggs, sugar, vanilla and oil.  Add the apples.
Mix in the flour, cinnamon, salt and baking powder.  Mix well but try not to over mix.  Batter will be thick.
Dump batter into a greased loaf pan.
Bake for an hour or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cover with foil for the last 15 minutes or so.

Description: 
I was given this recipe years ago by my friend Debbie. I've had it written down on a torn piece of paper for years and decided today that this recipe needs to be on AllRecipes. It is a moist, sweet and delicious bread with a crispy crust.  By far my favorite bread recipe!
