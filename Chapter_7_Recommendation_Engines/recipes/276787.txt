Ingredients:
10 medium red potatoes, cubed
1/2 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 onion, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil (optional)
1/2 tablespoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a large nonstick baking dish.
Combine potatoes, bell peppers, onion, basil, and garlic in a large mixing bowl. Lightly coat with olive oil. Sprinkle salt, black pepper, and paprika on top and toss to coat. Place in a single layer onto the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are golden brown and soft, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the oven and mix in Cheddar cheese. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 5 minutes. Serve.
