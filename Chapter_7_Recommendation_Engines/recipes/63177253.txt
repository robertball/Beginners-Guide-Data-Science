Ingredients:
4 14-15 ounce cans of pork and beans, or two 28 ounce cans (I use Bushes Country style)
4 slices of bacon cut into pieces
1 medium sweet onion chopped
1/2 green bell pepper diced (optional)
3-4 minced garlic cloves
1/4 cup of ketchup
1/2 cup of BBQ sauce
2 Tablespoons of Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons of cider vinegar
1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce
1 dash of liquid smoke
1/2 cup of brown sugar

Directions:
Cut bacon into 2 inch slices and cook in large fry pan with onions and green peppers until tender and bacon fat is rendered.
In a 13X9 baking dish pour beans, add all ingredients and stir in the dish, add the onion/pepper/bacon mixture.
Bake at 425° just until bubbles (about 10-15 minutes) then turn heat to 275° degrees for 1 1/2 to 2 hours until the sauce is thickened.

Description: 
Sweet tangy baked beans that can be made all in one pan. Green bell peppers or even jalapenos add a nice change of flavor from the traditional baked beans.
