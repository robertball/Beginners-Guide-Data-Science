Ingredients:
3 slices bacon
nonstick cooking spray
1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets
1/4 cup chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric (optional)
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of chicken soup (such as Campbell'sÂ®)
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 scallion, green part only, thinly sliced

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Once cool enough to touch, crumble and divide into thirds.
Spray the inside of a slow cooker with cooking spray.
Place cauliflower into the slow cooker and pour chicken broth on top. Season with salt, pepper, and turmeric.
Combine cream of chicken soup, mozzarella cheese, and Cheddar cheese in a bowl. Pour over cauliflower mixture.
Cook on High until cauliflower is cooked to your liking, about 2 hours. Stir in 2/3 of the crumbled bacon just before serving.
Transfer to serving platter and top with green onion and remaining bacon.
