Description: 
Often called gateau aux bleuets or pouding aux bleuets, this cake and its many variations are popular in Quebec. Taken warm from the oven and turned upside-down, it becomes a delicious pudding to serve with whipped cream; left in the pan to cool, it becomes a cake. Add cinnamon it you like a pleasant spiciness; omit for a plain white cake.
