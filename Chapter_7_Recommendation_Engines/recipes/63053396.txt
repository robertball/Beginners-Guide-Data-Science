Ingredients:
Mac & Cheese:
1 box Shell pasta/macaroni
1/2 cup Nutritional Yeast
1 can chickpeas/garbonzo beans
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 garlic clove
1/2 cup diced onion
1 tbsp yellow mustard
pinch of black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp tahini (optional: you can crush sesame seeds and use instead)
3/4 to 1 cup soy or almond milk
Chili:
1 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil
1/2 onion, diced
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 package of YVES meatless grounds
1 can black beans
1 can kidney beans
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tbsp cumin
1 tsp rosemary
1 tbsp basil leaves
1 tsp old bay seasoning
1 tsp sage
3 tbsp Sriracha Sauce
1 tsp liquid smoke
1 tbsp worchestershire

Directions:
Mac & Cheese:
While the pasta is cooking, combine all ingredients for the mac & cheese sauce in a food processor. Blend until smooth, will be gritty.
Heat sauce in a pan for 3 minutes then mix with pasta.
Chili:
In a crock pot or large cooking pot, combine tomatoes, beans, chili powder, sriracha, cumin, sage, rosemary and basil on medium to low heat.
While tomatoes & bean mixture is cooking, in a frying pan, add oil and cook onions until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, then green peppers. Let simmer for 2 minutes then add Yves meatless grounds with old bay seasoning, liquid smoke, & worechestershire. Add salt & pepper to taste or any other favourite "meat" seasonings.
Once cooked well, add to tomato & bean mixture. Cook on low heat for at least 15 minutes. You can let it simmer as long as you want, especially if in a crock pot.
Once both recipes are completed, put mac & cheese in a bowl with chili on top and its ready to eat!
