2 celery ribs, cut into large chunks
2 carrots, cut into large chunks
2-3 tsp salt
2 tbsp butter
1 medium onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Melt butter in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions, and saute 6-7 minutes or until tender.  Add bell pepper and garlic and cook 3-4 minutes more.  Stir in reserved 3/4 cup cooking liquid, cream of mushroom soup and cream of chicken soup.  Mix well.  Add tomatoes, and spices.  Mix well.  Cook, stirring occasionally, 8 minutes.
Skin and bone chicken; shred into bite size pieces.  Layer half of chicken in a greased 13x9 baking dish.  Top with half of soup mixture and 1 cup cheese.  Cover with half of corn tortilla strips.  Repeat layers once.  Top with remaining 1 cup cheese.
Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until bubbly.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
