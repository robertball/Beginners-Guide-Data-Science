Ingredients:
1 pound halibut
1/2 cup white wine
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup chopped button mushrooms
1/4 cup minced onion
1/4 cup minced red bell pepper
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup evaporated milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/2 pound crabmeat, flaked
1/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter 8 small ovenproof ramekins.
Cut fish into 8 pieces, and arrange in a shallow 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour wine over fish, and sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until fish flakes easily; keep oven on for final step.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute mushrooms, onion and red bell pepper until tender; remove from heat and set aside.
Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the saucepan over low heat. Mix in flour, and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly until smooth. Gradually add milk and increase heat to medium; stir constantly until mixture is thick and bubbly.
Stir in mushroom mixture, salt and remaining 1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper to saucepan, stirring until well combined. Remove sauce from heat and set aside.
Remove fish from wine carefully with a slotted spoon, and place 1 piece into each ramekin. Sprinkle crabmeat evenly on tops, followed by 2 tablespoons sauce and 1 1/2 teaspoons cheese in each dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes or until cheese is hot and bubbly; serve immediately.

Description: 
My husband is a 'lover' of crab meat. Since crab can be costly and he also 'loves' fish I arranged this 'sweetheart' of a dish. The intermingling of fish and crab with the flavor of mushrooms and onion baked in wine accompanied by the creamy taste of cheese sets the table for romance. Set your table with candles and flowers and enjoy!
