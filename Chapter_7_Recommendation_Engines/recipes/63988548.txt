Ingredients:
28 Ounce ground chicken
2 Hass avocado, sliced
4 Serving low-carb barbecue sauce
8 Pieces slices bacon

Directions:
Use a low-carb barbecue sauce that has less than 3g NC per serving.  Or use the Atkins recipe to make Barbecue Sauce.  Technically the Atkins Barbecue Sauce is considered a Phase 2 sauce - the ingredients are fine for Phase 1; simply use 1/2 of a serving instead of the full serving to keep within the best NC range.
Season ground chicken with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Form a patty and grill over medium-high heat until cooked through and no longer pink in the center.
Meanwhile, cook bacon over medium-high heat until browned and crispy. Place on a paper towel to absorb excess grease.
