Ingredients:
1/2 block of firm or super firm tofu (7-10 oz)
1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 clove garlic minced
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon corn syrup
Black sesame seed for garnish (optional)

Directions:
When you open your tofu, be sure to rinse it thoroughly under cool water, and if you are only using half the block (as this recipe calls for), save the juice to store the left over half block.
Cut your tofu into bite size square or rectangle pieces that are about 1/4 inch thick
Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and add the vegetable oil
While your pan is heating, dry each piece of tofu with a paper towel
Add your tofu to the pan and cook until golden brown on the bottom.  When the bottoms are browned, flip them over.
While your tofu cooks, mix your garlic, soy sauce, and corn syrup together.
When the tofu is cooked on both sides, lower the heat and add the soy sauce mixture, stirring to coat the tofu.
Let cook on low for a minute or two, until the tofu is caramelized, and there is not much liquid in the pan, then turn of the heat.
Put the tofu on a serving dish and sprinkle with black sesame seeds if desired

Description: 
I learned to make this because my husband, who is Korean, was missing the foods he ate growing up.  It's very simple and tasty, and can be a great introduction to tofu for someone who doesn't think they like it.  Very good served over steamed white rice!
