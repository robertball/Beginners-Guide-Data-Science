Ingredients:
1 recipe Creamy Macaroni and Cheese
1/2 pound thick-sliced bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
2 large onions, thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves

Directions:
Follow the recipe for Creamy Macaroni and Cheese using Vermont white cheddar.
Fry bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of bacon drippings. Add onions and thyme; saute until soft and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir bacon and onions into macaroni. Serve hot.

Description: 
Macaroni and cheese is perfect supper food. It's a kids' favorite, and adults like it too. My recipe is simple and almost as quick as the boxed variety. Try this variation with bacon and caramelized onions.
