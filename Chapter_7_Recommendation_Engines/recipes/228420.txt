Description: 
A great ice cream dessert from Pakistan, very easy to make and totally irresistible! I freeze it in a square glass dish overnight. Put the dish out for five minutes before serving. Make squares and serve. Another option is to freeze it in individual disposable cups. When ready to serve, put the cups under warm running water and take out kulfi.
