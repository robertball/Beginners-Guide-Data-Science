Ingredients:
1 cup Eggnog
2 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
3 1/2 cup bread flour
1 cup butter
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
3 eggs
1 cup currants
3 tablespoons rum
sliced almonds

Directions:
The night before, soak currants in rum (or soak for at least 2 hours). In a saucepan heat the eggnog to a scald. Pour into a large bowl and add in a 1 1/2 cups of flour. Mix till smooth and wait till the temperature cools to 110 F. Add in the instant yeast and mix till well blended. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise till double, about 20-30 minutes. In a separate bowl mix the sugar and butter together till well mixed. Slowly add one egg at a time till all the eggs are incorporated into the butter and sugar mixture. Add in the salt and cinnamon and mix. Pour this mixture into the large bowl with the dough and mix till smooth. Now, slowly add the rest of the flour to the mixture and beat for 3 minutes. The dough will be very sticky. Add in the currants and mix. Cover mixture with plastic wrap and allow to rest for 20 minutes. Take your bundt pan and spray with oil spray and sprinkle almonds on the bottom. Slowly add in the batter and cover with plastic wrap for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
