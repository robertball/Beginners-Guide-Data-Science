Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Beat eggs in a bowl using an electric mixer until combined. Add 1 cup flour and salt; beat until combined. Mix in remaining flour using a dough hook attachment until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.
Place dough on a floured cloth or board; knead until smooth and elastic. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces.
Roll out dough pieces using a pasta machine or by hand to desired thickness, adding flour to keep them from sticking as needed. If using a pasta machine, start rolling pasta at a #1 setting, roll again at a #2 setting, and again at a #3 setting.
Lay pasta sheets out on paper towels and let dry for 2 to 3 hours.
Cut dried pasta using a pasta machine to a fettucine-sized cut; let dry once more, about 1 hour.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add noodles and continue to boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and serve as desired.
