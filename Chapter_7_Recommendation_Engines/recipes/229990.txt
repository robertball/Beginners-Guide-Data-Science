Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, softened
1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup melted butter
2 pounds cream cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 (16 ounce) cans solid-pack pumpkin
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Brush the inside of a 10-inch springform pan with 1 teaspoon softened butter.
Mix graham cracker crumbs, cinnamon, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter together in a bowl until incorporated. Press mixture into the bottom of the springform pan.
Beat cream cheese and 1 1/2 cup white sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Add eggs, 1 at a time, blending in each egg before adding the next. Stir in cream, pumpkin, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice until thoroughly blended. Pour cream cheese mixture over the graham cracker crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is set in the middle, 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes, or leave on oven rack with door ajar for up to several hours.
Beat sour cream, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. Pour sour cream topping over cheesecake. Chill in refrigerator before removing sides of pan, about 3 hours.
