Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup canola oil
2 tablespoons brown sugar, or as needed
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat eggs, milk, white sugar, and canola oil together in a separate bowl; mix into flour mixture until just combined into a batter.
Pour batter into prepared muffin cups to about 1/4 full. Top each batter portion with a generous pinch of brown sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon; top with remaining batter to about 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
