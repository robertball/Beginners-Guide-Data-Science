Ingredients:
Carnitas:
1 (2 pound) boneless pork shoulder roast
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/3 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Lime Crema:
1 lime, zested and juiced
2 (5.3 ounce) containers plain fat-free Greek yogurt
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 pinch chili powder (optional)
Tacos:
16 (6 inch) soft yellow corn tortillas
4 leaves green cabbage, shredded
1 cup very thinly sliced red onion
1 cup pico de gallo (optional)

Directions:
Carnitas: Trim fat from pork. Cut pork into 2- to 3-inch pieces; transfer to a 4-quart slow cooker. Stir in onion, orange juice, cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, oregano, and cayenne.
Cover and cook on Low 8 to 10 hours, or on High 4 to 5 hours. Transfer pork to a large bowl; shred using 2 forks. Add enough cooking liquid from slow cooker to moisten.
Lime Crema: Add 2 tablespoons lime juice to a small bowl. Stir in yogurt and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Dust with chili powder.
Tacos: Serve pork in tortillas with cabbage, red onion, and pico de gallo (if using). Garnish with crema and lime zest.
