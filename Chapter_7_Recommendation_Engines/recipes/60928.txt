Ingredients:
6 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon vinegar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 (1 ounce) squares bittersweet chocolate, melted
3 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and halved
1 1/2 cups whipping cream
2 teaspoons granulated sugar
1 (1 ounce) square bittersweet chocolate, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
Beat together egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar to soft peaks in a large bowl.  Beat in sugar, about three tablespoons at a time, until stiff and glossy peaks form.  Sift cocoa and cornstarch over egg whites, and gently fold in.  Gently fold in vinegar, vanilla, and melted chocolate.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and spread the meringue into an eight inch circle.  Bake in the center of the oven for 1 1/2 hours until the outside is crispy and the center is soft.  Using a metal spatula, loosen the meringue from the parchment paper, and remove to cool on a wire rack.  Allow to cool completely, about one hour.
Whip cream with the sugar, and spread over the meringue.  Arrange strawberries decoratively over the top, and drizzle with chocolate.
