Ingredients:
1 cup basmati rice
2 cups water
1/2 tsp salt
2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 cup cut fideo noodles (or broken angel hair pasta)
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup chopped parsley

Directions:
Rinse the basmati under cold water for one minute. Bring two cups water and 1/2 tsp salt to a boil and add rice. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 20 minutes.
While the rice is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add noodles in a thin layer and cook until the noodles are the color of rust, stirring frequently. Add 1/2 cup water and simmer until the water is nearly absorbed and noodles are tender. Drain any excess and set aside.
Gently fluff cooked basmati with a fork, then fold in noodles and chopped parsley. Add salt to taste.
