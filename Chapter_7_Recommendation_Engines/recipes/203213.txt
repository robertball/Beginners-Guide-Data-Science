Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 1/2 pounds pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 (14.4 ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes
1 (7 ounce) can chopped green chilies
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 cup dry red wine
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the beef and pork until evenly browned on all sides. Remove the meat using a slotted spoon and place in a bowl, then set aside. Cook and stir the bell pepper and garlic in the same skillet until tender. Remove from heat.
Combine the tomatoes, green chiles, parsley, sugar, clove, cumin, and red wine in a large  pot, breaking up the tomatoes using a spoon. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Stir in the browned beef and pork along with their juice, then add the cooked green pepper and garlic. Cover and continue to cook over low heat for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove lid and allow to simmer until sauce is reduced, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is my great grandfather, Reverend Philip Worth's recipe. He was a great pastor and served his congregation very well and very loyally at Beautiful Savior Lutheran Church in Chicago for many, many years. I have cooked this many times -  but it always tasted better when my great gramps made it! It's easy to make, but the flavor would never make you think that!
