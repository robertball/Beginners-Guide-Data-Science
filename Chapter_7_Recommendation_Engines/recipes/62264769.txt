Ingredients:
2 cups boiling water
1 cup rolled oats
1 tablespoon yeast
1/2 cup warm water
2 tablespoons shortening
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup molasses
5 cups flour

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, pour boiling water over rolled oats.  Mix and set aside to cool.
Dissolve a drop of molasses in 1/2 cup warm water and sprinkle yeast over top.  Set aside until light and foamy, about 10 minutes.
Add shortening, salt, molasses and yeast mixture to cooled oatmeal and mix well.  Add the flour, beating until all the flour has been incorporated.  The dough will be very sticky.  Cover and set in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk.
Punch down and spoon into a greased loaf pan.  Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Bake for 1 hour or until tests done (hollow sound when tapped).  Slices better the next day.

Description: 
The recipe for this traditional batter-type molasses bread from Nova Scotia was given to me by a very good friend and was handed down from her great grandmother. It is a very easy, hearty bread that requires no kneading, and pairs well with baked beans, chowder and soup.
