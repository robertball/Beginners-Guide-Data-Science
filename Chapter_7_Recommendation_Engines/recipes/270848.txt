Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 medium onion, diced
1 pound ground beef
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/4 cups cornmeal
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat. Saute onion until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add meat, chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Stir together and cook until meat is browned and crumbled and almost cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and beans and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk together buttermilk, egg, and oil in a large bowl. Add cornmeal, salt, and baking soda and stir together until batter is combined.
Transfer meat mixture to the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend on top. Pour cornbread batter evenly over meat and arrange jalapeno slices on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cornbread topping is evenly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
