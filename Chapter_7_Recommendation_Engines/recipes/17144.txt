Description: 
This is a quick, tasty, low-fat vegetable soup. I usually make a big pot, and freeze half of it. Try it with zucchini, turnips, rutabagas or green beans. Sometimes I boil chicken breasts in the broth as I prepare the vegetables, then dice them and put them back in the broth with the salsa and vegetables.
