Description: 
I love this recipe because it is sweet and delicious and doesn't have any chemicals or added sugars. I buy all the ingredients online pretty easily and I make sure they are all single-ingredient options. For example, the coconut water is only coconut water, the hemp protein powder only contains hemp. You could probably use less banana and maybe peanut butter to lower the sugar and increase the protein.
