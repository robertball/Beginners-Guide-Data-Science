Description: 
I had this idea for a sweet breakfast pizza topped with fruit and yogurt, but I really wanted to do something more 'cool' with the idea. I incorporated zucchini into the sweet crust and it tastes exactly like zucchini bread only in a different form! With the sweet toppings, this pizza is the perfect alternative to your morning slice of quick bread!
