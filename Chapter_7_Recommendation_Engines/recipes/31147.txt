Ingredients:
4 ounces chopped corned beef
1 cup shredded steamed cabbage
1 cup diced cooked potatoes
1 cup shredded carrot
1/2 cup thinly sliced onion
salt and pepper, to taste
8 (7 inch square) egg roll wrappers
1 1/2 quarts oil for deep frying

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the shredded corned beef, cabbage, potatoes, carrot, and onion. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Lay the egg roll wrappers out on a clean dry surface a few at a time. Place about 1/2 cup of the mixture into the center of each wrap. Roll up into logs according to the directions on the package. Wet the edge with water to seal.
Fry rolls a few at a time, turning if necessary, for about 5 minutes, or until golden. Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels.

This is the best 'bar food' around. So tasty, so filling, so good. It is a great way to get rid of those corned beef and cabbage dinner leftovers!
