Ingredients:
Chicken in chunks - Either Chicken breasts or I prefer boneless skinless chicken thighs
Curry Powder (at least 5 tablespoons) more if you like
Salt & pepper to taste
1/2 can coconut milk
3 Tablespoons vegetable oil
1 onion cut in half then sliced
(Bell pepper if you like cut into strips)
Flour to thicken

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a pan
Add chicken chunks, Onion, (bell pepper)  and curry
Once the chicken and onions are partially cooked add the coconut milk
you now can add the salt, pepper and extra curry if you like to taste
Allow to simmer until the chicken is done
NOTE: If the sauce looks a little runny sprinkle a Tablespoon of flour and stir and keep adding flour until the thickness you desire is achieved.
serve over rice
(When I make my rice I cook it with the other half of the can of coconut milk)
