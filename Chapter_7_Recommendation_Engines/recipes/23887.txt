Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup garlic, thinly sliced
6 cups half-and-half
1 (2 ounce) can anchovy filets

Directions:
Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and saute until browned, then stir in half-and-half and anchovies. Heat through and let thicken. The anchovies will 'melt' to add a slightly salty taste.

Description: 
Garlic sauteed in butter, then simmered with anchovies and cream. If you love garlic, you will love this. My husband doesn't like it because it has too much garlic for him! It is an Italian dipping sauce that you eat as a main course. It is very soupy. You can eat it with Chinese cabbage, green peppers and/or Italian bread. I got the recipe from my mother several years ago; she told me that it was an old Italian dish. We are not Italian, but it has been in my family for a couple of generations!
