Description: 
My mom is not a huge fan of cilantro so I had to search around for a way to put together the right recipe for this classic Mexican/ Peruvian sauce. There is cilantro in here, but its matched with parsley and the fruitiness of the olive oil and cider vinegar. And guess what? She loved it and didn't even notice until I told her later. 
I served this sauce as an accompaniment to our grilled beef tenderloin. It also goes well over grilled seafood, vegetables, pasta salads, etc. Its such a great blend of herbs, you can't go wrong!
