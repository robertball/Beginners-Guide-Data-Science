Ingredients:
14 uncooked manicotti shells
1/2 pound ground beef
1 small onion, finely chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, finely chopped
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided

Directions:
Cook manicotti according to package directions; drain. In a skillet, cook the beef, onion and green pepper over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the tomato sauce, oregano and thyme; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Add 1/2 cup cheese; stir until melted.
Stuff half meat mixture into manicotti shells; arrange in a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Spoon remaining meat mixture over shells. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 20 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cheese; bake 5-10 minutes longer or until heated through and cheese is melted.

When I bought a 25-year-old cookbook at an auction, I found this gem inside. I think you'll make it again and again, as I do.
