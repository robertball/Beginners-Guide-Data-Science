Ingredients:
2 cups Cream cheese
1/3 cup HERSHEYÂ®'S Cocoa Powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup chopped pecans or coconut
1/2 cups clarified butter
1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, beat together the Cream cheese, HERSHEY'S (R) Cocoa Powder, vanilla extract and sugar. Mix in pecans.
Brush top of one sheet of phyllo dough with clarified butter, and fold in half lengthwise. Place one heaping teaspoons of the cream cheese mixture in one corner of the folded phyllo sheet. Fold sheet over the filling, forming a triangle. Trim ragged edges. Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets.
Place triangles seam side down on a medium baking sheet, brush with remaining butter, and bake in the preheated oven 20 minutes, or until golden brown.

Description: 
These delicate baked triangles are a rich, irresistible treat. Each is filled with brown sugar-sweetened chocolate-cream cheese. Serve them warm with a little honey! In a pinch, you could use Philly chocolate cream cheese instead of mixing your own.Modified from: Chocolate-Mascarpone Phyllo Triangles
