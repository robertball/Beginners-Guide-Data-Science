Description: 
From Eva Cullers, in Owen Drive neighborhood in Milwaukie, Oregon, mid- to late-1960s -- an all time favorite after school snack or party cake.  This does seem like a crazy mix, but guaranteed one of the best chocolate cakes.  Try oiling and lightly flouring bundt pan and then pouring in batter for a little fancier serving.
