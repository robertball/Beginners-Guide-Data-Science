Ingredients:
Dough:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup iced water
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 sticks butter (such as PlugraÂ®), cut into small cubes
Fruit Filling:
3 peaches, cut into 1/4-inch slices, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch

Directions:
Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl. Pour in water slowly and mix with a bowl scraper until absorbed. Add vanilla extract. Slowly mash butter into the mixture using your fingers until well combined. Flatten dough into a saucer and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour or up to overnight.
Place peaches in a medium bowl. Sprinkle with salt. Add sugar, vanilla paste, and cornstarch. Stir with a wooden spoon and let sit until peach juices are released, 5 to 10 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Lightly flour a work surface. Roll dough out to a thickness of no more than 1/4 inch. Cut out circles of dough using the rim of a cereal bowl. Place rounds 1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Place 2 spoonfuls of the peach filling onto the center of each crust, leaving about 1/2 inch of space around the edges.
Fold in the edges of the crusts 1/4 inch toward the center of each galette, forming a short lip to keep the filling in the middle.
Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are golden brown and bottoms have been cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes.
