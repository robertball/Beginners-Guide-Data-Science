Description: 
This salsa is embarrassingly easy to make and it always gets rave reviews.  My husband, Enrique, is Mexican and he loves it!  Be advised that the heat intensity greatly varies with each can of chipotles.  I change it up often by adding fresh tomatillos, more/less cilantro, onions, etc.
