Ingredients:
3 small zucchini, cut into french-fry shaped pieces
salt to taste
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Season zucchini pieces with salt.
Mix panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning in a bowl.
Dip zucchini pieces into the beaten eggs and then press into bread crumbs to coat; gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Arrange breaded zucchini onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.
Bake zucchini in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
