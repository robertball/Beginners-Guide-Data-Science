2 (16 ounce) cans cannellini beans, divided
2 cups chicken stock
12 ounces cubed cooked chicken

Directions:
Combine onion and celery in a pot over medium heat. Cook about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until vegetables are tender, about 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Add green chiles, then chili powder and 1 can cannellini beans. Cook until flavors marry, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, pour remaining can of beans into a bowl and mash to a paste consistency. Add mashed beans to the onion and bean mixture. Add chicken stock and cooked chicken. Reduce heat and simmer about 25 minutes.

This chicken chili has few ingredients with lots of flavor. If you are looking for something quick and healthy, this is the recipe to use. This is wonderful over white or brown rice. Top with reduced-fat cheese and/or sour cream--I do both!
