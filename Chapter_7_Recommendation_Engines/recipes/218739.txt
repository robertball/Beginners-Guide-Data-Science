Ingredients:
1/2 cup soy sauce
6 cloves garlic, smashed
4 slices fresh ginger root, coarsely chopped
1 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (such as Ac'centÂ®) (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon sesame seed oil
4 boneless chicken thighs
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 cup water, or as needed - divided

Directions:
Place the soy sauce, garlic, ginger, monosodium glutamate (if using), salt, pepper, and sesame oil into a large resealable plastic bag and squeeze the bag with your fingers to mix the ingredients and dissolve the salt. Add the chicken thighs to the marinade and squeeze the bag again to coat the chicken. Squeeze as much air as possible out of the bag and zip the bag closed. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
Mix the cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl until smooth. Pour the marinade from the plastic bag into a programmable electric rice cooker and mix in the cornstarch mixture until thoroughly combined. Place the chicken thighs into the sauce. Add just enough water to barely cover the chicken and stir.
Close the lid of the cooker, set the cooker for the regular rice setting, and press the start button. When steam begins coming out of the top of the cooker (after about 20 minutes), set the cooker's timer for 10 minutes. When the timer goes off, uncover and stir the chicken. Set timer and cook for another 10 minutes; switch the cooker to the keep-warm setting. Allow chicken to rest in the keep-warm setting for 20 minutes before serving.

Description: 
My mom designed this recipe to free up the stove by using the rice cooker to steam and stew chicken thighs, yielding tender, almost slow-cooked chicken with a comforting taste.  It takes a while to make, but requires minimal work.  You can use any cut of chicken, but dark meats come out especially soft.  Serve with white rice and enjoy!
