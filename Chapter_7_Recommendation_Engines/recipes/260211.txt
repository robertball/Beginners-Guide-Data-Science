Ingredients:
1 cucumber, sliced
1 medium red sweet pepper - halved, seeded, and cut crosswise into strips
1 cup cauliflower florets
2 stalks celery, cut into bite-size 1/2-inch-wide strips
1 cup broccoli florets
1 cup baby carrots
1 (10 ounce) container hummus
1 leaf romaine lettuce

Directions:
Down the center of a large cutting board, or tray, place some cucumber slices to form the spine of the skeleton. Arrange some red pepper strips on both sides of the cucumbers to form a rib cage.
Around the base of the cucumber slices, place some cauliflower florets to form a pelvis. Use celery sticks to form the legs of the skeleton, and cauliflower florets to form the knee joints. At the base of each leg, place a broccoli floret for feet.
Use baby carrots to form the shoulders and arms of the skeleton, using remaining broccoli florets for hands.
Into a small glass bowl or ramekin, spoon the hummus. Place at the top of the skeleton to make the head. Arrange the lettuce leaf around top of the bowl to form the hair. On hummus, place carrot slices to form the eyes and a red pepper slice for the mouth. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
Serve remaining vegetables alongside the skeleton as dippers.
