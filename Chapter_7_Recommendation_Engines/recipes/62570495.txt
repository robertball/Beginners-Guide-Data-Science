Ingredients:
Balls
1 Cup Rice Krispies
1 Cup smooth peanut butter
1 1/3 cup icing sugar
1 table spoon butter (melted)
Chocolate
1 1/2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips
1 tea spoon paraffin

Directions:
Mix ball ingredients like bread, and roll into balls.  You should have enough for about 50 balls, about the size of a tea spoon.  Cool for at least 30 minutes.  Once cool, melt chocolate in a double boiler (bain-marie) and roll balls in chocolate.  Set on wax paper, cool in fridge for 24 hrs.  You can freeze these too!  Enjoy!
