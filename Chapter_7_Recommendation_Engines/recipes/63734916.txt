Ingredients:
Broth:
4 cups of shredded chicken
1 tsp poultry seasoning
1 can cream of chicken
1 tsp chicken base
1 can whole potatoes
2 tsp butter
1 tsp pepper
1 tsp chicken boullion powder
4 qt water
Dumplins:
2 cups self rising flour
1 cup ice water
1/2 tsp chicken boullion powder
2 cups of flour for kneeding

Directions:
Place all of the ingredients for the broth in a large pot and bring to a boil.
In the meantime mix the flour and boullion powder together in a medium bowl.
Add the cup of water and blend vigorously with a fork until mixture thickens and is well blended.
Use a large piece on freezer paper or wax paper for a area to kneed the dough.
Sift the flour onto the kneeding area and mound-up.
Pour the thickened dumpling mixture in the center, and begin kneeding.
Fold the mixture, while working a little flour into it repeatedly for about 2 minutes.
Form it into a ball and set aside.
Re-mound the remaining flour.
Pull off a baseball size portion and flatten it atop the mound of flour.
Using a rolling pin or other rounded object, roll the dough out to a thickness of about 1/8th of an inch.
Using a pizza cutter or knife cut the dough into 1 inch widths by about 3 inch lengths.
Repeat this process until all of the dough mixture is used.
Add these strips, one at a time to the rapidly boiling broth, stirring gently and often so as not to stick together.
Once all of the strips are added, reduce the temp to low, and cover.
Let simmer for 45 minutes while often stirring gently.
