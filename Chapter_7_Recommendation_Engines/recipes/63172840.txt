Ingredients:
12 oz jar roasted red peppers
16 oz fresh mozzarella
1 lb slicing/beefsteak tomato
32 leaves fresh basil and/or arugula
olive oil
black pepper
4 oz can sliced black olives (optional)

Directions:
Slice the mozzarella into 16 slices.  Cut the pepper into 16 equal pieces.  Slice the tomato into 16 slices.
On a serving dish, arrange the ingredients in this order: tomato, basil, mozzarella, pepper, basil.  Then start over again, in the same order, proceeding in a spiral-like manner until your ingredients run out, which should be the center of the dish.
Drizzle olive oil and spread pepper over the whole dish.  Scatter the olives over the entire dish too, if desired.
