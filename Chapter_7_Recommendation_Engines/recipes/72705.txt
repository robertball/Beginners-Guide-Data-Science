Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup finely chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped carrot
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 quart chicken stock
1 quart milk
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste
chopped fresh parsley for garnish

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and carrot, and cook, stirring frequently until tender. Whisk in the flour and cornstarch, and cook for about a minute stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in the chicken stock and milk so that no lumps form.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture is starting to thicken, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in the baking powder, and shredded cheese, and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley before serving.

Description: 
This is a cheese soup recipe that is just cheese, no potatoes or broccoli, lightly flavored with carrots and onions.  It's appealing to kids as it is, or, as my dad sometimes did, you can just leave all the vegetables out to make kids happy.
