Ingredients:
1 lb. dried pinto beans
2 cups chicken broth
2 cups water
1 large yellow onion, diced
6 slices bacon, chopped
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 tsp.  salt
1 tsp.  pepper
1 small can diced chili's (optional)

Directions:
Wash beans and sort through to pick out any inedible ones. Cover beans with water and soak overnight; drain.  Place beans in a 5 quart or larger crock pot or slow cooker with ingredients. Make sure the liquid is covering the beans by at least 3 inches. Cover crock pot and cook on low setting for 8 hours, or until beans are soft and done.
Stir a couple of times during cooking and add more water if necessary.

Description: 
My mom and my aunt have made these ever since I can remember. It is such an easy and versatile recipe. The aroma that the beans emit throughout the house during cooking is to die for.
