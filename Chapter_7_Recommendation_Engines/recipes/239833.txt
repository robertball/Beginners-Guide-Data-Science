Description: 
Kahlua®, pecan, and chocolate pie; that is the perfect autumn desert. The chocolate chips don't make it too sweet and add just the right texture to a pecan pie. The Kahlua® tastes better if you let the pie sit for a day or two. This is not just your typical pecan pie. You can substitute Kahlua®-flavored coffee syrup for the Kahlua® liqueur, if desired. Serve warm or at room temperature.
