Ingredients:
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons fish sauce
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon minced shallot
6 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 onion, chopped
2 lemon grass, chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 thin, boneless center-cut pork chops
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Whisk together the brown sugar, honey, fish sauce, 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, ginger, five-spice powder, sesame oil, shallot, garlic, onion, lemon grass, salt, and pepper in a bowl, and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the pork chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours.
Heat 1/4 cup of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.  Cook until the pork chops are no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes on each side.

Description: 
My mom and I developed this recipe together. We call it Vietnamese/Chinese because the fish sauce is from Vietnamese cuisine and 5 spice powder from Chinese cuisine. It is our favorite marinade for pork chops. If you buy your pork chops from an Asian market, let them know what you're cooking. Generally, the thinner the chop, the better.
