Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups frozen Southern-style hash brown potatoes
8 ounces Italian sausage, cooked, sliced
1 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)
1 cup frozen tri-color pepper mixture
4 eggs
1/4 cup milk or water
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
1/2 cup shredded Italian cheese blend

Directions:
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add potatoes; cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Add sausage, mushrooms, if desired, and peppers; cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 4 minutes.
Meanwhile beat eggs, milk, salt and oregano in bowl until blended.
Reduce heat to medium. Pour eggs over mixture in skillet. As eggs begin to set, gently pull the eggs across the pan with an inverted turner. Continue cooking until eggs are thickened and no visible liquid egg remains. Do not stir constantly.
Sprinkle with cheese. Remove from heat; cover pan. Let stand until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
