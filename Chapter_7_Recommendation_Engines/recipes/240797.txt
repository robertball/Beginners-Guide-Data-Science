Ingredients:
cooking spray
3/4 pound Roma (plum) tomatoes, halved lengthwise
1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
2 teaspoons olive oil, or more to taste
salt and ground pepper to taste
1 pound butter, cut into cubes
3 tablespoons grated red onion
6 cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced
3 tablespoons minced fresh basil, divided
2 pounds shrimp, peeled and deveined
10 fresh mushrooms, quartered
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Arrange tomato halves onto prepared baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over the tomatoes; season with salt and pepper.
Roast tomatoes in preheated oven until edges are crisp, about 35 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board to cool; cut into small chunks.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes; drain. Transfer to a large bowl.
Melt butter in a skillet over low heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, and half the basil in the hot butter until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir shrimp, tomato chunks, mushrooms, and garlic powder into the onion mixture. Increase heat to medium-low and cook and stir until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 6 minutes.
Pour shrimp mixture over the angel hair pasta; top with Parmesan cheese and lemon juice and toss to coat pasta completely. Garnish with remaining basil.

Description: 
This is always a hit. The best part is how fast you can whip it up! You could just buy roasted tomatoes in a jar, but I think roasting them yourself gives the dish a very fresh, deep flavor.
