Ingredients:
1/2 pound Italian sausage, casings removed
2 (14 ounce) jars pickled red peppers (such as PeppadewÂ®), drained
2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 pie plates with aluminum foil.
Pinch about 1/2 teaspoon sausage off and roll into a small oval shape. Stuff the sausage piece into a pepper. Repeat with remaining sausage and peppers.
Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil into each foil-lined pie plate and divide the stuffed peppers into each one. Rotate the plates to roll and coat poppers in the oil.
Roast poppers in the preheated oven until the sausage is cooked through and the poppers are very slightly dried out, about 20 minutes. Let cool before serving. Arrange onto a serving platter and sprinkle with parsley.
