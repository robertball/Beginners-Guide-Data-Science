Vegan-Salad Sandwich Spread Recipe

Ingredients:
1 can Chick Peas, drained
1/4 cup Vegenaise
2 Tablespoons Dill Pickle Relish
1 Tablespoon of your favorite mustard
1/2 teaspoon Garlic Salt (to taste)
1/2 teaspoon Celery Salt (to taste)
1/4 teaspoon pepper (to taste)
1/4 cup of Toasted Walnuts.

Directions:
Place Walnuts a small pot of boiling and keep them in there for 2 minutes to blanch them to get rid of bitterness. You'll know they are done when you see the water turn brown as the tannen's boil out. Don't leave them too long or they will get too soft.
Place Walnuts in a warm frying pan or toaster oven for 5 minutes to dry them out.
While the Walnuts are cooking, place all ingredients in a food processor or blender.
Mix until you get a texture that you like. I like mine to gel well for the best chicken or tuna salad-like texture. Add more vegenaise and/or mustard as needed for your preferred texture.
Break up the walnuts into small bite-sized pieces and mix with salad.
Spread on your favorite whole grain bread alone or with your favorite sandwich toppings.
This recipe is very modifiable, you can switch the pickle relish to Sweet, leave the relish out, or add onions, celery, pecans, sunflower seeds, etc, whatever you prefer.
