Description: 
Named after a friend of mine who taught me how to make this Caribbean-based, slow-cooked dish many, many years ago! Easy to prepare and can be served with long-grain boiled rice or we now always have it with baked potatoes for a really filling, warming meal. Use the hot pepper sauce in moderation if you don't like it too spicy!
