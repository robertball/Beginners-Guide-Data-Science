Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, roughly chopped, divided
20 habanero peppers, halved
5 aji dulce peppers, halved

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add 1/4 of the onion, habanero peppers, aji dulce, and garlic. Cook and stir until tender, about 3 minutes. Let cool at least 5 minutes.
Transfer pepper mixture to a blender. Add pineapple juice, lime juice, tequila, vinegar, cilantro, culantro, sugar, oregano, salt, black pepper, cacao powder, and cumin. Blend until smooth. Pour sauce into a glass bottle with a lid; let stand for a least 1 week for flavors to blend.

Description: 
This recipe is for hot sauce! Hot but flavorful. The consistency isn't a thin liquid like TabascoÂ®. It's a little on the thick side so it doesn't disappear when you put it on your food. Great with everything on your plate...that is, if you love it hot and spicy! This keeps in the refrigerator for several weeks.
