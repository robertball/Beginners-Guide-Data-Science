Ingredients:
6 tablespoons vegetable shortening
6 tablespoons margarine
1 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1 large egg
1/4 cup molasses
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Mix together shortening, margarine, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, egg and molasses in a large mixing bowl.
Sift dry ingredients together and add to shortening mixture. Mix thoroughly.
Chill dough in refrigerator until firm (approximately 2 hours).
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Form dough into 30 balls, approximately 1 level tablespoons each.  Place cookies on ungreased cookie sheet and pat down gently with fork making a criss-cross pattern.
Bake cookies in the center of the preheated 350 degrees F oven for 10-12 minutes.  Do not overbake. Cookies will look chewy when they come out but will become crisp.   Cool cookies on wire cooling rack.
