Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes
8 oz "end and pieces" bacon
3/4 cup sour cream
1/3 cup milk
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake potatoes in preheated oven for 1 hour.
Meanwhile,  place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
When potatoes are done allow them to cool for 10 minutes.  Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save skins.  To the potato flesh add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 3/4 cup cheese.   Mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy.  Spoon the mixture into the potato skins.  Top each with remaining cheese and bacon.
Bake for another 15 minutes.
