Ingredients:
2 limes, juiced and zested
1 (12 fluid ounce) can light colored beer
2 teaspoons honey
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
Salt and pepper
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Pound chicken to even thickness. In a bowl, mix the lime juice, zest, beer, honey, garlic, cilantro, salt and pepper until the honey dissolves.  Pour the mixture over the chicken, cover and marinate for 30 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate.
Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade. Grill chicken until tender and juices run clear, about 7 minutes per side. Serve on pasta, with rice, or cool and slice into a salad.
