Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups water
2 cups uncooked couscous
1/2 cup raisins (or dried cranberries)
1 1/2 cups fresh asparagus tips and pieces
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onion or shallots
1/3 cup shredded carrots
1/4 cup roasted sunflower seeds or cashews
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons yellow curry powder
1 teaspoon bottled minced fresh ginger
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup (3 ounces) crumbled bleu cheese

Directions:
Bring 1 3/4 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan; gradually stir in couscous and raisins. Simmer, covered, on low for 8-10 minutes.  Remove from heat; cover and let stand 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
While couscous stands, using medium frying pan, saute broccoli florets, onion, and carrots in olive oil for 5 minutes or until tender-crisp.
Combine couscous, broccoli, onion, and carrot mixture, and remaining ingredients, tossing gently. Sprinkle with cheese and serve immediately.
