Ingredients:
1 lb. unseasoned ground pork
1 pkg. of maifun (rice stick noodles)or saifun (bean threads)
1/2 tsp. chili paste
4 stalks of celery chopped
2 carrots grated
1 bag of coleslaw mix
1 can waterchestnuts chopped
1 onion finely chopped
4 oz. bean sprouts
Soy sauce to taste
Ginger to taste
Garlic to taste
dash of rice wine vinegar

Directions:
Place finely chopped onion, and garlic and ground pork in large skillet, wok, or pot. While browning over medium heat, crumble the pork finely. Add soy sauce and chile paste to taste. Add in some of the bean threads, or rice stick noodles.  You probably won't need the whole package. Once the noodles are limp, lift on the fork and use clean kitchen shears to snip into short pieces. Once pork is browned, add in chopped celery, carrot and waterchestnuts. Cook stirring lightly. Stir in well-rinsed and drained bean sprouts. Once mixture is all together and hot, give it a taste. Adjust seasonings if necessary. Allow to cool slightly, then wrap in eggroll wrappers. Once wrapped, deep-fry a few at a time, laying on paper towels to drain,or bake at 325 for 20 minutes, spraying with Pam and turning and respraying after 10 minutes, allowing space between the rolls.

Description: 
Delicious eggrolls make a meal on their own. Stuffed with vegetables and pork, they're a family favorite. A Vietnam veteran family friend once told me they tasted authentic, almost like what he remembered from his tours in the Army.
