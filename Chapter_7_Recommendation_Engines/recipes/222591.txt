Ingredients:
2 cups crushed cornflakes
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
¼ cup sesame seeds
1 teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon dried oregano
1 (3 pound) broiler/fryer chicken, cut up
⅓ cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Combine cornflakes, Parmesan cheese, sesame seeds, paprika, and oregano in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for up to 4 months.
Dip chicken pieces in milk, then roll in about 1 1/4 cups coating mix. Place in baking pan.
Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 45 to 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
