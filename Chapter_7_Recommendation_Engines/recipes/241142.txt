Once the water is boiling, add half-and-half, cumin, garlic salt, white American cheese pieces, shredded Monterey Jack cheese, chopped green chiles, and diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, respectively, to the bowl of the double boiler; cook, stirring often, until the cheeses are melted and the mixture is smooth, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
I have been looking for a wonderful, rich queso dip. I took the best of two recipes that sounded good, plus added my own flair. I made this for my family and co-workers and had to make another batch, because there wasn't any left for me! Transfer finished dip to a small slow cooker to keep warm; serve with tortilla chips or add to your favorite Mexican dish! Enjoy!
