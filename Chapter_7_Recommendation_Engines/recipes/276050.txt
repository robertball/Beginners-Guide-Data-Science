Ingredients:
6 pounds boneless prime rib roast
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons minced garlic

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Trim fat off the beef and place in a shallow roasting pan. Stir together mustard and garlic in a small bowl and spread on top of the beef. Sprinkle with pepper.
Roast uncovered in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 150 degrees F (65 degrees C), 2 to 3 hours. Remove from oven, cover with foil, and let stand for 15 minutes.
