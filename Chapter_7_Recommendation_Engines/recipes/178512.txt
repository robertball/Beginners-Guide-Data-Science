Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook the rabbit, onion and garlic in the hot oil until the garlic and onion are fragrant and the rabbit is brown. Stir in the wine, bay leaf, beef bouillon, nutmeg, tomato paste, and sugar; season with salt and pepper. Add the potatoes, carrots, and peas. Pour enough water over everything until covered.
