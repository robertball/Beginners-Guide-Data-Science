Ingredients:
3 cups water
.6 oz fresh ginger root, finely sliced
2 cinnamon sticks
10 whole cloves
6 whole cardamom pods, slightly crushed
2 tsp whole black peppercorns
3 black tea bags
3 cups heavy cream
5 egg yolks
1 1/4 cups turbinado or organic cane sugar
1 cup powdered skim milk

Directions:
Bring water and spices to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and steep tea bags for five minutes.  Strain tea and set aside to cool.
In the medium saucepan, heat cream, powdered milk, and sugar over medium heat until a candy thermometer reads 140 degrees, stirring frequently.  Beat half the hot cream into the egg yolks in a medium bowl one ladle at a time.  Pour the egg mixture into the sauce pan and continue to heat until the mixture reaches 165 degrees.  Hold heat for 1 minute.  Do not allow to boil.
Strain cream mixture into a bowl and stir in the tea, and place in an ice water bath or refrigerator to chill to just above freezing.  Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions.

Description: 
The result of patient experimentation - a smooth and creamy ice cream with the sweet spice of masala chai tea lattes.  The addition of powdered milk helps prevent the extra water from forming ice crystals without the use of stabilizers.
