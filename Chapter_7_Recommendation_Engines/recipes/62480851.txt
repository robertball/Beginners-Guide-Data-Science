Ingredients:
1 cup Quinoa (Red is great for this recipe)
2 cups Water
1 medium Apple (Fuji or your favorite), diced
1/3 cup Sliced Almonds or Chopped Walnuts
1 Tbsp Butter
1 Tbsp Cinnamon (Sri Lankan is the best)
2 Tbsp Maple Syrup
1/2 tsp Salt
1 1/2 cup Almond milk
1-2 Tbsp half and half (optional)

Directions:
Rinse the quinoa with water to remove the bitter resin-like coating (called saponin). Place quinoa and water in large pot, bring to a boil then reduce to medium heat. Quinoa will absorb all of the water once it has finished cooking.
Place butter and chopped apples in a wok or large sauce pan, and put over low-medium heat. Stir and add cinnamon, maple syrup, salt and chopped nuts. Allow cinnamon apples to heat briefly, 2-3 minutes, then add cooked quinoa and mix briefly. Add milk and half and half, then stir over heat for 1-2 minutes and serve.
Enjoy!
