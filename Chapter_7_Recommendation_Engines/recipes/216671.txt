Ingredients:
1 pound pork tenderloin, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch thick medallions
1 teaspoon dried tarragon, crumbled
1 teaspoon garlic powder
4 tablespoons butter, divided
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white wine
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds
1/4 cup sliced green onions

Directions:
With a meat mallet, pound the tenderloin slices to 1/4-inch thick. Combine tarragon and garlic powder in a small bowl, and sprinkle the mixture over the cutlets. Rub the seasoning into the meat, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour to blend the flavors.
Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat until the foam disappears. Brown half of the tenderloin pieces in the butter, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Do not crowd pan. Repeat with the remainder of the pork pieces and 1 more tablespoon of butter. Set the pork pieces aside on a warm platter.
Melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in the skillet over medium heat; stir in the flour until smooth and the mixture starts to fry. Gradually whisk in wine, stirring constantly until the flour mixture and wine are blended; stir in chicken bouillon granules and Dijon mustard. Allow the sauce to boil for 1 minute; whisk in the cream. Bring the mixture almost to the boiling point, and stir in the almonds and green onions. Pour sauce over the pork, and serve.

This pork recipe is a staple in our house.  It is easy to prepare and is quite tasty! I like to serve this dish with steamed broccoli with hollandaise sauce.
