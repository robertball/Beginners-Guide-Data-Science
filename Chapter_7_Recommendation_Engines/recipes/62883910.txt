3rd~A layer of sliced green onions
4th~A layer of small diced tomatoes.
5th~A layer of shredded lettuce.
6th~A layer of seasoned cooked shredded or ground meat. You can use beef, pork, turkey or chicken.
7th layer~now finish filling the dish with your faorite potato chips, plain cut or rippled.
Lay a large plate or platter over the top of the filled dish and then flip it over so the platter is now on the bottom.
The platter you flip the nachos into should be 2 or so inches larger than the bowl.
Carefully lift the dish off the platter.
Add enough chips around the Cha-chos to finish filling the platter. Sprinkle the chips with cheese.
Broil for a minute or two to melt the cheese and serve.

Description: 
Chef Robert Irving of the Food Channel demonstrated these on his show. They are nachos, but you use your favorite potato chip instead of tortilla chips. They look fantastic.
