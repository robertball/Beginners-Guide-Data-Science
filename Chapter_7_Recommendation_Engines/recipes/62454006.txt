Ingredients:
2 matzoh
2 large eggs
1 TBSP butter
2 cups hot water
1/8 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp cooking oil, or cooking spray

Directions:
preheat non-stick frying pan on low for 5-10 minutes with either a 1/2 tsp oil or coating in oil spray
break  matzoh into  hot water. i take a matzoh, break it into 4 pieces, then lightly crush them in my hand. it will be a mixture of small crumbs up to 1/2 inch chunks. let soak while doing next step. approximately 2 minutes.
whisk 2 eggs in a bowl.
strain matzoh. shake out extra water. DO NOT SQUEEZE !
mix matzoh into eggs.
add a little salt to mixture (1/8 tsp)
clean frying pan of oil, and cover frying pan with 1/2 tbsp butter (or a little more wouldnt kill you)
dump matzoh/egg mix into pan. it will spread out.
cover pan, and cook for 10 minutes.
( give the pan a little shake after a minute to make sure matzoh isnt sticking and moves as a single "pancake")
after 10 minutes, slide matzoh off onto a plate.
butter pan with remaining 1/2 tbsp butter
take a 2nd plate, cover matzoh, and flip plates. then slide matzoh back into pan (so the uncooked part is now on the bottom)
cover pan, cook 8 more minuets.
remove, sprinkle a little salt on top (to taste).
