Description: 
Until I started eating clean, I had never heard of kefir or Sucanat. Kefir is a drinkable yogurt that contains so much healthy goodness it's a perfect swap-out for buttermilk. Sucanat is a non-refined cane sugar, and can be found at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and health food stores.Modified from: Classic Bran Muffins
