parchment paper
1 (6.5 ounce) package corn bread mix

1 teaspoon white sugar
8 hot dogs, cut in half

Directions:
Cut soaked bamboo skewers in thirds. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom of the air fryer basket.
Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Whisk together corn bread mix, milk, egg, and sugar in a bowl until smooth; pour into a tall glass.
Insert a skewer into each hot dog piece. Remove the basket of the air fryer and place cut parchment paper on the bottom of the basket. Dunk 4 hot dogs in the glass with the batter and place on top of the parchment paper alternating direction of the stick end.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 8 minutes or until desired brownness. Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining hot dogs.

Description: 
Air fryer corn dogs may not be as uniform as the deep-fried version but they are much better for you and fun to make.
