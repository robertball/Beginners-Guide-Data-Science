Ingredients:
2 large eggs at room temperature
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla
1/4 cup all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
10 ounces Ghirardelli® 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Chips
1 1/2 cups walnut or pecan pieces

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F with a rack in the center.   Line a cookie sheet with parchment.
Whisk eggs, sugar and vanilla in a small bowl.  Set the bowl in a larger bowl of hot tap water until needed.   In another bowl, whisk the flour and baking powder together.
Stirring frequently, melt butter with 1 cup of the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over barely simmering water.  Off heat, whisk in the egg mixture.  Stir in the flour, nuts and remaining chocolate. Scoop slightly rounded tablespoons of batter 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheet.   Bake until the surface of the cookie looks dry and faintly cracked, and the centers are still gooey, 10-12 minutes.  Set the pan on a rack to cool.  Store cookies in a tightly sealed container.
