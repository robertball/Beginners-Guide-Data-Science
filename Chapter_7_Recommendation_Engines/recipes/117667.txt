Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) beef brisket, cut in half
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 cup chunky peanut butter
2/3 cup soy sauce
4 teaspoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 cup water
1 1/4 cups julienned carrots
1 medium red bell pepper, sliced
1 medium green pepper, sliced
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1 cup unsalted peanuts
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown brisket on both sides in 2 tablespoons olive oil. Transfer meat and drippings to a 5-qt. slow cooker. Combine the peanut butter, soy sauce, sesame oil, cilantro, lemon juice, garlic, pepper flakes and pepper; pour over brisket. Cover and cook on low for 8-9 hours or until meat is tender.
Remove brisket and keep warm. Combine cornstarch and water until smooth; stir into cooking juices. Cover and cook on high for 30 minutes or until thickened. Meanwhile, in a large skillet or wok, stir-fry the carrots, peppers and onions in remaining olive oil until crisp-tender. Add peanuts if desired. Stir cooking juices and stir into vegetable mixture.
Thinly slice meat across the grain. Place rice on a large serving platter; top with meat and vegetable mixture.
