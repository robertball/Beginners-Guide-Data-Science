Description: 
I make this attractive and delicious dish fairly often because I can have it ready in less than half an hour. Served with a fresh vegetable and simple cooked potatoes, we have a healthy meal. The seasonings blend for a nice flavor, and the fish remains moist. -Bonnie Baumgardner, Sylva, North Carolina
