Ingredients:
1 1/4 C uncooked Arborio rice
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup white wine
3 3/4 C chicken or vegetable broth
1 t dried onion flakes or 1/4 fresh onion diced
3 cloves garlic minced with some kosher salt
1 t Kosher salt
1/4 t black pepper
2/3 c shredded parmesan cheese (to add at the end)

Directions:
Saute the garlic & fresh onion if using in the olive oil briefly, do not brown
Add the rice to the slow cooker, add the olive oil / garlic mixture and other spices and mix to coat the rice.
Pour in the broth and wine, stir to mix the flavors.
Cover and cook on high for 2 - 2 1/2 hours, or until rice is tender.
Stir in the parmesan cheese and leave uncovered for about 15 minutes to let a bit of the moisture escape.
The final product will have a creamy porridge like consistancy.
You can add shrimp, spinach and some basil at the end to make this an all in one meal, or serve as a side dish.

Description: 
This is a keeper if you like risotto but don't like to stir, stir, stir.  It isn't exactly like stove top risotto but so much easier.
