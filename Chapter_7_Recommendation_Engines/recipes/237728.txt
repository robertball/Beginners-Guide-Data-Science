Description: 
Since the weather is warming up two things come to mind: what am I going to make with all those sweet berries and how can I avoid turning on my oven? This dessert is so fast and easy and looks cooked because we brulee sugar on top of the mascarpone. I'm not a big dessert person but this is my idea of the perfect finish to that early summer dinner.
