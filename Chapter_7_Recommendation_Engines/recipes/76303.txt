Ingredients:
3 slices bacon
1 (16 ounce) package frozen cut okra
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, seeded and diced
1 medium tomato, diced
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup corn oil
1/4 cup white vinegar

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook until evenly browned, then remove to paper towels to drain. Pour off most of the bacon grease, leaving a thin coating on the pan. Add okra to the bacon grease in the skillet, and fry until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer the okra to a salad bowl, and toss with the onion, green pepper, and tomato. Crumble in the bacon.
In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, corn oil, and vinegar until the sugar has dissolved. Pour over the salad, and toss to coat. Chill for 30 minutes before serving.
