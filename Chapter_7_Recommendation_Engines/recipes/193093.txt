Ingredients:
1 cup farro, rinsed
2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup ricotta salata, coarsely crumbled
2/3 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
1/2 cup toasted walnut halves, coarsely chopped
1/3 cup moist-packed sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1/2 teaspoon grated fresh lemon rind
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/3 cup Newman's Own® Greek Vinaigrette Dressing

Directions:
Place farro, water, and salt in a 2-quart sauce pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to low, cover and simmer until liquid evaporates, about 20 minutes.
While farro is cooking, place all remaining salad ingredients except dressing in a medium serving bowl. After farro is cooked, drain in a colander and let cool for 5 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent clumping.
Place farro in serving bowl with other ingredients and stir to blend. Add dressing; stir to coat all ingredients. Serve warm.
