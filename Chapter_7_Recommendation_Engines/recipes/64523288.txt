Ingredients:
- 1 Cup of fresh (or left over) Crab Meat
- 8 oz. of Cream Cheese
- 1/4 Cup Finely Chopped Scallions (Any Onion)
- 1 Pack (24) Wonton Wraps
- 1 Beaten Egg
- Salt & Pepper to taste
- 2 Dashes of Worcestershire Sauce
- Dash of Hot Sauce
- Oil for frying

Directions:
With a hand mixer (or really strong arm), mix together Cream Cheese, Worcestershire, Chopped Onions, Seasoning and Crab Meat. Lay out Wonton wrappers and scoop about a spoonful of the Crab mixture onto each wrapper. Take a basting brush and brush the outside edges of the wrappers with egg wash and pinch all 4 middles of the wraps together to make a flower-like design. Carefully drop them into hot Oil (380') one at a time. Turn at least once to cook wraps to golden brown evenly. About 2 minutes. (Do not overcook or cheese will disappear.) Remove with mesh strainer and let sit on cooling rack. Enjoy.
