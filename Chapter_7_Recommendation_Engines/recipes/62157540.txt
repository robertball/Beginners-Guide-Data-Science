10 tbls dark brown sugar
3 tbls gumbo file'
2 tbls ground thyme

1 tbls cayenne pepper
2 tbls ground mustard
2 tbls ground allspice
2 tbls rubbed sage

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a bowl unti thoroughly combined. Store in an airtight container until ready to use. Do not refrigerate or freeze, as this causes the sugar to crystallize. To use, liberally coat pork butt or brisket with rub, massaging it into the meat. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. Smoke meat as you normally would.

Description: 
This perfectly seasoned dry rub is perfect for smoking pork butts, ribs, and beef briskets. It gets a little kick from just the right amount of cayenne pepper, plus the unique flavor of sassafras. The brown sugar creates a nice crunchy bark on the outside of the meat.
