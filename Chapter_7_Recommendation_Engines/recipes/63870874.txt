Ingredients:
1 lb raw shrimp, peeled & deveined
1 cup FRESH lemon juice (approximate)
1 jalapeno, seeded & minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 lb tomatoes, diced
1 cucumber, peeled and diced
1 small yellow onion, peeled and diced
2 Hass avocados, peeled, pitted, and diced
1 bunch of cilantro, stems removed, minced
8 basil leaves, minced
salt & pepper to taste
8 TBSP Spicy Goat Cheese Aioli (allrecipes.com/personalrecipe/63870869/spicy-goat-cheese-aioli/detail.aspx)
8 ciabatta rolls, sliced in half (or 16 slices ciabatta bread)

Directions:
Dice shrimp to about the same size as the vegetables.
Place shrimp in a nonreactive bowl (plastic, ceramic, or glass), and cover with lemon juice.  You want enough lemon juice to cover the shrimp, so this may require more than one cup.  Leave until 'cooked' (pink and opaque) all the way through, about 10-15 minutes.
Add jalapeno, garlic, salt, and pepper.  Stir thoroughly.  Let sit another 5 minutes.
Add tomatoes, cucumber, onion, avocado, cilantro, and basil.  Gently toss.  Cover & place in refrigerator for 1 hour.
Spread spicy goat cheese aioli on top & bottom buns of the ciabatta rolls.
Place one romaine leaf on each bottom bun.
Use a slotted spoon to top each bun with ceviche filling, allowing each spoonful to drain back into the bowl for a few seconds before placing on bun.
Add top bun & serve.
