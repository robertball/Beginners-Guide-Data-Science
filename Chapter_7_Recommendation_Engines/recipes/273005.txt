Ingredients:
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, or more to taste
2 pounds cubed lamb stew meat
2 onions, finely chopped
1 cup beef stock
1 cup chopped, seeded tomato
3 tablespoons tomato paste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 1/2 pounds okra, stems trimmed
2 cups water, or as needed
1 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook lamb in small batches, turning constantly, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
Add onions to the lamb and saute until translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add beef stock, chopped tomato, tomato paste, garlic, cumin, and coriander; stir well. Season with salt and pepper. Cover tightly and reduce heat. Simmer until meat is tender, adding more water if stew becomes too dry, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Rinse okra in cool water. Poke holes into okra to help absorb liquid. Add to the stew. Pour lemon juice over okra to reduce their slimy texture.
Simmer on low until okra is soft and stew is thickened, 30 to 45 minutes more.

Description: 
Bamya bil lahme originated in Egypt thousands of years ago. It is made with lamb or beef. This is the recipe as taught to me by my Egyptian mother-in-law while I was living in Egypt. This recipe is a one-pot recipe, making it quicker and easier to prepare than other stove-to-oven methods. Serve with Egyptian or other short-grain rice.
