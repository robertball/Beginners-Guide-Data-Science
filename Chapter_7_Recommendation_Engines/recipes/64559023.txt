Ingredients:
1 ripe pineapple
1 750mL bottle gold Barbados rum, such as Mount Gay or Trader Joe’s Rum of the Gods

Directions:
Peel pineapple and cut into chunks. Place the chunks in a large glass container and top with the entire bottle of golden rum, making sure all fruit is covered.
Set aside pitcher to a dark, cool shelf and stir or lightly shake once a day for at least 1 week and ideally 2 weeks for maximum flavor. Taste every day to ensure the pineapple flavor is the strength you wish it to be.
Strain the pineapple solids and store pineapple-infused rum for up to 6 months.
Cook’s Note: Save the discarded pineapple to make boozy cupcakes or jam.
