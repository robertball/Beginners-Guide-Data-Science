Ingredients:
2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 boneless pork loin, trimmed
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 mango, peeled and diced
1/2 small shallot, peeled and thinly sliced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Combine chili powder and cocoa powder in a bowl; sprinkle over both sides of pork loin.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and brown pork loin on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer pork and juices to a baking dish.
Roast in the preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Combine mango, shallot, cilantro, and lemon juice in a bowl. Slice pork loin and top with juices from the baking dish and mango mixture.
