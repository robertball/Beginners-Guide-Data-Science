Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup white rice
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound lean ground sirloin
2 (14 ounce) cans tomato sauce, divided
2 green onions, chopped
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon cracked black pepper
4 Cubanelle peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in ground sirloin; cook until it begins to brown, and is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain any excess fat. Stir in 1 can tomato sauce, green onions, garlic salt, kosher salt, and pepper; cook until flavors combine, 5 to 10 minutes.
Mix rice into ground sirloin mixture.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stuff Cubanelle pepper halves with the meat and rice mixture, rounding the tops. Place the stuffed peppers into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Stir remaining can of tomato sauce, brown sugar, parsley, basil, and oregano together in a bowl. Spoon tomato sauce over peppers in the baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are hot and beginning to brown, about 1 hour. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.

Description: 
A succulent sweet pepper, stuffed, and topped, this is the best stuffed pepper you will ever have. You will remember this dish. I like using roasted garlic flavored tomato sauce.
