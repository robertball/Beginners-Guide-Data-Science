Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/3 cup molasses
1 egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 3 cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy. Beat in molasses and egg until combined.
Whisk flour, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir into butter mixture until just combined.
Roll dough into teaspoon-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake 1 sheet at a time in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are firm, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
