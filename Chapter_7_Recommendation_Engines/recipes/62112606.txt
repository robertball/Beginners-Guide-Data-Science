Ingredients:
1/2 Cup warm water
4 Tbsp Granulated Sugar
1 pkg Active Dry Yeast
1 Cup Cooked White Rice
2 Large Eggs, beaten
1/3 cup raisins
1 tsp salt
1 tsp Vanilla Extract
1 tsp freshly grated Nutmeg
1 tsp Cinnamon
1/4 crushed cashews (Optional)
3/4 Cup All Purpose Flour
Oil for frying
Powdered Sugar for a heavy dusting

Directions:
Combine the water and sugar in a small bowl. Add the yeast and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add the rice and stir well. Cover with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature 10 minutes. Lightly mash the rice mixture, leaving some grains intact. Stir in the eggs, salt, vanilla, raisins and spices. Add the flour. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
Heat oil in a large saucepan, enough to cover calas, on medium heat. Drop spoonfuls into oil, turning when brown. After removing from oil, promptly sprinkle with powdered sugar.
