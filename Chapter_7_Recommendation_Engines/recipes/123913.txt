Ingredients:
2 (0.6 ounce) cakes compressed yeast cake, crumbled
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup warm water (80 to 90 degrees F)
1/3 cup shortening, melted
1/2 cup sugar
1 egg, beaten
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 cup warm milk (80 to 90 degrees F)
TOPPING:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup shortening
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Pinch salt
2 (16 ounce) cans peaches in heavy syrup, drained

Directions:
Dissolve yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in water; let stand 5 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine shortening, sugar and egg. Gradually mix in 2 cups flour, milk and yeast mixture. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Divide in half; press each half into a greased 11-in. x 7-in. baking pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. For topping, combine flour, sugars, shortening, vanilla and salt; sprinkle over dough. Arrange peaches on top. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
My mom served this moist coffee cake every Sunday after church, but the peach topping was reserved for special occasions, like when company came. Usually she simply sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on top.
