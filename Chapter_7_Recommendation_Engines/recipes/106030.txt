Description: 
These kebabs have 6 different kinds of spices; the first time I smelled them I knew immediately that I had to find the recipe.  The most affordable way to purchase the spices is in bulk at either a health food store or an Asian or Middle-Eastern market.  They are very good! Serve with yogurt, flat bread, lettuce, tomato and cucumber.
