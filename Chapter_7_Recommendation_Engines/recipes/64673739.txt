Ingredients:
28 graham cracker squares
1 cup butter
1 cup light brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp salt
3/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Line a large ungreased baking pan with sides (jelly roll pan) with graham crackers, breaking in half if necessary to line the pan.
Melt butter and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat until it comes to a boil.
Allow it to boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in salt and vanilla. Pour mixture over top of the graham crackers evenly, spreading to coat.
Sprinkle pecans on top and bake in oven for 10-12 minutes until bubbly all over. If you prefer it a little crunchier, bake for 2 more minutes.
Remove from oven and allow to cool. Cut into squares.
