Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 pound lean ground beef
1/2 pound Mexican chorizo, casing removed and meat crumbled
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup frozen corn
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 tablespoon butter
1 (2 pound) package hash brown potatoes
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
shredded lettuce
1 cup guacamole

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, chorizo, and onion until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, coriander, and black pepper. Add black beans, tomatoes, and corn; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a 2-quart baking dish.
Combine cream cheese and butter in a microwave-safe bowl; heat on high until melted, about 1 minute. Stir cream cheese mixture until smooth; spread over meat mixture. Layer hash browns over cream cheese mixture and top with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and potatoes are lightly brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Serve with shredded lettuce and guacamole.
