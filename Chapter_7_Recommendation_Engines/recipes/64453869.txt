Ingredients:
3 zucchini
1 pound pork sausage
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (32 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella or Monteray Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Trim stems from zucchini and slice lengthwise. Scoop out seeds and put in bowl.  Place zucchini in oven while preparing stuffing so that it will partially cook. Partially saute sausage. Mix seeds with sausage, garlic, bread crumbs, and parmesan cheese. Stuff squash with sausage mixture and place in 9x13 inch baking pan. Pour sauce over squash and cover pan with foil.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until sausage is cooked. Remove foil and cover with mozzarella cheese.  Cook until cheese is melted.
