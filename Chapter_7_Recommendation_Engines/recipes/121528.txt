Ingredients:
1 pound bulk sausage
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese

1 medium green pepper, diced
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies, drained
1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped ripe olives, drained
1 (1 ounce) package ranch salad dressing mix
48 wonton wrappers
vegetable oil

Directions:
In a skillet, cook sausage until no longer pink; drain. Add cheeses, peppers, chilies, olives and dressing mix; mix well. Set aside. Brush both sides of wrappers with oil; press onto the bottom and up the sides of greased muffin cups. Bake at 350 degrees F for 5 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to a baking sheet. Fill each with about 2 tablespoons of the sausage mixture. Bake for 5 minutes or until heated through. Serve warm.
