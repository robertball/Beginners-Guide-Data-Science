Description: 
I love quinoa and my husband loves rice bowls so I decided to combine the two. I really do not have a recipe but instead I use whatever I have in the fridge. This is so versatile, feel free to add leftover roasted chicken, bacon bits, steak, or even roasted vegetables. Generally, I do not measure any of the ingredients so do not hold true to my measurements below.
