Ingredients:
1 box(18.25 ounce) spice cake mix
1 small box of pumpkin pudding
1 cup pumpkin puree
3 eggs
1/4 cup of canola oil
1/3 cup of applesauce
1/2 cup applejuice or applecider
2 rounded tsp pumpkin pie spice
dash of cinnamon and fresh nutmeg
I use cream cheese frosting II from this website and then use a microplane to dust the cupcakes with some fresh nutmeg...mmmmm

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 and place cupcake papers in your cupcake pan. In a small bowl stir pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon and nutmeg together with pumpkin. Use mixer to blend cake mix, pudding, oil, applesauce, applejiuce and eggs. Fold in pumpkin mix. Scoop into your cupcake pan, fill 3/4 full and cook for 17-19 min. Mix will be thick it is ok. Use toothpick to test if they are done after 17 minutes. Allow to cook on a rack and follow directions for cream cheese frosting II and dust with fresh nutmeg. I also keep my cupcakes in the fridge, it keeps them moister. Enjoy!!!
