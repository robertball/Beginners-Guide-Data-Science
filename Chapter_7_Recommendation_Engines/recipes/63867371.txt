Ingredients:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup Italian salad dressing
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 pinch salt
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound tilapia fillets
1/4 teaspoon lemon pepper
salt to taste
4 cups iceberg lettuce, torn into bite-sized pieces
1 small onion, chopped
6 pita breads, cut in half

Directions:
In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, Italian dressing, & cheese. Season with black pepper and salt. Mix until well blended, then set aside.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the tilapia fillets in the skillet, and season with lemon pepper & salt. Fry until browned on each side, and fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes.
Warm pita breads in the toaster or in the microwave to soften. Open from the cut side to make pockets. Fill pita bread halves with lettuce, onion, and tilapia fillets, then spoon in some of the cheese sauce. Serve and enjoy!
