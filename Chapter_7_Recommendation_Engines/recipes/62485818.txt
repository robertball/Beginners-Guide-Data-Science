Ingredients:
1/2 tsp chilli garlic sauce
2 Tbsp maple syrup

Directions:
Put both ingredients in a small bowl and microwave on high for 1 minute for thin sauce, or 1-1/2 minutes for more of a paste.
This could also be done on the stove in a saucepan, stirring over high heat until it boils rapidly.

Description: 
After trying a thai pizza in Myrtle Beach, I had a craving one day and decided to figure out how to make it on my own. I like this recipe a lot. Like, 'eating pizza for a week straight' amount of love for this.
If you don't like the pizza idea, try it on chicken wings!
