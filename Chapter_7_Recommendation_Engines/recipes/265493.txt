Ingredients:
2 cups lukewarm water (105 degrees F, 40 degrees C)
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/2 tablespoon salt
4 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 cup marinated olives (such as StarÂ® Garlic & Basil) - drained, chopped, and herbs and garlic reserved
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
coarse salt
1 teaspoon dried parsley, or as needed

Directions:
Combine water and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Add 1 cup flour and 1/2 tablespoon salt. Stir using a wooden spoon until combined. Stir in olives, reserved herbs and garlic, and garlic powder. Add remaining flour 1 cup at a time, stirring until thoroughly combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set in a warm spot to rise for 1 hour.
Add 1 tablespoon oil to an 8-inch cast iron skillet and spread to coat bottom and sides. Flour your hands. Remove plastic wrap from bowl and transfer dough to the prepared skillet and shape into a disc. Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Drizzle remaining oil on top of the loaf and sprinkle with salt and parsley. Score the top of the loaf with a knife.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is nicely browned, 30 to 35 minutes.
Remove bread from oven and turn on to a wire rack to cool before serving, about 20 minutes.
