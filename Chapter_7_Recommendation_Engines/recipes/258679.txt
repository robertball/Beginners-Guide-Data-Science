Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine, or more to taste
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon cornstarch
5 ounces pork fillet, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons peanut oil
1/2 onion, diced
2 teaspoons curry powder
1/4 teaspoon water
1 spring onion, or more to taste, sliced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups cold cooked rice
3/4 cup green peas

Directions:
Mix rice wine, soy sauce, and cornstarch together in a bowl. Add pork; toss until evenly mixed.
Preheat a wok or deep saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour in peanut oil. Cook pork in the hot oil in batches until evenly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate using a slotted spoon. Cook onion in the remaining oil until softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
Mix curry powder and water in a bowl to form a paste.
Stir curry paste, spring onion, and salt into the wok. Add rice, stirring to break up any lumps. Stir in peas. Return pork to the wok; cook and stir until rice and pork are heated through, 4 to 5 minutes.
