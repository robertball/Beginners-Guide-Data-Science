Ingredients:
3 eggs
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 cup I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, melted
2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted

Directions:
Whisk the eggs with the sugar and salt until light.   Melt the butter and stir in.   Sift together all the remaining ingredients and fold in. Heat Pizzelle iron and place 1 tablespoon of batter on each imprint.  Close iron and bake according to manufacturer's directions.  Cool on racks.  Pizzelles should be formed onto cannoli tubes while still hot. They will harden as they cool.
