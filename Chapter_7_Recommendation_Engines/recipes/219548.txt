Directions:
Cook the beef and chili powder in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat.
Stir the soup, water, tomatoes and beans in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat.
Stir in the rice. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes or until the rice is tender. Sprinkle with the cheese. Serve with the tortilla chips for dipping.
