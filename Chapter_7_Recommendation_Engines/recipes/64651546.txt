Ingredients:
4-5 pounds chicken wings and little drumettes (you can get them in one package)
Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
1 cup hot pepper jelly
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
1/2 cup hot sauce (I used: Frank’s original)

Directions:
Preheat the broiler
Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil, place a rack on top of the pan and coat the rack with cooking spray. If you don’t have a rack the just spray your aluminum foil with spray or use a non-stick aluminum foil.
Set the wings and drumettes on the rack and lightly coat with salt and pepper. Put in oven and broil 4 to 5 inches from the heat, turning over once, until barely cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
Reduce oven to 300 degrees
Using a small sauce pan, add the hot pepper jelly, lime juice and hot sauce then whisk together until smooth. Bring to a boil, Add to an oven proof baking pan and add the chicken and coat with the mixture.
Put in the oven for at least 10 minutes.
NOTE: If you want to keep in the oven longer reduce to 200 degrees, cover and keep warm until ready to serve!
