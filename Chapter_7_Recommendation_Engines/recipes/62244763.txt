Ingredients:
6 potatoes, diced (3 large baking potatoes work fine)
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup
12 oz. ham steak, diced
2 cups milk
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the potatoes into a large saucepan and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain off all but 2 cups of the water, then stir in the cream of chicken soup, ham, milk, and Cheddar cheese. Return to a simmer over medium heat, and cook a few minutes until hot. Season to taste with red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper.

Description: 
I changed this recipe from the original by adding ham instead of spam and using cream of chicken soup instead of cream of onion soup (what is that, anyway?).Modified from: Belle's Cheesy Potato Stoup
