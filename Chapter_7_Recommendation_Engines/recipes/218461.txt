Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
1 large onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
2 pounds fresh tomatoes - peeled, seeded and chopped
1/4 cup dry vermouth, or to taste
2 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground cinnamon
1 (4 ounce) container crumbled Gorgonzola cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat, stir in onion. Cook and stir until golden brown, about 12 minutes; season with salt, black pepper, dried basil, dried oregano, and dried thyme. Cook until dried herbs are fragrant, about 1 more minute, then mix in the tomatoes and vermouth. Bring to a boil, then stir in the chicken broth. Bring soup back to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Mix in the fresh basil, oregano, thyme, and garlic. Cover pot, and cook until tomatoes are tender, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Sprinkle cinnamon over the soup, and ladle into bowls; top each serving with a spoonful of crumbled Gorgonzola cheese.
