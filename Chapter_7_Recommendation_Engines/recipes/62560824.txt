Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 1/2 cups fresh cranberries
1/2 cup pecans, coarsely chopped - optional
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
3/4 cup orange juice
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup powdered sugar
2-4 tsp orange juice
1 tsp orange zest
Few drops of vanilla

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Roughly chop fresh cranberries, set aside.  Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir in orange zest, cranberries, and pecans. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together butter, sugar, and eggs until smooth. Stir in orange juice. Fold in flour mixture until just moistened. Pour into prepared pan.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the bread springs back when lightly touched. Let stand 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool. Wrap in plastic when completely cool.
Mix together the ingredients for the icing to a drizzle consistency and when your bread is removed from the pan and still slightly warm, drizzle icing and let dry.
