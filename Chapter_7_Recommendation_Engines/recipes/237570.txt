Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 1/4 pounds ground beef
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 (15 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon salt
1 splash red wine

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Season onion with Italian seasoning; continue to saute until the herbs are fragrant, about 3 minutes more.
Break beef into small pieces and add to the skillet; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir tomato sauce and diced tomatoes into the beef mixture; season with salt, place a lid on the skillet, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer for 1 hour.
Splash wine over the mixture, stir, and simmer until thickened, about 20 minutes.
