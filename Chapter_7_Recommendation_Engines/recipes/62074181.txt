Ingredients:
4 Cod filets (or your favorite white fish)
1 jar Pastene Roasted Red Peppers
1 jar Horseradish Sauce (Heinz is fine)
1 Bag Cajun Snack Mix (mashed into crumbs)
Garlic Pepper
Worcestershire Sauce

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 375.
Take the fish filets and lay on paper towel so they are not dripping wet.
Take roasted red peppers, drain liquid, and clean all pieces of any seeds.
Blot dry all red pepper pieces on paper towel.(This is an important step)
Dice all the peppers, then place in mixing bowl.
Add about 1-1.5 cups of horseradish sauce.
Add 8-10 dashes of worcestershire.
Using either a food processer or hand blender, mix all into a sauce.
Note* If the roasted peppers are NOT dried properly, the sauce will be too runny.
In a 13x9 glass baking dish, pour very thin layer of sauce to cover the bottom of the pan.
Place fish filets into dish, and season with garlic pepper.
Using the remainder of the red pepper sauce, completely cover each filet.
Then sprinkle each filet with the Cajun snack mix crumbs.
Bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes, or until crumbs start to brown.
Serve immediately with side of rice & favorite veggies.
