Ingredients:
6 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups milk
6 tablespoons butter, cubed
4 eggs
3 hard-cooked eggs
vegetable oil
2 tablespoons cold water

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, cardamom and salt. In a saucepan, heat milk and butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat just until moistened. Add 3 eggs; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Dye hard-cooked eggs; lightly rub with oil. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough into thirds. Shape each portion into a 24-in. rope.
Place ropes on a greased baking sheet and braid; bring ends together to form a ring. Pinch ends to seal. Gently separate braided ropes and tuck dyed eggs into openings. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 20 minutes.
Beat water and remaining egg; gently brush over dough. Bake at 375 degrees F for 28-32  or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
I've made this Easter treat for 20 years! Colored hard-cooked eggs baked in the dough give this sweet bread such a festive look. Leave them out and it can be enjoyed anytime of year. My husband especially enjoys this bread with baked ham. -Heather Durante, Wellsburg, Virginia
