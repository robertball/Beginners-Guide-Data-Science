Ingredients:
2 medium russet potatoes
4 tablespoons butter
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup sour cream
4 green onions
4 ounces of smoked salmon cut into small pieces or thinly sliced lox
2 ounces of caviar (some lumpfish varieties are cheaper)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Wash, scrub and pierce potatoes with a fork and wrap in a single layer of foil and cook for 60 minutes.
While potatoes are in the oven, blend cream cheese and sour cream in a mixing bowl  and chop green onions.
When potatoes are done (test by sticking in a fork to see they are soft enough),  remove foil and slice the potatoes  down the middle almost all the way.
Divide the butter and put into potatoes.
Spoon the sour cream/cream cheese mixture in and top with chopped green onion and season  with salt and pepper.
Add the smoked salmon or lox and top with caviar.
