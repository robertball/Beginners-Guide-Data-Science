Ingredients:
3 cups fresh gooseberries
2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
2 tablespoons milk
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on a lower oven rack.
Stem and rinse berries.
Crush 1/2 cup berries in the bottom of a saucepan. Combine sugar, tapioca, and salt; mix with crushed berries.  Cook and stir until mixture boils. Cook for 2 more minutes. Remove from heat, and add in remaining whole berries.
Pour fruit filling into pastry. Adjust top crust; cut slits to allow steam to escape. Brush top crust with milk and sugar.
Bake in preheated oven on baking sheet until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 35 minutes.
