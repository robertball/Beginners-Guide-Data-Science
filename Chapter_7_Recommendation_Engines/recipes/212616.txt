Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 3/4 cups Swanson速 Natural Goodness Chicken Broth
2 (10.5 ounce) cans Campbell's速 Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup or Campbell's速 Condensed 98% Fat Free Cream of Chicken Soup
8 (6 inch) flour tortillas, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
6 cups hot cooked long-grain white rice

Directions:
Place the chicken into a 4-quart slow cooker. Sprinkle with the chili powder and cumin.  Pour in the broth.
Cover and cook on LOW for 8 to 9 hours* or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken to a cutting board.  Using 2 forks, shred the chicken.
Reserve 1 cup liquid in cooker, adding additional broth, if needed, to make 1 cup.  Stir the soup into the cooker.  Stir in chicken.
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Layer half the chicken mixture, tortillas and cheese in a 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Repeat the layers.
Bake for 30 minutes or until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve over the rice.
