Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) bag chocolate chips
2/3 cup smooth peanut butter
1/3 cup crispy rice cereal
2 quarts vanilla ice cream, softened
2 cups whipped cream
4 cups hulled and halved strawberries

Directions:
Combine chocolate chips and peanut butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Simmer, stirring frequently, until melted and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.
Place rice cereal in a large bowl. Pour melted chocolate mixture on top; toss gently to combine. Spread on a baking sheet and cool until firm, about 30 minutes. Break cereal mixture into small pieces. Measure out 1 cup into a bowl; reserve for topping.
Fold remaining rice mixture into the softened ice cream. Spread ice cream into a 10-inch springform pan. Sprinkle reserved rice mixture on top.
Freeze ice cream until firm, about 1 hour. Spoon whipped cream on top; garnish with strawberries.
