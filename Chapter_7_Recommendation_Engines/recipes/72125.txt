Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 boneless center-cut pork loin chops

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.
In a bowl, mix the orange juice, Dijon mustard, and brown sugar. Place the pork chops in the prepared baking dish, and pour orange juice mixture over chops.
Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Pour the remaining marinade liquid into a skillet, and cook over medium-high heat until reduced by about 1/2. Pour over the cooked chops to serve.

Went looking for something to marinate my pork chops in and came up short. Went back to Mom's old standby that we all love. Enjoy! My brother prefers pineapple/orange juice...go figure!
