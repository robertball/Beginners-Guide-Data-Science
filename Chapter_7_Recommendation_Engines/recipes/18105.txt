Ingredients:
2 pounds chicken thighs
1 (16 ounce) bottle zesty Italian dressing
1 (16 ounce) jar salsa

Directions:
To Marinate: Place chicken in a nonporous glass dish or bowl; pour dressing and salsa over chicken and turn to coat. Cover with lid or aluminum foil and refrigerate to marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.
Preheat oven to Grill/Broil.
Remove chicken from dish or bowl, discarding any remaining marinade, and grill/broil for about 20 minutes or until cooked through and juices run clear. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me by my father-in-law, who owns a machine shop. It is the family's traditional birthday party dinner. This chicken is truly mouth-watering and goes perfectly with a tomato/brie bowtie pasta.
