Ingredients:
1 lb. white baking chocolate
1/2 cup peanut butter
2 cups Rice Krispies cereal

Directions:
Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
Place your Rice Krispies in a large mixing bowl and set aside.
In a medium sauce pan over medium-low heat, slowly melt the white chocolate.  Once it is melted, take the pan off the heat and stir in the peanut butter.
Pour the mixture over the Krispies and mix.  Pour this final mixture onto the cookie sheet (about a centimeter thick) and place in the fridge to cool, approximately 1 hour.  Once the bark is firm, break into pieces and enjoy!
