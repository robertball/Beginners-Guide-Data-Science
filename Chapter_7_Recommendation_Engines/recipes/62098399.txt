Ingredients:
1 pre-made pie crust, thawed
2 pints fresh strawberries, halved
1 pint fresh blueberries
1/2 pint fresh rasberries
3 T. fresh mint leaves, chopped
1/4 c. lemon juice
2 T. flour
1/2 c. granulated sugar
1/4 c. brown sugar
3 T. melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place all the berries into a bowl and toss with the lemon juice.  Add the mint leaves and toss again.
In a separate bowl, combine the sugars and flour.  Then, add these ingredients to the berry bowl and toss once more.
Place the bottom pie crust into a regular-sized pie plate and add the entire berry mixture.  Cover with top pie crust and press sides together to seal the edges.
Make slits in the top of the pie (5 or 6), then brush the top and edges of the crust with the melted butter.
Bake (on a cookie sheet to avoid oven drips) for 45 minutes or until crust is golden brown.  It's great served both warm or chilled, whichever you prefer.

Description: 
My husband is a HUGE fan of any type of pie.  This past spring, I was getting bored of making him all of the typical pies around, so I decided to concoct one of my own.  I had lots of fresh berries and I grow my own mint.  It turned out to be the perfect combination!
