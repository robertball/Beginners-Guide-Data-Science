Ingredients:
3 large egg whites
1 tbsp honey
1 tsp vanilla extract
2/3 cup unsweetened coconut milk
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tbsp tapioca flour
1/2 cup coconut flour

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine eggs with honey, milk, cinnamon and vanilla extract with a hand mixer. Blend until eggs are fluffy as clouds 2-3 minutes.
Next add baking soda, baking powder, tapioca flour and mix with hand mixer just to combine.
Then fold in coconut flour and stir by hand. Be careful to not over mix as coconut flour is extremely absorbent.
Heat a skillet to medium heat and spray with nonstick cooking spray.
Scoop a 1/4 cup of the batter and add to the skillet.
Cook 3-4 minutes until small bubbles form in the center of the pancakes then flip to cook another 2 minutes until lightly browned on both sides.
Remove from skillet and place on a baking rack to cool.
Repeat for entire batter then devour!
