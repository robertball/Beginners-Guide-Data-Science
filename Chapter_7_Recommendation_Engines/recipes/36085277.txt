Ingredients:
1 pint grape tomatoes, halved
salt
1 medium shallot, thinly sliced
1 TBS drained capers
2 TBS red wine vinegar
3 TBS olive oil
4 center-cut salmon fillets with skin (about 7oz each)
freshly ground pepper
1/2 tsp ground cumin
2 TBS canola oil
1 TBS minced parsley
1 TBS chopped basil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425.  In a bowl, toss the tomatoes with 1/2 tsp of salt, shallot, capers, and vinegar.
In a medium ovenproof skillet, heat 1 TBS of olive oil.  Season the salmon with salt and pepper and add to the skillet, skin side up.  Cook over moderately high heat until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes.  Carefully flip the fish.  Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the fish until cooked through, about 7 minutes; transfer to plates and pour off any fat from the skillet.
Place the skillet over moderate heat and add the tomato mixture along with the cumin, canola oil and remaining 2 TBS of olive oil.  Cook, scraping up any bits stuck to the skillet, until the tomatoes just soften, about 2 minutes.  Pour the sauce over the salmon, sprinkle with parsley and basil and serve right away.
