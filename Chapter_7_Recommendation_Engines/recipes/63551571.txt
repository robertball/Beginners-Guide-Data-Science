Ingredients:
1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
4 tsp. granulated sugar
4 tsp. baking powder
2 tsp. kosher salt
1 3/4 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450F degrees.
Spray an 8-inch square baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
In a microwave-safe bowl (or you can use the baking dish that you'll be baking these in), melt stick of butter in the microwave.
In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
Pour in the buttermilk.  Stir until a loose dough forms. Dough will be sticky.
Press biscuit dough into baking dish (right on top of the melted butter).
It is easiest to spread it out with your hands.
Take a sharp knife and cut the biscuit dough into 9 squares before baking.
Bake for about 20-25 minutes, rotating once during baking.
