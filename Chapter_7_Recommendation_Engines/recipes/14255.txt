Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 cups low-fat salad dressing
1 cup ketchup
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 head iceberg lettuce - rinsed, dried, and chopped
1 head romaine lettuce- rinsed, dried and chopped
3 large tomatoes, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 yellow bell pepper, diced
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 (4 ounce) can green chile peppers, finely chopped
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
12 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (14.5 ounce) package corn tortilla chips

Directions:
Brown the beef, drain, season with chili powder and set aside to cool.
Prepare the dressing by whisking the Miracle Whip, ketchup and taco seasoning mix together in a small bowl.
In a large bowl, combine iceberg lettuce, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, green pepper, red or yellow pepper, green onions, jalapeno peppers, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, half of the cheese, half of the crushed chips, dressing and cooled ground beef. Mix well, cover and refrigerate.
Just before serving, top the salad with the other half of the cheese and crushed chips.

Description: 
This is one of those 'some of this and some of that' recipes. I call this garbage salad because when traveling to a picnic I carry it in a medium (untreated) trash bag, and fill a container when there!  You can substitute fresh jalapenos for the canned green chiles, if you like. Serve with whole chips on the side.
