Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1/4 cup beer (such as Sam Adams®)
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger whiskey (such as Jack Daniel's®)
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat; lightly oil the grate.
Combine the ground beef, beer, Worcestershire sauce, whiskey, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl; mix until evenly combined. Shape the mixture into 6 patties.
Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 5 to 8 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
