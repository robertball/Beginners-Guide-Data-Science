Description: 
My kids LOVE the taquitos we get at the grocery store in the freezer aisle.  They would happily eat them every day.  However I, the mean Mommy I am, and working on reducing the amount of processed food in our diet so I HAD to try homemade.  After checking all the recipes for Taquitos I could find, I decided to mix it up and create my own!  So I took ideas from about 4 different recipes and went to town.  My kids and husband have given there seal of approval (my VERY picky 3 yr old even had seconds!)  I serve on a bed of lettuce with sour cream and do Mexican rice on the side.
