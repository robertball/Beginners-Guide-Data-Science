Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 onion, diced
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1 carrot, peeled and diced
8 (4 ounce) fillets catfish fillets
salt and black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
garlic powder to taste
1 (14.4 ounce) can diced Italian tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup dry white wine

Directions:
Place 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat.  Saute onion, green pepper, and carrot until golden brown; remove from the pan.  Using the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, sear all of the fillets on both sides.   Lay all of the fillets into the skillet, sprinkle with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder. Top with the sauteed vegetables, and pour on the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and white wine.
Bring to a simmer, and cook gently until the sauce has thickened slightly, and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Something new to do with catfish besides deep frying it! A yummy blend of tomatoes and italian seasonings make this a mild fish dish. Great if you don't care for that  sometimes overpowering catfish taste.  For a stronger fish flavor, try making the sauce separately and serving over grilled catfish!
