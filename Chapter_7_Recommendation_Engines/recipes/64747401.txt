Ingredients:
2 medium butternut squash (about 3 pounds each)
3/4 tsp salt
Pepper, optional
4 ounces Neufchâtel cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
3 Tbsp brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Cut each squash in half lengthwise; discard seeds. Place squash cut side down in two 13x9-in. baking dishes; add 1/2-in. water. Bake, uncovered, at 350° for 1 hour.
Turn squash over; sprinkle with salt and pepper if desired. In a small bowl, beat the Neufchâtel cheese, butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy; stir in pecans. Spoon into squash cavities.
Bake 15-20 minutes longer or until filling is lightly browned and squash is tender.
