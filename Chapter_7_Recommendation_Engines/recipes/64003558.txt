Ingredients:
1/4 cup flour
1 egg, room temp
1/4 cup buttermilk, room temp
1/4 tsp table salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp cayenne
15 saltine crackers
2 cups potato chips
1 large yellow onion, cut into 12 large rings (*see note*
3 T vegetable oil

Directions:
Oven rack to lower middle - oven to 450.
Place 1/8th cup flour in shallow dish.
Beat egg & buttermilk in medium bowl, then whisk in remaining flour, salt, pepper and cayenne.
Pulse saltines and chips together in food processor until finely ground and place in a separate dish.
Dredge each onion ring in flour, then dip into buttermilk mixture allowing excess to drip back into bowl.  Give a final dip into crumb coating, turning ring over to coat thoroughly. Rings may be refrigerated at this point for up to 1 hour, but bring them back by letting sit at room temp for 30 minutes before baking.
Pour oil onto baking sheet, place in oven,  and heat until just smoking (apx 8 minutes).  Tile pan to coat evenly with oil, then arrange onion rings onto sheet.  Bake, flipping rings over and rotating pan halfway through baking, for apx 15 minutes.  Briefly drain on paper towel and serve immediately.
