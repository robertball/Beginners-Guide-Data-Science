Ingredients:
1/2 cup margerine
1 large onion, sliced
1-2 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 cup flour
4-5 cups vegetable stock
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt margerine and add onions.  Cook over medium-high heat until onions and margerine are browned.  Stir in garlic and cook a couple more minutes.  Reduce heat to medium and stir in flour with a fork.  Add vegetable stock 1 cup at a time, stirring constantly until desired thickness is reached.  Simmer on low 5 minutes, adding salt and pepper.  If you prefer a smooth gravy, pour through a sieve to remove onions.  Serve hot or freeze and reheat as required.
