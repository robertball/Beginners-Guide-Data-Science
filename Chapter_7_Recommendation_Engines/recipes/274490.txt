Ingredients:
1 serving nonstick cooking spray
Bread:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups white sugar
1 (15 ounce) can solid-pack pumpkin puree
1 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup raisins
Orange Glaze:
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
6 teaspoons orange juice
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1 tablespoon chopped walnuts, or as desired

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two 9x5-inch loaf pans with cooking spray.
Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
Mix sugar, pumpkin, oil, and eggs together using an electric mixer in a large bowl until well blended. Mix in flour mixture until well combined. Stir in walnuts and raisins by hand. Divide batter between the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaves comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pans on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove loaves from the pans and let cool completely, about 15 minutes more.
Combine confectioners' sugar, orange juice, and orange zest in a small bowl. Stir using a spoon to blend well. Spoon glaze over the top of cooled loaves, letting excess run down the sides. Sprinkle with additional 1 tablespoon walnuts before glaze hardens.

Description: 
My grandmother and I always make tons of these at Christmas time to give as gifts. It isn't the holidays without this dessert. Not only are they delicious, they're freezer-friendly! I would classify these in the same family as banana bread (sweet loaf) rather than 'bread.'
