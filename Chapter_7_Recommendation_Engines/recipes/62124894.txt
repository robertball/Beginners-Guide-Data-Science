Description: 
This is incredibly easy to make and there are never any leftovers.  This is perfect to cook for guests at your house, or a breakfast-for-dinner meal.  This casserole is cheesy and gooey and tastes just like an Egg McMuffin!  Also, feel free to jazz it up by using zesty hot sausage and pepper jack cheese.
