Ingredients:
6 chicken breast halves (enough to make 4 cups cooked chicken cut into bite-sized chunks)
1 cup diced celery
2/3 cup mayo (not salad dressing)
4 tablespoons heavy cream
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt (do NOT add if chicken was well-salted during the cooking process)
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup Craisins or raisins (optional)
1/2 cup slivered, toasted almonds (optional)

Directions:
Simmer the chicken breasts in water until no pink remains, about 30 minutes.  Let cool and cut into bite-sized chunks using kitchen shears.
Combine the mayo, cream, vinegar, salt and pepper.  Stir in the celery, raisins and almonds.
Toss this mixture with the chicken. Chill.
Serve on lettuce leaves with a croissant on the side for a lovely luncheon presentation.
(Although I like to use rotisserie chicken as a start in a lot of dishes, I don't recommend it in this recipe.  Save it for dishes with more intense flavors.)

As the weather warms up, cool salads fill the bill.  We served this at our wedding luncheon 31 years ago.
