Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 large shallots, chopped
2 scallions, chopped
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1 carrot, peeled and chopped
4 cups chopped calabaza (Caribbean pumpkin)
4 cups chicken stock
3 sprigs fresh thyme
2 bay leaves
1 Scotch bonnet chile pepper, stemmed
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1 pinch sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk
1 lime, juiced

Directions:
Heat butter and oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add celery, shallots, scallions, garlic, and carrot and cook until soft and just starting to turn golden, about 5 minutes, making sure not to brown.
Add calabaza, chicken stock, thyme, bay leaves, Scotch bonnet chile pepper, and allspice to the pot. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and let simmer until pumpkin is tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat and season with sea salt and pepper.
Puree soup using a hand blender until smooth. Return to a medium-low heat and bring to a boil. Stir in coconut milk and lime juice and let simmer to develop flavor, about 5 minutes. Serve.

Description: 
This velvety seductive coconut soup was a favorite of mine on the island of Jamaica. I tried it at every restaurant and finally recreated it with this recipe...a combination of all of the ones that I loved! Try to find the Caribbean pumpkin (calabaza) if you can. It's green and not orange.
