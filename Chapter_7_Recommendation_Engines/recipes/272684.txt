Ingredients:
6 cups chicken broth
6 cups water
10 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 pound sausage links, cut into bite-sized pieces
¼ cup vegetable oil
¼ cup flour
2 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 (16 ounce) package frozen sliced okra

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, water, and Cajun seasoning in a large stock pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; add chicken. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside to cool slightly. Cut into bite-sized pieces.
Microwave sausage to remove some of the grease, 1 to 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring chicken broth mixture back to a boil.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Slowly add flour, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add mixture to boiling stock.
Place chicken, sausage, shrimp, onion, and bell pepper into stock pot. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally until vegetables are tender and meat is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Add okra; cook until softened, about 30 minutes more.

Description: 
This recipe is a combination of gumbo and seafood soup. I make it for large get togethers and everyone begs for the recipe. It is relatively easy as far as a gumbo goes and oh, so good! Serve with French bread over rice. It is also good if you add file powder.
