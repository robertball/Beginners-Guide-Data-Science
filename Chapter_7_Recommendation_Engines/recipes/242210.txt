Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup dry pinto beans
1 cup chopped onions
1/2 cup red wine
1/4 cup sesame seeds
2 cloves garlic, peeled

Directions:
Combine water and pinto beans in a saucepan; bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Cover saucepan and remove from heat; let sit, at least 1 hour. Bring water back to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until beans are tender, about 45 minutes.
Mix onions, red wine, sesame seeds, and garlic in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until wine has evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes.
Blend bean-water mixture in a blender until smooth; add onion mixture and blend until smooth.
