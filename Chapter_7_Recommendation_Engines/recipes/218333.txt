3/4 cup light olive oil

Directions:
Blend the lime juice, vinegar, and cilantro together in a blender until smooth. Add the brown sugar, garlic, and salt; blend again until smooth. Spoon the mustard into the mixture. Turn the blender on and slowly pour the olive oil into the dressing mixture in a thin stream; blend until thoroughly combined.

Description: 
This is a delicious, tangy vinaigrette. It's so versatile, it can be used for mixed greens or taco salads. Enjoy! Serve immediately or keep in the fridge for 4 to 5 days. I prefer white wine vinegar in this recipe, as opposed to regular white vinegar. You can also use Dijon mustard if you prefer to spicy brown.
