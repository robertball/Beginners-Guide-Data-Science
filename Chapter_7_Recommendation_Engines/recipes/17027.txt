Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 cup milk

Directions:
Season chicken with salt and pepper (no such thing as too much, since this is the only seasoning this dish has)!
Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat and add chicken. Saute until browned, about 5 minutes each side, then add milk (enough to cover 3/4 of the chicken).
Reduce heat to low and simmer for 2 hours, uncovered. Remove chicken and use juices in skillet as a sauce.
