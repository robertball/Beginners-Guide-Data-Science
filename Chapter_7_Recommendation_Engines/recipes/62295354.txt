Ingredients:
i/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup honey
2 cups halved green seedless grapes
2 cups fresh blueberries
2 cups fresh halved strawberries
2 cups fresh raspberries

Directions:
1. For dressing, whisk together in a small bowl the orange juice and honey.
2. In a large serving bowl, mix together grapes, blueberries and strawberries. Gently stir in dressing. Cove and chill for 2-4 hours.
3. Just before serving, stir in the raspberries. *These berries are far more delicate than blueberries and strawberries, and will lose their texture if chilled too long in the dressing.
