Ingredients:
2 cans whole water chestnuts
1 bottle teriyaki marinade/sauce
3/4 bag light brown sugar
1 package regular sliced bacon, sliced in thirds
toothpicks

Directions:
Wrap water chestnuts in pieces of bacon and secure with toothpick. Arrange in a baking dish.
Bake uncovered at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes, checking periodically to see if bacon is close to being done cooking. Remove from oven, carefully drain grease.
Pour teriyaki into baking pan just to the point of coving chestnuts.
Pack brown sugar into spaces between chestnuts. Using a LOT of sugar will ensure that the sauce will by thick and syrupy, coating the chestnuts when finished, and less drippy when being eaten.
Continue baking at 350 degrees for 20-25 more minutes. Will be extremely hot. Sauce will syrupy, but will continue to thicken upon standing.
*Keep the leftover sauce by freezing in a ziplock bag for use the next time or as a great cooking sauce for slow cooker ribs!
