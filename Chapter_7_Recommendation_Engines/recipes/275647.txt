Description: 
Polenta, a staple of Northern Italian cuisine, is traditionally made by adding cornmeal to boiling salted water and stirring with a wooden spoon until your biceps aches! You can achieve the same results by letting your Instant Pot® do all of the work for you! We like to serve this topped with browned Italian sausage and pork ribs that have simmered in a sauce made with onions, garlic, basil and tomato sauce until the ribs are falling off the bone-tender! Serve with additional cheese, if desired. Delizioso!
