Spicy Mango Salmon Recipe

Ingredients:
Salmon
1 mango
Greek yogurt
Chili flakes

Directions:
Salmon:
Bake salmon for 450 degrees for 15 minutes. Fish cooks fast, if you overcook your fish, it will come out too dry.
Sauce:
In food processor, puree one mango and Â¼ cup of Greek yogurt. Add a couple of chili flakes and stir.
Presentation
You can drizzle the sauce on the bottom of your plate, then place salmon on top with a small garnish of choice.
You can also drizzle the sauce on top of the salmon. You can go over the salmon, or over the entire plate in a zigzag motion.
For this recipe, I recommend my Garden Fresh Coleslaw as a side.
Wine Tip
This recipe pairs well with Riesling or Chardonnay!
