Ingredients:
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole milk
1/4 cup half-and-half
1 garlic clove, peeled and lightly crushed
Table salt and ground black pepper
Pinch nutmeg
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 package  fresh fettuccine (9-ounce)

Directions:
Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot over high heat. Using ladle, fill each of 4 individual serving bowls with about 1/2 cup boiling water. Set aside.
Heat butter over medium heat in large saucepan until foaming. Whisk in flour until mixture is smooth and golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in milk, half-and-half, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and nutmeg and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Discard garlic, stir in Parmesan, and remove from heat.
Stir 1 tablespoon salt and pasta into boiling water and cook, stirring constantly, until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain pasta.
Return sauce to low heat, add 1/3 cup pasta water and cooked pasta; toss until evenly coated. Cook until sauce has thickened slightly, about 1 minute. Add more cooking water as needed to thin sauce to proper consistency and adjust seasonings. Working quickly, empty water from warmed bowls and fill with pasta. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Make the sauce while the pasta water is heating up. Once the sauce is done, you should be ready to cook the pasta. Fresh pasta is more porous than dried, and we recommend it here because it will better absorb the sauce.
