Ingredients:
2 tbsp low-sodium teriyaki sauce
1 tbsp honey
1 tbsp rice vinegar
4 tsp chopped garlic, divided
1 tsp grated ginger
1 tsp dark sesame oil
6 salmon fillets (about 1.5lbs)
1 lb brussels sprouts, halved if large
1 tbsp canola oil, divded
1/2 tsp salt, divided
vegetable oil cooking spray
1/2 lb shiitake mushrooms, thinly sliced

Directions:
Position rack in middle of over; heat oven to 450F. In a bowl, combine teriyaki sauce, honey, vinegar, 1 tsp garlic, ginger, and sesame oil.  Place salmon in a shallow dish; sprinkle with 1 1/2 tbsp teriyaki mixture; marinate 15mins.
In a second bowl, toss sprouts with 1 1/2 tsp garlic, 1/2 tbsp canola oil, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. Coat a rimmed sheet pan with cooking spray. Spread brussels sprouts in pan in a single layer; roast until light brown, 5 mins.
In a second bowl, toss mushrooms with remaining 1/2 tbsp canola oil, 1 1/2 tsp garlic, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper.
Move brussels sprouts to the center of the pan; top with salmon; place mushrooms in pan around the edges; roast, stirring mushrooms occasionally, until salmon is cooked through, 8-10 mins.  Top salmon with remaining teriyaki mixture; serve over brussels sprouts and mushrooms
