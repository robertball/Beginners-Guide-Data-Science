Ingredients:
2 pounds fresh asparagus, trimmed
2 portobello mushroom caps, cut into strips
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Combine asparagus and portobello mushrooms in a bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Season with thyme, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine. Spread in one layer on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until asparagus is tender, about 8 minutes. Turn and bake for an additional 8 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of asparagus spears. Season with salt and pepper.
