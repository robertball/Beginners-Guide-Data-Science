Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (3 pound) beef chuck roast
1 large onion, diced
1 (1 ounce) package dry Italian salad dressing mix
1 (1 ounce) package dry Ranch-style dressing mix
1 (1.2 ounce) package brown gravy mix
1 (14.5 ounce) can beef broth
1 cup of water
1 tomato
1 carrots
Mushrooms
Red Potatoes

Directions:
Heat oil in the pressure cooker over medium-high heat with the lid open. Brown the roast on all sides in the hot oil.
In a small cup or bowl, mix together the Italian salad dressing mix, Ranch dressing mix, and gravy mix. Sprinkle them evenly over the roast. ( Can also sprinkle half before brown the beef) Pour in the beef broth + water and add the chopped onion (can also brown the onion first).
Seal and lock pressure cooker, and cook over high heat to build pressure until the indicator sounds (mine whistles). Turn heat down to medium, and cook for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Run under cold water to help release the pressure before unsealing the lid. Add the vegetables & cook for another 15 minutes. You can use the juices as an au jus, or thicken with flour or cornstarch to make a yummy gravy.Serve with noodle or rice.
