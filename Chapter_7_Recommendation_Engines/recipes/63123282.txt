Ingredients:
For the Beignets:
2 cups milk
1 TBL instant yeast
1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
3 1/2 to 4 cups bread flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans
canola oil for frying
For Icing:
3 TBL heavy cream
2 TBL water
1 TBL instant coffee
3 cups powdered sugar

Directions:
In small saucepan over low heat, warm the milk to just lukewarm. You should still be able to comfortably leave your finger in the milk without it feeling too hot.
In bowl of an electric mixer fitted with dough hook, combine the warmed milk, yeast, brown sugar, 3 1/2 cups of flour, baking soda & salt. Mix on low until the ingredients come together & forms a smooth elastic dough. If needed, add the remaining flour, a bit at a time, to form a soft, elastic dough.
Add the pecans & mix just until completely incorporated. Cover, allow to rise in a warm place for 1 hr or until dough doubles in size.
When the dough is ready, line a baking sheet with parchment paper & lightly dust with flour. Lightly dust the counter with flour, turn out dough onto it.
Roll the dough out to 1/2" thick. Using a pizza wheel or dough cutter, cut the dough into 2" squares. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet & cover with clean towel. Let rest for 30 min.
Meanwhile, fill a large pot with about 2" of oil. Heat oil over medium-high until it reaches 375 F. Set a cooling rack over another sheet pan next to stove.
When oil is hot & down has rested, work in batches to fry the beignets. Using slotted spoon, gently lower 3-4 squares into hot oil & fry, turning once, until golden brown, puffed & cooked thru about 3-4 min. Transfer to cooling rack & continue working in batches until all are fried.
In a medium bowl, whish together cream, water & instant coffee until coffee is dissolved. Add the sugar & stir well until mixture is smooth. Add more water or powdered sugar to adjust the consistency to be able to drizzle as thick icing. Drizzle icing over the warm beignets.
