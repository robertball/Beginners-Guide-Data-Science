Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)
1 cup unsalted butter
1 egg, beaten
1 1/4 cups sugar
2 teaspoons milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder, soda, and nutmeg; set aside.
Combine egg, sugar, milk, and vanilla; stir well.  Add flour mixture and combine until moistened. Pat dough into a ball and chill at least 2 hours.
Divide dough in half; store 1 portion in refrigerator.  Roll dough to 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly floured surface.  Cut with a 3-inch cookie cutter, and place on lightly greased cookie sheets or parchment lined cookie sheets.
Bake at 375 degrees for 6 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.  Cool on wire racks.
