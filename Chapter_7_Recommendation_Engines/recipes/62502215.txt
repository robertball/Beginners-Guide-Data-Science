Bake 40 minutes, basting chicken and potatoes every 10 minutes or so with drippings in pan.
Brush chicken with maple syrup and spoon drippings over potatoes, bake additional 20 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink and potatoes are tender.
To serve, arrange chicken, potatoes and garlic on warm platter (or individual plates).  Pour any pan juices over chicken.  Split garlic cloves open and spread on chicken.

Description: 
I've been making this recipe for so many years, I can't remember where I got it from.  It's really quick to throw together.  After fixing it several times, my husband 'discovered' that you were supposed to spread the garlic on the chicken. It's one of his favorites now.
