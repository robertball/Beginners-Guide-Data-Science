Ingredients:
1 cup warm fat free milk (70 to 80 degrees F)
1/4 cup butter or stick margarine, softened
2 eggs, lightly beaten
3 3/4 cups bread flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
TOPPING:
1 egg
2 tablespoons water
2 teaspoons sugar
1/4 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first eight ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed).
When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface; divide into thirds. Shape each into a 20-in. rope. Place ropes on a parchment-lined baking sheet; braid. Pinch ends to seal and tuck under. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.
In a small bowl, beat egg and water; brush over dough. Sprinkle with sugar and almonds. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool.
