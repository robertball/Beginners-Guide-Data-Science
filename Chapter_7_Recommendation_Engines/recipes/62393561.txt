Ingredients:
12 Rhodes frozen rolls (the large ones, if you can find them)
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 Tablespoons cinnamon
1 box vanilla pudding (NOT instant)

Directions:
Grease bundt pan well. Place frozen rolls around pan. Stir together butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, pour over rolls. Sprinkle with dry pudding mix. Cover loosly with plastic wrap and let sit out over night. The next morning, uncover, bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Rolls are done when you tap on one and it sounds hollow.
Let cool 10 minutes, place plate on top of pan and invert to release rolls. Cinnamon mixture will be hot! Be very careful. Rolls can be pulled apart or you can slice the loaf.
Great additions include raisins, nuts and dried cranberries. Sprinkle in with the pudding.
