Ingredients:
1 egg
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1 cup diced onion
1 cup chopped spinach
2 cups shredded low-fat Mexican blend cheese
salt and ground black pepper, to taste
4 whole-grain buns

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Whisk egg in a large bowl until uniform in color; add ground beef, oats, onion, spinach, cheese, salt, and ground black pepper and mix with your hands until well blended. Form the beef mixture into 4 patties.
Grill patties until bottoms are brown, about 5 minutes; flip and continue grilling until brown, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into middle of burgers should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 5 minutes.
Transfer burgers to whole-grain buns.
