Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 (8 ounce) container cold pack aged sharp Cheddar cheese (such as MacLaren's Imperial Sharp Cold Pack Cheddar Cheese product)
1/4 cup finely chopped red onion
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
1 dash hot sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Place cream cheese and cold pack Cheddar cheese in a microwave-safe bowl; slice cheese into chunks with a knife. Microwave cheese in 30-second intervals on high just until softened, stirring between intervals.
Stir red onion, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, paprika, and hot sauce into cheese mixture with a fork until evenly combined; spoon into an airtight container and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Remove cheese spread from refrigerator about 30 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Attention, cheese lovers! This may be the best cheese spread you've ever had! My friend's mother gave me this recipe over 15 years ago. I always make it around the holidays, or for football and hockey game nights. Everyone begs for this recipe. Turn this into a pub spread by adding a half cup of your favorite dark ale. Use brick cream cheese for a spread, or spreadable cream cheese for a dip. Serve with crispy crackers, toast, or bagels.
