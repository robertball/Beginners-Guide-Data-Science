Ingredients:
Broth:
1 1/2 quarts water
1 pound lamb shoulder blade chops
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)
1 large onion, quartered
3 stalks celery, quartered
1 bunch parsley sprigs
10 sprigs fresh thyme, divided
4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
4 whole allspice berries
ground black pepper to taste
4 bay leaves, divided
Stew:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon dried savory
1 tablespoon garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash®)
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 pounds butterflied leg of lamb, trimmed and cut into cubes
3 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
3 rutabagas, diced
4 potatoes, diced
1/2 small head cabbage, chopped
1 (16 ounce) package baby carrots
4 small onions, chopped
1 leek, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1 teaspoon garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash®)

Directions:
Combine water, lamb chops, stout beer, large onion, celery, parsley sprigs, 5 sprigs thyme, garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, allspice, black pepper, and 3 bay leaves in a slow cooker to make broth.
Cook on High until flavors combine, about 4 hours. Let cool, at least 30 minutes. Place lamb chops in a resealable plastic bag. Strain broth into a bowl; discard solids. Refrigerate lamb chops and broth, 8 hours to overnight.
Combine flour, savory, 1 tablespoon garlic and herb seasoning, salt, and pepper in a brown paper bag. Add cubed lamb; shake until coated.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/3 cubed lamb; cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining olive oil and cubed lamb. Transfer browned lamb to the slow cooker.
Skim fat off the chilled broth and pour into the slow cooker. Trim and bone lamb chops; dice lamb meat and add to the slow cooker. Stir in remaining 5 sprigs thyme and bay leaf, rutabagas, potatoes, cabbage, baby carrots, and small onions.
Cook on High until lamb is tender, about 4 hours. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Stir in leek, chopped parsley, and 1 teaspoon garlic and herb seasoning. Cook until flavors combine, 2 to 3 minutes more.

Description: 
While touring Ireland, our family ordered Irish stew at most of the many pubs and restaurants we ate at in order to determine what features we liked best in an Irish stew. This recipe is my attempt to recreate the flavor we preferred. The broth is made the day ahead and I like to use the slow cooker, but the recipe could be adapted for the oven or stovetop.
