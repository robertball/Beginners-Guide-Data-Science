Ingredients:
6 c. diced potatoes
1 can (10 3/4 oz.) condensed cream of chicken soup
1/2 stick butter, melted
1/2 c. milk
1 c. sour cream or plain Greek yogurt
2 c. grated cheddar cheese, or use a mix of cheddar and gruyere
1/4 c. grated onion (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
3/4 c. crushed cornflakes or panko bread crumbs (optional for crumb topping)
Additional 2 T. butter (optional for crumb topping)

Directions:
Prepare the potatoes: Scrub 6-8 medium russet potatoes and wrap in foil. Bake the potatoes in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until they are easily pierced with a fork but not too tender. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel and dice them. If you want, you can substitute plain frozen diced (not shredded) potatoes. Let the potatoes thaw before using them in the recipe.
Combine soup, butter, sour cream or yogurt, milk, cheese, onion, salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Mix well. Add the diced potatoes and stir gently until combined.
Place potato mixture in a 2-3 quart casserole dish or 9 x 13-inch baking pan.
Optional: Mix 2 T melted butter with crushed corn flakes or panko bread crumbs. If using panko, season with a little salt and pepper. Sprinkle crumb mixture over potato mixture.
Bake uncovered at 350 degrees for 30-45 minutes or until hot and bubbly.
