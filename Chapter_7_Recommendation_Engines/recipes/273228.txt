Ingredients:
3/4 cup shortening
1 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup vanilla-flavored soy milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 cups rolled oats
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat shortening, brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in soy milk until well combined.
Mix flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl. Pour over the sugar mixture and mix well. Fold in oats, walnuts, and raisins; cookie dough will be thick.
Scoop out tablespoon-sized balls of dough and drop onto cookie sheets. Press down slightly to flatten cookies.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on the cookie sheets for 2 minutes before removing to cooling racks.
