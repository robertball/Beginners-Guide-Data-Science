Ingredients:
1/8 cup(s) oil, olive, extra-virgin
1 1/2 tablespoon vinegar, red wine
2 teaspoon mustard, Dijon, divided
1/4 teaspoon tarragon, dried
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 tablespoon capers drained and rinsed (optional)
1/2 pounds beef, sirloin well trimmed
2 cup(s) broccoli florets
1 medium pepper(s), yellow, bell cut into 1/2-inch squares

Directions:
Heat the broiler. Or heat a grill to medium-high.
In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, 2 teaspoons of the mustard, the tarragon, and salt. Stir in the capers, if using. Brush both sides of the beef with the remaining 2 teaspoons mustard.
Broil or grill 6 inches from the heat for 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let the beef stand for 5 minutes before cutting across the grain into 1/2" thick slices. Then cut the slices crosswise into 1" squares, reserving any juices that accumulate.
Meanwhile, in a steamer, cook the broccoli for 3 minutes until just barely tender. Add the hot broccoli to the bowl of dressing along with the bell peppers and stir to combine. Stir in the beef and beef juices. Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled.
