Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 cup beef broth
8 ounces portobello mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
1 green bell pepper, cut into strips
1 yellow onion, cut into strips
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 1/2 pounds beef sirloin tips, cubed
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine coconut milk, beef broth, portobello mushrooms, green bell pepper, onion, and sea salt in a 9x13-inch casserole dish; mix well. Add beef tips; stir until well-coated.
Bake in the preheated oven until beef is tender and sauce has thickened, about 1 hour.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Serve beef tips and sauce over pasta.

Description: 
Super quick prep and your family will love it! My children are dairy-intolerant; I have found that coconut milk is an excellent substitute for milk and cream and gives any dish a wonderful flavor. This recipe is gluten-free and dairy-free. It is also wonderful served over rice.
