Ingredients:
4 cuts chicken broth (1 quart) shopping list
1 small onion shopping list
1 Tablespoon butter shopping list
1+1 Tablespoons olive oil shopping list
1 bay leaf shopping list
1 sprig fresh thyme shopping list
salt and pepper shopping list
1 cup arborio rice (or short-grain white rice) shopping list
lots of parmesan cheese shopping list

Directions:
Heat the chicken broth until boiling. Taste the broth and add salt if necessary: it should be salty.
Peel and finely chop onion. Put in a heavy-bottomed saucepan with butter and 1 Tablespoon olive oil. Add bay leaf and thyme. Cook gently on medium heat 4-5 minutes, until onions are soft and clear.
Add rice and cook another 5 minutes, stirring often. Then, ladle onto the rice enough hot chicken broth just to cover the rice. You will hear it bubble and hiss at first. Stir the rice, and lower the heat to a very gentle bubbling. Cook, uncovered, for about 10 minutes, until almost all the broth has been absorbed by the rice.
Add the remaining hot broth and continue cooking at a gentle simmer another 10 minutes or so until the rice is tender but just a little chewy at the center. Near the end of the cooking, stir in another tablespoon of olive oil and taste for salt. Add more if needed. One of the special things about risotto is that there should still be some soupy broth in the pot when the rice is done. Serve it right away with some black pepper and freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
