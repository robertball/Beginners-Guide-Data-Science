1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar

Line a 9-in. pie plate with pastry; flute edges. In a large bowl, combine the apples, butter, sour cream, lemon juice, sugar, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg. Spoon into pastry shell. For topping, combine flour and sugar in a bowl; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over filling.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until the filling is bubbly and the apples are tender. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
I often brown the topping for this special-occasion pie under the broiler to give it extra eye appeal. Watch it carefully, though, because you don't want to burn Thanksgiving dessert! It's a fitting finale for any festive meal.
