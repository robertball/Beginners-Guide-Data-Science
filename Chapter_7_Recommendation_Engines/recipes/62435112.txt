Directions
1. Rinse chicken well under cold running water. Evenly space chicken in an 8x11" shallow glass baking dish. I use an UN-greased dish but a light coating of cooking spray makes clean-up easier. Pour Red French Catalina Style dressing with Orange Zest Mixed into it, liberally over chicken making sure to completely cover each breast. (Don’t skimp on the dressing it makes the resulting sauce taste great.) Sprinkle the packet of French onion soup mix evenly across each piece of chicken. Open the jellied cranberry sauce and while it is still in the can use a Fork to stir it into a consistency resembling jam. Evenly spoon your cranberry sauce across each piece of chicken. At this point add your Sun Dried Tomatoes and Garlic evenly over Breasts, fresh ground Black Pepper to taste. Cover with foil and poke a small vent into foil for steam to escape. Place in preheated 350 degree oven Bake for 15 mins. covered, then remove foil and bake an additional 25-30 mins. Basting occasionally to keep Sun-Dried tomatoes from becoming dry. , or until Breasts when pierced with a fork the juices run clear. Usually about 40-45 minutes combined time, and viola!
