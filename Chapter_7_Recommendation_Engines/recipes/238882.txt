Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup sunflower seed kernels
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
1 cup huckleberries
1 carrot, grated finely
1/4 onion, diced
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is soft and water has been absorbed, about 25 minutes.
Heat a small skillet over medium heat; toast sunflower kernels in hot skillet until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.
Transfer quinoa to a large bowl and fluff with a fork; add sunflower kernels, chickpeas, huckleberries, carrot, onion, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Gently stir the salad until thoroughly mixed; season with salt and pepper.
