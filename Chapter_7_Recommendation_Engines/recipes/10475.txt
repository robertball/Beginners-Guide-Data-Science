Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/4 cup white sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons shortening
2 1/2 tablespoons brandy
2 teaspoons anise seed (optional)
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup vegetable oil for frying
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar for decoration

Directions:
In a large bowl beat together eggs and sugar until thick and light colored. Then beat in shortening, brandy, anise seeds (optional) and salt.  Beat in flour gradually.
On a floured surface, knead dough into a smooth ball. Divide ball into two equal pieces, wrap in waxed paper and chill in refrigerator for at least two hours.
Roll one piece of dough into a rectangle approximately 12 x 15 inches. (The other piece of dough should be left in refrigerator until ready to be rolled.) Using pastry wheel, cut dough into strips 6 x 1 inch.
Make a vertical slit in top 1/3 of the strip and draw the bottom end of it through OR tie a knot in the center.  Repeat with remaining dough and set aside.
Heat oil in a deep frying pan to 360 degrees F (185 degrees C).   Deep fry strips until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, cool, and sprinkle heavily with confectioners'  sugar.
