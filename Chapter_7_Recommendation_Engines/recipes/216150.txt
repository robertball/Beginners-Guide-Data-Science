Ingredients:
1 (15.5 ounce) can white hominy, drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a sheet of aluminum foil.
Pat the rinsed hominy dry with paper towels and place into a mixing bowl. Sprinkle with garlic powder and chili powder. Drizzle with the vegetable oil, and toss until evenly coated. Spread onto the prepared pan in a single layer.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes, until the hominy is crisp and dry, 40 to 50 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature before serving.

Description: 
These are very good. When baked correctly they have almost a Corn NutÂ® consistency. I love garlic powder and chili powder on mine, but feel free to experiment with other seasonings.
