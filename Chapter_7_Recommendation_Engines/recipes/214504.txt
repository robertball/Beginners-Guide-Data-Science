Ingredients:
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons molasses
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Whisk the ketchup, water, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, granulated garlic, and black pepper together in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and continue cooking at a simmer, stirring together, another 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely. Pour into a glass jar and store uncovered in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight. This allows the flavors to blend and reduce any sharpness from the vinegar.

Description: 
I make this in huge batches and made the mistake giving out jars of it to friends. Now I can't keep enough of it around.
