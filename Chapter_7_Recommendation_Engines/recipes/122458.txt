Ingredients:
3 bacon strips
1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons chopped onion
1 garlic clove, minced
3/4 cup dry bread crumbs, divided
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1 (2 pound) beef tenderloin, trimmed
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Remove bacon; crumble and set aside. Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon drippings. In the drippings, saute the mushrooms, onion and garlic until tender. Remove from the heat; stir in 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, parsley and bacon.
Cut a slit lengthwise three-quarters of the way through the tenderloin. Lightly place stuffing in the pocket; close with toothpicks. Combine butter and Parmesan cheese; spread over top and sides of meat. Press the remaining bread crumbs onto butter mixture.
Place meat on rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes. Cover and bake for 1 hour or until meat reaches desired doneness (for rare, a meat thermometer should read 140 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Let stand for 10 minutes and remove toothpicks before slicing.
