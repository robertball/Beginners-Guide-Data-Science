Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked long-grain rice
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (16 ounce) package fresh (refrigerated) stir-fry vegetables
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup classic-style stir-fry sauce
1 tablespoon honey
2 cups chow mein noodles
1/4 cup cashew halves

Directions:
In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
While rice is cooking, cut chicken into 1/2-inch pieces. Spray a 12-inch nonstick skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat. Add chicken; sprinkle with seasoned salt. Stir-fry 4 to 6 minutes or until brown.
Add vegetables and water to skillet and heat to boiling. Reduce heat to medium, cover and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in stir-fry sauce and honey and heat through.
Divide hot cooked rice and chow mein noodles among bowls. Top with chicken mixture, sprinkle with cashews and serve.
