Ingredients:
1 medium onion, cut into medium dice
1/4 green bell pepper, cut into medium dice
1 pound lean ground beef
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 1/2 cups water
3/4 cup uncooked long grain rice
1/2 cup ketchup
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
While chopping onion and bell pepper, cook ground beef in a small soup kettle or Dutch oven until it loses its raw color, about 5 minutes.
Add onions and pepper to beef; cook until tender, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in tomatoes, water, rice, ketchup, cumin, Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rice is fully cooked, about 20 minutes. Stir in cilantro and serve.
