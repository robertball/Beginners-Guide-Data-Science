Ingredients:
Orange Miso Dressing:
1/4 cup miso paste
1/4 cup canola oil
2 tablespoons rice vinegar, or more to taste
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
1 teaspoon peanut butter
1 teaspoon chile garlic sauce
1 (8.8 ounce) package dried soba noodles
2 cups baby spinach
1 cup carrots, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1/2 cup shredded cabbage
1/2 cup sliced snow peas
8 cherry tomatoes
16 cooked shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 green onions, finely chopped
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Whisk miso paste, canola oil, rice vinegar, orange zest, orange juice, ginger, mirin, peanut butter, and chile garlic sauce together in a bowl until dressing is blended.
Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Stir in soba noodles and return water to a boil. Boil noodles until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander under cold running water until cool, about 1 minute. Toss cooked soba noodles with 1/2 of the miso dressing in a large bowl until thoroughly coated.
Divide spinach among 4 serving bowls; top each with 1/4 of the dressed noodles. Divide carrots, cabbage, snow peas, and cherry tomatoes among each bowl; top each with 4 shrimp. Drizzle remaining miso dressing onto each bowl to taste; sprinkle with green onions and toasted sesame seeds.
