Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup powdered sugar
2 cups flour
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Heat oven to 350. Add all ingredients to a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer for about two minutes. The dough will be crumbly and start to stick together. Form into a ball of dough with your hands. If dough is still crumbly add in an additional 1 â€“ 2 Tbsp softened butter.
Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface and cut into small shapes with cookie cutters or the end of a drinking glass. Place cookies a half inch apart on a baking sheer lined with parchment paper. Add sprinkles, if desired.
Bake for 14-16 minutes until just set and bottoms are very lightly browned. Immediately remove from cookie sheet onto a cooling rack to cool completely.
