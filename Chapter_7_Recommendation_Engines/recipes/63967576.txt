Ingredients:
Salt (1 tsp)
Pepper (3/4 tsp)
10 Cloves of garlic
1 Cup olive oil
8 Anchovy filets
3 Raw Eggs
1 and 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 Lemons (seeded and juiced)
2 Limes (seeded and juiced)
Dry Mustard (1/2 tsp)
Sugar (1/2 tsp)
Two heads Romaine Lettuce
1.5 cups medium grated Parmagiano-Reggiano cheese
1 Bag Texas Toast Caesar Croutons

Directions:
1. Wash Romaine Lettuce and pad dry with some paper towels.  Cut up the leaves to your liking and place in a large bowl.
2. Grate Parmagiano-Reggiano and place over the top of the prepared greens.
3. Add the croutons to the bowl; at this point you're ready to prepare the dressing.
4. Combine the Salt, Pepper, Garlic, Olive Oil, Anchovies, Eggs, Worcestershire Sauce, Lemon/Lime Juice, Dry Mustard, and Sugar into a blender
5. Blend the mixture on a high setting until the dressing begins to thicken and turn white (the longer you blend it, the more firm/creamy the texture will be).
6. Pour over prepared salad and toss. (Note: You will not need ALL of the dressing, start out by using half and then work your way up).

Description: 
My family loves Caesar dressings and several years ago we stumbled across this one online... we added some more garlic and anchovies to it and we've been preparing it like this ever since.  Hope you enjoy!
