Ingredients:
1 (5 1/2 pound) bone-in turkey breast, halved
1 medium lemon, halved
1 teaspoon salt-free lemon pepper seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic salt
4 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth

Directions:
Remove skin from turkey. Pat turkey dry with paper towels; spray turkey with nonstick cooking spray. Place breast side up in a slow cooker. Squeeze half of the lemon over turkey; sprinkle with lemon-pepper and garlic salt. Place lemon halves under turkey. Cover and cook on low for 5-7 hours or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F. Remove turkey and keep warm. Discard lemon.
For gravy, pour cooking liquid into a measuring cup; skim fat. In a saucepan, combine cornstarch and broth until smooth. Gradually stir in cooking liquid. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with turkey.

Description: 
Lemon and a hint of garlic add a lovely touch to these moist slices of slow-cooked turkey breast. I usually serve the gravy over a combination of white and brown rice, along with broccoli for a healthy meal.                                             --Lynn Laux of Ballwin, Missouri
