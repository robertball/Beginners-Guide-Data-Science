Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
2 red bell peppers, chopped
1 large Spanish onion, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, diced, or more to taste
2 cups salsa
1 cup sour cream
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning
1 (1 pound) package processed cheese (such as Velveeta®), cubed
1 cup grated Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add red bell peppers, onion, and jalapeno pepper; saute until onion is just translucent, about 5 minutes.
Mix salsa, sour cream, and taco seasoning together in a large, oven-safe casserole dish. Add the turkey mixture and processed cheese. Mix well. Top with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is bubbling, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This ground turkey dip is the most asked-for recipe ever. Enjoyed it at a party, and ever since it's all I take when I'm asked to bring something. Serve with scoop-style tortilla chips (such as Tostitos®) or pita bread cut into eighths.
