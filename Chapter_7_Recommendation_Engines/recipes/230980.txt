Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (4 pound) beef pot roast
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
3 large potatoes, quartered
3 carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
1 onion, sliced
1/3 cup vinegar
1/3 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook beef in Dutch oven until browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Mix brown sugar, salt, mustard, and black pepper together in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the roast. Arrange potatoes, carrots, and onion in the Dutch oven around the roast. Pour vinegar and water over the vegetables.
Place a cover on the Dutch oven and put in preheated oven. Cook until the roast is hot in the center, and just turning from pink to grey, about 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C).
