Ingredients:
5-6 oz. pre-cooked roast pork
1 tbsp mascarpone cheese
1 tbsp mustard
1 tbsp olive mayonaise
1 tsp Crystal hot sauce (or six drops of Tabasco - Others change flavor)
1 tbsp dry feta cheese
2-3 garlic chive stems
2 cornichons (small 1" long sour pickles)
2 hearts of palm
1/2 tsp ground pepper
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp paprika or achiote (for color)
1/8 tsp dried thyme
Salt to taste

Directions:
Put all ingredients into a food processor. Pulse chop, stopping to scrape down the bowl periodically. When the ingredients are fine chopped and form something of a ball, stop. You are going for integration of the pieces so you don't taste individual ingredients.

Description: 
I had real deviled ham (home made) once when I was a kid, and never found anything in a can like it. This is a Cajun take on the classic, using roast pork leftovers instead of ham, with a few fun ingredients to kick it up a notch!
