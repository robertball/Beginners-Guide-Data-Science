Ingredients:
1/4 cup raspberry jelly
1/4 cup prepared dijon
1/4 cup mayonaise
1 box frozen whole grain waffles
1/2 pound turkey deli meat, shaved
1/2 pound black forest deli ham, shaved
1 package Deli Swiss cheese
3 eggs
1/4 cup milk
Butter flavored cooking spray

Directions:
Mix dijon and mayonaise together. Spread one waffle with raspberry jelly and a second waffle with dijonaise. Layer small portions of turkey, ham and swiss on one waffle and top with the second to make it a sandwich. Press together well. Wisk 3 eggs in 1/4 cup milk. Dip the sandwich in the egg batter and then cook each side in a medium heat skillet coated with butter flavored cooking spray.

Description: 
This is a healthier take on the classic Monte Cristo. Would make a great sandwich for a brunch. You can sprinkle with powdered sugar for the true Monte Cristo affect, but it sweet enough in my opinion because of the jelly and waffles.
