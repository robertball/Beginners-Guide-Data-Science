1 Pillsbury pie crust or homemade
1 egg
1 cup almond meal (or grind up almonds)
1/2 cup powdered sugar
10 small fresh apricots, pitted and quartered
1/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup apricot jam, melted

Directions:
Mix together the almond meal, powdered sugar and egg to create a paste.
Roll out pie crust onto a baking sheet.
Spread almond paste leaving about 1/2 inch around the edge of the crust.
Toss together apricots and sugar. Spread on top of the almond paste.
Take the edges of the crust and fold over the paste and apricots and crimp the edges as you go around.
Bake for 40 minutes or until crust is golden brown.
Melt the apricot jam in the microwave. Use a pastry brush to brush jam over the hot galette as a glaze.
