Description: 
My Mom's Swedish meatball recipe. This isn't the kind a lot of people are used to in a creamy white sauce. She served them every Christmas Eve in a chafing dish as part of the Smörgåsbord. My Mom used to have a vegetable sour cream and a lingonberry sauce on the table for those that might want to dip these in something
