Ingredients:
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
2  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix
9  lasagna noodles
1 cup Alfredo sauce, or as desired
1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste
¼ cup crumbled cooked bacon, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch dried oregano, or more to taste
1 pinch garlic salt, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine evaporated milk, chicken, and ranch dressing mix in a skillet over medium heat; cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. Shred chicken.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and dry on paper towels.
Spread Alfredo sauce over each noodle; top with shredded chicken.
Combine mozzarella cheese, bacon, oregano, and garlic salt in a bowl; sprinkle over chicken layer. Roll each noodle around the filling and place rolls in an 8-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes.
