Bake at 375 degrees F for 5 minutes; cool completely. In a mixing bowl, beat milk and pudding mix for 2 minutes or until thickened. Immediately stir in peanut butter and chocolate. Fold in whipped topping. Spread over cooled crust. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
