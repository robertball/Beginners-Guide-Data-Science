Ingredients:
1/2 cup corn oil or 1/2 cup canola oil or 1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup vegetable shortening, room temperature ( Crisco shortening is good)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Place all ingredients in a mixing bowl.
Using an electric mixer beat until mixture has increased in volume slightly and resembles marshmallow cream.
Place in a container with a lid and store on the counter or in a cupboard (in hot weather it may be refrigerated).
The mixture tends to separate slightly upon sitting in your cupboard or refrigerator so mix before using, then brush pans using a pastry brush or a clean paper towel.

Description: 
If you bake and cook everyday then this is a must to have in your cupboard, it's so much cheaper than using cooking spray and works even better than Pam cooking spray, no chemical fumes and will not leave burnt on black residue on the edges of your pans like cooking spray will and will keep forever in your cupboard.
For baking recipes using chocolate you may use 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder in place of white flour or 1/4 cup each cocoa powder and flour
