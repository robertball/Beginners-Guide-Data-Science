Ingredients:
1 (8.8 ounce) package King's Hawaiian® Snacker Rolls
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
2 pinches powdered garlic
1 (12 ounce) can tuna packed in water, drained and lightly flaked
4 teaspoons finely chopped onion
4 teaspoons finely chopped celery
4 teaspoons sweet pickle relish
1/2 teaspoon chopped parsley
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
2 slices sharp Cheddar cheese, cut in half
8 slices tomato

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl, combine mayonnaise, salt, pepper and powdered garlic. Then add the tuna, onion, celery, sweet pickle relish, parsley and lemon juice. Lightly toss to evenly mix all ingredients. Set aside.
Preheat oven broiler.
Separate Snacker Rolls into 4 bottoms and 4 tops and set all on a baking sheet. Place a half slice of cheese on the cut side of each roll bottom and a quarter of the tuna mix on the cut side of each roll top.
Set the baking sheet under the broiler until cheese is melted and tuna is warmed.
Remove from oven. On each bottom, place two slices of tomato and combine the two halves of the sandwiches. Serve with Caesar or fruit salad. Serve immediately.
