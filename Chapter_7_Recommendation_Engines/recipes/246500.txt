Ingredients:
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 pound pork belly, cut into bite-size pieces
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 cups prepared dashi stock
1 cup kimchi, cut into bite-size pieces
2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean chile paste)
1 tablespoon gochugaru (Korean chile powder)
1/2 (12 ounce) package tofu, cut into 1/2-inch squares
1 cup zucchini, cut into bite-size pieces
1 small onion, sliced
2 green chile peppers, sliced
2 green onions, sliced

Directions:
Heat sesame oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir garlic into pork mixture and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir dashi stock and kimchi into the pork mixture; bring to a boil. Stir in gochujang and gochugaru; simmer until stew is thickened slightly, about 20 minutes.
Stir tofu, zucchini, onion, and green chile peppers into the stew; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and garnish with green onion.
