Image:

Ingredients:
2 whole wheat tortillas (10 inch diameter)
3 cups fresh spinach leaves (1/3 prewashed package)
2/3 cup cheddar cheese, shredded
1 green onion, chopped
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp chili powder

Directions:
Heat a non-stick pan on medium-high heat. Place 1 tortilla shell onto the pan.
Sprinkle 1/3 cup cheddar cheese evenly over the tortilla. Top with spinach, green onions, garlic powder, chili powder and remaining cheese. Place the second tortilla ontop of the spinach mound.
Cook for 3 minutes, or until the bottom tortilla starts to develop a bit of colour and starts to crisp. To flip and cook the other side, slide the quesadilla off the non-stick pan onto a dinner plate, cover with another dinner plate and flip. The crispy tortilla side should now be on top. Slide the quesadilla back onto the pan and cook for another 3 minutes, or until the bottom tortilla starts turning crisp.
Slide onto a cutting board, and cut into 8 wedges.

Description: 
A super quick & easy light dinner. This also makes a great snack or appetizer. It looks like a lot of spinach at first, but it shrinks down a lot in no time during cooking. Other types of tortillas can be used if whole wheat isn't available. Serve with salsa and sour cream.
