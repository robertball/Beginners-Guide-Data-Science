Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked bean threads (cellophane noodles)
1 large dried shiitake mushroom
1 pound ground pork
1/2 pound shrimp, chopped
1 large carrot, peeled and grated
1 small shallot, minced
2 1/4 teaspoons Vietnamese fish sauce
1 1/4 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 1/4 teaspoons ground black pepper
24 egg roll wrappers
1 egg, beaten
oil for deep frying

Directions:
Soak vermicelli and shiitake mushroom in warm water until pliable, about 15 minutes; drain well. Mince shiitake.
Combine vermicelli, shiitake, pork, shrimp, carrot, shallot, fish sauce, sugar, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Toss well to break up pork and and evenly distribute filling ingredients.
Lay 1 egg roll wrapper diagonally on a flat surface. Spread a scant 2 tablespoons of filling across the center of the wrapper. Fold bottom corner over filling, then fold in side corners to enclose filling. Brush egg on top corner of wrapper and continue rolling to seal. Make additional egg rolls in same manner.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer, wok, or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), or until a drop of water jumps on the surface.
Fry egg rolls until golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels or paper bags.

Description: 
These egg rolls freeze really well, so go ahead and make a double batch. Add shredded cabbage or julienned taro for a different twist. Add minced crab to make it even more flavorful.
