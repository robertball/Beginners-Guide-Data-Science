Ingredients:
FOR THE CRUMBLE
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup butter
FOR THE PIE
6 cups peeled and sliced pears
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
unbaked pie crust

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine the flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and Cheddar cheese. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Toss the sliced pears with the lemon juice. Combine the 1/2 cup brown sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Add the sugar mixture to the pears and toss to coat.
Transfer the pears to the pie crust and top with the crumble mixture.  Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 45 minutes.
