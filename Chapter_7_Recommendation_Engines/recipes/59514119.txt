Ingredients:
2/3 pound ground beef
2 cup cooked long grain white rice (regular or instant)
4 green bell peppers
1 1/2 cups marinara sauce
1teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup mozzarella
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a skillet over medium heat, cook the beef until evenly browned.  Do not drain.
In the pan the beef was cooked in, mix the browned beef, cooked rice, a generous 3/4 cup of maranara sauce and the worcestershire sauce.
Remove and discard the tops, seeds, and membranes of the bell peppers. Arrange peppers in a baking dish that fits in the toaster oven with the hollowed sides facing upward. The dish can be shallow.  Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary so that they will stand upright. Spoon an equal amount of the mixture into each hollowed pepper.
Spoon the second cup of sauce over the peppers.
Bake 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the peppers are tender. Sprinkle with the cheese and bake for 10 more minutes.
