Ingredients:
1 cup zucchini, grated
1 large egg
1/4 medium onion, diced
3 garlic cloves (minced)
1/4 cup reduced fat sharp cheddar cheese, grated
1/4 cup seasoned breadcrumbs
salt and pepper to taste
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450°.  Spray a muffin tin with cooking spray.
Grate the zucchini into a clean dish towel.  Wring all of the excess water out of the zucchini. In a medium bowl, combine all of the ingredients and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Fill each muffin section half-way, pushing down on the filling with your spoon so it's nice and compacted so they don't fall apart when you take them out of the tin.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the tops are golden.
Use a plastic knife or rubber spatula around the edges of each tot to remove them from the muffin tin. Enjoy!!
