Description: 
I made this up to go with some apple wine a friend had given us. It was quite possibly the best chicken I have ever roasted. I love cooking the chicken in a cast iron roasting pan sitting on a bed of chopped apple, onion, and garlic. Place thawed whole chicken in chilled brine and refrigerate 18 to 24 hours. Roast chicken as usual.
