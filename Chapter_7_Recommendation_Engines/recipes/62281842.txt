Ingredients:
4 (flash-frozen) boneless skinless chicken breasts
1-2 T. butter
1-2 T. olive oil
1/2 tsp garlic salt
1/2 tsp dried fines herbs
1/4 tsp dried rosemary
1/4 tsp dried oregano leaves
1/4 tsp dried marjoram leaves
1/4 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Line baking pan with foil.  Place frozen breasts in pan.  Melt butter; add oil.  Add the garlic salt, pepper, and each of the dried herbs, crushing herbs between fingers to release maximum flavor.  Stir well with fork.  Spoon 1/4 of the oil mixture over 1 breast, quickly brushing with a pastry brush to spread evenly and cover top.  Repeat for each piece of chicken.
Bake at 350 for 45 minutes, or until done.
