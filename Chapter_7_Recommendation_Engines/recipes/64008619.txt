Ingredients:
1 gallon water
5 tea bags (I recommend jasmine tea, but any green tea will do)
3/4 cup sugar or more to taste
3/4 cup passion fruit syrup
fresh passion fruits (enough to make 1 1/4 cups pulp)

Directions:
Boil the water and pour it into a large pitcher.
Add tea bags and steep 4 minutes.
Remove tea bags and add sugar.
Place the pitcher in the fridge to cool.  (To speed the cooling process, use less boiling water and add ice cubes until it equals 1 gallon.)
When tea is cool, add passion fruit syrup.
Cut open passion fruits and scoop pulp into a measuring cup.  You need at least 1 1/4 cups of it, but you may want to add more.
Add passion pulp to contents of pitcher and stir well.
Can be stored in the fridge for several days.  Stir again before pouring into glasses, and serve with ice.
