Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1 lb italian bulk sausage
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 (29 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
12 dry lasagna noodles
2 eggs, beaten
1 pint part-skim ricotta cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a skillet over medium heat, brown ground beef and sausage, onion and garlic; drain fat. Mix in basil, oregano, brown sugar, diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Simmer for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles, and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or until al dente; drain. Lay noodles flat on towels, and blot dry.
In a medium bowl, mix together eggs, ricotta, Parmesan cheese, parsley and 1 teaspoon salt.
Layer 1/3 of the lasagna noodles in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover noodles with 1/2 ricotta mixture, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese and 1/3 of the sauce. Repeat. Top with remaining noodles and sauce. Sprinkle additional Parmesan cheese over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

Best Lasagna I've ever made and keeps the men in family coming back to moms for dinner. Prepare up to 2 days in advance, if desired, and chill covered in the refrigerator until ready to bake. Increase the baking time by about 15 minutes.Modified from: American Lasagna
