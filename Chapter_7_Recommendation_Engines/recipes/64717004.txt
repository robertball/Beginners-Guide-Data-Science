Ingredients:
½ cup (1 stick) butter
½ tsp chili powder (or more to taste)
4 ears corn (whole, not shucked)
½ cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat grill to 375°F.
Cut the butter in chunks and place in the measuring cup; add the chili powder.
Microwave the mixture for about 1 minute, until melted.
Stir the mixture until combined.
Place the corn as is--in the husk (not shucked, cleaned or soaked) on the grill.
Grill for about 15-20 minutes, rotating every 5 minutes or so.
Let cool for a bit after removing from the grill, then pull the husks down (you can now use this as your handle) and remove any silk.
(TIP: Watch the video for this technique.)
Place the corn on plates and spoon the butter mixture over each ear.
Generously sprinkle feta cheese over the top of each ear.
Yum! (TIP: Keep the dental floss handy.)
