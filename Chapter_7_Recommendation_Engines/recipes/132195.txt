Ingredients:
4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate
1/2 cup vegetable shortening
2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Melt the chocolate and shortening in a saucepan over low heat. Remove from heat and mix in sugar and vanilla. Beat in eggs 1 at a time.  In a bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Stir in the chocolate mixture and nuts. Chill dough in the refrigerator 3 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
Place confectioners' sugar in a bowl. Roll dough into 1 inch balls. Roll dough balls in confectioners' sugar to coat. Arrange 3 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. The cookies will look soft when removed from the oven. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Enjoy!
