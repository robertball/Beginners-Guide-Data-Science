Ingredients:
1 quart oil for deep frying
1 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup yellow cornmeal
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
1 1/4 cups milk
1/4 cup honey
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 pounds hot dogs
wooden sticks
cornstarch

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in the egg, milk, and honey. Mix until everything is smooth and well blended.
Dredge the hot dogs in cornstarch, shaking or wiping off excess. Insert wooden sticks into the ends. Dip the hot dogs in the batter one at a time, shaking off the excess. Deep fry a few at a time in the hot oil until they are as brown as you like them. Drain on paper towels or serve on paper plates.
