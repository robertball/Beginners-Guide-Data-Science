Ingredients:
1 lb pork loin
1 tbsp butter
1/2 yellow onion, sliced
2 tbsp fresh tarragon, chopped
Dry Onion soup mix, full packet
14 oz whole cranberry sauce
2 tbsp Dijon mustard, or more to taste
Salt and Pepper, to taste
1 tbsp corn starch

Directions:
Pat dry, and season pork loin with salt and pepper to taste, on all sides.
Turn on Sauté setting on Instapot and once hot, add butter to melt.
Sauté loin on all sides roughly 1 minute a side, just until some color shows.
Turn sauté off, and add sliced onions, cranberry sauce, Dijon, diced tarragon, and dry onion mix.
Gently combine, and make sure to pat some on top of loin.
Cover and cook for 9 minutes on manual setting.
Allow to naturally release, around 10 minutes.
Once opened, take temperature to ensure it’s cooked to 180-185 degrees. Will continue to rise slightly once out.
Place on cutting board to allow to rest for 8-10 minutes before slicing thinly.
While resting meat, put Instapot back on sauté setting and add cornstarch.
Whisk for 2-5 minutes until thick sauce forms.
Top loin with sauce, and serve with sweet potatoes and veggies.
Note: Sauce makes enough for 2 loins, if you need additional meat. I just love lots of sauce.
Note: I made this recently and didn’t have terragon on hand. I substituted 1-2 tsp of dried marjoram and was great.
