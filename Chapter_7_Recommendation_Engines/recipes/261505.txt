Ingredients:
1/4 pound ground pork
1/4 pound ground beef
1 egg white
3 tablespoons panko bread crumbs, or more as needed
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 carrots, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1 parsnip, diced
1/2 cup minced onion
1 tablespoon herbes de Provence
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 cups chicken broth
1 cup orzo pasta
2 cups chopped fresh spinach
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Mix pork, beef, egg white, bread crumbs, and Italian seasoning together in a bowl. Form very small, pea-sized meatballs.
Heat oil in a soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add carrots, celery, parsnip, onion, herbes de Provence, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until vegetables are soft, 7 to 10 minutes.
Pour chicken broth into the pot; bring to a boil. Add the mini meatballs and orzo pasta. Reduce heat to low; let simmer until flavors combine, 15 to 20 minutes. Add spinach; cook until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Garnish with Parmesan cheese.

This is my favorite soup recipe that I started making after, funnily enough, I got married! The local paper published it, too. Garnish with parsley, and serve!
