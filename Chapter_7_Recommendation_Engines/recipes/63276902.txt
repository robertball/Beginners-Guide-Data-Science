Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tablespoon dried sage, crumbled
1 tsp Tony's Chachere's*
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/2 teaspoon dried fennel, crushed
Pinch of ground nutmeg
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 large egg white

Directions:
Mix all ingredients, except egg white, together in a medium bowl.
Add the egg white and combine thoroughly.
Cover and chill for at least 15 minutes, but best chilled overnight.
To easily form the sausage patties, rinse your hands in cold water.
Divide the mixture into eighths and shape each portion into a 2 1/2-inch disk.
Patties can be made to this point and refrigerated or frozen until ready to use.
Use a cast iron skillet for best results.
Fry the sausages on both sides until completely cooked through and golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.
Drain and serve immediately

Homemade sausage patties are leaps and bounds better than store bought.  Ground pork is cheap, so it makes this breakfast side dish not only delicious but also affordable.
