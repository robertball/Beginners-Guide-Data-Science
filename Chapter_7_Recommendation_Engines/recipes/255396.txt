Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large zucchini, chopped
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 yellow onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 cups trimmed fresh green beans
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Poke about 10 holes into spaghetti squash; place in a baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until spaghetti squash is softened and partially cooked, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven; cool until easily handled. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut spaghetti squash in half and seed. Pull the squash flesh from the peel with a fork.
Heat oil in a braising pan over medium-high heat. Add zucchini, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add bell pepper, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until flavors combine, about 3 minutes. Stir in green beans; cook until bright green, about 2 minutes.
Stir diced tomatoes and Italian seasoning into the pan; simmer until tomatoes are warm, about 5 minutes. Add spaghetti squash; toss until combined. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until spaghetti squash is tender, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This was certainly the hit of the party. I served this paleo pasta primavera with my paleo pork roast loin and it disappeared right in front of me! Keep warm until ready to serve.
