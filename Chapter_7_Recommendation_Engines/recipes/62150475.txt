Description: 
After graduating college, I loafed around in Mexico for a few months under the pretense of learning Spanish to give me an edge in my field.  I rented a little converted apartment above the garage of a wonderful Mexican family who took me in under their wing.  The mother made this very flavorful soup with all these interesting textures.  It was my favorite dish of the whole trip.  I had to watch her make this soup and literally count out all the ingredients because she made this soup from her heart, not from a recipe.
