Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, thinly sliced
1/2 cup white wine
12 ounces cooked crabmeat
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/4 pound seedless red grapes, halved
4 ounces Stilton cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat,  add mushrooms and white wine. Cook stirring until mushrooms are slightly softened, and about 1/4 cup white wine remains. Remove the mushrooms, and set aside.
Arrange the crabmeat in the bottom of a small baking dish. Layer with the mushrooms, green onions, and grapes. Drizzle with the butter and wine mixture, and top with Stilton cheese.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the dish is heated through and bubbly.

Description: 
This is a very different yet wonderful way to serve crab. Everyone I have ever served it to was pleasantly surprised. Living in the NW we love our crab. You can use blue cheese instead, if you can't locate Stilton.
