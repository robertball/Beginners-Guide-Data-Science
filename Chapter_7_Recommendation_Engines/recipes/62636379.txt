Ingredients:
10 corn tortillas
1 cup fat free refried black beans
1/2 cup grated cheese
1/4 cup chopped green onion
2 Tbls oil

1/2 cup plain yogurt

Directions:
Make 5 quesedillas with black beans, cheese and green onion.
Heat oil over medium high heat in a 12 inch skillet.
Fry quesedillas in oil 2 minutes each side until crispy.  They will overlap slightly, but that's okay.
Meanwhile, mix enchilada sauce and yogurt.
Pour sauce mixture over quesedillas.  Reduce heat.  Cook for another minute or two.
