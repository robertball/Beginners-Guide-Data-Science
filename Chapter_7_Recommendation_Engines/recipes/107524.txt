Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup white wine
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 small shallot, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
8 (5 ounce) lamb loin chops

Directions:
In a small bowl, blend the oil, vinegar, wine, garlic, shallots, tarragon, salt and pepper. Place lamb chops in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in marinade, seal and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.
Place lamb chops on the grill; cook until grill marks form, about 5-6 minutes per side for medium, or to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Discard remaining marinade. Remove from grill, let rest 5 minutes and serve.
