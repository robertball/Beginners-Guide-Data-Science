Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup margarine, melted and cooled, butter
2 tablespoons anise extract, lemon oil

4 teaspoons baking powder

Directions:
Beat eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until fluffy. Stir in the melted margarine and anise extract. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir in gradually. Dough will be sticky.
