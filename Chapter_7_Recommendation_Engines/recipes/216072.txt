Ingredients:
1 brain-shaped gelatin mold
4 (3 ounce) packages peach flavored Jell-O® mix
3 cups boiling water
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 1/2 cups peach schnapps
4 drops blue food coloring
2 drops red food coloring
2 teaspoons water

Directions:
Lightly oil a brain-shaped gelatin mold.
Stir the peach gelatin mix with boiling water in a bowl to dissolve the gelatin. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Mix in the evaporated milk and peach schnapps; pour into the prepared mold. Refrigerate until set, 4 to 6 hours.
To decorate, dip the mold in very warm water (don't let the water enter the top of the mold) to loosen; invert the mold on a serving platter and lift to leave the brain in place. Mix blue and red food coloring in a small bowl with 2 teaspoons of water. Use a small clean paintbrush to paint the coloring into the grooves of the brain. Return the brain to the refrigerator until the food coloring sets. Serve cold.

Description: 
This spooky Halloween treat is scarily realistic! A non-alcoholic version may also be made for the kiddies by substituting the peach schnapps with water.
