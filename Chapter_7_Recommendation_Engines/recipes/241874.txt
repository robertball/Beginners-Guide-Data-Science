Ingredients:
1 cup dried chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pinch ground cumin, or to taste
1 pinch paprika, or to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place chickpeas in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand for 24 hours. Drain and dry on paper towels.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pour chickpeas into a baking dish; drizzle olive oil over the top and season with cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Stir to coat chickpeas.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 20 minutes, until crispy and fragrant, about 1 hour. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
There's a Mexican joint Michele and I go to once in a while that serves a complimentary bowl of spicy, fried chickpeas when you sit down to eat. It's a very nice touch, and a periodic reminder of what a great, highly-addictive snack this is. As in, only make single batches at a time, because you will eat everything you make. Season with any combination of spices that you like.
