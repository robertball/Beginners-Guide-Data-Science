Ingredients:
Dough
6 to 7 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
4 teaspoons RapidRise Yeast (or 2 packets)
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 cup water
1 cup milk
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 large egg
Filling
1 1/2 lbs ground beef
5 cups shredded cabbage
1 medium onion diced
1/2 cup diced celery
1/4 cup diced carrots
2 cloves garlic minced
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons season salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper
1 teaspoon extra hot Sriracha
1 teaspoon caraway seeds

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, and salt.
Heat water, milk, and oil until very warm (120° to 130°F).
Gradually add liquids to flour mixture.
Beat 2 minutes at medium speed (speed 2 of KitchenAid) of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally.
Add eggs and 2 cups flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed (speed 4 on KitchenAid).
Stir in 2 cups of flour.
Add 1/2 cup at a time of remaining flour to make a soft dough.
Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes (or knead with KitchenAid hook for 2 minutes on speed 2)
Cover and let rest 10 minutes.
Divide dough into 2 equal pieces; roll each to a large rectangle and slice into 8 equal sections (16 total).
Scoop about 1/4 cup beef and cabbage filling in the center of each section; moisten edges. Bring the 4 corners up to center and pinch edges closed to seal. Place on greased baking sheets pinched side down.
Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.
Bake in oven pre-heated to 400 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes.
