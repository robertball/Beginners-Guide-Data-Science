Ingredients:
12 slices bacon
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 (9 ounce) package white cake mix, batter prepared as directed on package
1 teaspoon maple flavored extract
1/4 cup maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 9 inch round cake pan.
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until lightly browned but still soft, about 7 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.  Place the bacon on the bottom of the greased cake pan, overlapping slices as necessary to fit.  Sprinkle the bacon strips with the brown sugar.
Combine the prepared cake batter, maple extract, and maple syrup in a large bowl, mixing well.  Pour the batter over the brown sugar and bacon in the cake pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 15-20 minutes.  Cool cake slightly and remove from pan by inverting onto a serving platter.  Cut into wedges to serve.
