Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup unsalted butter, chilled in freezer and cut into thin slices
1 cup cold heavy cream
egg wash:
2 tablespoons heavy cream or buttermilk
1 egg
1 tablespoon melted butter
1 teaspoon confectioners sugar
1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and baking soda together in a large bowl.
Cut butter into flour mixture with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 5 minutes.
Make a well in the center of butter and flour mixture. Pour in 1 cup heavy cream; stir until just combined.
Turn dough onto a floured work surface, pat together into a rectangle.
Fold the rectangle in thirds. Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle. Repeat twice more, folding and pressing dough a total of three times.
Roll dough on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thick.
Cut out 6 triangular scones.
Mix egg wash ingredients in small bowl
Transfer scones to the prepared baking sheet.
Brush the tops and bottoms of scones with egg wash, then sprinkle generously with sugar
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes, brushing the tops with egg wash again at 5 and 10 minutes.
