Ingredients:
2 Anjou pears
1 Red Delicious apple

Directions:
Cut pears and apple into quarters. Remove and discard seeds, stems, labels, and any other undesirable bits. Transfer flesh and skin of fruit into a high-powered blender (such as NutriBullet(R)).
Blend until pear applesauce is liquefied. Pour into a bowl. Refrigerate before serving, if desired.

Description: 
Apples are okay, but pears are divine. I wanted to figure out how to make a simple pear sauce because I like pears far more than apples. It had to be simple, quick, fresh, and above all else, easy to clean-up. So I decided to experiment and started with the most basic recipe possible. I love the flavor, and you can't get much simpler: 3 pieces of raw fruit, a knife, cutting board, blender, and 2 bowls.
