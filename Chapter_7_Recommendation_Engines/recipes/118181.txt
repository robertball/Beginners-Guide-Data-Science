1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
2 (6.5 ounce) jars marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
4 eggs
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

In a small skillet, saute onion and garlic in oil until tender. Stir in artichokes. Remove from the heat; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, parsley, salt, pepper, oregano and hot pepper sauce. Stir in the cheese, cracker crumbs and artichoke mixture.
Pour into a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10-15 minutes before cutting into 1-in. squares. Serve warm.
