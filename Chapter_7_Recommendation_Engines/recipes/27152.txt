2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup NESTLE® CARNATION® Evaporated Milk
1/3 cup water
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
CHIMICHANGAS:
1 1/2 cups water
6 ounces dried apricots, chopped
3 ounces dried apples, chopped

1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
12 (8 inch) soft taco-size flour tortillas
