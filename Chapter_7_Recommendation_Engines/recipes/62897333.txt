Ingredients:
3 ounces unsweetened chocolate
2 teaspoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Pinch sea salt
6 tablespoons xylitol, powdered, OR 7 tablespoons erythritol, powdered
Pinch stevia extract
4-6 teaspoons water

Directions:
Powder xylitol or erythritol in coffee grinder with pinch of sea salt.
Chop chocolate finely.
Melt together unsweetened chocolate and butter in a double boiler, stirring occasionally until smooth.
Stir in cream and sweetener mixture, and whisk until smooth.
Remove from heat and add vanilla and water. Add more water to thin it out if necessary. Taste and adjust sweetness with a bit more stevia or powdered erythritol, as necessary. Keep in mind that the sauce will firm up over ice cream. Store in a jar in the refrigerator, and reheat and whisk well to use.
