Ingredients:
14 oz canned Coconut milk
1/4 cup Maple syrup, pure
1 cup Palm sugar
1 Small pinch Sea salt
1/4 tsp Vanilla extract
2 tbsp Coconut oil

Directions:
In a small heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the coconut milk, palm sugar, and maple syrup. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes and then remove from heat.
Whisk in the coconut oil, vanilla, and sea salt.
Allow the Caramel Sauce to cool for 20 minutes. A thin film will naturally form over the top of the sauce; this is perfectly normal. Simply give the sauce a good whisk before pouring it into a glass airtight container (I use a canning jar). The sauce will continue to thicken (although not much) while it cools.
Store in the refrigerator. Can be served warm or cold. Use within 5-7 days.
