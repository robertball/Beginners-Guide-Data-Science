Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
1 pinch dried parsley, or to taste
1 pinch Italian seasoning, or to taste
1 cup spaghetti sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
15 shells jumbo pasta shells
2 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef, garlic salt, dried parsley, and Italian seasoning. Cook and stir until beef is browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix in spaghetti sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook until sauce is thickened and resembles a Bolognese, 15 to 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add oil. Cook pasta shells in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Transfer shells to a baking dish and let cool briefly.
Scoop cream cheese into the bottom of the pasta shells. Scoop sauce over the cream cheese. Sprinkle with feta cheese and parsley.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned, about 15 minutes.
