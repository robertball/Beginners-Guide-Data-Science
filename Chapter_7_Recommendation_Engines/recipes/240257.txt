Ingredients:
5 cups chopped cauliflower stems and leaves
1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon dried minced shallots
14 fluid ounces water, or as needed
2 tablespoons bacon drippings
3/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine cauliflower stems and leaves, chicken broth, garlic, and shallots in a 4-quart pot; add enough water to cover the leaves. Cover pot and bring liquid to a simmer.
Heat bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot bacon drippings until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add onion to the soup and continue to simmer until stems soften, about 2 hours.
Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return soup to pot and stir spinach, salt, and pepper into soup; simmer for 5 minutes.

Description: 
Save your cauliflower greens! They are edible! You may not expect much from a bowl of greens, but this soup is savory, delicious, and paleolithic. Garnish each serving with Parmesan cheese and parsley if desired.
