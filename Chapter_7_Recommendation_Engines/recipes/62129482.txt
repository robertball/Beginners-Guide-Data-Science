Ingredients:
1/2 onion, cut in narrow strips
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 piece of zucchini, sliced
1/3-1/2 cup green bell pepper (red pepper may be used as well), diced
1 cup chopped spinach leaves (or even salad greens)
1/3 cup sliced mushroom
1/2 tomato, diced
2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
3-4 slices of soft mozzarella cheese
A pinch of salt
1/2 tsp. ground black pepper
1/2  tsp. paprika
1 sandwich roll

Directions:
In a saute pan, heat some extra virgin olive oil and add chopped garlic and onion. Once the onions and garlic turn golden brown, add the zucchini, bell pepper, and mushroom. Cook the mixture for 2-3 minutes. Add the spinach leaves and saute; when the leaves wilt, add the chopped tomatoes (it is important to add the tomatoes last because the rest of the mixture will not cook in the presence of the tomatoes). Season with salt, pepper, paprika. Place the vegetables in the sandwich roll, and place the cheese on top of the vegetables. If you would like for the cheese to melt into the sandwich, microwave your sandwich for 40-50 seconds.
