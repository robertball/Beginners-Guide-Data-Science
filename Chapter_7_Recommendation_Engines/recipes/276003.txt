Ingredients:
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup cherry jam
1/4 cup dried tart red cherries, chopped
16 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers
water, as needed
nonstick cooking spray
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Whisk together cream cheese and jam in a small bowl; stir in dried cherries.
Place a wonton wrapper on a work surface with a corner pointing toward you. Moisten edges with water. Spoon a rounded teaspoon of cherry mixture just below center of wrapper. Fold bottom corner over filling, tucking it under on the other side. Fold side corners over filling; roll egg roll away from you toward remaining corner. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
Coat both sides of egg rolls with cooking spray. Arrange egg rolls, in batches if necessary, in a single layer in the air fryer basket.
Cook in the preheated air fryer until well browned, 4 to 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk together sugar and cinnamon in a shallow bowl.
Remove egg rolls from the air fryer and immediately roll in cinnamon sugar, using two forks. Cool on a wire rack for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve warm.
