Description: 
I loved this drink growing up. It is very delicious and great on a cold chilly day. My Mexican grandmother used to make this for us when I was a kid, and now I make it for my kids. Very delicious. Serve hot, alone or you can top with whipped cream and dust some cinnamon over it. Sugar can also be less or more, suited to taste.
