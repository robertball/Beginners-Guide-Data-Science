Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
1 (6 ounce) container fresh blackberries, or more to taste
7/8 cup milk
2 eggs
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
7 tablespoons white sugar
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon brown sugar, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking dish with butter.
Add blackberries to the prepared baking dish.
Stir milk and eggs together in a bowl. Whisk in flour, sugar, and salt and mix until batter is smooth. Pour batter over blackberries.
Bake in the preheated oven on the middle rack until eggs start to set, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle brown sugar on top and bake until golden brown, about 20 more minutes.

Description: 
Clafoutis is one of my favorite French desserts because it takes only 10 minutes to prepare and is super versatile. I tried it with blackberries the other day and loved the result!
