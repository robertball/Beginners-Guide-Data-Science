Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 cup long-grain converted rice
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 onion, diced
1 pound ground beef
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chilies (such as RO*TELÂ®)

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir rice in the melted butter until rice is lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir bell pepper and onion into rice and cook until bell pepper is softened and onion is translucent, 5 to 8 minutes.
Break the ground beef into the rice mixture; cook and stir until beef is completely browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir tomato sauce and diced tomatoes into ground beef mixture. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Great Spanish rice as a main course meal. I usually serve it with mashed potatoes. Can be made less spicy using regular tomatoes.
