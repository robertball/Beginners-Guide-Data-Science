Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup quinoa
1/2 sweet potato, peeled and cut into chunks
1 beet, peeled and cut into chunks
1/2 cup edamame (soybeans)
1 plum tomato, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 (5 ounce) package fresh spinach
1/4 large red onion, diced
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 clove garlic, chopped
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons crumbled goat cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Add quinoa and bring back to a boil. Reduce heat and cover; simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Pour into a strainer; run cold water over quinoa to cool slightly.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add sweet potato and beet; cover and steam until tender, about 15 minutes. Add edamame; steam until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool until running water.
Combine tomato, red bell pepper, spinach, red onion, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and black pepper in a large bowl. Fold in cooked quinoa, sweet potato, beet, and edamame. Top salad with goat cheese.

Just starting a health kick, getting off the sauce for the next 30 days and back to the gym. This recipe just came to me, so thought I'd share! It is great with salmon, boiled eggs, and avocado.
