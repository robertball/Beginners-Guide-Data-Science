Description: 
Just made a perfect (dairy free) ice cream for topping off my rich chocolate coffee cake! :)

Threw this mixture into our soft serve ice cream maker (Cuisinart ICE-45 Mix-It-In).  Took about 25mins (or more) to set up so it was thick enough to pile up on a cone!  It was delicious!!  Boys (3&5) had it in cones & on the cake!
