Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup water
1/4 cup honey
5 tablespoons butter, divided
1 egg

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, oats, yeast and salt. In a small saucepan, heat the water, honey and 4 tablespoons butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat just until moistened. Add egg; beat until well combined. Stir in enough remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into 24 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-22 minutes or until golden brown. Melt remaining butter; brush over rolls. Remove from pan to a wire rack.

Description: 
Since these tender rolls require only one rising, they are relatively quick to make. Whole wheat flour and oats make them nutritious, too. &3151;Arlene Butler, Ogden, Utah
