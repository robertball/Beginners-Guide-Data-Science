Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup shortening
1/4 cup cold water
FILLING:
4 medium fresh peaches, peeled and sliced
1 1/3 cups sugar
5 teaspoons lemon juice
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/3 cup water
3 cups fresh raspberries

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Roll out pastry to fit in a 9-in. pie plate. Transfer to pie plate; trim and flute edges. Line unpricked pastry shell with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Bake at 450 degrees F for 8 minutes. Remove foil; bake 5 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack.
In a large saucepan, combine the peaches, sugar and juice. Combine cornstarch and water until smooth. Stir into peach mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until thickened. Remove from heat ; cool to room temperature. Fold in raspberries. Spoon into crust. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Refrigerate leftovers.

I came up with this recipe when we had a bumper crop of raspberries, and a friend gave me some of the juiciest peaches we'd ever tasted.
