Ingredients:
2 cups light molasses
2 cups brewed coffee
2 eggs, lightly beaten
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup miniature marshmallows

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour 36 muffin cups.
Blend molasses, coffee, and eggs together in a bowl until smooth.
Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl.
Beat shortening and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add coffee mixture alternately with flour mixture, mixing between each addition, until batter is combined. Stir in vanilla extract. Fold in chocolate chips and marshmallows.
Fill prepared muffin cups about 3/4 full of batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Sweet and spicy treat--like gingerbread mixed with s'mores--for dessert or breakfast. I've had this recipe since 1970 and don't know the source, but I think the muffins are delicious. I hope you enjoy them, too.
