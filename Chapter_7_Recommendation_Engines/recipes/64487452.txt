Ingredients:
5-8 Pickling Cucumbers OR 4-5 Regular Cucumbers (the smaller the better)
1 Quart Purified Water
2 Tablespoon Sea Salt for Half Sours (Use 3 T for Full Sours)
1 Tablespoon Pickling Spice
3-5 Oak, Horseradish, or Grape Leaves (optional)

Directions:
Soak the cucumber in ice water for an hour to perk them up. Trim the flower end by ? inch to prevent bitterness.
Place leaves (if using) and pickling spice in the bottom of a half gallon mason jar.
Pack the cucumbers in strategically to get as tight a fit as possible.
Dissolve the salt in a quart of purified water and pour it over the cucumbers. This should be just enough to cover them. If not, mix a bit more brine using the same ratio.
Cover loosely with a plastic lid or a kitchen towel and set on the counter for 3 to 7 days. When the cucumbers are pickled to your liking, refrigerate and enjoy!
