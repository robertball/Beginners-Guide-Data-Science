Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked white rice
2 cups water
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
2 sheets nori seaweed sheets
1/4 cucumber, peeled and sliced lengthwise
2 pieces imitation crab legs
1/2 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, sliced
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root

Directions:
Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in rice vinegar and salt. Allow to cool completely.
Lay out seaweed sheets. Moisten hands with water, then spread the rice evenly on each sheet, leaving  a 1/2 inch gap along one edge, lengthwise. Arrange strips of cucumber, imitation crabmeat, and cream cheese in a straight line along the side opposite of the gap. Roll the sushi from the toppings to the exposed end of the the seaweed sheet.
Using a sharp wet knife, slice each roll into 5 or 6 pieces. Serve with minced ginger on the side.

Description: 
Delicious and surprisingly simple to make. Sushi is expensive to buy at the supermarket, so making your own will save you tons of money. My husband is a sushi freak! I make this for him all the time.
