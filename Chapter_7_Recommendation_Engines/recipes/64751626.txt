Ingredients:
Black Plantains, cut into soft chunks of 2" (best served with crème fraîche and cinnamon as a dessert)
or
Yellowed or Green Plantains, sliced very thinly, about 1/8" thin on a mandolin, on long diagonal edge. (best served as plantain chips, crispy, salted with a dip or on their own)
Sea salt
1/4" deep Corn Oil for frying
Cast Iron skillet
Cinnamon
Castor Sugar (granulated sugar)
Crème fraîche
Paper towels, about 5
Oven mitts, pot holders and a metal slotted spoon for frying.

Directions:
***See cautionary notes at bottom before reading the directions please***
If using yellow or green, unripened plantains, mandolin-slice them on long diagonal for best use of surface area when salting and frying.
Blackened plantains, cut into 2" long chunks, or just peel and halve the lengths the long way.
Spread plantains out on a large surface covered with paper towels or clean kitchen towels.
Sprinkle generously with salt, flip over, and salt other side.
Allow to rest 1 hour.  During this time, the bitters will be drawn out of the plantains and their surfaces will look very watery.
[Salt acts as a coagulant; it will force the extraction of bitter flavors from the plantain, as is with avocados, white asparagus, aubergine, courgette, etc.]
After 1 hour, pat both sides dry very well and place onto a platter.  Cover with another layer of fresh paper towel or clean kitchen towel to absorb any new moisture.
***Be certain you have pot holders and a fitted glass lid for the skillet before heating it up***
Using a cast iron skillet, pour 1/4" corn oil in and heat up to medium.
Wait at least 8 or 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, line a baking sheet or other platter or cutting board with paper towels.
***CAUTION***  [If plantains are still watery, pat-dry them thoroughly at this point, as if not, their water will splatter-burn upon their entry into the hot oil.  Oil and water never mix in frying. ]
With both hands in a pot holder, test a small piece of pat-dried plantain. Using a slotted metal spoon, lower it into the oil slowly.  If it sizzles upon hitting the hot oil, it is hot enough.
Using a metal slotted spoon, carefully lay slices into the oil, not touching.  Personally, I always place 4 slices onto the metal slotted spoon and then lay them in at the same time, slowly,  into the oil. You may need to do a few batches this way.
Allow at least 2 minutes per side and watch for them to turn a toasted color before turning over carefully.
Typically, the firmer yellow or green plantains need longer in the oil, and will not get squishy or soft, even.  If sliced thinly, they will not need to be browned to be done, just crispy and their surface changed before turning over.
When both sides are crispy, remove to towel-lined serving plate or platter.
Blackened plantains, while softer, will need the same amount of time in the oil.  As they are softer and sugary, they will caramelize differently in the oil! This is good! Watch them, because while they look gorgeous sizzling in the oil, they are getting softer as well.  Take care and careful caution while turning over or removing to towel-lined platter.
The blackened, softer plantains will be sugary-er than firmer ones.  For this reason, they are soft, sweeter, hence served more as a dessert with crème fraîche,
