Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
1 egg yolk
1 egg white
1 cup powdered sugar
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 cup milk
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp vanilla
Frosting:
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla
3 tbsp milk

Directions:
Place frosting ingredients in mixing bowl, beat for two minutes.
Preheat oven to 375F(190C)
Sift flour and baking powder into a bowl, set aside.
Cream sugar, vanilla and butter together, add unbeaten egg yolk and continue to beat. Beat egg white 1 1/2 minutes until stiff. Set aside.
Add flour mixture alternately to the creamed sugar mix: Begin by adding 1/3 of flour mix, then 1/2 of the milk. Add another 1/3 of flour and the remaining milk, then the final 1/3 of flour. Work quickly to avoid overbeating. This takes about 1 1/4 minutes to mix.
Fold in the beaten egg white. Drop batter from spoon onto non-stick cookie sheet (may butter or grease a sheet that is not non-stick) and bake for 15 minutes
Frost as -soon- as cookies are removed from oven in this way: Using a spatula, lift cookies from sheet and turn into bowl of frosting. Use tongs to turn each cookie to ensure it is well-coated, and lift out onto wax paper, bottom-down. Let stand until frosting is dry. (About 10 minutes.)
