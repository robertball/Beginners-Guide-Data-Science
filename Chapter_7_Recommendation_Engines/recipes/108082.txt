Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups quinoa
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cups water
1 bunch green onions, chopped
3/4 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup raisins
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Bring the quinoa, salt, and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Once done, scrape into a large bowl, and allow to cool for 20 minutes. Stir in the green onions, celery, raisins, cayenne pepper, vegetable oil, vinegar, lemon juice, and sesame oil. Allow to stand at room temperature for 1 hour to allow the flavors to blend. Stir in the cilantro and pecans before serving.

Description: 
This is an unusual and tasty high-protein grain salad. Quinoa is a grain that has almost no flavor, but the spices add zest. It's well worth trying, I make it often since discovering quinoa at my health food store.
