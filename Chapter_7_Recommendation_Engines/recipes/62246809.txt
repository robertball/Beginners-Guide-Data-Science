Nana's Texas Cornbread Recipe

Ingredients:
1/4 cup (approximately) Crisco shortening. You want enough to have a crispy crust on bottom and sides.
2 cups cornmeal
1 cup flour
3 TB baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 can Mexican corn, drained.
Approximately 16-20 oz Buttermilk. I never measure this; I merely go by how the batter looks and feels.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Place Crisco in cast iron skillet, put in oven until the Crisco is hot (but not smoking).
While Crisco is heating, combine dry ingredients, egg and corn. Slowly add buttermilk, mixing constantly, until it forms a batter with a smooth consistency. If the batter is sticky or looks "mealy," keep adding buttermilk until the batter is smooth, but not runny.
Remove skillet from oven. Pour batter into skillet, being careful of shortening spatters. Return skillet to middle shelf of oven and cook for approximately 30 minutes, or until top starts browning. You can test for doneness with a toothpick, just like cake.
If it's done, immediately slide bread onto a platter and divide into  wedges (a chef's knife will do the trick). Serve with butter.

Description: 
How my grandmother used to make it, back in East Texas. It's fast, simple, not sweet, not overly moist or (horrors!) too dry. Don't get fancy with this type of cornbread; it's supposed to be down home.
