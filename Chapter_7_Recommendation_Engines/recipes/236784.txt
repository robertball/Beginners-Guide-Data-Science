Ingredients:
1/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 egg, beaten
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
4 small chicken cutlets*
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 slices fresh mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
8 thick slices artisanal-style bread
1 (24 ounce) jar RAGÚ® Old World Style® Traditional Sauce

Directions:
Mix together the flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper in a shallow bowl.  Place beaten egg in another bowl. Mix together panko bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in a third shallow bowl.
Dredge each piece of chicken in the flour, coating both sides; shake off the extra. Dip chicken in beaten egg, and then press into the breadcrumbs, making sure to coat well on both sides. Set on a plate.
Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Pan fry chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side.
Place chicken on slices of bread. Spread about 1/4 cup of Ragu(R) Old World Style(R) Traditional Sauce over each piece of chicken. Top with a slice of cheese and a tablespoon of Parmesan cheese. Top with the remaining slices of bread. Heat in a panini press or in a large skillet until the cheese is melted. Heat remaining sauce for dipping.
