Ingredients:
olive oil
8 oz tempeh, crumbled
1 white onion, diced
3 oz portabella mushroom, chopped
8 oz zucchini, chopped
12 oz yellow squash, chopped
8 oz grape tomatoes, halved
1 jar (6.7 oz) Trader Joe's Pesto
1.5 cups cooked brown rice
8 bell peppers (any color), tops and seeds removed
parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 400F.  Prepare all ingredients as listed above.
Heat oil on high heat in skillet.  Saute onion and tempeh until tempeh starts to brown.  Turn heat down to medium and stir in mushrooms, squash and zucchini until almost tender.  Add tomatoes and turn heat off.  Stir in pesto and rice to absorb moisture.
Place bell peppers in a baking dish, sitting upright like little bowls.  Scoop veggie mixture into peppers.
Bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes, or until peppers start to sizzle, and tops of veggies begin to brown.  Add parmesan and continue baking for 5 more minutes.
Serve warm.
