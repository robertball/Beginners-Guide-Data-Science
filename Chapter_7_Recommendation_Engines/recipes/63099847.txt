Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter (unsalted)
4 cups diced onions (size by your preferences)
1/2 cup All-purpose flour
64 ounces chicken stock
1 1/4 cups instant potato flakes
1 quart Half & Half cream
8 ounces Philadelphia cream cheese
1 cup cooked diced potatoes,(see notes)
1 Tablespoon Lawry's Seasoned Salt
dash of Tabasco sauce (more is better)
Notes: I use left over baked potatoes with the skin left on, and typically put in several cups.

Directions:
1. Saute butter and onions on low heat until tender but not browned.
2. Add flour to onions and mix well.
3. Add chicken stock slowly, stir constantly. Bring to boil.
4. Add instant potato flakes while stirring constantly; reduce heat.
5. Whip in Half & Half cream (do not boil).
6. Cube cream cheese, add to stock, continue stirring.
7. Add cooked, diced potatoes.
8. Simmer until thick and blended.
9. Add season salt and dash of Tabasco sauce.
