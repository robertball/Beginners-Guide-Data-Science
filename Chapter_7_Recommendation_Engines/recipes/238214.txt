Ingredients:
1 pound beef top sirloin, diced
1 pound pork butt, diced
1 pinch chili-lime seasoning (such as Tajin®)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lager-style beer
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 cup diced roasted red peppers
1 cup water
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/4 cup chili powder (such as Gebhardt®)
1 tablespoon chili-lime seasoning (such as Tajin®)
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
6 bay leaves
1 (15 ounce) can chili beans, drained and rinsed (optional)

Directions:
Combine beef and pork in a large skillet over medium-high heat; season with 1 pinch chili-lime seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir until meat is evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, jalapeno pepper, and garlic until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir beef-pork mixture into onion mixture; add diced tomatoes with juice, beer, tomato sauce, roasted red peppers, water, tomato paste, chili powder, 1 tablespoon chili-lime seasoning, cumin, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, cayenne pepper, and bay leaves.
Bring tomato-meat mixture to a boil, add chili beans, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, at least 2 hours.

Description: 
This chili has great flavor with medium heat. It's best when made the day before, refrigerated overnight, and then reheated over medium heat until it begins to simmer again.
