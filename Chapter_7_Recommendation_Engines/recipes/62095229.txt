Ingredients:
2 cans kidney beans
1 onion, chopped
3 slices bacon, diced
3- 4 carrots, peeled and sliced into thick slices.
2-3 potatos, peeled and quartered
1 16 oz. can whole tomatoes, chopped
1 lb. ground beef
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Saute ground beef in large soup pot or Dutch oven.  Add onion, and saute until soft. Add kidney beans and rinse out cans with a little water and add to stew pot. Add bacon (not cooked but just raw), carrots, potatoes and tomatoes. Stir and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and simmer for about an hour. If the soup is too thin, take the lid off and cook a little while longer to thicken. Serve with salad and French bread.

Description: 
Hearty stew made with hamburger and ingredients usually on hand. My mother got this recipe from Olga Lundblad in Carmel. Great for those cold winter nights. Serve with a crisp green salad and warm French bread.
