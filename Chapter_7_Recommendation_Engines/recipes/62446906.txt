Ingredients:
1 1/2 10 oz. bags of Campfire or Jetpuff miniature marshmallows.
2 Tablespoons water
1 2-lb. bag of powdered sugar

Directions:
Put marshmallows in a microwavable bowl.  Sprinkle with water.  Microwave in 40 seconds intervals (stirring in between intervals) until melted.  Put melted marshmallows in a stand mixer bowl that is greased with Crisco.  Mix with greased dough hook, gradually adding most of the powdered sugar.  Mix for about 8 minutes from the start.  If it looks too dry after about 3 minutes, add water a teaspoon at a time.
If microwave is too strong, you may end up with clear little balls.  If so, start over.  It can't be salvaged.
Grease countertop and sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Grease hands with Crisco and knead fondant, adding additional powerdered sugar, if needed, until smooth.  When rolling out fondant - if it is too stiff, microwave at 10 second intervals.
