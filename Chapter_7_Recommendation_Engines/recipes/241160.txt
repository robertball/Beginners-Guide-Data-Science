Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
4 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup cottage cheese
ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Pour beaten eggs into the skillet; let cook undisturbed until the bottom of the eggs begin to firm, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir cottage cheese and chives into eggs and season with black pepper. Cook and stir until eggs are nearly set, 3 to 4 minutes more.
