Description: 
SINCE our children left the nest, lasagna has been relegated to company fare since most recipes make enough for a crowd.    But then I saw a recipe that rolled lasagna noodles into individual servings, and I adapted my original recipe to this efficient way of preparing it. Now my husband and I enjoy this entree often. -Virginia Foley, Manchester, New Hampshire
