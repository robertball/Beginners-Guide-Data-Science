Ingredients:
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1/2 pound ground beef
1 cup chopped kimchi
4 cups cooked rice
4 eggs

Directions:
Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat and add sesame oil; cook and stir ground beef until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add kimchi; cook and stir for 10 minutes. Add rice; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Move the fried rice to 1 side of wok. Crack eggs into wok and cook until bottoms are set, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip eggs and cook until set, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve 1 egg on top of each fried rice portion.

Description: 
This is a great way to use kimchi, simply fried with minced beef and rice. Hint: When you buy already-made kimchi from a Korean market, leave the kimchi at room temperature for 1 day to ferment.
