Ingredients:
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 lemons, zested
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 10 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Beat sugar and oil together in a bowl with an electric mixer. Add eggs and lemon zest; beat until smooth.
Stir flour, poppy seeds, baking powder, and salt together in bowl; gradually beat into the sugar mixture alternately with buttermilk and 2 tablespoons lemon juice until you achieve a smooth batter. Stir vanilla extract into the batter; pour into prepared muffin tins.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 25 to 35 minutes. Cool muffins in pans for a few minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.
Stir confectioners' sugar and 2 tablespoons lemon juice together in a bowl; drizzle over tops of cooled muffins.
