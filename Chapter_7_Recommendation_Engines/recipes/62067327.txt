Ingredients:
1          cup of pistachios (no red ones)
½         cup of  sliced almonds
1          cup of dried apricots
1          cup of cranberrie raisins
1          cup of pitted dates
3/4      cup of figs – well sliced –
3/4      cup of candied cherries
1/4      cup of poppy seeds
1/4      cup of chopped pecans
6         rings of pineapple
1          cup of all purpose flour
1          cup of sugar
1/2      teaspoon baking powder (rounded but not heaping)
1/2      teaspoon of salt
2          teaspoons of vanilla
3          eggs
1          bottle of rum (or imitation rum/optional) optional
1          bunt pan

Directions:
a)	Soak the 6 pineapple rings in the rum and slice up the figs and the apricots and soak them in rum as well. Let them sit in advance (just the rings) or set out and soak ahead of time; or soak them the time that it takes you to mix the recipe. Don’t pre soak the apricots & figs they will expand and get weird? Only soak while you’re prepping & mixing. (if you chose not to use rum –skip this part)
b)	Shell the pistachios (or get pre-shelled nuts) – no RED ONES
c)	Spray your bunt pan well and let it set – make sure you spray the center post as well
d)	Chop the candied cherries in half and chop/dice the dates.
e)	Mix all the ingredients minus the soaking ones, pecans & 6 cherry halves
f)	Once all is in the bowl take the figs and apricots out, & squeeze them – the apricots will have expanded & put them in the dough as well
g)	Your dough will look funny it’s dense and it will look grand when baked
h)	Take out your soaking rings and line the bottom of the bunt pan it should fit exactly 6 (keep the soaking rum for the icing)
i)	Put a cherry in the center of each pineapple ring & sprinkle the pecans all around them
j)	NOW put the dough in the pan and smooth it out and push it down gently.
k)	Bake @ 300 degrees for 1 hour and poke occasionally until no dough comes of the toothpick or fork.
l)	When you bring it out of the oven let it set 2 minutes & then take a plate put it on the top of the pan and flip it over quickly, while holding both sides. The cake should fall out easily. Don’t’ let it set the wrong way too long or you won’t get it out of the pan.
m)	ICING – if you didn’t use rum or you chose not to soak your pineapple you can use the pineapple juice instead mixing it with confectionary sugar for a icing dripping. It’s GRAND with the pineapple soaked rum. Make sure it’s well doused/covered. OR if neither interests you; get some almond extract or peppermint extract instead.
KEEP IN MIND – IF YOU CHOSE TO OMIT AN INGREDIENT THAT’S FINE – THE LESS YOU HAVE THE MORE CAKE YOU WILL HAVE.. MORE INGREDIENTS – LESS CAKE/ LESS INGREDIENTS – MORE CAKE -the dense appearance will not be apparent but it will not be as heavy - If you follow the instructions you will have a very dense cake -Excellent; and one slice will be sufficient. (substitute as you like - that's how I came up with this; I hated those candied thingies & raisins)
