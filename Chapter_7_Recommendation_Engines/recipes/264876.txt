Ingredients:
8 ounces nonfat cream cheese, softened
1 cup butter, softened
2 teaspoons butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla
6 eggs, room temperature
3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
2 cups strawberries, muddled
1 teaspoon vanilla sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Cream nonfat cream cheese, 1 cup plus 2 teaspoons butter, and sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add salt and vanilla extract and beat the mixture well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Gradually add flour, one cup at a time, beating until just incorporated into the batter. Add strawberries after the last cup of flour and beat for a few seconds. Finish mixing with spatula if you need to.
Pour batter into the prepared Bundt(R) pan. Lightly sprinkle the top of the batter with the vanilla sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in the pan. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely.
