Ingredients:
3 lb. beef bottom round roast
1 envelope onion soup mix
1 18 oz jar of home style beef gravy

Directions:
Put the meat in the slow cooker fat side up. Pour the onion soup mix on top then add the gravy. Cover and cook on high for 6-10 hours. Just before serving, remove the fat, then pull apart the meat (this gives every piece of meat a good flavor). Serve alone or over rice or pasta.

Description: 
This roast recipe started from my mom's recipe, but I forgot to add the water. Well, that was a happy accident. By doing so, it made the roast have thicker more flavorful gravy. I love how I can put it in the slow cooker and forget about it, because the longer it cooks the easier it is to shred.
