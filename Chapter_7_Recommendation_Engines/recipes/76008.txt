Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups dried cherries
2 tablespoons water
2 (11 ounce) packages white chocolate chips
4 (3 ounce) bars vanilla-flavored candy coating
1 1/4 cups chopped pistachio nuts

Directions:
In a small glass bowl, microwave cherries with water on high for 2 minutes; drain, and set aside.
In a separate microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate chips and candy coating together until melted and smooth, stirring occasionally. Stir in cherries and chopped pistachios, and spread into a wax paper-lined 15x10 inch pan. Chill for 1 hour, or until firm.
Cut into 1 inch squares, and enjoy. Store unused portion in an air-tight container.
