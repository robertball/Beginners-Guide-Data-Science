Ingredients:
1/4 c. cider vinegar
3/4 c.  oil
2 T. soy sauce
2 dried shitake mushroom
1 tsp. sesame oil
1 t. toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Put the mushroom in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Let soak until the mushroom is soft. Toast the sesame seeds in a small skillet, stirring until they are golden in color. Remove from the heat so they donâ€™t burn.
When the mushroom is soft, saving 2 tablespoons of the soaking water, trim and discard the stem; chop the mushroom.
Put the oil, vinegar, soy sauce, reserved soaking water, sesame oil, the chopped mushroom in a blender. Whir just until the mushroom is in tiny pieces, about 10 seconds. Add the toasted sesame seeds and blend a few seconds more.
