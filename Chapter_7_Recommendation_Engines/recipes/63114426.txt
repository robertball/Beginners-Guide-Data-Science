Ingredients:
Ingredients
1 3/4 cups black beans (or 1 can of no salt added)
1/3 cup melted coconut oil (or melted butter)
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup honey (or other equivalent sweetener)
3 lightly beaten eggs
1/2 cup chopped up bittersweet chocolate (or semi-sweet chips if you don’t mind the added refined sugar in them)
1/3 cup finely chopped walnuts -optional

Directions:
Making these could NOT be simpler.
Preheat oven to 350°. Grease an 8×8 pan.
Place all but the final 3 ingredients (eggs, chopped up chocolate and walnuts) into a blender or food processor and blend until smooth.
Fold in the remaining ingredients.
Pour into the pan and bake for about 30 minutes.
Let cool – the texture actually changes as they cool off, getting more “fudgy”.

Description: 
Try these; I promise you will love them!! They are extremely good for you and just as yummy, plus they only take five minutes to prepare. I'd rather have these over regular brownies any day!! Sounds strange, but believe me nobody will be able to tell the main ingredient. Awesome with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of hot fudge sauce!! Enjoy:)
