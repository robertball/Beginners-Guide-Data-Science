Chicken curry can be keto-friendly if a few changes are made. Make sure to watch the carb count on your coconut milk and serving size. Some vegetables (mushrooms, bell peppers, broccoli, sugar snap peas -use sparingly- etc.,) may be added, just take the carb count into consideration. If desired, serve with cauliflower rice.
