Description: 
This is a restaurant/gourmet caliber dish! It is important to make sure that the clam sauce and Parmesan cheese is mixed well into the linguine noodles for maximum flavor. I added 1/4 lb. of sauteed mushrooms and flavored them and the clam sauce with some dill. Also, I increased the number of cans of the clams to 4; using 2 cans of smoked clams (which made a noticeable difference). I generously sprinkled lemon juice on top which really brought out the taste. Serve this with Italian herb or Asiago Cheese Bread to sop up olive oil clam sauce.Modified from: Linguine and Clam Sauce
