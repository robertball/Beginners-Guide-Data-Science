Ingredients:
1 tbs butter
1 cup finely chopped onion
2 cups finely chopped Swiss chard leaves
4 cups (so many!) finely chopped green kale leaves
4 spring onions (or scallions to those in the USA), minced
1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs
1/2 cup  & 2 tbs finely grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 tsp grated nutmeg
2 tbs green pesto
1/2 tsp sea salt
1 tsp ground white pepper
2 large eggs
Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)

Directions:
Melt butter in a pan over a medium heat, then add the onions and cook until just softened but not brown. Add the chard and kale and 1/4 tsp of salt and continue to cook and stir until completely wilted - the greens, not you. Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes, do not get out of the kitchen, you can take the heat! Stir in the spring onions, breadcrumbs, the 1/2 a cup of Parmesan, the nutmeg and the pesto. Taste mixture (yummy!) and season, starting with ¼ tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper and adjusting to taste. Stir in the eggs, breaking up yolks and combining completely into a uniform mixture.
Heat oven to 190 degrees C and line a baking tray with parchment paper. Roll the mixture into balls of 1½ tablespoons each and place on baking sheet. Sprinkle the top of each ball with a pinch of grated parmesan.
Bake for around 20 minutes or until completely cooked through and browned on the bottom. Enjoy!
