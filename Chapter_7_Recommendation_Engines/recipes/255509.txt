Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
4 cups fresh cranberries
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup dates, pitted and chopped
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup vinegar
1/2 cup chopped fresh ginger
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 large garlic clove, chopped
8 cloves

Directions:
Combine water, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large pot; stir until sugars dissolve. Add cranberries, onion, dates, raisins, vinegar, ginger, cinnamon, salt, garlic, and cloves. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the cranberries have burst and sauce begins to thicken, about 15 minutes.
Pour into a large bowl and refrigerate until set, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is by far the best cranberry dish of any type that I've ever tasted. It was passed on to me from my mother-in-law. The garlic adds a hint of savoriness and the fresh ginger gives it a spicy kick. A very easy recipe with a sophisticated flavor. I could not find another cranberry chutney recipe exactly like it anywhere on the web, so I am sharing it here! The flavor gets better the longer it sits, so making it a day or two ahead is preferable.
