Ingredients:
-24 ounces ground lean beef sirloin
-6 slices of light (2%) swiss cheese
-1 red onion diced
-1/2 tsp sea salt
-1/4tsp black pepper
-(optional) Mrs. Dash Steak seasoning to preference
-1Tbsp canola oil
-6 large slices of rye bread

Directions:
Season the meat with salt, pepper and optional Mrs. Dash and form into six 4 ounce patties. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the patties and scatter the onion around the burgers. Stir the onion from time to time to keep it from burning.
Cut large slices of rye bread in half to fit patties better. Toast rye bread until golden brown.
Cook the burger for 3 to 4 minutes, then flip and immediately cover each with a slice of swiss cheese. Continue cooking until the burgers are cooked all the way through about another 3-4 minutes. Remove, place on top of the toasted rye, cover with the sauteed onions, and top with the piece of rye.

Description: 
This is a phenomenal way to enjoy a restaurant style patty melt without all of the fat and calories. This was by one of the best meals I've made for my family.

It is simple and very flavorful recipe. I got it from the 'Cook This Not that' recipe book.
