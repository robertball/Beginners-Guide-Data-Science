Ingredients:
steak

Directions:
Some meat-cooking experts like to use the “finger test” as a reference for checking for doneness.
To know what raw meat feels like, pinch the flesh of your hand below your thumb, while your hand is relaxed.
To know what medium-rare meat feels like, touch your middle finger lightly to your thumb and pinch it.
To know what medium-cooked meat feels like, touch your ring finger to your thumb.
To know what well-done meat feels like, touch your pinkie and thumb together.
