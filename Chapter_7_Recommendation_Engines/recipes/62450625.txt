Ingredients:
1 large egg
1/2 cup milk + 1/2 tbsp vinegar (or 1/2 cup buttermilk)
1 1/3cups all purpose flour
1 1/3 cups old fashioned oats
1/3 cup wheat germ
1/4 cup sugar
1 tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
10 tbsp cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1/2 cup dried raspberries

Directions:
Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 400F.
Stir together the milk and vinegar, let sit for a few minutes. Stir in the egg.
Whisk the flour, oats, wheat germ, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl. Drop in the butter and, using your fingers, toss to coat the pieces of butter with flour. Quickly, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture is consistency of cornmeal. (You'll have pea size pieces, pieces the size of oatmeal flakes and pieces the size of everything in between.)
Pour the egg and milk mixture over the dry ingredients and stir with a fork just until the dough, which will be wet and sticky, comes together. Don't over mix.
Add in the raspberries. Still in the bowl, gently knead the dough by hand 8 to 10 times. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide it in half. Working with one piece at a time, pat the dough into a rough circle that's about 5 inches in diameter, cut it into 6 wedges and place on the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.
Bake for 20 to 22 minutes on a lined cookie sheet, or until their tops are golden and firmish. Transfer them to a rack to cool.

Description: 
Soft and buttery! The wheat germ makes them a little more crumbly than regular scones tend to be, but the texture change is very pleasant!
