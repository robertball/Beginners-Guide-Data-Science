Description: 
I developed this gluten free flour blend when trying to find a lighter yet more elastic blend than any I have found through various channels. Taking a traditional, successful blend, this adds sweet rice flour and powdered milk to aid in elasticity and helps the browning process during baking. Use a lower oven temperature (about 20 degrees fahrenheit) when using this blend for a thorough and complete baking.Modified from: Brown Rice Flour Blend
