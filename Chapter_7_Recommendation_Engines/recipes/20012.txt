Ingredients:
1 egg white
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon peppermint extract

Directions:
In large bowl, whisk egg white until frothy, but not stiff.  Stir in confectioners' sugar and peppermint extract.  You  may need to knead it with your hands.  If you wish to add food coloring, knead it in, and keep kneading until the color is evenly distributed.
Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Form the dough into small balls, place on cookie sheet and flatten slightly.  Cover and let sit overnight in a cool, dry place, until set.

Description: 
The creams need to set overnight. If you wish to use chocolate, melt 2 ounces chocolate chips, then dip half of the cookie into it. You may also knead in food coloring before you mold them.
