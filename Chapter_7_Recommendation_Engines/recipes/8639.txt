Ingredients:
1 ½ cups honey
6 tablespoons soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 pounds chicken wings

Directions:
Heat honey, soy sauce, and garlic in a saucepan until boiling.
Place the wings in the bottom of a 9 x 13 inch baking pan, and pour the honey mixture over the chicken.  Cover with foil.  Marinate in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight.
Bake, covered,  at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour; turn the wings after 1/2 hour.  Remove the foil cover, and bake for 15 minutes. Take the wings out of the sauce, and bake on a rack for 10 minutes. Turn the chicken wings, and cook for another 10 minutes.

Description: 
These wings are sweet and sticky like candy! The sauce can be reheated and poured over a side dish of rice.  Make sure to bring the sauce to a boil, and simmer for several minutes to kill any bacteria that may be present.
