Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup chunky peanut butter
3/4 cup sour cream (not reduced-fat)
3 tablespoons butter, melted
2 tablespoons boiling water
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 cup whole milk, warmed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Whisk together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Whisk together peanut butter, sour cream, butter, and boiling water in a large bowl (mixture will be very thick). Stir flour mixture into peanut butter mixture until fully combined, then stir in chocolate chips.
Generously coat a 6-quart oval slow cooker with cooking spray. Spread batter evenly in slow cooker.
Whisk together white sugar, cocoa powder, milk, and vanilla in a small bowl until smooth. Pour over batter.
Cover and cook on High until sides of cake begin to pull away from ceramic liner and appear solid (the center will still be soft), 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
