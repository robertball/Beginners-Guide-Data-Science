Ingredients:
6 slices thick cut bacon
8 oz package cream cheese or fat free cream cheese softened
1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese or your favorite type of cheese
1/4 green onion minced
2 tsp fresh lime juice
2 tsp fresh garlic chopped
1/4 cup cilantro chopped
1/4 cup tomato diced
15 large jalapeno pepper

Directions:
Preheat charcoal grill to medium heat
Cook bacon over medium heat until crisp.  Remove from pan and drain on paper towels.  Once bacon is cooked crumble and put is large mixing bowl.  Add all other ingredient to bowl with bacon and mix well.
Cut the stem ends off of the jalapenos.  Scrap all the stems and seeds out using a small teaspoon.  Using a pipping bag (or a Ziploc bag with the corner cut out) pipe the filling into each pepper setting them in a pepper rack as you finish.
Place the peppers over indirect heat and close lid and cook for 20 minutes checking frequently to be sure they don't burn. Once they are  slightly charred on the bottom they are ready.   Remove from grill and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
These are a much healthier version of bacon  wrapped jalapenos.  I think these have so much more flavor.  Perfect for parties and entertaining.
