Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 large stalks celery, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (28 ounce) can canned peeled and diced tomatoes
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 (7 ounce) cans whole baby clams, undrained
4 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon chili pepper flakes
2 teaspoons dried oregano
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
In a large saucepan, saute the onion, celery, and garlic in 2 tablespoons olive oil until tender.  Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, and clams. Season with bay leaves, chili pepper flakes, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover, and simmer for 1 hour, until tomatoes begin to turn deep red in colour and the sauce thickens.  Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil near the end of the cooking time.

Description: 
Inspired by my Greek mother-in-law's Kokkinisto. I decided to add clams for something different. Spoon over rice or angel hair pasta, sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese, and serve with crusty bread and white wine.
