Ingredients:
3/4 cup water
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground mustard
1/8 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 cup powdered milk
1 cup canola oil, or as needed

Directions:
Combine the water, sugar, salt, mustard, paprika, vinegar, lemon juice, and powdered milk in a blender. Puree until smooth. With the blender running, drizzle in the oil in a slow, steady stream. If you add it too fast, the mixture will not thicken. Use more or less oil to make it the thickness you like. Store in the refrigerator.
