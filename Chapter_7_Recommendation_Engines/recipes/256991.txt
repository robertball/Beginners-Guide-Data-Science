Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups crushed digestive biscuits
1/4 cup unsalted butter, cubed
2 1/3 cups Irish stout beer (such as Guinness速)
1 cup white sugar
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 (8.8 ounce) containers mascarpone cheese
3 tablespoons honey
1/2 lemon, juiced
3 tablespoons water
8 sheets gelatin

Directions:
Mix digestive crumbs and butter together in a bowl. Pour into an 8-inch cake pan and press into an even layer over the bottom using the back of a spoon. Chill until firm, about 30 minutes.
Combine stout beer and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until syrupy and the consistency of caramel, about 40 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
Beat heavy cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.
Whisk mascarpone cheese and honey together in a bowl. Fold in whipped cream and lemon juice.
Combine water and gelatin sheets in a microwave-safe bowl. Let gelatin soften, about 5 minutes. Drain. Heat in the microwave until melted, about 10 seconds.
Pour cooled beer mixture over the mascarpone mixture; add gelatin. Beat well until smooth. Spread over the digestive biscuit crust. Chill until set, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
Guinness速 celebrated 250 years (1759 - 2009) in Ireland today. The place where I work has made a special Guinness menu for the day. I am a pastry chef, so I decided to make a Guinness速 cheesecake.
