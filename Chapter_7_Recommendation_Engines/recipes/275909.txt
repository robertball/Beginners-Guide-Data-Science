Ingredients:
3/4 cup apple cider
2 tablespoons honey
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 medium apple - peeled, cored, and diced
1/2 cup warm water
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Mix apple cider, honey, and yeast together in a bowl until frothy. Set aside for 5 to 10 minutes.
Mix flour, apple, water, butter, cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl; mix in apple cider mixture until a dough forms. Cover with a warm towel and let dough rise for 90 minutes.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Form into 12 equal-sized rolls. Place on a baking sheet and let rise for 30 minutes more.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 30 minutes.
