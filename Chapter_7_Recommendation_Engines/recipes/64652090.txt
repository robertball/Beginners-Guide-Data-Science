Ingredients:
1 pound hot Italian sausage, casing removed
2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 medium onion, diced small
1 red pepper, diced small
4 cloves garlic, pressed through a garlic press
1 32oz. carton chicken broth
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 10oz. package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1 16oz. package gnocchi (found in the pasta aisle of the grocery store) (I prefer to use the mini when available)
3/4 cup heavy cream
Salt and pepper, to taste, optional
Fresh grated Parmesan cheese, for serving, optional

Directions:
In medium skillet, brown the sausage, breaking it apart as it cooks, about 10 minutes; drain and set aside.
In a large soup pot, saute onions and red pepper in olive oil, just until onions are tender.
Add garlic and cook another minute.
Add sausage, chicken broth and basil; simmer about 20 minutes.
Add spinach and stir to distribute.
Add gnocchi and simmer until they are cooked, about 3-5 minutes.
Add heavy cream and simmer to heat through.
Taste and season with salt and pepper, if needed.
Serve topped with Parmesan cheese, if desired.

Description: 
I found a recipe similar to this on the internet, but I changed it up according to what I had on hand and my family's tastes. This soup comes together in a snap, but tastes like it took all day to make. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
