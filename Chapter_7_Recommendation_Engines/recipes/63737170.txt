Ingredients:
1 lb sweet or hot Italian sausage (5 links)
1/2 lb ground beef
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1-1/2 tsp dried basil leaves
1/2 tsp fennel seed
1/4 tsp pepper
1/8 cup chopped parsley
4 cups canned tomatoes, undrained; or 1 can (2 lb, 3 oz) Italian-style tomatoes
2 cans (6-oz size) tomato paste
1 tablespoon salt
12 curly lasagna noodles (3/4 of 1lb. package)
1 container (15 oz) ricotta or cottage cheese, drained
1 egg
1/8 cup chopped parsley
1/2 tsp salt
3/4 lb mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced
1 jar (3oz) grated Parmesan cheese (3/4 cup)

Directions:
Remove sausage from outer casings; chop the meat.  In 5-quart Dutch oven, over medium heat, saut√© sausage, beef (break up beef with wooden spoon), onion, and garlic, stirring frequently, until well browned - about 20 minutes.
Add sugar, 1 tablespoon salt, the basil, fennel, pepper, and 1/8 cup parsley; mix well.  Add tomatoes, tomato paste, and 1/2 cup water, mashing tomatoes with wooden spoon.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat; simmer, covered and stirring occasionally, until thick - about 1.5 hours.
In 8-quart kettle, bring 3 quarts water and 1 tablespoon salt to boiling.  Add lasagna, 2 or 3 at a time.  Return to boiling, boil, uncovered and stirring occasionally, 10 minutes, or just until tender.  Drain in colander; rinse under cold water.  Dry lasagna on paper towels.
Preheat oven to 375F.  In medium bowl, combine ricotta, egg, remaining 1/8 cup parsley, and remaining 1/2 tsp salt; mix well.
In bottom of 13x9x2-inch baking dish, spoon 1.5 cups sauce.  Layer with 6 lasagna, lengthwise and overlapping, to cover.  Spread with half of ricotta mixture; top with third of mozzarella.  Spoon 1.5 cups sauce over cheese, sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan.  Repeat layering, starting with 6 lasagna and ending with 1.5 cups sauce sprinkled with Parmesan.  Spread with remaining sauce; top with with rest of mozzarella and Parmesan.  Cover with foil, tucking around edge.
Bake 25 minutes; remove foil; bake, uncovered 25 minutes longer, or until bubbly.  Cool 15 minutes before serving.
