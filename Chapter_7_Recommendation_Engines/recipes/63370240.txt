Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 onion, chopped
1/2 carrot, chopped
2 cups long-grain white rice
3 cups chicken stock
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 pinch saffron (optional)
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup apricots, chopped
1/4 cup almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter and olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and carrot; cook and stir until onion is lightly browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat.
Combine rice and onion mixture in a 9x13-inch casserole dish placed on a baking sheet. Stir thoroughly to coat the rice.
Combine chicken stock, salt, saffron, apricots, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes.
Pour chicken stock mixture over rice in the casserole dish, sprinkle with almonds, and stir to combine. Spread mixture evenly along the bottom of the pan. Cover tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove foil and fluff with a fork to separate the grains of rice.
