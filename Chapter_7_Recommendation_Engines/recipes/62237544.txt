Ingredients:
1/2 cup corn starch
1/2 cup icing sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup butter, softened

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
Sift together corn starch, icing sugar and flour.
With wooden spoon, blend in butter until soft, smooth dough forms.
Shape into 1 inch balls and place 1 1/2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet; flatten with lightly floured fork.
Alternatively, roll dough to 1/4 inch; cut into shapes with cookie cutters. Decorate with candied cherries, coloured sprinkles or nuts if desired.
Bake 15-20 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.
Cool on wire rack.

Description: 
This is the best shortbread recipe I have tried. I found the recipe on a box of corn starch and have been using it for years. They are deliciously simple and melt in your mouth.
