Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 cup strong brewed coffee
1 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (10 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, drained
2 cups miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup butter, softened
4 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
4 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Preheat  oven  to  350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.
In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, soda and salt.
Add eggs, coffee, milk, oil and vanilla. Beat until smooth (batter will be thin).
Fold in cherries and chocolate chips. Pour batter into 9x13 inch pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes or until toothpick inserted into middle comes out clean. It's best to leave it in the pan, because the chips and the cherries sort of sink to the bottom and solidify and will stick big time! Frost with white buttercream.
For the frosting: In a large bowl, combine butter, confectioners sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and vanilla. Cream with an electric mixer. Add milk by the tablespoon until frosting is smooth.

Description: 
We always called it the Busy Cake...too many things going on with it! Crushed maraschino cherries can be found in the ice cream sundae department at the grocery store. If you can't find them, get regular maraschino cherries and chop.
