Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups uncooked white rice
3 tablespoons sesame oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 cup chopped cooked chicken breast
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 carrots - peeled and diced
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup green peas
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup soy sauce

Directions:
Cook rice according to package directions. While rice is cooking, heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in sesame oil and stir in onion. Fry until golden, then add garlic. When garlic is lightly browned, mix in chicken. Fry until chicken is done.
Lower heat to medium and stir in celery, carrot, green pepper, and peas. Fry until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in beaten egg and cook just until egg is scrambled and firm.
When rice is done, mix thoroughly with vegetables and stir in soy sauce. Adjust seasoning to your preference and serve immediately.
