Ingredients:
4 cups vegetable oil for deep-frying
1 cup cream-style corn
1 egg
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup maple flavored pancake syrup

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small bowl, mix together the cream-style corn and egg. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Add the corn mixture to the dry ingredients, and mix until just blended.
Drop batter 1/8 cup at a time into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, turning once if the fritters don't turn over by themselves. Drain fritters on paper towels, and serve with maple syrup.
