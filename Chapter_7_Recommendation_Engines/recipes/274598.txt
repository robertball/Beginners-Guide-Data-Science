Ingredients:
4 ounces Neufchatel cheese, softened
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg, at room temperature
1 egg white, room temperature
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup raspberries
Glaze:
2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/4 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 9 cups in a cupcake tin with cupcake liners.
Cream Neufchatel cheese, butter, and sugar with an electric mixer until smooth. Add egg and egg white; beat until well combined. Add lemon zest, lemon juice, and lemon extract.
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add to butter mixture and beat until just combined. Fold in raspberries. Spoon batter into the prepared cupcake tin, filling each cup 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.
Mix powdered sugar and lemon juice together in a small bowl and drizzle over cooled cupcakes.

Description: 
These raspberry-lemon cupcakes are not too sweet with just the right amount of tartness. I used frozen raspberries but feel to use fresh raspberries. Easy to make and ready in less than 40 minutes.
