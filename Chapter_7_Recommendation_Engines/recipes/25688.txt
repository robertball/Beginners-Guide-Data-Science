Description: 
I have been preparing this magnificent pasta and bean soup, unchanged for over 30 years, and confess that of the very many Pasta e Fagioli I have tasted none even came close to a reasonable comparison to this superb dish Italiano.  Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese if desired. Makes many servings and is excellent the next day. Should the soup become too thick it may be thinned with broth. Have many Chicago hard rolls, red wine, baguettes or garlic bread on hand. BUON APPETITO!
