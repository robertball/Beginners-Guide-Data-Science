Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
3 (10.75 ounce) cans cream of mushroom soup
1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth
2 chicken breasts, cut into chunks
1 (6 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1/2 cup wild rice
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped celery
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
water, as needed

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels.
Crumble bacon into a large pot; add cream of mushroom soup, chicken broth, chicken, mushrooms, wild rice, onion, celery, and bell pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the rice is completely tender, about 2 hours. Stir water into the soup as needed to keep it from being too thick.
