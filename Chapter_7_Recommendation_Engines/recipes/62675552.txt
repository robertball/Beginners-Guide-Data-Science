Ingredients:
4 thick slices bread (I like Italian or a "sweet" bread like Portuguese)
1 tbsp buter or magarine
2/3 cup unsweetened almond milk
1/4 cup egg whites (about 2)
1/4 cup natural peanut butter, smooth or chunky, softened
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
Whisk together milk, egg whites, softened peanut butter, vanilla and cinnamon.
Melt butter in griddle over medium heat.
Dip slices of bread in peanut butter mixture - let each side soak for a few seconds.  Place on griddle.  Cook about 3 to 4 minutes each side or until golden brown.
These can be served with syrup, powdered sugar, chopped fruit (apples, bananas work well), applesauce, yogurt......probably chocolate syrup, too!
