Ingredients:
1/3 cup chilled whipping cream
1 teaspoon dark brown sugar, packed
4 1/2 cups whole milk
4 large oranges
9 ounces Ghiradelli (chopped) milk chocolate
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
milk chocolate, curls, (optional)
orange peel, twists, (optional)

Directions:
Whisk cream and brown sugar in medium bowl until stiff peaks form.  Cover and refrigerate whipped cream.
Pour milk into heavy large saucepan.  Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (orange part only) from 4 oranges.  Add peel to milk (reserve oranges for another use).  Bring milk mixture to simmer over medium-high heat. Remove from heat.  Cover and let steep 30 minutes.
Strain milk mixture into large bowl, pressing on solids to remove liquid.  Return milk to same saucepan.  Bring to simmer over medium-high heat.  Add chopped chocolate and cocoa powder; whisk until melted and smooth.  Simmer 1 minute, whisking constantly.  Ladle hot chocolate into 4 ceramic cups or mugs.  Top with whipped cream.  Sprinkle with chocolate curls and garnish with orange peel twists, if desired.

Description: 
The flavor of orange? A natural partner for chocolate?  Really comes through in this dessert-like drink.  It's topped with sweet whipped cream and can be garnished with orange peel twists and chocolate curls.  If you prefer cocoa a little less rich, cut the amount of milk chocolate to seven ounces
