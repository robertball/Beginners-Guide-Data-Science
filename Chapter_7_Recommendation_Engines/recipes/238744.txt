Ingredients:
4 corn tortillas, or as needed
1/2 cup chopped onion
5 slices peppered bacon
6 eggs, lightly beaten
2/3 cup sour cream
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen corn (thawed if frozen)
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil

Directions:
Preheat oven 325 degrees F. Wrap tortillas in Reynolds(R) Aluminum Foil and bake for 10 minutes or until soft. Arrange the tortillas to make a crust in a Reynolds(R) Bakeware Pie Pan, overlapping and trimming as needed, and making sure the edges stay below the top edges of the pan.
Cook onion and bacon in a large skillet until onion is tender and bacon is crisp. Drain on paper towels.
Whisk together eggs, sour cream, and salt in a large bowl. Add onion mixture, corn, and cheese; mix well. Pour egg mixture into tortilla-lined pie pan.
Bake 35 to 45 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. If necessary, cover edge of crust with aluminum foil to prevent overbrowning.
Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
