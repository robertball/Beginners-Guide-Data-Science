4 large center cut pork chops, trimmed
1 cup red onion, chopped fine
2 cups white button mushrooms, coarsely chopped
1/2 stick butter (4 tbsps)
1 cup white cooking wine
2 tbsps chopped parsley, fresh is better, but dried works too.
Salt & pepper to taste
Garlic powder to taste
1/2 cup sour cream (optional)
Hot buttered bowtie noodles or white rice

Directions:
In a large skillet over med-high heat, melt butter and cook mushrooms and onions til just tender, about 3 minutes.
Add salt, pepper garlic, parsley and wine.  Cook 1 minute more, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat, place pork chops in pan, spoon some of the mushroom mix on top, cover and simmer 25 minutes.
Remove chops from pan and keep warm.
Add sour cream to pan with sauce and mushroom mix over medium-low heat, stir well, until well blended and hot, about 3 minutes.
Place each chop on a bed of hot bowtie noodles or rice, and spoon mushroom sauce evenly over top of each chop and serve immediately.

Description: 
This recipe came about when I had pork chops and mushrooms on hand and wanted something different.  The richness of the mushrooms and the tang of the wine, make these chops an easy and tasty weeknight main course!  Serve with a tossed green salad for a complete meal.
