Ingredients:
1/2 cup Cream Cheese, softened
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup chopped fresh spinach
1/2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
4 boneless chicken breasts
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
SAUCE:
3/4 cup white wine or chicken broth
1/4 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
3 teaspoons chopped shallot
3 garlic cloves, minced
6 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup butter, cubed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°. In a small bowl, combine first five ingredients. Take each chicken breast and cut a pocket in the breast to stuff with the cheese mixture. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Place in a un-greased 13x9-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, 20-25 minutes or until a thermometer reads 170°.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine wine, tomatoes, shallot, garlic and basil. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; cook until reduced by half. Add cream and butter. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until thickened, stirring occasionally. Serve with chicken.
