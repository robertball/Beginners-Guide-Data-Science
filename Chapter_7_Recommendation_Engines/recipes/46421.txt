Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and finely chopped
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 1/3 cups chopped red and yellow bell peppers
6 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes with thick tomato puree
1 (19 ounce) can black beans, undrained
2 (19 ounce) cans dark red kidney beans, undrained
1 (19 ounce) can cannellini beans, undrained
1 (10 ounce) package frozen whole kernel corn

Directions:
In a large, non stick, stock pot heat olive oil.  Saute jalapeno pepper, onion, and red and  yellow peppers over medium heat until onions are translucent (5-8 minutes).
Add the remaining ingredients and slowly bring to a boil.  Cover pot and simmer on low heat for 20 minutes.  Serve hot.  Chili tastes best when allowed to sit overnight.  Refrigerate chili in covered pot overnight.  Bring to a boil over a low heat, stirring constantly.  Serve with SPLENDA(R) Hearty Corn Cakes.
