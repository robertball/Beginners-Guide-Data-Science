Ingredients:
6 medium chicken breast halves
1/4 cup honey mustard
2 tablespoons low-fat mayonnaise or salad dressing
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed
1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1 cup finely shredded reduced-fat mozzarella cheese
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
1/2 cup finely chopped red sweet pepper
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
3 garlic cloves, minced
Grilled asparagus (optional)
Roma tomatoes, cut up (optional)

Directions:
Make a horizontal pocket in each chicken breast half by cutting from one side almost to, but not through, the other side. Place chicken in a self-sealing plastic bag set in a shallow dish. For marinade, in a small bowl combine mustard, mayonnaise, oil, vinegar, oregano, basil, and rosemary. Pour over chicken; seal bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours, turning bag occasionally.
Meanwhile, for stuffing, in a medium bowl combine mozzarella cheese, spinach, sweet pepper, black pepper, and garlic. Spoon stuffing into pockets in chicken breast halves. If necessary, fasten pockets with wooden toothpicks.
For a charcoal grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan. Test for medium heat above pan. Place chicken breasts, bone sides down, on grill rack over drip pan. Cover; grill for 45 to 55 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink (170  degrees F), turning once halfway through grilling. (For a gas grill, preheat grill. Reduce heat to medium. Adjust for indirect cooking. Grill as above.) If desired, serve  with asparagus and tomatoes.

Description: 
This impressive Wave 1 dish requires at least two hours of marination, but once the stuffed chicken breasts are cooked on the grill they prove to be worth the wait!
