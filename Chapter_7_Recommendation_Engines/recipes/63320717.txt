In the same skillet, melt margarine over medium heat. Cook and stir onions and apples in margarine until caramelized. Stir in applesauce, apple juice, chicken bouillon, garlic, and curry powder. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour over chops, and cover dish with foil.

Description: 
A wonderful change from the traditional pork chops and applesauce.  Boneless pork chops are browned, and then baked in a coating of caramelized onions, apples, and curry powder.  Savory and wonderful! Serve with rice and your favorite vegetable.Modified from: Pork Chops with Apple Curry Sauce
