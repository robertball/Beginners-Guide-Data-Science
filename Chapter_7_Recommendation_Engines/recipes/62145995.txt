Ingredients:
2 Tbsp. unsalted butter
1.5 lbs. carrots
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
2 thyme sprigs
2 cups chicken stock

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
In a large oven-proof skillet, melt the butter over moderately low heat.
Peel and slice carrots 1/4" thick on the diagonal.
Add carrots, garlic and thyme and season with salt and pepper.
Cook, tossing frequently, until the carrots are tender but not browned, about 10 minutes.
Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil and remove from the heat.
Cover the carrots with a round of parchment paper and cover the skillet with a lid.
Braise the carrots in the oven for about 30 minutes, or until they are very tender.
Discard thyme sprigs and serve.
