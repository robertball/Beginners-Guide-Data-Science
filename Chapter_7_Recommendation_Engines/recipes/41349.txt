Ingredients:
1 tablespoon cornmeal
1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed
1/2 pound lean ground beef
1 medium onion, chopped
1 sweet yellow pepper, chopped
1 garlic clove, minced
1 (16 ounce) can fat-free refried beans
1 cup salsa
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 cups (8 ounces) shredded reduced-fat Mexican-blend cheese
2 medium tomatoes, chopped
2 cups shredded lettuce

Directions:
Coat two 12-inch pizza pans with nonstick cooking spray; sprinkle with cornmeal. Divide the bread dough in half; roll each portion into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to prepared pans. Build up edges slightly; prick dough thoroughly with a fork. Bake at 425 degrees for 12 minutes or until lightly browned.
Meanwhile, in a skillet, cook the beef, onion, yellow pepper and garlic over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in refried beans, salsa, chilies and chili powder; heat through. Spread over the crusts; sprinkle with cheese. Bake 6-7 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Top with tomatoes and lettuce; serve immediately.
