Ingredients:
1 can Campbell's cream of chicken soup
1 can Campbell's cheddar cheese soup
1 19 oz can enchilada sauce
1 cup 1% milk or skim milk
1 cup chicken broth
2-3 cups shredded or cubed cooked rotisserie chicken
Serve over crushed tortilla chips.
Top with Lowfat cheddar cheese, lowfat sour cream, green onion, whatever you like!

Directions:
Pour all the ingredients into pot, cook on medium, stir occasionally as it might stick to the bottom. Cook for about 20 minutes until well incorporated.
I mix all the ingredients in the morning in a crockpot and then 2 hours before dinner turn the crockpot on and it's perfect!
