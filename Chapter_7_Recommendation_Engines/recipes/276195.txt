1 cup dry chickpeas (garbanzo beans)

Directions:

Description: 
Instead of buying canned chickpeas, I use my pressure cooker to cook them from dry. I don't need to soak them ahead of time, and I can keep the fresh cooking liquid for different uses (like subbing for chicken broth!) If you do decide to soak the beans, check your appliance manual because cooking time will be shorter.
