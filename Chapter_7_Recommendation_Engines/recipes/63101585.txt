Ingredients:
12 ounces egg noodles , cooked
1/3; cup flour
1/3; cup butter , melted
¼ teaspoon pepper
½ teaspoon dry mustard
3 cups milk
1 cup cheddar cheese , shredded
2 cups sauerkraut , drained
16 ounces kielbasa , ring
½ cup breadcrumbs

Directions:
Cook egg noodles as per directions on package. I really like the Pennsylvania Dutch Kluski noodles as they add great texture to this dish, but I'm sure any thick egg noodle will work. Set aside.
Slice or cube kielbasa - we cube as we like it spread throughout the casserole more thoroughly.
Heat butter in dutch oven until melted, stir in flour and seasonings. When mixture is well combined add milk. Bring to a boil for one minute, stirring constantly.
Add 3/4 cup of cheese, stir until melted.
When sauce is ready stir in sliced kielbasa, drained sauerkraut and pre-cooked egg
noodles.
Pour into a 3 quart casserole.
Mix remaining cheese with bread crumbs and sprinkle over casserole.
Bake at 375° for 20 minutes or until heated through.

Description: 
A true German/Polish dish that is simply Delish!!! I sometimes use Swiss cheese in replace of the cheddar, which is a good switch as well!  This is a casserole that is very inexpensive, simple and quick to make and not to mention leftovers are the best the next day as well!!
