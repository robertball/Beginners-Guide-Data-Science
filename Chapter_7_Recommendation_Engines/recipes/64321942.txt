Ingredients:
3 teaspoon oil, olive, extra-virgin, divided
2 ounce(s) spinach, fresh, 4 cups packed
1 whole pita, 100% whole-wheat, 6 inches each, halved horizontally
1 large tomato(es), plum, thinly sliced
2 large egg(s)
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper, black ground
1 ounce(s) cheese, feta, reduced-fat, crumbled

Directions:
Heat the oven to 450Â°F. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil over medium heat. Add spinach, in batches if necessary, and cook until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush inside of each pita round with 1 teaspoon oil.
Place pita rounds, oiled side up, on a large baking sheet and bake until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven.
Divide tomatoes and spinach evenly among pita halves, leaving an empty space in the center of each for an egg. Crack 1 egg into the center of each pita. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, return to the oven, and bake until yolks are lightly set, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cheese and continue baking until cheese has softened, about 2 minutes more. Serve warm.
