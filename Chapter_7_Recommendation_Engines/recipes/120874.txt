Ingredients:
1 medium onion, chopped
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
1/2 cup minced fresh parsley
3 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dill weed
1/4 teaspoon rubbed sage
3/4 cup cornmeal
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a skillet, saute onion in oil until tender; cool. In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, parsley, sugar, salt, dill, sage and onion mixture; mix well. Add cornmeal; mix well. Stir in whole wheat flour and enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 3-5 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape into two loaves. Place in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30-45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Cover with foil. Bake 15-20 minutes longer or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.

I'm a serious bread baker, and this is my most prized recipe. My husband jokes that the real reason he married me was so that he could enjoy this herb bread forever!
