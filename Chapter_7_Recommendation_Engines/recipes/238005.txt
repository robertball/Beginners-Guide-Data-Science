Description: 
This started as an experiment with a custard-style ice cream base and has become a requested favorite for get-togethers. The sweetness of the peach and smooth cream gets a boost from the earthy spices without being overpowering. I eat it plain but a few friends enjoy it in ice cream sandwiches.
