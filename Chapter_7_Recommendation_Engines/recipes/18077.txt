Ingredients:
6 medium beets
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 cloves garlic, crushed
salt to taste

Directions:
Wash the beets and boil until tender, about 45 minutes (or 20 minutes in a pressure cooker). Remove the skins by running cold water over the boiled beets, and then slipping of their skins. Slice the beets and toss with the olive oil, vinegar, garlic, and salt.

Description: 
This is a simple but elegant dish of beets tossed with a tangy garlic vinaigrette dressing.  Feel free to use more than the two cloves of garlic--I do!
