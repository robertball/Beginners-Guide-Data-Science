Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup honey
1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (2 pound) whole snapper fillet

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a large sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray.
Thoroughly mix the soy sauce, honey, ginger, and garlic in a large bowl. Dip both sides of the fish into the soy sauce mixture, and place onto the aluminum foil. Spoon a little more sauce over the top of the fish. Roll up the aluminum foil to completely enclose the fillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the fish is opaque and flakes easily, about 20 minutes.
