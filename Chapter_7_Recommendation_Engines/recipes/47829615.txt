Ingredients:
900 grams of spaghetti
9 eggs
Parmesan cheese, to taste
2 packages of bacon
1 cup heavy cream
Lemon pepper

Directions:
Fry bacon, set on paper towel to absorb grease and then break into small pieces.
Cook pasta, to al dente, in large pot of boiling water according to package directions. Drain and return to pot.
In a bowl, whisk 9 eggs and 1 cup of cream. Pour egg mixture into the pasta pot and place on low heat. While stirring constantly, add bacon and parmesan cheese. Serve immediately. I donâ€™t measure the amount of cheese I put in. If you like it cheesy you will put more in. Just judge on your own how much you want. For a nice flavor I had lemon pepper.  You can half the amount if you want to make less. It makes great leftovers. Just reheat in microwave.
