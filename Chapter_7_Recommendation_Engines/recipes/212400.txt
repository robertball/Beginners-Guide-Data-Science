Ingredients:
2 liters plain seltzer water
1 tablespoon pressed fresh ginger juice
1 fresh squeezed lemon (medium-sized)
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
5 packets Stevia Extract In The Raw®

Directions:
Cut small pieces of peeled ginger root and place in a press (like the kind used for garlic). Press ginger root to produce 1 tablespoon of juice and place in small bowl. Add strained lemon juice, vanilla extract and Stevia Extract In The Raw. Stir to combine.
Open 2-liter bottle of seltzer and pour out 1/2 cup to make room for soda flavor mixture. Using a funnel, pour mixture into soda bottle and quickly screw on cap.
Careful! The carbonated water will react explosively with the natural ingredients in flavor mixture.
Allow for ingredients to mix with water and for some gas to be released from bottle prior to uncapping - by unscrewing cap just a small amount to hear hissssss. Pour over ice and enjoy!
