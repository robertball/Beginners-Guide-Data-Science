Ingredients:
2 large white sweet potatoes
1 pound ground lamb
1 onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup finely chopped leek
1/4 cup finely chopped celery
1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce (such as Pom√¨)
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained
1 teaspoon ground cumin, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup tahini
1/2 cup finely chopped green onions

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Prick sweet potatoes several times with a fork and place onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 50 minutes to 1 hour.
In the meantime, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir lamb in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Add onion, leek, and celery to the skillet and saute until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, chickpeas, cumin, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat; simmer 5 to 10 minutes. Return lamb to the skillet and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes more.
Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Pour lamb mixture into a baking pan. Mash the sweet potato in a bowl, stir in tahini and green onions, and spread on top of the lamb.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling throughout and top is lightly browned, about 40 minutes.
