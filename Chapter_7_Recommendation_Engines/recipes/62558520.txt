Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups flour
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup margarine or butter
1 can sweetened condensed milk
2 tbsp margarine or butter
1 package milk chocolate chips
1 package Skor toffee bits (Heath bits in the US)

Directions:
Combine the flour, sugar and margarine with a hand mixer until crumby. Pour crumbs into a greased 9x13 pan and pat down into an even crust. Bake at 350F for 20-22 minutes, until lightly golden. Remove from oven while preparing next step.
Heat the condensed milk and the 2 tbsp margarine in a saucepan over low to medium-low heat, stirring until thickened, about 5-10 minutes (I do it until it's starting to stick to the bottom of the pot, even starting to burn a tiny bit). Pour over the baked crust and return to the oven for 12-15 minutes.
Sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over the condensed milk layer (depending on the size of the package, you may or may not need the whole thing - just sprinkle them on until it looks covered enough). Return the pan to the oven until the chocolate is shiny and spreadable, 2-3 minutes. Spread the chocolate as evenly as possible, and sprinkle toffee bits over the chocolate (I use about 3/4 of the bag of toffee bits), pressing them into the chocolate lightly. Let cool and then chill in the fridge for a couple of hours.

Description: 
A delicious toffee chocolate dessert bar. One of my 'specialties' - my brother nearly makes himself sick on them when I make them! They are not my original creation, but I can't remember which magazine or recipe booklet I first saw them in years ago!
