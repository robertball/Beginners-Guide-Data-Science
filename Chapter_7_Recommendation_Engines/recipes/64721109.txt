Ingredients:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1" cubes
2 tbsps vegetable oil
1 large onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp salt, or to taste
1/2 tsp black pepper, or to taste
2 tbsps flour
1 tsp dried basil
3/4 tsp dried oregano
pinch ground nutmeg
3 cups low sodium chicken broth
2 cups unsweetened almond milk
16 oz garden rotini pasta
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt

Directions:
1. Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chicken and onion. Season with salt and black pepper, and cook until lightly browned and chicken is no longer pink, about 5-7 minutes.
2. Sprinkle flour over chicken. Stir, and cook for 1 minute. Pour in chicken broth and almond milk. Add in basil, oregano,  and nutmeg. Stir to combine.
3. Mix in pasta. Bring mixture to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until sauce is slightly thickened and pasta is cooked, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, and stir in Parmesan and Greek yogurt. Season with additional salt and black pepper to taste. Mixture will thicken more as it cools. Serve topped with additional Parmesan, if desired.
