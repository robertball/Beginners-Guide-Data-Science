Ingredients:
1 pound bulk pork sausage
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon beef bouillon granules
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups milk
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease, reserving about 2 tablespoons in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low.
Stir flour, beef bouillon, and black pepper into sausage until evenly coated and grease is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually stir milk into sausage mixture; add Worcestershire sauce. Simmer gravy, stirring often, until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is always a winner in our house. The gravy is not a really thick gravy, but the taste more than makes up for it.  Serve over biscuits or toast.
