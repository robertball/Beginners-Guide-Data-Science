Ingredients:
2 large green tomatoes (or several small)
1 egg white
1/4 cup milk
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornmeal
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 -1/3 cup vegetable oil for frying
Optional:  Garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper (mix into crumbs)
Italian seasoned bread crumbs okay.

Directions:
Slice tomatoes 1/4-1/2 inch thick. Discard the ends.
Whisk egg and milk together in a medium-size bowl. Scoop flour onto a plate. Mix cornmeal, bread crumbs and seasonings on another plate. Dip tomatoes into flour to coat. Then dip the tomatoes into milk and egg mixture. Dredge in crumb/meal mixture to completely coat.
In a large skillet, pour vegetable oil and heat over a medium heat. Place tomatoes into the frying pan in batches. Do not crowd the tomatoes; they should not touch each other. When the tomatoes are browned, flip and fry them on the other side. Drain them on paper towels.

Description: 
You can also fry up red tomatoes with this recipe but make sure they are not over ripe or they will be mushy.  Serve these tomatoes outside with a glass of iced tea one summer night and enjoy the sunset with someone you love.Modified from: Best Fried Green Tomatoes
