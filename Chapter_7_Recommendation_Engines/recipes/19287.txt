1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups self-rising flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, shortening, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Stir in the flour just until blended then fold in the white chocolate chips, macadamia nuts and coconut. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Place the cookies 3 inches apart onto the cookie sheet.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown on top. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
