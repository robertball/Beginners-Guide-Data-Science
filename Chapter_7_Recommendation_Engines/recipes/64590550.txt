Ingredients:
3 tablespoons unsalted butter or coconut oil
8 large eggs, room temperature
1 cup almond milk (I used vanilla unsweetened)
1 teaspoon lemon zest and lemon juice
1/2 cup tapioca flour
2 tablespoons coconut flour
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup blueberries (fresh or frozen)
Local maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. F
Add butter to the pan and place in the oven until batter is ready.
In a large mixing bowl add eggs and almond milk then whisk together.  Continue whisking while adding in tapioca flour, coconut flour, salt, lemon zest and lemon juice.  Fold in blueberries.
Using a pot holder or kitchen towel and remove the pan from the oven.  Swirl around by holding the handle or brush the butter/oil to coat the pan evenly.
Pour batter into pan and bake for 18-20 minutes or until the middle begins to firm.  Slice and enjoy with your favorite toppings and more fruit!

Description: 
It's almost the end of the season for us at the lake and with us moving to Florida I really want to clean out the refrigerator.  I will be using up what I have over the next few weeks and this morning I found 2 bags of frozen blueberries.  I normally use them for my smoothies and this morning I wanted pancakes.  I love pancakes but don't always want to stand over the stove flipping them. 

This morning I decided to make one in my cast iron skillet and OMG I was in Paleo heaven!  I did drizzle local maple syrup and now I am a happy person ready to start my day.
