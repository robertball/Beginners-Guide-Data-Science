Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 onions, finely chopped
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon dry mustard
2 cups dry red lentils
8 cups water, or more to taste
1 cup cooked rice
1 small red Swiss chard - leaves chopped and stems discarded
4 sprigs fresh cilantro, chopped
2 limes, juiced
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat and cook onions until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with turmeric, cumin, and dry mustard and stir to combine for 1 minute.
Rinse lentils under cold running water twice in a colander and drain. Add lentils and water to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until lentils are soft, 20 to 25 minutes. Add rice and puree with an immersion blender. Add more water if soup is too thick.
Stir chard and cilantro into the soup and cook until flavors are well combined, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with lime juice, salt, and pepper.

Description: 
This is a great vegan lentil soup recipe that I often make when I have leftover rice to use up. It is very filling and tastes even better the next day.
