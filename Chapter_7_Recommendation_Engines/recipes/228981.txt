Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 teaspoon garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chopped fresh mint
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups mixed baby salad greens
1/2 cup torn romaine lettuce
2 tablespoons diced mango
1 1/2 teaspoons roasted peanuts
4 slices cucumber, quartered
2 tablespoons crisp chow mein noodles
1 (3 ounce) fresh ahi (yellowfin) tuna steak
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 avocado, sliced

Directions:
Whisk olive oil, lime juice, cilantro, garlic, mint, lemon juice, and salt in a bowl. Refrigerate salad dressing for at least 1 hour or overnight for best flavor.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and grease the grate.
Toss salad greens, romaine lettuce, mango, peanuts, cucumber, and chow mein noodles in a salad bowl.
Sprinkle tuna with salt and black pepper.
Grill tuna on the preheated grill until the outside is seared and brown and the inside is still red, about 1 1/2 minutes per side for rare. Slice the grilled tuna.
Top salad with slices of avocado and grilled tuna; drizzle with salad dressing to taste.

Description: 
The closest I've been able to come in recreating one of my favorites! The salad will be fairly greasy, but that is how it is in the restaurant version as well. It just doesn't taste nearly as good with only little dressing. I usually use about 3/4 of the dressing, but you may use less or more. Enjoy!
