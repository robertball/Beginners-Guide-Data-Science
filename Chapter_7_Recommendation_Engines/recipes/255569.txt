Ingredients:
Coffee Chile Spice Rub:
1 tablespoon fennel seeds
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
1 tablespoon coriander seeds
1/4 cup finely ground dark roast coffee beans
1/4 cup ground ancho chile pepper
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt
2 tablespoons hot smoked paprika
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
Steak:
1 pound hanger steak
salt to taste
1 teaspoon olive oil
4 shallots, halved
3 cloves garlic, smashed
3 sprigs fresh thyme
1 tablespoon butter, cut in small pieces
Salad Dressing:
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons honey
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Salad:
1 bulb fennel, halved
1/2 lemon, juiced
1/2 apple, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1 tablespoon fresh mint leaves, or to taste
1 tablespoon fresh parsley leaves, or to taste
1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves, or to taste
1/4 cup pomegranate seeds
2 tablespoons chopped hazelnuts

Directions:
Cook and stir fennel seeds, cumin seeds, and coriander seeds in a skillet over medium-high heat until toasted and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a spice grinder or food processor; add coffee, ancho chile pepper, brown sugar, kosher salt, paprika, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Grind until spice rub is a medium-coarse texture.
Break steak down into 4-ounce pieces. Lightly score steak 1/2-inch x 1/2-inch and season with salt. Rub steak with spice rub. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium high. Pack spice rub onto all sides of the steak and place in the hot cast iron skillet; drizzle about 1 teaspoon olive oil over steak.
Cook steak in the cast iron skillet until well browned, about 4 minutes. Flip and scatter shallots, smashed garlic, thyme, and butter around steak. Cook steak until desired doneness is reached, 4 to 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Let steak rest for 5 minutes; cut into thin slices.
Whisk juice of 1 lemon, lemon zest, olive oil, honey, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl until dressing is evenly mixed.
Thinly shave fennel and toss with juice from 1/2 lemon (to preserve color) in a bowl. Add apple, mint, parsley, and cilantro. Drizzle dressing over salad and toss gently; season with salt and pepper. Arrange steak slices on top of salad and scatter roasted shallots, pomegranate seeds, and hazelnuts on top.

Description: 
This smoky, sweet, spicy rub adds amazing flavor and color to just about any type of steak or pork tenderloin â€“ and is great for grilling and pan-searing. To save time, make the rub ahead of time and store in an airtight container until ready to use. This recipe was made in a Panasonic CIO and appears on an episode of the Dinner Spinner TV Show on The CW!
