Ingredients:
1 winter squash of your choice (acorn, butternut or other, excluding spaghetti squash)
1/2 c. heavy cream (more or less to taste)
1/4 c. butter
2 tbsp. brown sugar (optional)
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. pepper
1 tbsp. yellow curry

Directions:
Cut squash in half.  Scoop out seeds and strings.  Cut squash halves further into quarters.  Place in dutch oven and cover with cold water.  Bring to boil.  Simmer until tender, about 30 minutes.  Drain, leave uncovered, and cool approximately 20 minutes.  Scoop squash out of shells/skins into a mixing bowl.  Add cream and seasonings.  Whip on medium with whisk attachment until fluffy. If a more moist potato is desired, add more cream. Serve at once.
