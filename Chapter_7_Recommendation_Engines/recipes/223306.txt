Ingredients:
8 jalapeno peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add jalapeno peppers, cover, and steam until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Mix cream cheese with Parmesan, Cheddar, and feta cheeses, garlic, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chili powder, and garlic powder in a bowl.
Arrange jalapeno peppers on prepared baking sheet. Spoon cheese mixture into each pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 10 minutes.
