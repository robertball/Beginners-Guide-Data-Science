Ingredients:
2 6 ounce cans tomato paste
15 ounce can tomato sauce
1 1/3 cups brown sugar
1 1/2 cups red wine vinegar
1/2 cup unsulfured molasses
4 teaspoons hickory-flavored liquid smoke
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon allspice
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon paprika
2 teaspoons celery salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium heat, mix together the tomato paste, tomato sauce, brown sugar, wine vinegar, molasses, liquid smoke and butter. Season with garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, paprika, celery seed, cinnamon, cayenne, salt and pepper.
Reduce heat to low, and simmer for up to 20 minutes. For thicker sauce, simmer longer, and for thinner, less time is needed. Sauce can also be thinned using a bit of water if necessary. Brush sauce onto any kind of meat during the last 10 minutes of cooking.

Description: 
I did not have the ketchup one day to make this, so I found a recipe for ketchup to make my own. Realizing that many of the ingredients are similar to the ones used in the BBQ sauce recipe, I decided that I preferred the ketchup-free version. It does not use ketchup, and has been simplified. In my opinion, it turns out just as well as the original (which has been fabulous all 10 times that I have made it!) but it doesn't use my entire bottle of ketchup!Modified from: Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce
