Ingredients:
3 green plantains
1 quart water
1/4 cup olive oil
1 cup sliced white onion
1 1/2 tablespoons salt
1 cup sliced Anaheim peppers

Directions:
Place the plantains and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, and cook 20 minutes, until plantains are tender but slightly firm. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the liquid. Cool plantains, and peel.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the onion until tender.
In a bowl, mash the plantains with the reserved liquid and salt. Transfer to a food processor, mix in the peppers, and puree. Serve the pureed plantain mixture topped with the onions.
