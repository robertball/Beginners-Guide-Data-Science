Ingredients:
8 pounds pork baby back/spareribs (add steaming 2 hours if using spareribs)
3 cups ketchup
1 cup barbeque sauce
1 cup brown sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 dash hot pepper sauce, or to taste
3 tablespoons steak sauce, (e.g. Heinz 57)
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Place the ribs in a large stock pot with enough water to cover. Bring the water to a boil and cook over medium-high heat for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In medium saucepan, combine ketchup, barbeque sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, steak sauce and garlic; blend well.  Cook the sauce over medium heat for approximately 20 minutes.
Cut the ribs between the bones and place in a baking pan. Pour sauce over ribs, cover and cook for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue cooking for an additional 30 minutes. If using SPARERIBS, steam, covered an additional 2 hours.
