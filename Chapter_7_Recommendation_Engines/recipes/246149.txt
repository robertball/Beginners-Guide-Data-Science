Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, broken into florets
1 cup almond flour
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Bring water to boil in a saucepan. Add cauliflower; boil until tender, about 15 minutes. Strain cauliflower, transfer to a bowl, and mash with a fork.
Stir almond flour, eggs, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper into cauliflower until well-combined; form into 1/4-cup sized patties.
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry patties in a single layer until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining patties and olive oil.
