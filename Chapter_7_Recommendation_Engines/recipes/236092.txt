Ingredients:
1 teaspoon grapeseed oil
1 onion, diced
1/2 cup sliced shiitake mushrooms
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon wine vinegar
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 bunch kale leaves, torn (ribs removed and discarded)
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

Directions:
Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion, mushrooms, and garlic in hot oil until the mushrooms are soft, about 5 minutes. Add butter and vinegar to the mushroom mixture; season with salt and pepper. Toss mushroom mixture in the wok until the butter melts and coats everything, about 1 minute.
Switch heat off and add kale to the wok; cook and stir in the hot wok until the kale is bright green, about 5 minutes. Season kale mixture with nutmeg and stir.

Description: 
I make this at least twice a week for my family. It is a super easy and yummy way for us to get a good dose of our dark leafy greens. Macadamia nut oil is also good in place of grapeseed if you have it.
