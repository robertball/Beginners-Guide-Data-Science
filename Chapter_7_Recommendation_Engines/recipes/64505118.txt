Ingredients:
1 large egg yolk
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 ½ teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon white vinegar
¾ cup macadamia nut oil or avocado oil (you will have a nutty flavor using Mac Nut oil)

Directions:
If you choose, you can use an immersion blender and will have this done in no time! If you choose to use an immersion blender be sure to use a container that is narrow and with high sides. The container should just fit your blender.
You can also use a stand blender. When using a stand blender you will need to SLOWLY drizzle your oil in as the blender is blending.
You can also so use a bowl, whisk and elbow grease. This will take time and patience.
For immersion blender, add all the ingredients to your container. Place blender in the container with the bottom of the blender flat agains the bottom of the container.
Blend until all your oil is incorporated.
For stand blender, place all your but the 3/4 cup of oil in the blender.
Turn on blender, SLOWLY add the remaining oil, SLOWLY in a steady stream.
NOTE: you will have splatter, so I tuck a paper towel around the opening to reduce the mess.
For hand blending, this process is the same as stand blending, but you will use your elbow grease to create the emulsion.
