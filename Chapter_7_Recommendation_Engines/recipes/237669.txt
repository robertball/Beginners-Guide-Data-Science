Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup sliced Chinese sweet pork sausage (lup cheong)
1 large egg, beaten
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
1/2 cup chopped bok choy
2 cups cold, cooked jasmine rice

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Stir sausage and egg into the hot oil; cook while stirring to scramble the eggs until they begin to firm, about 2 minutes. Season egg mixture with 1 teaspoon salt; add bok choy. Cook and stir until the bok choy begins to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.
Break rice into small pieces and add to the skillet; cook while stirring to break the rice into individual grains
