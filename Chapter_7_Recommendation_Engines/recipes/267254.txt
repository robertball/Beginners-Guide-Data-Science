Ingredients:
2 cups frozen corn, thawed
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (13.5 ounce) can spinach, drained
1 1/2 cups shredded jalapeno Jack cheese
1 cup sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles, drained
4 green onions, sliced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 (16 ounce) package egg roll wrappers
cooking spray

Directions:
Mix corn, beans, spinach, jalapeno Jack cheese, Cheddar cheese, green chiles, green onions, salt, cumin, and chili powder together in a large bowl for the filling.
Lay an egg roll wrapper at an angle. Use your finger to lightly moisten all 4 edges with water. Place about 1/4 cup of the filling in the center of the wrapper. Fold 1 corner over filling and tuck in the sides to form a roll. Repeat with remaining wrappers and mist each egg roll with cooking spray.
Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (199 degrees C). Place egg rolls in the basket, making sure they are not touching; cook in batches if necessary. Fry for 8 minutes; flip and cook until skins are crispy, about 4 minutes more.
