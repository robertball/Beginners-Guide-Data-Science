4 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1 (9 inch) graham cracker crust

Directions:
Heat oven to 325 F.  In large bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar.  Add eggs and vanilla; beat well.
In small bowl, reserve 1/2 cup cream cheese mixture.  In heavy saucepan over very low heat, melt chocolate chips with shortening; stir into reserved 1/2 cup cream cheese mixture.
Pour vanilla mixture into crust.  Drop spoonfuls of chocolate mixture onto vanilla mixture; swirl with knife or metal spatula for marbled effect.  Place filled crust on cookie sheet.
Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until center is almost set.  Cool to room temperature.  Cover; refrigerate several hours or until firm.  Refrigerate leftover cheesecake.  8 servings.
