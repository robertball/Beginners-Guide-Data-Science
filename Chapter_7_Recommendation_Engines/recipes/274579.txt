Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups mashed banana
1/3 cup oil
1/3 cup milk, or as needed
1 medium egg, beaten
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cocoa powder
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with 12 paper liners.
Combine mashed banana, oil, milk, egg, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl. Sift flour and cocoa powder into a large bowl. Add sugar, baking powder, and salt into the flour mixture; mix to combine. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Batter should be wet enough to scoop into muffin liners; add a little extra milk if your mixture is too dry.
Stir chocolate chips into batter. Scoop batter into muffin liners.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 12 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
I love banana! And these make the ideal treat for supper for the school lunches. They freeze well so double the recipe and try and leave some for the freezer! Store in an airtight container once cooled.
