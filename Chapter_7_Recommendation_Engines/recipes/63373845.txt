5 cups of unsalted cashew haves
1/2 cup of olive oil
1/4 cup of dried rosemary
pinch of salt (to taste)
pinch of black pepper (to taste)
1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper
pinch of garlic powder

Directions:
in a large 10in saute pan you want to add the oil and place the heat on medium. be sure to coat the entire bottom of the pan. Once the oil is heated add the cashews. and toss with a wooden spoon every few minutes, and cover. What your looking for a is a dark golden color on the cashews and a bit soft.
After you have the coloring right you want to turn the heat to low and add the spices gradually not all at once. Toss as you add to give a good coat. once the cashews are seasoned cover and let simmer for about 3 to 5 minutes then let cool.
