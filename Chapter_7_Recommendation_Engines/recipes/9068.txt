Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups chicken stock
1/4 cup wild rice
4 tablespoons butter
2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms
2 cups chopped celery
1 cup chopped onion
4 cups corn bread stuffing mix
1 tablespoon poultry seasoning

Directions:
Combine chicken stock and wild rice in a saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat.
Melt the butter in a large skillet. Add the mushrooms, celery, and onion. Cook and stir until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.
In a large bowl, mix the crumbled cornbread and poultry seasoning. Add the rice with chicken broth and the vegetables and mix well. Use to stuff a turkey or bake on its own. More chicken stock can be added if stuffing is dry.
