Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup hot sauce
1 dash ground black pepper
1 dash garlic powder
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
10 chicken wings

Directions:
Combine the butter, hot sauce, pepper and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir together and heat until butter is melted and mixture is well blended. Remove from heat and reserve.
In a small bowl mix together the flour, paprika, cayenne pepper and salt. Place chicken wings in a  zip lock bag with  dry mixture and shake until they are evenly coated.   Spread coated wings on a rack set over a jelly roll pan and refrigerate for 60 to 90 minutes to help set the flour mixture.  This step is very important.  Take from refrigerator and bake at 350 for 45 minutes.  Then turn the oven to 375 and brush on the sauce and bake for another 5 minutes and then turn wings and brush the other side.  Bake for another 5 minutes and wings should be good and crispy.  May adjust cooking time to desired brownness.
