1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract

3/4 cup chopped pecans

Beat the softened butter, salt, vanilla extract, almond extract and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar until the mixture is thoroughly combined.
Add pecans and flour.
Mix until combined.
Roll the dough into balls the size of large marbles or walnuts.
Place on the prepared cookie sheet and bake for 15 minutes or when the cookies start to brown.
Pour the other 1/2 cup of powdered sugar in a small mixing bowl.
Remove from oven and when cookies are still hot but cool enough to handle roll them in powdered sugar.
Let the cookies cool completely and roll in powdered sugar once more.
Enjoy with tea or all by themselves!
