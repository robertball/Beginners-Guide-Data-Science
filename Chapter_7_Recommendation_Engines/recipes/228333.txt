2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped

1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste

Directions:
Blend carrot and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped.
Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir carrot mixture, onion, and green bell pepper until softened, about 10 minutes. Add millet; stir until fragrant and toasted, about 3 minutes.

Description: 
My Cuban suegra taught me how to make a sofrito. I used this same process (without tomatoes and plus a carrot) to enhance millet. Serve warm or cold.
