Ingredients:
1/2 cup tapioca flour
2 tablespoon arrowroot powder
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 1/2 pounds fresh sole or flounder, pat dry
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2-3 tablespoons Italian fresh parsley, chopped

Directions:
In a shallow bowl or baking dish add in tapioca flour, arrowroot powder, salt and pepper.  Use a fork to combine well.
Dredge the sole lightly into the mixture then give a little shake and set aside on a plate.
Heat a large pan over medium-high heat.  You will do this in 2 batches.  Add 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil to the hot pan and let the butter melt and almost start to bubble.
Add sole fillets into the pan (do not let them touch each other) and cook each side for ab out 2 minutes then flip and cook the other side for 1 minute until golden brown.  Carefully remove and set on a plate then tent lightly with foil.   Cook the remaining fillets after adding in the remaining butter and oil.  Place all of the sole on the platter.
Add lemon juice and bring to a high simmer then add in parsley and stir around. Add the sole back into the pan and let warm through then serve.

Description: 
Meuniére is fish lightly coated in flour then sautéed in butter then add lemon juice and parsley before serving.  The butter becomes more of a browned butter and this dish is beautiful and delicious.  I love using sole or flounder.
