1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons paprika

1 1/2 (16 ounce) cans kidney beans, drained with liquid reserved
2 tablespoons tomato paste
hot sauce to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat.  Saute garlic, onion, bell pepper, parsley, chili powder, cumin, paprika, turmeric, salt and pepper, until onions are tender.  Stir in kidney beans and some of the reserved liquid until desired consistency. Stir in tomato paste and hot sauce.
Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for an hour, stirring occasionally.  Add more bean liquid and/or water if necessary so that beans don't dry out.

Description: 
We used to have this for dinner during the summer at the lake. Whoever was cooking would throw it all together in the morning and by dinner time, it was ready. If there were ever any leftovers, they were gone after lunch the next day. Even the 10 year old boys ate it.
