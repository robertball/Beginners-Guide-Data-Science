Ingredients:
2 cups light cream
1/4 teaspoon coconut extract, or to taste
1/4 cup Panang-style red curry paste
2 tablespoons chicken broth, or to taste
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 white onion, chopped
2 tablespoons Asian fish sauce (nam pla)
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed

Directions:
Heat cream and coconut extract in a skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Whisk curry paste and chicken broth together in a bowl; stir into cream mixture and bring to a simmer. Add chicken, cover, and cook just until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes.
Stir red pepper, green pepper, onion, fish sauce, sugar, garlic, and basil into the curry mixture. Replace cover; cook until vegetables are just cooked through, about 3 minutes more. Stir in flour to thicken to desired consistency.

Description: 
This is a Thai recipe that can also be made with pork, beef, or tofu instead of chicken. This recipe traditionally contains coconut milk, but I substituted other ingredients. Serve over rice.
