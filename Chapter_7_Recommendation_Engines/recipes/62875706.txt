½ tsp. salt
¼ tsp. pepper
1 can diced tomatoes
1 tsp. dried Italian herb seasoning or oregano
1 lb. frozen ravioli or tortellini

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450F.
In large non-stick skillet, cook beef over med-high heat, breaking up with wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 5-7 minutes. Drain off fat.
Add onion, garlic, salt and pepper; cook for 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and herb seasoning. Reduce heat to med-low; cover and cook for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in large saucepan of boiling salted water, cook ravioli for 2-5 minutes if fresh, 6-8 minutes if frozen, or until tender but firm. Drain well and add to sauce; toss to coat.
Divide among 4 individual gratin dishes or place in one 11x7 inch glass baking dish; sprinkle with mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. Bake in oven for 10 minutes or until cheese is melted.
Freeze-ahead: After sprinkling with cheese, let unbaked casserole cool for 30 minutes. Refrigerate until cold. Cover and unwrap with heavy-duty foil and freeze for up to 1 month. Thaw in refrigerator. Bake as directed.
