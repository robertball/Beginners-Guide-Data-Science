Ingredients:
2 cups of finely grated bar soap (Felsnaptha, Zote, Kirk's Castile)
1 cup of 20 Mule Team Borax
1 cup of Arm and Hammer Washing Soda
1/4 cup OxyClean
Make sure that you buy Washing Soda, this is not Baking soda.  It can be found in the laundy aisle.
Use 1 tablespoon regular loads
Use 2 tablespoons for heavy/extra dirty loads

Directions:
Grate the bar soap as fine as you can.  I use the food processor or Kithcen Aid grater attachment to do this.
Mix the borax, washing soda and oxyclean together.  Combine with the grated bar soap.  Working in small batches, process the soaps together to a fine powder.
The oxyclean scoop is 2 Tablespoons.
Use a whole scoop for large or really dirty clothes.  Half a scoop for regular loads.

Description: 
This is a great money saver.  My clothes get really clean and I save a ton of money.  I make huge batches of this at one time.  The number of servings is a guess.
