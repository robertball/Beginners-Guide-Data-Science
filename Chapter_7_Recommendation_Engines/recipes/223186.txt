Ingredients:
2 onions, chopped
1 green bell pepper, cut into chunks
1/4 habanero pepper, or more to taste
3 tablespoons light virgin palm oil
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon peanut butter, or more to taste
2 cubes chicken bouillon
1 teaspoon salt
2 bunches fresh spinach, cut into thin strips

Directions:
Blend onions, green bell pepper, habanero pepper, and oil in a blender until creamy.
Transfer the onion mixture to a stock pot. Add water, peanut butter, bouillon cubes, and salt to the onion mixture. Place a cover on the stock pot and bring the mixture to a boil; cook at a boil for 30 minutes.
Stir the spinach into the boiling mixture; replace the cover on the stock pot and cook until the water has evaporated a bit and the sauce has the consistency of gravy, about 30 minutes more.

This is my mother-in-law's recipe. She resides in Freetown, Sierra Leone. If you have trouble getting the consistency, simmer for a bit without the lid. Serve over rice or with bread.
