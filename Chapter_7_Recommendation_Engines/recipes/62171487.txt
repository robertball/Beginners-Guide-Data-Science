Tips & Notes
Make Ahead Tip: Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Reheat in the microwave or serve cold.
Tip: To make fresh breadcrumbs: Trim crusts from firm sandwich bread. Tear bread into pieces and process in a food processor until a coarse crumb forms. One slice of bread makes about 1/3 cup crumbs.

Description: 
The frying and fuss are taken out of crab cakes by shaping and baking them in muffin tins. For the best taste, look for pasteurized crabmeat in the refrigerator case at your market's fish counter, a better choice than canned varieties. Make it a meal: Try these cakes with some tangy tartar sauce and coleslaw.
