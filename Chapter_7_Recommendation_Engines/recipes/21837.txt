Ingredients:
4 refrigerated cornbread biscuits
4 vegetarian hot dogs

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Wrap a biscuit around each hot dog, pinching the dough at the end to seal.
Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
The serving size all depends on the number of refrigerator biscuits used, so I just chose 4!  These are quick and easy.  They are also a nice 'comfort food' that kids really enjoy!
