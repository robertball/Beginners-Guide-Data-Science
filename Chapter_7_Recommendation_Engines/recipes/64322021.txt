Ingredients:
1/2 cup(s) wine, dry white
1/2 medium shallot(s) coarsely chopped
1 1/2 sprig(s) parsley, Italian with extra leaves for garnish
2 fillet(s) fish, striped bass, fillets (about 6 ounces each)
salt to taste
pepper, black ground to taste
8 whole carrot(s), baby
6 ounce(s) asparagus (small bunch), thickly sliced
1 medium leek(s) white and light-green parts only, thinly sliced

Directions:
In large deep-sided skillet, combine wine, 1 cup water, shallot, and parsley sprigs. Bring to a boil over high heat. Season fish with salt and pepper; add to pot. Cover and simmer about 8 minutes, until fish is opaque and just flakes when you poke with a fork.
Use a slotted spoon to remove fish from skillet. Add carrots and asparagus to simmering liquid; cover and cook 2 minutes, until crisp-tender. Transfer vegetables to medium bowl. Discard liquid.
Meanwhile, coat medium nonstick skillet with cooking spray; set over medium heat. Cook leeks 4 minutes, until softened, stirring. Add cooked carrots and asparagus to skillet; stir to coat and combine flavors. Season with salt, pepper, and parsley. Serve fish and vegetables garnished with additional parsley.
