Ingredients:
Medium yellow onion sliced into thin rings
2 tsp. olive oil
Butter
1 lb. seasoned hamburger
8 slices of bread (country, white, light rye)
8 slices American cheese
Condiments such as ketchup, bread and butter pickles, spicy mustard or Russian dressing

Directions:
Saute onion slices in 2 tsp butter and 2 tsp olive oil over medium heat for about 30 minutes, until caramelized.
While onions are cooking, form 4 quarter pound patties into the shape of your bread (usually square).
Grill or pan fry patties until medium rare, or one notch below your hamburger preference (they will cook a little more later).
Assemble sandwiches for grilling; lay down slice of bread, add 1 slice of cheese, add 1 cooked hamburger patty, add 1/4 of the caramelized onions, add 1 slice of cheese and then finish with a slice of bread.
Lightly butter the outside of the top slice of bread.
Heat cast iron skillet or other flat-bottomed pan over medium to medium-high heat and put sandwiches butter side down.
While first side is browning, lightly butter outside of the top slice of bread so it is ready when you flip.
Flip after approximately 2 minutes.
Judge when the patty melt is done the same way you judge your grilled cheese.

Description: 
My daughter Maddie and I do not like hamburgers, so I have been looking for a recipe that makes them palatable so I can cook them for the whole family.  She LOVED these, especially the caramelized onions.  Mission complete!  This is a heavy sandwich, so serve with a spinach stawberry salad and roasted carrots (no fries!)
