Ingredients:
1 package McCormick® Grill Mates® Zesty Herb Marinade
1/3 cup water
3 tablespoons white vinegar
3 tablespoons oil
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 pork loin chops
1 (3/4 pound) salmon steak
1/2 pound Italian sausage links

Directions:
Combine Marinade mix, water, vinegar and oil in a small bowl. Place chicken, pork, salmon and sausage links in a single layer in a large, self-closing plastic bag.  Pour marinade over meat and close bag. Turn bag gently to coat all sides of meat.  Refrigerate 30 minutes or longer for extra flavor.
Remove meat from marinade. Place meat on preheated grill. Discard any leftover marinade. Grill chicken and pork 5-7 minutes per side or until done. Grill salmon and sausages 8-10 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork and sausages are well done.
