Ingredients:
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon salt
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon coriander
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon cumin
2/3 cup chickpea flour (besan)
4 tablespoons water, or as needed
cooking spray

Directions:
Mix red onion, yellow onion, salt, jalapeno, garlic, coriander, chili powder, turmeric, and cumin in a large bowl. Stir until evenly combined. Add chickpea flour and water. Stir to combine into a thick batter. Add more water if necessary. Let mixture rest for 10 minutes.
Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray the air fryer basket with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon 2 tablespoons of batter into the basket and flatten. Repeat as many times as your basket allows without the bhajis touching.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 6 minutes. Mist the tops of each bhaji with cooking spray. Flip and cook 6 additional minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batter.
