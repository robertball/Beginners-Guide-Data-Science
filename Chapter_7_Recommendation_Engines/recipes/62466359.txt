Ingredients:
CRUST:
1 1/2-2 C. Flour
1/8 C. Sugar
1/4 C. Butter or Stick Margarine, Softened
1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/4 teaspoons yeast
1/2 C. warm water
FILLING:
1 lb. Hamburger
3 to 4 C. shredded cabbage, small head
1 onion
1-2 Tablespoons Garlic Powder
Salt and Pepper to taste
Individually Wrapped Cheese Slices

Directions:
1. For Crust- Mix flour, sugar, butter, salt and yeast in a large bowl. Add warm water and stir until soft ball forms. Knead on a floured surface for several minutes. Allow to rise for 1 hour, covered in a dry, warm place.
2. For Filling- Brown hamburger and onion together. Add cabbage and let cook for about 10 minutes, until steamed. Add garlic powder, salt and pepper.
3. Split dough in half. Roll out each to fit an 8x8 baking dish. Put one half on bottom and sides of pan to form crust. Place hamburger filling on top. Cover with cheese slices, like cheddar. (I prefer velveeta singles.) Cover with the other half of dough to form upper crust and try to pinch closed.
4. Bake in oven at 350 for 20 minutes. Cover with foil and bake another 10 minutes. Allow to sit for several minutes before cutting.
