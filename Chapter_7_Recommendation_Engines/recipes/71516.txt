Description: 
This recipe was given me by my aunt, who loves Mediterranean cooking. A delicious, refreshing salad made from shredded cabbage and a dressing made from lemon, garlic, olive oil, and cilantro. The proportions I listed will at least start you out with a dressing that's not too strong, but feel free to play around with them. This salad is more of an art than a science.
