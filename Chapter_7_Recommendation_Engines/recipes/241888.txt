Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package French vanilla cake mix (such as Duncan Hines® Moist Deluxe)
3 large eggs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, plus
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/3 cup soybean oil
Icing:
4 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/3 cup shortening
3 tablespoons half-and-half
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheet with silicone baking mats.
Beat cake mix, eggs, 1/2 cup flour, 3 tablespoons flour, and soybean oil together in a stand mixer until stiff.
Divide and roll dough into 1-inch balls and arrange on prepared baking sheets and flatten to about 1/2-inch thick.
Bake in preheated oven until somewhat firm in the center, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove from oven and let cookies sit undisturbed until set, about 5 minutes more.
Spread a sheet of aluminum foil onto a countertop. Transfer cookies to foil to cool completely, at least 20 minutes.
Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, shortening, half-and-half, and vanilla extract together with a hand mixer until smooth; spoon into a pastry bag and pipe onto cooled cookies or just spread onto cookies using a spatula.
