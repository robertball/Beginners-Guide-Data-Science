Description: 
Perfect for cold winter evenings or a late lunch after a day raking leaves, or an afternoon playing in the snow.  The chopping may take a few minutes, but once you have the ingredients together, it takes no time to put everything together.  The beer is a real surprise ingredient and gives a real flavor depth, that no one can really identify.  I've been making this for more than 25 years and it's everyone's favorite.
