Ingredients:
375g/13oz plain Four
Pinch Salt
225g/8oz Butter - diced
150g/5oz mature Cheddar Cheese - grated
60g/2oz grated Parmesan Cheese - grated
½tsp English/Dijon mustard
Small pinch Cayenne Pepper
2 Egg Yolks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5;
Sift the flour and a pinch of salt into a bowl;
Using your fingertips, rub in the butter until all the lumps are gone and the texture is like fine breadcrumbs;
Stir in the cheese, mustard powder, cayenne, and egg yolks;
Add 4-5 tablespoons of cold water and mix to a firm dough;
Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes;
Line a baking sheet with baking parchment;
Roll out the dough to a square, roughly the thickness of a £2 coin;
Cut the square in half, then cut each half into 1cm/½in strips;
Transfer carefully onto the lined baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes, until crisp, then leave to cool on the tray.
