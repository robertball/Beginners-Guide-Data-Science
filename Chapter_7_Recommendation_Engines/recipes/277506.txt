Ingredients:
3 vanilla beans
2 cups vodka
1 cup water

Directions:
Split vanilla beans with a very sharp knife.
Pour vodka into a mason jar and add vanilla beans. Place a lid loosely on the jar.
Place a trivet in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and set the mason jar on top of the trivet. Pour water into the pot.
Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 30 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Transfer mixture, including vanilla beans, into a glass bottle, and seal tightly.

Description: 
Homemade vanilla takes months to develop, but if you have an Instant Pot® you can make vanilla extract even faster! 
You don't have to get expensive vodka, because the star is the vanilla beans! Make sure you use quality vanilla beans--and yes, the type of vanilla beans does matter.  I bought my vanilla beans from the Savory Spice Shop®.
