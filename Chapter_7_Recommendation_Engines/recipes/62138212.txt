Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups brown sugar
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
1 - 2 cups icing sugar

Directions:
In a medium, heavy saucepan, bring the sugar and cream to a rolling boil, stirring constantly over high heat. Boil 1 minute. Add Baking Soda and boil 1 more minute. (Important note - do not boil for more than time listed)
Remove from heat. Add butter pieces but DO NOT STIR. Let mixture cool on counter for 15 minutes then place in fridge for 45 - 60 minutes until completely cool.
Beat well. Beat in icing sugar 1/2 cup at a time until desired consistency is reached. (I usually use about 1 cup)
** NOTE - It is important to let icing cool completely before beating.
