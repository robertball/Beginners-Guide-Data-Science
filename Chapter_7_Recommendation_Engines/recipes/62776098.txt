Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 large onion, diced
2-4 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 small head of cabbage, finely chopped
1-2 zucchini, peeled and diced
1-2 tomatoes, cored and diced
1 stalk of celery, diced
1 leek, chopped
2-3 carrots, peeled and chopped
2 cubes bouillon (beef or parsley)
5-7 cups water
4-5 cubes of frozen spinach
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 can white beans
6-12 slices stale bread
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Saute onion in olive oil until it begins to soften.  Add garlic and soften it briefly.
Add chopped vegetables and stir until they begin to soften and even brown a little.
Add water, bouillon cubes and dried rosemary.  Cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours.
Add white beans and bring to a boil.  Recover and simmer for 10 minutes.
Leave it on the stove to cool all day or even overnight.  Just donâ€™t open the pot until you are ready to finish it.  If you need to wait longer, store it in the refrigerator.
Add stale bread and simmer for 10 more minutes.
Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serve.

Description: 
A friend called this Italian home cooking at its best - a bunch of vegetables and leftover bread that somehow becomes a wonderful, hearty soup that is also good to serve to your vegan friends.  The bulk of it can be made as far in advance as the night before or just 2-3 hours before dinner.
