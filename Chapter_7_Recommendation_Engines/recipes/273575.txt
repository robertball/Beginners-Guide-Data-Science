Ingredients:
aluminum foil
6 slices bacon, divided
8 small red potatoes, or more to taste, halved
1 red onion, quartered and slightly broken apart
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon chili powder
coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Build a campfire and allow the fire to burn until hot.
Cross two 1 1/2-foot long pieces of aluminum foil so the centers are overlapping. Place 3 strips of bacon in the center of the foil.
Combine potatoes, onion, red pepper flakes, and chili powder in a bowl. Season generously with salt and pepper. Place potato mixture on top of the bacon slices and top with the remaining bacon slices.
Fold the opposite ends of the foil inward to create a packet, making sure that all open spaces are sealed.
Throw the packet directly on the campfire. Cook, turning as needed so the contents do not burn, until potatoes are tender and edges of the foil blacken, 45 to 60 minutes. Open packet very carefully.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe on a camping trip in New Hampshire's White Mountains. Potatoes, onions, and bacon are roasted in foil over an open flame. Normally I'd use olive oil, but we were in the mountains and the only source of fat/oil we had was the bacon. Turned out to be a hit and we've been making these ever since.
