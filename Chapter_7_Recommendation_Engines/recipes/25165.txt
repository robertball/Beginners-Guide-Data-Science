Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 pound bacon
2 bunches fresh spinach, rinsed and dried
4 green onions, thinly sliced
2 eggs
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/4 cup red wine vinegar

Directions:
Place 6 eggs in a medium saucepan with enough cold water to cover. Bring water to a boil, and immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel, and chop.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside, reserving approximately 1/2 cup of drippings in the skillet.
In a large bowl, toss together the spinach and green onions.
Heat the reserved drippings over low heat. In a small bowl, whisk together the 2 remaining eggs, sugar, white vinegar, and red wine vinegar.  Add to warm grease, and whisk for about a minute, until thickened. Pour at once over spinach, add crumbled bacon, and toss to coat.  Garnish with chopped egg.
