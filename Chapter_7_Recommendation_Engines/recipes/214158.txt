1/4 cup butter
1 (10.5 ounce) package fruit flavored mini marshmallows
6 cups fruit-flavored breakfast cereal (such as Post Fruity PebblesÂ®)

Spray an 8x10-inch pan with cooking spray.
In a large saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Gently stir the marshmallows into the butter, and allow to fully melt.
