Description: 
I got this recipe from my ex-wife's mother. People absolutely beg her to make this for family dinners and potlucks. It's so simple, she'll often just give them the recipe. The only thing bad about this recipe is there are never any leftovers. You can use as much or as little cheese as you like, but we like to cover the entire thing with a healthy layer of cheese.
