Ingredients:
1 medium spaghetti squash
1 lb chicken breast
3/4 cup raw cashews
1/2 cup coconut milk (canned; I used "light")
1/2 cup chicken bone broth
2 Tbsp avocado oil or ghee
4 tsp chopped garlic
1/2 white onion, minced
3 cups broccoli florets, broken into pieces
salt & pepper (I used about 1 tsp each)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375ºF.
Slice your spaghetti squash in half lengthwise, and scoop out the seeds.
Place the open sides down on a foil-lined baking sheet.  Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until tender enough to scrape out with a fork.
While the squash bakes, grill the chicken breast with a little salt & pepper to season.  You can use a skillet or grill pan; just make sure it is lightly browned & cooked through.  Allow it to rest, then slice into bite-sized pieces.
Blend the cashews, coconut milk, and broth in a blender or food processor until smooth.
Set aside or refrigerate if you make it ahead of time.
Once the the squash is done baking, use a fork to scrape out your "pasta" and transfer it into a bowl.
In a large skillet or pot over medium heat, sauté the broccoli, garlic, & onion in avocado oil or ghee until slightly softened (2-3 minutes).
Add the sauce, and stir to combine.
Stir in the spaghetti squash, and season with salt & pepper.
Continue to cook until the sauce begins to thin (about 5 minutes).
Add the chicken to dish and stir.
Continue to cook until the sauce simmers and the chicken is warmed.
Serve hot!
