Ingredients:
1 cup steel-cut oats
2 cups water
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 large apple - peeled, cored, and diced
1/3 cup dried pitted dates, diced
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon chopped pecans, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place oats into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Add water, almond milk, apple, dates, rosemary, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt. Stir until ingredients are just combined. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 4 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Let sit for 5 minutes before releasing pressure using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Stir cooked oatmeal and top with chopped pecans.

Description: 
Get ready to shake up your old morning routine with an exciting new flavor of oatmeal. The woodsy taste of rosemary goes so well with the autumn flavors of cinnamon and apple in this steel-cut oatmeal done in minutes! Dried dates give it just enough sweetness, and I loved it with pecans on top.
