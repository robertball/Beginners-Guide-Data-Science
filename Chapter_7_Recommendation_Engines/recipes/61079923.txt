Ingredients:
2 kiwis, peeled and diced
2 Golden Delicious apples - peeled, cored and diced
1 (14 ounce) can of peaches in light syrup, diced
1 pound strawberries
10 (10 inch) flour tortillas
butter flavored cooking spray
1 1/2 cups cinnamon sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, thoroughly mix kiwis, Golden Delicious apples, strawberries, and diced peaches.  Drizzle 1/4 cup of the peach juices over fruit.  Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Coat one side of each flour tortilla with butter flavored cooking spray. Cut into wedges and arrange in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Sprinkle wedges with desired amount of cinnamon sugar. Spray again with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven 8 to 10 minutes. Repeat with any remaining tortilla wedges. Allow to cool approximately 15 minutes. Serve with chilled fruit mixture.

Description: 
Perfect for a healthy snack and can be made with any kind of fruit that is in season.  I used a can of peaches that I diced up and added to the fresh fruit eliminating the need to add any extra fruit preserves and sugar.Modified from: Annie's Fruit Salsa and Cinnamon Chips
