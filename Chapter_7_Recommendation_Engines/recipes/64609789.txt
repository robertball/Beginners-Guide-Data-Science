Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup cold butter, cubed
2 packages Neufchatel cheese, softened
1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp sugar, divided
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
3 medium tart apples, peeled and finely chopped
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
STREUSEL:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup quick-cooking oats
1/3 cup cold butter, cubed
1/3 cup hot caramel ice cream topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a small bowl, combine flour and brown sugar; cut in butter until crumbly. Press into a well-greased 13x9-in. baking pan. Bake 15-18 minutes or until lightly browned.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar and vanilla until smooth. Add eggs; beat on low speed just until combined. Spread over crust.
In a small bowl, toss apples with cinnamon, nutmeg and remaining sugar; spoon over cream cheese layer. In another bowl, mix flour, brown sugar and oats; cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over apple layer.
Bake 25-30 minutes or until filling is set. Drizzle with caramel topping; cool in pan on a wire rack 1 hour. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. Cut into bars.
