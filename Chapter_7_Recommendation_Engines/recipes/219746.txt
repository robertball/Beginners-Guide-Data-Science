Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup corn oil
1/2 cup light corn syrup (such as Karo®)
2 (12 ounce) packages crispy corn and rice cereal (such as Crispix®)
1 (1.9 ounce) container aji nori furikake (seasoned seaweed and sesame rice topping)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).
Melt the butter and sugar together in a small sauce pan over low heat. Remove from heat, then stir in the corn oil and corn syrup. Place the cereal on a large baking sheet. Pour the butter mixture over the cereal, then sprinkle the furikake while tossing the cereal to coat.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cereal is dry, stirring every 15 minutes to keep cereal from browning too quickly. Allow to cool, then store in an airtight container.
