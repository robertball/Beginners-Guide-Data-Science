Ingredients:
1 pound chicken (2 cans or left overs from rotisserie) shredded
6 cans beans (4 black, 2 kidney)
2 cans diced tomatoes OR tomato sauce
2 cans corn, drained
2 packages of chili seasoning (can use taco seasoning instead)
Sour Cream (optional)

Directions:
If you care for more of a chili, drain beans, if you care for more of a soup, do not drain beans.
Place all ingredients into a 6 quart slow-cooker and mix together thoroughly.  Cover and cook on low for 8 - 10 hours or on high for 4 - 6 hours.  Top with sour cream if desired.
