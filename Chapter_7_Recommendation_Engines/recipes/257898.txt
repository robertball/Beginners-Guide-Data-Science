Description: 
This gluten-free, dairy-free recipe is a great way to eat pasta and get your vegetables too. Change up some of the optional ingredients or add meat for other delicious variations.  Great way to use up vegetables before they go bad in your fridge. This recipe is very forgiving and hard to screw up. The amounts are just a guesstimate and do not have to be exact. I encourage you to play, eat, and enjoy!
