Ingredients:
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup + 1.5 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup butter
1 egg
1/4 cup cold water
4 pounds fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced
2 teaspoons vanilla
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup orange juice
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3.5 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon butter, melted

Directions:
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, and salt. Work in the butter with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and cold water. Sprinkle over flour mixture, and work with hands to form dough into a ball. Chill 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll out half of dough to 1/8 inch thickness. Place in a 9x13 inch baking dish, covering bottom and halfway up sides. Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
In a large saucepan, mix the peaches, vanilla, lemon and orange juice. Add 1/2 cup butter, and cook over medium-low heat until butter is melted.
In a mixing bowl, stir together sugars, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cornstarch; mix into peach mixture. Remove from heat, and pour into baked crust.
Roll remaining dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut into half-inch-wide strips. Weave strips into a lattice over peaches. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar, and drizzle with 1 tablespoon melted butter.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until top crust is golden brown.
