Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
5 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 cup cold butter (no substitutes)
1 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
2 eggs, beaten
FILLING:
1 1/2 cups chopped, peeled tart apples
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter (no substitutes), melted
GLAZE:
2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt and lemon peel; cut in butter until crumbly. Stir in the yeast mixture, milk and eggs by hand.  turn onto a floured surface; knead about 20 times (dough will be slightly sticky). Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
For filling, combine the apples, walnuts, sugar and cinnamon; set aside. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Roll each into an 18-in. x 15-in. rectangle; brush with butter. Sprinkle with filling to within 1/2 in of edges. Starting with a short side, fold one third of the side over filling; repeat with other side, making a 15-in. x 6-in. rectangle. Pinch seams to seal. Cut each into 15 slices. Twist each slice a few times; pinch ends together, forming a small circle. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over warm rolls.

Description: 
This dough should be refrigerated for at least 2 hours. I often prepare it the night before and bake the rolls fresh in the morning as a special breakfast treat.
