Ingredients:
Meatballs:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup cornmeal
2 tablespoons chopped onion
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or to taste
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
Stew:
6 large potatoes, cut into chunks
6 large carrots, cut into chunks
1 large onion, quartered
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans tomato juice
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix ground beef, milk, egg, cornmeal, onion, chili powder, and dry mustard together in a large bowl; divide and shape into meatballs.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
Spread 1/2 cup flour into a wide, shallow dish. Roll meatballs in flour to coat.
Cook coated meatballs in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes.
Remove meatballs from skillet with a slotted spoon to a casserole dish, reserving fat in the skillet. Arrange potato, carrots, and onion chunks atop the meatballs.
Stir 2 tablespoons flour into reserved fat until you have a smooth paste; add tomato juice and diced tomatoes. Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes; pour over the meatballs and vegetables. Place a cover on the casserole dish.
Bake in preheated oven until potatoes and carrots are completely tender, about 90 minutes.
