Ingredients:
1 - 1/2 cups butter
1/2 cup molasses
2 cups granulated sugar
2 eggs
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cinnamon
4 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoons ginger
1 teaspoon cloves
1/2 cup sanding sugar or granulated sugar

Directions:
Sift together dry ingredients and set aside.
Melt butter, and in a large mixing bowl, combine butter, 2 cups sugar, molasses and eggs.
Beat well until combined.
Add dry mixture to wet and mix until just combined.  Should be a soft sticky dough.
Refrigerate dough for at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees, and line baking sheet with parchment paper.
Scoop dough into small balls with a #60 disher (slightly under a tablespoon), leveled off on top creating domes with a flat bottom.
Roll domes of dough in remaining sugar or sanding sugar, and place at least 2 inches apart on parchment-lined baking sheets.
Bake for 8-10 minutes or until cookies are brown and firm.
Cool on pan for 2 minutes before removing parchment to cooling rack until completely cool.
Run an offset spatula under cookies to release from paper, and serve or store in an airtight container.

Description: 
This recipe is from my childhood neighbor, Mrs. Rae.  She was always baking something - bread almost every day.  And this was her most popular recipe.  When fresh, these cookies are crispy around the edges, slightly chewy in the middle, and have just the perfect blend of spice. They taste like Fall and remind me of great neighbors.  Note that if stored, these lose their crisp edges.  All the more reason to devour some right away!
