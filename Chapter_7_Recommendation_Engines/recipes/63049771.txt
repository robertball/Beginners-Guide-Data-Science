Ingredients:
2 medium yellow onions, quartered
16 oz jar roasted red peppers, drained
15 oz can pumpkin puree
6 oz can tomato paste
2 lbs ground bison
1 lb boneless pork ribs, roughly chopped
2 cups chicken broth
1 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1/4 tsp chili powder
salt and ground black pepper

Directions:
In a blender or food processor, combine the roasted red peppers, pumpkin and tomato paste. Puree until smooth. Set aside.
Heat a large stockpot over medium-high. Add the bison and pork and cook until starting to brown, about 7-8 minutes.
Add the pumpkin mixture and the broth, then stir well. Add the garlic powder, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, smoked paprika and chili powder.
Bring to a simmer, then partially cover the pot to prevent splattering but allow steam to escape. Simmer for 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
