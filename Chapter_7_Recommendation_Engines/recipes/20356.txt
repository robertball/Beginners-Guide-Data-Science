Ingredients:
1 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons steak sauce
1 teaspoon garlic salt
2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
1 teaspoon onion powder
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons lemon juice
4 drops hot pepper sauce, or to taste
4 dashes Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons whiskey

Directions:
In a saucepan combine ketchup, steak sauce, garlic salt, liquid smoke, onion powder and brown sugar. Add lemon juice, pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce and whiskey. Warm over medium low heat until simmering.
Refrigerate for at least one hour before using, to let flavors mingle. Brush on meat during the last few minutes of grilling or baking.
Not recommended for marinating unless you omit the lemon juice, as the acid makes the chicken grainy.

Description: 
Sweet, spicy, and flavored with Jack Daniels whiskey. Great on chicken and pork chops. I came up with this recipe after experimenting in my kitchen. Ketchup may be replaced by your favorite bottled barbeque sauce. You may have to adjust the ingredients to suit your taste. The key is adding just enough whiskey to flavor, not overpower, the dish.
