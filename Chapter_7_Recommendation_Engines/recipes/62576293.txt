Ingredients:
4 tbsps. Butter
3 one ounce squares semisweet chocolate*
1/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 egg
5 tbsps. flour
2 ounces milk chocolate
Chopped pistachio nuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter 24 mini tassie pans (or mini muffin wrappers if you have no tassie pans.) Melt together butter, semisweet chocolate and sugar. Stir until smooth. (I do this in the microwave.) Watch carefully! Beat in vanilla, then the egg. Fold in flour til blended. Spoon by teaspoon into the cups. Tins should be half full. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until the center springs back when touched. Cool in pans for 10 min. Remove and cool completely on racks. To frost: Melt milk chocolate and stir til smooth. Spread on each brownie and then top with chopped pistachios.
Makes 2 dozen tassie sized brownies.
*Tip: If you do not have semisweet chocolate squares, you can substitute 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder + 1 tablespoon of butter per ounce of semisweet chocolate.
