Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can butter beans, rinsed and drained
1 1/4 pounds extra-lean ground turkey breast
1 egg white, beaten
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Mash butter beans in a large mixing bowl. Add ground turkey, egg white, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper; stir until evenly mixed. Fold bread crumbs into mixture evenly.
Form the mixture into 1-inch meatballs.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat.
Cook meatballs in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover the skillet and continue cooking until meatballs are no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
