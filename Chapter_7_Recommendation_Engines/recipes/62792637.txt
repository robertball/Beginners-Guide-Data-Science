3 cups romaine lettuce chopped
1 cup shredded red cabbage
1/2 cup shredded carrots
1 zuchinni diced
1 large yellow or red bell pepper chopped
1 can water chestnuts, drained and sliced into strips
4 green onions, whites and greens thinly sliced
1- 6 oz can mandarin oranges, drained
rotisserie chicken- remove breast and chop, save leg/thigh for another use
1 bunch cilantro coarsely chopped if desired
slivered almonds
for dressing:
1/2 cup oil - canola or peanut is fine
1 T sesame oil
1/2 cup soy (reduced sodium or regular)
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar (plain, not seasoned)
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 T grated ginger
1/4 cup sugar more or less to taste
1 T sesame seed

Directions:
Bring 3 quarts of unsalted water to boil. Break rice noodles into 5-6 inch piece if desired and drop into water. Boil 3 mins, remove from heat. Drain and rinse with cold water. Place in the bottom of large deep serving dish, and set aside. Prep all vegetables. Make salad dressing by combining all ingredients in a mason jar with a lid and shake to mix. May also use a stick blender to make an emulsion if desired. Drizzle about 1/4 c of the dressing over the rice noodles to flavor, toss to coat. Layer vegetables in order, then the chicken and mandarin oranges. Garnish with cilantro and almonds if desired. Refrigerate salad and dressing to chill. Apply dressing to individual servings to prevent veggies from wilting.
