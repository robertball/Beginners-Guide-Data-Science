Ingredients:
2 lbs rigatoni pasta
18 beaten eggs
1 1/3 lbs tuma (a mild creamy sheeps milk cheese) sliced
3 cups pecorino cheese  grated
1 cup hot chicken broth
pinch of saffron
8 slices day old Italian bread
1/4 cup minced parsley
lard to grease casserole dish
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Boil the rigatoni in salted water, drain once the pasta is slightly al dente, about 10 minutes.  While the pasta is cooking take a deep casserole dish large enough to hold everything and grease it with the lard.  Lay four of the bread slices over the bottom.  Beat the eggs and combine them with the parsley  and grated pecorino cheese.  Transfer the drained 1/3 pasta to the casserole dish top with 1/3 of the sliced cheese and 1/3 of the egg mixture.  Continue to make layers once everything is used up cover with the remaining 4 slices of bread.  Pour the  saffron broth over all.  Bake at 350 F until all the liquid is absorbed about 1-2 hours.  Remove from the oven when it is firm but not dried out.  Slice it and serve it warm, at room temperature or cold.  It will keep well refrigerated for several days.
