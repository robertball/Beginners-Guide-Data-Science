Ingredients:
3 cups sliced fresh mushrooms, or more to taste
4 sprigs fresh thyme
1/2 serrano pepper, thinly sliced, or more to taste
Brine:
1 cup white wine
1/2 cup water
2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
20 whole black peppercorns
12 coriander seeds
3 (1-inch) strips lemon zest, or more to taste

Directions:
Fill four sterilized 8-ounce jars 3/4 of the way with mushrooms. Place 1 thyme sprig and some serrano pepper slices on top.
Combine white wine, water, kosher salt, sugar, garlic, peppercorns, coriander seeds, and lemon zest in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and pour over mushroom mixture in each jar.
Tightly seal each jar and transfer to the refrigerator. Chill until flavors meld, 1 to 2 days.

Description: 
These are great appetizers and snacks. Use on an antipasto tray, on bruschetta with goat cheese, or just out of the jar. Go for a variety of different mushrooms here. They keep for about 2 months in the refrigerator.
