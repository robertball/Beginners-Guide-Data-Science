Ingredients:
1 pound asparagus spears, ends trimmed
1/3 cup margarine or butter
3 tablespoons sesame seed
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the asparagus in a large pot filled with water 1 inch deep. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, but still bright green. This will take about 5 minutes, or longer if your asparagus spears are thick. Drain and place on a serving dish.
Meanwhile, melt the margarine or butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the sesame seeds, and cook, stirring frequently, until they are golden brown and toasted, about 2 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and parsley; season to taste with salt and pepper.
To serve, pour sauce over the cooked asparagus.
