Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 (16 ounce) jar Ragu® Cheesy! Roasted Garlic Parmesan Sauce
1 small tomato, chopped
8 ounces rotelle, penne or gemelli pasta, cooked and drained

Directions:
Heat olive oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat and lightly brown chicken. Stir in Roasted Garlic Parmesan Sauce and tomato.
Simmer covered, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes or until chicken is thoroughly cooked. Spoon chicken and sauce over hot rotelle and garnish, if desired, with crisp-cooked crumbled bacon and chopped fresh basil.

Submitter: 
Ragu®
Description: 
You can cut the chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces before cooking for easier eating. Just remember they'll cook a little quicker than the whole chicken breasts.
