Ingredients:
1/2 cup squash seeds
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried sage

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
Separate squash seeds from squash flesh, rinse through a fine-mesh strainer, and spread onto a paper towel to dry.
Combine squash seeds, olive oil, rosemary, salt, and sage in a bowl and mix well. Spread seasoned seeds in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, flipping every 10 minutes, until seeds are crunchy, 30 to 40 minutes.
