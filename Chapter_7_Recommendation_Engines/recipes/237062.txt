Description: 
Not only is this Syracuse salt potatoes recipe one of the most delicious ways to cook baby spuds, it's also one of the most interesting. I generally don't like when people watch me cook their food, you know, in case anything gets dropped (#5secondrule), but these are kind of fun to do in front of guests; just to see that look of shock in their eyes, as you dump in all that salt.
