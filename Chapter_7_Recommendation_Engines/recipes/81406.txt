Ingredients:
1 submarine sandwich roll, split
1 slice American cheese
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
3 egg, beaten
1 pinch salt
1 clove garlic, minced
12 slices pepperoni sausage

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Spread 1 tablespoon of the butter or margarine onto the cut sides of the submarine sandwich roll. Place the roll buttered surfaces down into the heated skillet. Cook until lightly toasted. Remove the roll from the skillet, and place the cheese onto one of the toasted surfaces. Set aside.
Melt the remaining butter in the hot skillet. Add garlic and pepperoni; cook and stir until soft.  Stir in the beaten eggs; cook and stir with the pepperoni until firm and scrambled. Spread the egg mixture over the cheese on the roll, and top with the other half of the roll to serve.
