Ingredients:
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup bulgur
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 onion, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
6 sun-dried tomatoes, cut into strips
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring chicken broth and bulgur to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until bulgur is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; saute onion and celery until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir onion mixture, artichoke hearts, and sun-dried tomatoes into bulgur; season with salt and pepper.
