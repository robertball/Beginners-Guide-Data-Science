https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C).
Stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. In a small bowl or 2-cup measuring cup, beat egg with a fork.
Stir in milk and oil. Pour all at once into the well in the flour mixture.
Mix quickly and lightly with a fork until moistened, but do not beat. The batter will be lumpy. DO NOT OVERMIX. This will create tough/heavy muffins. Pour the batter into paper lined muffin pan cups.
Variations: Blueberry Muffins: Add 1 cup fresh blueberries.
Raisin Muffins: Add 1 cup finely chopped raisins.
Date Muffins: Add 1 cup finely chopped dates.
Cheese Muffins: Fold in 1 cup grated sharp yellow cheese.
Bacon Muffins: Fold 1/4 cup crisp cooked bacon, broken into bits.
Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden.

Description: 
Great basic recipe. I used them for my mothers birthday breakfast and added various berries to batter. Very good as long as you don't overmix. Adding vanilla and maybe numeg and/or cinnamon also added to flavor. Will definitely try these again.
