Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups rice flour
1 1/2 cups tapioca starch
2 Tbsp sugar
1 Tbsp xanthan
1 Tbsp dry yeast
1 tsp salt
1 large egg
2 Tbsp oil
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
1 1/3 cup very warm almond milk

Directions:
Combine rice flour, tapioca starch, sugar, yeast, xanthan, and salt in a heavy-duty mixer.
Mix in egg, oil, vinegar and milk. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes to increase air volume in the dough.
Scoop dough into an oil sprayed 8x4 inch loaf pan.
Let rise on top of preheating oven for 30 minutes or until dough doubles in size.
Brush the top of the loaf with 1 Tbsp melted butter or vegetable oil (Don't skip this step with this recipe or the crust will be dry and chalky).
Bake in preheated 350 F oven for 50-60 minutes.
If not eaten within 24 hours, bread may be sliced and frozen. Remove from freezer as needed. Defrost frozen bread (in microwave) before toasting.
