Directions:
Melt butter in a stock pot over medium-low heat. Add potatoes and carrots. Cook until beginning to soften, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.
Stir in chopped dill pickles, flour, pickle juice, garlic, Worcestershire, onion salt, sugar, dill, curry powder, and white pepper until well combined.
Add chicken broth, warm milk, and bay leaves. Simmer until vegetables are soft and soup has cooked down, about 1 hour. Season with salt.

Description: 
After discovering that this dill pickle soup was totally a thing at the Polish Village Cafe in Hamtramck, my wife and her sister, who are obsessed with their Polish heritage, decided to make this a part of our repertoire. It sounds crazy but it works, and most people we introduce to it, love it.
