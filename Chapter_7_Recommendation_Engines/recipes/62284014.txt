Directions:
Season pork chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and then dredge in 1/2 cup flour.  In a skillet over medium heat, lightly brown chops in a small  amount of oil.
Place chops in slow cooker, and top with onion slices.  Add both chicken and beef broth with the mushroom soup.   Cover, and cook on Low 6 hours.
Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
After the chops have cooked, transfer chops to the oven to keep warm. Be careful, the chops are so tender they will fall apart. In a small bowl, blend 2 tablespoons flour with the sour cream; mix into meat juices.  Turn slow cooker to High for 15 to 30 minutes, or until sauce is slightly thickened.  Serve sauce over pork chops.
