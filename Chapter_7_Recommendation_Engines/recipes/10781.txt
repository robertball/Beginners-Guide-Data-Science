Ingredients:
2 cups chow mein noodles
2 cups crushed cornflakes cereal
16 (1 ounce) squares white chocolate
1/3 cup chocolate covered raisins

Directions:
Place a sheet of waxed paper or foil on a large cookie sheet.  In a large bowl, combine the noodles and the cereal and set aside.
Melt white chocolate or vanilla candy-coating in a double boiler over hot water (or in the microwave).  Remove from heat and pour over noodles and cereal.
To form nests, mound 2 tablespoons of the mixture onto the prepared cookie sheet. With the back of a teaspoon, make an indentation in the center of each mound.  Press 3 or 4 candies in the center of each "nest".  Allow to set at room temperature until firm.

Submitter: 
Rosina
Description: 
Fun treats for Springtime.  You can use vanilla flavored candy coating instead of white chocolate, if you like.
