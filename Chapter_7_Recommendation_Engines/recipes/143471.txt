Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package small seashell pasta
1 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
2/3 cup white sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 large Vidalia or sweet onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1/4 cup grated carrots
1 pound diced cooked ham

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente,  8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta, but do not rinse. Let stand 5 minutes.
To make the dressing, combine the mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, mustard, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Set aside.
Combine the onion, celery, bell pepper, carrots, and ham in a large bowl. Stir in the dressing. Add the pasta and toss gently to blend all ingredients. Chill at least 4 hours before serving.

Description: 
I was messin' around in my kitchen trying to put a twist on my traditional macaroni salad recipe. I tried several different dishes before I came up with this one. Now my friends and family can't get enough of it! I recommend making it a day ahead and chilling it overnight to really develop the flavors.
