Ingredients:
1 cinnamon stick
4 dried bay leaves
6 dried cayenne peppers
1 Tbsp. whole multi coloured peppercorns
1 Tbsp. whole yellow mustard seeds
1/2 Tbsp whole brown mustard seeds
1 tsp. whole caraway seeds
2 tsp. whole allspice berries
1 tsp. whole cloves
1 Tbsp whole coriander seeds
1/2 tsp. ground mace
1 Tbsp. dill seeds
1 Tsp celery seed
1 Tbsp cardomon pods

Directions:
Put all the ingredients except the mace in a mortar and give the ingredients a few light jabs with the pestle.  If you don't have a mortar and pestle put all the ingredients in a plastic resealable baggy and lightly knock it a few time with a mallet or rolling pin.
Heat in the microwave at 600w for 10 seconds or slightly warm in a skillet over low heat.
Once cooled, add the mace.
Store in a sealable container and shake lightly.
Always shake well before using.  Add the desired amount for your recipe loose or in a piece of cheesecloth knotted closed.
Keeps for one year in a air-tight container kept in a cupboard at room temperature.

Description: 
This is unofficial because I've never used commercial pickling spices.  This recipe follows some guidelines from recipes found in cookbooks or looking up ingredients for the commercially produced brands. It uses less cinnamon and more savoury flavours than industrial brands.  The method slightly opens the seeds and then is toasted to release flavour. I use it for pickled eggs and veggies as well as on meats.  I even use this to steam tofu and veggies in the steamer.
