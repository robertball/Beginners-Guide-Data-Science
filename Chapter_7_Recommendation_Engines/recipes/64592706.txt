3/4 cup milk
2 tbsp. butter
1/2 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Mix sugar, cornstarch and salt in med. saucepan.
Stir in milk until smooth.
Bring to a boil over med. heat, whisking constantly (the mixture may appear to separate, but keep at it, it will come together when it comes to a boil and thickens).

Serve warm.
Makes about 1 cup.
Rum & Raisin version:
Add 1/4 tsp. rum extract and 1/4 cup raisins to warm sauce.

This tastes like butter tarts (without the raisins! - although there's a rum & raisin version listed below) - served over ice cream, yum!
