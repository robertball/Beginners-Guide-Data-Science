Grilled Grouper with Mango Butter Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
4 grouper filets (6-8 oz each)
1 shallot, minced
1/2 stick butter (2 oz)
1 ripe mango, cubed
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup white wine, Chardonnay or sweeter
1 tsp honey
1/2 - 1 tsp red pepper flakes (to taste)
ground sea salt and white pepper

Directions:
Mince the shallot. Saute in pan with butter on med heat till the shallot softens.
Add the mango, honey, olive oil, wine, red pepper, and salt to taste.  Stir well. Simmer on low heat for about 10 min., stirring occasionally.
Brush the grouper with olive oil on each side, adding salt and white pepper to taste.  Grill about 4 minutes per side over med-high heat. (It's a meaty fish - it can take it.)  Grouper doesn't flake quite like other fish, but if it's opaque, white, and separates easily under a fork, it's ready.
Plate the fish, and top with sauce.
A bed of couscous is nice with this, and so is grilled asparagus. (Wash, snap off the bottoms, put on foil, sprinkle with olive oil, salt, and pepper, fold the foil into an envelope, and put on top rack of grill (or on main but off-heat) for about ten minutes.)

Description: 
Other versions of this recipe I've found online were too sweet and too fatty for me.  Here's a stripped-down, super-easy, (slightly) spiced-up version that's quick enough to make on a work night.
