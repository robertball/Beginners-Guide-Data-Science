Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
salt
freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup sugar

1 head Bibb lettuce, rinsed and torn
1 1/2 pints fresh strawberries, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
Coat chicken with 1 tablespoon of oil, sprinkle with salt, pepper and 1 teaspoon of  sugar.
Place chicken on hot grill; cook, turning once, until grill marks form and chicken is cooked through, 10 to 14 minutes. Remove from grill; when cool enough to handle cut into bite-size pieces.
In a blender, combine the remaining oil and sugar, red wine vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper. Process until smooth.
Place lettuce, strawberries, pecans, onion and chicken in a large bowl. Add  dressing; toss to coat and serve.
