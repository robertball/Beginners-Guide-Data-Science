Ingredients:
1 cup tomatoes, seeded and diced
1 medium red onion, diced, divided
1 cup diced fresh pineapple
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon white sugar
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch strips
1  lime, juiced
8 (7 inch) tortillas, or more as needed
1 cup shredded lettuce
8 dashes Sriracha sauce, or more to taste (optional)

Directions:
Combine tomatoes, 1/2 cup diced red onion, pineapple, and cilantro in a medium bowl. Add 1 tablespoon lime juice, salt, and sugar; toss to combine. Cover salsa with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
Place the remaining red onion in the bowl of a small food processor. Add juice of one lime and process until finely ground, about 3 minutes.
Place chicken strips into a shallow dish. Slather onion mixture over the chicken, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill to high heat, about 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil the grill.
Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove to a plate.
Lightly brown the tortillas on the grill for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Drain the salsa.
Thinly slice the chicken, against the grain. Lay tortillas out on plates, top with lettuce, chicken, pineapple salsa, and Sriracha sauce.
