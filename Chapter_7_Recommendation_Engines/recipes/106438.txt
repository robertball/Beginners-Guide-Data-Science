Ingredients:
3/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1 cup butter, softened
2 teaspoons molasses
2 large eggs
1/3 cup apple juice concentrate, thawed
2 teaspoons grated fresh lemon peel
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup peeled, shredded fresh apple
2/3 cup old-fashioned oats
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly spray miniature muffin pans with vegetable cooking spray; set aside.
Beat SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, butter, and molasses at medium speed of an electric mixer 1 minute or until blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating until blended after each addition; add apple juice concentrate and lemon peel, beating until blended.
Combine flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, soda, and salt; add to SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener mixture, beating on low speed just until blended. Stir in apple, oats, and raisins.
Spoon batter into prepared pans; filling three-fourths full. Bake until edges are lightly browned, 12 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool.
