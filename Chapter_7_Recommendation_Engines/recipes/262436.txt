Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 small white onion, sliced
1 large clove garlic, crushed and chopped
1/2 pound lean ground pork
6 tablespoons fish sauce, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 long green chile - seeded, deveined, and chopped, or more to taste
1 1/3 cups winged beans, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
1 cup cream of coconut

Directions:
Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic until onion begins to turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Add pork; saute until starting to whiten, 3 to 5 minutes. Add fish sauce and black pepper. Continue cooking and stirring until pork begins to brown, about 2 minutes more.
Stir green chile into the pork mixture; saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add winged beans; cook and stir until bright green, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in coconut cream; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low; let simmer until coconut cream thickens, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
The transliteration of gising-gising from Filipino to English is wake up-wake up. Ideally, this vegetable dish should be spicy enough to wake you up if you're feeling sluggish. You can use other kinds of vegetables like string beans or river spinach (kangkong), but I like to use winged beans (sigarilyas) because of their unusual shape. Best served with steamed white rice and tinapa (smoked fish).
