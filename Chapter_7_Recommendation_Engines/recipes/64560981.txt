Ingredients:
3/4 cup pecans
3/4 cup cashews
3/4 cup blanched almonds
3/4 cup blanched peanuts
1/8 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp peanut oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees and put parchment paper on  baking sheet.  Distribute nuts over baking sheet and bake for 10 to 12 minutes turning nuts halfway through and being very careful not to burn.   Put baked and cooled nuts into food processer and blend for 4 to 5 minutes;it may take awhile to make nuts form into butter from a coarse blend.  Drizzle in oil and blend it in half way through the blending process;use a rubber spatula to push down nut mixture at the same time.  Should a crunchier version of the nuttier nut butter be required,  chop coarsely an additional two teaspoons of each nut and stir in after food processing step is finished.  Store in refridgerator.

Description: 
I made my butter out of 4 variety of nuts as I was getting tired of peanut butter.  Make sure you get your nuts when bulk bins are on sale as this can get expensive.
