Ingredients:
1 cup bulgur
2 cups vegetable broth or stock
1 (18.75 ounce) can adzuki beans
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce
1 egg, beaten
1 cup stale whole wheat bread cubes
1 cup skim milk
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 (12-inch) skewers

Directions:
Combine the bulgur wheat and vegetable stock in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then simmer for about 10 minutes, or until liquid has been absorbed. Set aside to cool.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the adzuki beans, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, cilantro, hot sauce, and the egg. Mash with a potato masher or sturdy whisk until fairly smooth. Soak the bread in milk, then squeeze out the excess; add to the bean mixture along with the bulgur. Mix using your hands until everything is well blended. Cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour, or until firm.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Wet your hands, and form the kofta into 32 oval shapes. Press onto skewers four at a time. Brush with remaining olive oil. Place on a baking sheet or broiling pan.
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Turn over, brush again with oil, and continue baking for 5 to 10 minutes, until crispy.

Description: 
This makes a spicy and healthy version of one of my favorite dishes. Serve with tabbouleh, pita bread and olives for a wonderful feast. Black beans or chickpeas can be substituted for adzuki beans. Adjust hot sauce and garlic to your tastes.
