Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, diced
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 pounds ground beef
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup milk
1 (32 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Place bacon, onion, bell peppers, salt, and pepper into a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until bacon is evenly browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. Add ground beef and cook until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix in mushroom soup and milk. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish.
Top casserole with Tater Tots(R), followed by Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until Tater Tots(R) are golden and heated though and cheese is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes.
