Ingredients:
2 slices bacon
4 cups hot water
1 pound fresh spinach
1 cup natural peanut butter (such as Adams®)
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Tabasco®) (optional)
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Place bacon slices in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel and crumble into pieces.
Place water, spinach, peanut butter, seasoned salt, and hot sauce in a blender. Cover and hold lid down; blend on highest setting until soup is smooth and warmed through. Let sit until bubbles float to the top, about 5 minutes.
Strain soup into bowls through a nut milk bag or cheesecloth to avoid getting bubbles in the bowls. Stir in bacon pieces and grated Parmesan cheese; garnish bowls with additional Parmesan cheese.
