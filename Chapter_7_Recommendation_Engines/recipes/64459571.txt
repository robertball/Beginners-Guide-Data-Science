Ingredients:
1 tbs butter
1/2 cup flour
2 cups milk
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
14 oz fresh spinach leaves
2/3 cup ricotta cheese
1 egg yolk
salt & pepper
nutmeg

Directions:
First make cheese sauce. Melt butter in a pan, stir in 1 1/2 tbs flour, and cook 1 minute. Off the heat stir in milk. Bring to a boil, stirring, until thickened. Simmer 1-2 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup Parmesan. Keep warm. Cook spinach in a covered pan, with just the water clinging to the leaves after washing, over low heat for 1 minute. Drain well and chop. Beat into ricotta with remaining flour, egg yolk, 1/2 Parmesan cheese, seasoning and nutmeg. Use floured hands to carefully shape heaped teaspoon mixture into rounds. Cook the gnocchi in batches. Drop into a large pan of simmering water and cook until they float on the surface, 3-4 minutes.Lift out, drain, and place in a lightly greased cooking dish. Spoon over the sauce and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese. Place under a hot broiler until golden. Serve immediately.
