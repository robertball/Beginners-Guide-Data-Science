Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1 chicken boullion cube, Knorr preferred
1 cup sliced carrots
1 cup frozen green peas
1/2 cup minced celery
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup chopped white onion
~or~ 1/2 Cup pearl onions
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 to 1 teaspoon Paul Prudhomme Poultry Magic
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
2 cups chicken broth (reserved liquid from above)
1 cup milk
2 (9 inch)  unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
In a saucepan, combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery. Add water and boullion cube to cover and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain and reserve chicken/veggie broth, and set aside chicken mixture.
In the saucepan over medium heat, cook onions in butter until soft and translucent. Stir in flour, Poutry Magic, thyme, garlic and celery seed. Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
Place the chicken mixture in bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
