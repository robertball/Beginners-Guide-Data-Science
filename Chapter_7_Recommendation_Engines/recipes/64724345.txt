Ingredients:
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup honey
1 tbsp unsalted butter
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla extract
3/4 tsp baking soda

Directions:
1. Butter a large cookie sheet and set aside.
2. In a large microwave safe glass bowl, mix together sugar and honey. Mixture will be very thick. Place in the microwave and cook 1 minute on high. Stir, then cook another 1 minute. Stir mixture again, and cook an additional 30 seconds-2 minutes, or until mixture boils and sugar is dissolved.
3. Stir in walnuts, and microwave another 3-4 minutes. Stir in butter, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Microwave an additional 1-2 minutes, until mixture is caramel in color.
4. Carefully remove bowl from microwave, and quickly stir in baking soda until incorporated, then immediately pour mixture onto buttered cookie sheet. Allow to cool 15 minutes, or until brittle is set. Break into pieces and store in an airtight container.
Note: The cook times for this recipe are based on a 1200 Watt microwave. You may have to add or subtract time depending on the wattage of your microwave.

Description: 
After several failed attempts at making homemade brittle, I finally got some sense and called my Grandma Myrna! She gave me this recipe for brittle made in the microwave, and I had instant success! The best tips she gave were to work quickly, have everything pre-measured out, and for goodness' sake, don't burn yourself!
