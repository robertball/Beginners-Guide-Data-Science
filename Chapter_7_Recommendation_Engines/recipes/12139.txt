Ingredients:
2/3 cup white sugar
3 3/4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
6 egg yolks
2 1/2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 (12 fluid ounce) cans evaporated milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 1/2 tablespoons butter
1 (9 inch) deep dish pie crust, baked and cooled
3 egg whites
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Whisk together 2/3 cup sugar, flour, cocoa, and egg yolks in a saucepan.  Stir in milk.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until thick. Start with a whisk and then use a spoon to stir the custard as it cooks.
Remove pan from heat, and add vanilla extract and butter. Mix well; pour filling into a baked, deep dish pie crust. Let cool completely.
In a mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until peaks form. Slowly add 1/2 cup sugar, and beat again until stiff peaks form. Spread over cooled pie.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes, or until meringue browns.  Let pie cool several hours before serving.
