Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 pounds bison chuck roast, cut into 3/4-inch cubes, or bison stew meat
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 (14.5 ounce) cans beef broth
2 cups cranberry juice or cranberry juice cocktail
1 1/2 cups fresh cranberries, rinsed
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups frozen cut green beans
1 1/2 cups chopped carrots
1 cup sliced celery

Directions:
Reserve 1/4 cup of the flour. Place the remaining flour in a resealable plastic bag. Add bison chuck roast cubes, a few at a time, shaking to coat. Heat oil over medium-high in a 5- to 6- quart Dutch oven or pot. Brown bison cubes in batches on all sides in hot oil. Drain off fat. Stir in 3 cups of the broth, the cranberry juice, cranberries, onion, thyme, marjoram, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 1 hour.
Stir in green beans, carrots, and celery. Simmer, covered, for 1 more hour or until bison and vegetables are tender. Stir the remaining 1/2 cup broth and the reserved 1/4 cup flour in a small bowl until smooth; stir into stew. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly; cook and stir 1 more minute.
