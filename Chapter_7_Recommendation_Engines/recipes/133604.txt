Ingredients:
2 tablespoons margarine or butter
¼ cup chopped onion
⅓ cup chopped celery
¼ cup chopped green pepper
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 ½ cups chicken broth
⅔ cup long grain white rice
1 teaspoon dried basil
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon black pepper
¼ teaspoon hot sauce
1  bay leaf
⅔ cup diced cooked chicken breast
⅔ cup cooked crumbled Italian sausage
⅔ cup peeled cooked shrimp

Directions:
Melt margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion, celery, and green pepper; cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Pour in diced tomatoes, chicken broth, and rice; season with basil, garlic, pepper, hot sauce, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then turn heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is done, about 20 minutes.
Once the rice has cooked, stir in chicken, sausage, and shrimp. Simmer for a few minutes until heated through. Remove bay leaf before serving.

Description: 
My family loves a lot of flavor and spice in our food and jambalaya delivers. This is my version of a New Orleans jambalaya that's got a nice kick to it but not overly hot for those whose tongues can't handle it.
