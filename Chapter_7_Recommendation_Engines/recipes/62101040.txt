Ingredients:
1 Acorn Squash
1 Yellow Onion
1 Cup Rice (preferably Arborio)
2-3 Cans Vegetable Broth
1/4 Cup Butter
Olive Oil
1/2 Cup White Wine
1/4 Cup Parmesan Cheese
1/4 Cup Fontina Cheese
To Taste:
Salt
Pepper
Italian Seasoning
Rosemary
Garlic Powder

Directions:
For the Squash:
Cut in half, remove seeds.  Place cut side down on microwaveable plate and microwave for 15 minutes (until super soft).  When cool enough to touch, remove skin and mash in a bowl with a little olive oil, rosemary, garlic powder, and salt and pepper.
For the Risotto:
Warm vegetable broth and keep simmering.
Melt half the butter and saute onion over medium heat until soft.  Add rice and stir.  Add white wine and stir until liquid is dissolved.  Add vegetable broth one or two ladles-ful at a time and stir until broth is gone each time.  Continue this until rice is soft and creamy.  During this process, add salt, pepper and italian seasoning to taste.
When rice is soft, add cheeses and stir until melted.  Add remaining butter and mashed squash and stir until the butter is melted and the squash is heated through.  Serve.
