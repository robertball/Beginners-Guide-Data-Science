Ingredients:
2 fully ripe avacados
1 cup cooked shredded chicken
1 cup cooked chopped chirizo
1 cup cooked ground beef, seasoned with taco seasoning
1 cup diced tomatoes
1 cup diced onions
1 cup chopped cilantro
1 cup diced jalapeno peppers, optional
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 package 8 inch flour tortillas
1 jar favorite salsa

Directions:
Seed and peel two fully ripe avacados. Place in a large bowl, mash, sprinkle with lemon juice or lime juice and add a pinch of salt. Set aside.
Warm tortillas according to package directions. Spread the avacado mixture on the tortillas first. In this order, spoon the remaining ingredients on the tortillas: ground beef, chirizo, shredded chicken, diced tomatoes, diced onions, chopped cilantro, optional diced jalapeno peppers and shredded cheese. Top with favorite salsa.
Please make sure not to over-load the tortillas with the ingredients or they will break open when handling. Fold ends and sides over filling and be prepared for the delicious taste of the conquistador, as it will captivate your taste.

I enjoy Mexican, Tex-Mex, Cali-Mex and Filipino-Spanish cuisine. I came up with the original title of this recipe and I came up with the recipe myself. One bite and you will be conquered by the conquistadores. Mexican beer with lime is optional.
