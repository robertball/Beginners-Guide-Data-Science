Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups fresh blueberries
1/2 cup organic cane sugar
1 tbsp cornstarch
2 tsp fresh lemon juice
3/4 cup all purpose flour
1/3 cup yellow cornmeal
2 tbsp + 2 tsp organic cane sugar, divided
2 tsp grated lemon peel
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp salt
1/4 cup cold butter
1/3 cup buttermilk
Sweetened whipped cream (optional)
Additional grated lemon peel (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
In a 3 quart saucepan, heat blueberries, 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice over medium heat.  Cook 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved.  Divide mixture among 4 6oz individual baking dishes.  Place dishes on a cookie sheet.
In a medium bowl, mix flour, cornmeal, 2 tbsp sugar, 2 tsp lemon peel, baking powder, baking soda, and salt with a whisk.  Cut in the butter using a pastry blender until mixture resembles course crumbs.  Gently stir in buttermilk.  Knead with hands until dough forms.  Shape into 4 biscuits and place on the blueberry mixtures.  Spring with 1/2 tsp sugar each.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until the filling is bubbly and the topping is golden brown.  Cool 10 minutes.  Serve warm, garnished with whipped cream and additional lemon peel.
