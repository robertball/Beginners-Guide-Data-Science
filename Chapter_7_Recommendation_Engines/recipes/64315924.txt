Ingredients:
1 8 oz package cream cheese, softened
1 cup grated parmesan cheese, divided
2 cans crescent dinner rolls or seamless dough sheets
1 cup chopped red peppers
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Beat cream cheese and 3/4 cup parmesan with mixer until well blended.
Separate rolls into 8 rectangles, pressing perforations together to seal, or cut sheets into 8 rectangles. Spread each with 3 tbsp cream cheese mixture. Top with peppers and parsley.
Fold 1 long side of each rectangle over filling to center; fold again to enclose filling.
Cut each into 4 squares.
Place, seam sides down, on baking sheet. Sprinkle with remaining parmesan.
Bake 13-15 minutes, or until golden brown.
