https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 c. GF flour mix
2 c. sugar
1/3 c. cocoa
2 1/4 t. baking powder
1 1/2 t. baking soda
1 1/2 t. xanthan gum
1 1/2 t. vanilla
1 1/2 c. hot water
1 1/2 c. mayonnaise (can be egg-free)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Spray 2 cake pans, or 1 bundt pan, or 2 mini-bundt pans or 1 13x9 inch pan or 24 cupcake tins with non-stick spray.
Blend dry ingredients.
Add mayonnaise and mix well.
Gradually add hot water and vanilla and mix until smooth (it will be slightly gluey - that's normal for GF).
Spoon into prepared baking pan(s) and bake until a toothpick comes out clean and cake has pulled slightly from the sides of the pan (start checking at 30 minutes for most pans except cupcake tins. For cupcake tins, start at 15 minutes.)
Cool for a few minutes in pan(s), then remove from pan(s)[except for the 13x9 inch pan] and cool completely on wire racks.
Frost with your favorite chocolate frosting.

Description: 
This chocolate cake is an adaptation of a cake I ate as a child. It's easy, moist and delicious! I have successfully substituted egg-free mayonnaise for the regular mayonnaise, if eggs are off your list, too.
