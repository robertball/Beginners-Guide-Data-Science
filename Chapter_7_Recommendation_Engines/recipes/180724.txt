Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 tablespoon Indian chili powder
1/2 cup water, or as needed
1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree
1 tablespoon white sugar
salt to taste
1/3 cup heavy cream or half-and-half (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; stir in onions and bay leaves, and cook about 5 minutes until the onions begin to soften. Add flour, ginger-garlic paste, garam masala, turmeric, and Indian chili powder. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour the water into the pan, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom with a wooden spoon.  Pour in the tomato puree and thin with additional water to desired consistency. Add sugar and salt; cook until sugar is dissolved and soup is hot, about 5 minutes.
Remove bay leaves and serve with cream if desired.

Description: 
After some looking at different recipes, I thought I would experiment with making an Indian Tomato Soup, as I once had in a restaurant.  This comes close.  Warning!  Indian Chili powder is much spicier than your ordinary store-bought.
