Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup vanilla whey protein powder
1/3 cup tapioca flour
1/3 cup sorghum flour
1/3 cup arrowroot flour
1/3 cup oat flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum
3 eggs
1 1/4 cups shredded zucchini
2/3 cup applesauce
1/2 cup stevia powder
1/4 cup canola oil
1/4 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 standard-sized silicone baking cups with cooking spray.
Mix protein powder, tapioca flour, sorghum flour, arrowroot flour, oat flour, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and xanthan gum in a large bowl until evenly blended.
Whisk eggs, zucchini, applesauce, stevia powder, and oil in a medium bowl until combined. Add to flour mixture and stir until just combined. Fold in walnuts; let batter sit, about 5 minutes.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each to the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until fully cooked in the centers, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack; remove from liners when completely cooled.
