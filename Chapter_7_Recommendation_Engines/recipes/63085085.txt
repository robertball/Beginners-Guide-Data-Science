Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
2 TBLS A1 sauce
2 TBLS Ketchup
¼ cup grated cheese
2 eggs
2 tsp beef boulion
1 tsp Garlic salt
1 tsp Onion powder
½ tsp pepper
¼ cup bread crumbs

Directions:
Mix all ingredients.  (I like to use my KitchenAid counter top mixer).   I also use a scoop to make the balls to size you prefer.  Place balls on a non-stick (either stick free foil or silicone liners) cookie sheet.  Bake at 350° for approx. 20-25 mins depending on the size of the balls.

Description: 
This recipe tops any meatball I have ever tried.  Easy, tasty, and tender!

I like to freeze them so I can use them later with wither pasta sauce, gravy, or soups... very versatile!
