Ingredients:
2 lb. bag frozen chopped broccoli
1 can Cream of Mushroom soup
1 cup Mayonnaise
1 egg
1 tbsp. spicy brown mustard (like Gulden's)
1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
1/4 tsp. onion powder
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
1/8 tsp. salt
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese (reserve 2 tbsp. for topping)
4 Saltine crackers, finely crumbled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and set the rack to the center position.
While the oven is heating, bring a large pot of water to boil and parboil the frozen broccoli four 4 minutes, then drain and let cool slightly, so as not to curdle the mayonnaise and egg when mixing the casserole ingredients.
Mix broccoli, soup, mayonnaise, egg, and remaining ingredients in a large bowl, reserving 2 tbsp. of cheese and the crackers.  Pour the mix into a 1 1/2 to 2 quart casserole dish and sprinkle the top with the remaining cheese and cracker crumbs.
Bake at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes.  Let stand for 10-15 minutes before serving.

This is a family favorite for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  My mother made it for years, and now I make it every year for my own family.  I have made some alterations over the years and this is the version we currently enjoy.
