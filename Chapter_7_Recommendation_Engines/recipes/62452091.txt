Ingredients:
2 boneless petite sirloin steak about 1lb
4 oz lower sodium teriyaki sauce
2 long Italian Five Grain Baguette,cut in half and split lengthwise
4 teaspoons mayonnaise, or to taste
1 ounce chile sauce with garlic
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
1 small red onion, sliced into rings
1 medium cucumber, peeled and sliced lengthwise
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
salt and pepper to taste
Canola Cooking Spray

Directions:
Marinate steaks in teriyaki for at least 30 minutes. While steaks are marinating prep sandwich ingredients and make pink mayo by combining mayonnaise & chili garlic sauce. Heat a large cast iron skillet coated with canola cooking spray on medium high heat add steaks and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning once, or until browned on each side. Remove and let steak rest for 5 minutes then slice thinly crosswise
Open the baguette and spread pink mayo on the insides. Place 1/4 of the strips of sirloin steak  into each roll. Spread chile sauce directly on the meat. Sprinkle with a little lime juice and top with slices of onion, cucumber, cilantro, salt and pepper. Finish with another quick drizzle of lime juice.

Description: 
This is a twist on the Vietnamese Sandwich which uses petite sirloin steak instead of pork chops. I also use an Italian 5 grain baguette which is healthier than the traditional white baguette. Beer or red wine is the beverage of choice for this authentic recipe of French influenced  Vietnamese cuisine .Modified from: Vietnamese Sandwich
