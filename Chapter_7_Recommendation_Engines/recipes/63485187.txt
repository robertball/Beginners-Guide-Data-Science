Description: 
I created this salad in looking for something flavorful, yet healthy.  This is NOT for the faint of heart--there are a lot of bold flavors going on in this salad--onion, cilantro, and lime.  There is NO dressing or cheese required as the creaminess of the avocado takes care it (and helps lower calories/bad fat!).  Give it a try.  If you like bold and spicy without the heat, you'll enjoy this!
