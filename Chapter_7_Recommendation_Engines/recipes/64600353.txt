Ingredients:
2 packages (6 ounces each) stuffing mix
1 can (10-3/4 ounces) condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
1 cup milk
8 cups cubed cooked chicken
1/2 tsp pepper
3/4 pound sliced deli ham, cut into 1-inch strips
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
3 cups shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°. Prepare stuffing mixes according to package directions. Meanwhile, whisk together soup and milk.
Toss chicken with pepper; divide between two greased 13" x 9" baking dishes. Layer with ham, Swiss cheese, 1 cup cheddar cheese, soup mixture and stuffing. Sprinkle with remaining cheddar cheese.
Bake, covered, 30 minutes. Uncover; bake until cheese is melted, 10-15 minutes.
Freeze option: Cover and freeze unbaked casseroles. To use, partially thaw in refrigerator overnight. Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 350°. Bake, covered, until heated through and a thermometer inserted in center reads 165°, about 45 minutes. Uncover; bake until cheese is melted, 10-15 minutes.

Description: 
The nice thing about this recipe is that it gives two casserole for the price of one. I often freeze several half recipes in disposable pans to share with neighbors or for when I don’t have much time myself.
