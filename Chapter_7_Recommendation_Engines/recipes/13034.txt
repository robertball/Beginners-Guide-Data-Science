Drain and rinse beans. Place beans in slow cooker with canned tomatoes, broth, white wine, and vegetables.  Cover, and cook on low for 7 to 8 hours.
In a skillet, cook the sausage over medium heat until done.  Slice links into 1/2 inch pieces.  Add meat to slow cooker, and cook soup another 30 to 60 minutes.
