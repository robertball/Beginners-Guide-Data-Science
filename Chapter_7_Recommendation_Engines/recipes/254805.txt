Ingredients:
3 cups shredded zucchini
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup dry potato flakes
1/4 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Mix zucchini, eggs, vegetable oil, onion powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir in potato flakes and baking powder; mix until batter is combined.
Pour 1/2 cup of the batter onto the center of the waffle iron. Close the lid; cook until iron stops steaming and waffle is crisp, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
A gluten-free waffle using zucchini and dry potato flakes--think green eggs and ham. Serve with sour cream, tart jam, onion chip dip, or applesauce. They can be breakfast, brunch, lunch, or a side dish. Easier than standing at the stove and frying zucchini pancakes. I like them with my homemade rhubarb jam.
