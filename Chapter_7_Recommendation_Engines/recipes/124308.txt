Description: 
This Southern dish has appealing down-home flavor. A sizable serving topped with butter is a treat. When I was growing up, Mother baked it to go with soups and stews. I always thought her spoon bread was the best.                                        --Mildred Sherrer, Fort Worth, Texas
