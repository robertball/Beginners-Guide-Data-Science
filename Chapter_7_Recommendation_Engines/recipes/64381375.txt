Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Bisquick, or baking mix
1 Pound of hot breakfast sausage
Pinch of Cayenne pepper
Pinch of black pepper
Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 cup milk
8 oz. pack of shredded cheddar cheese. I use mild cheddar cheese, but sharp cheese is also good

Directions:
Put everything in the bowl and mix. This is easiest to do with your hands.
Roll the mixture into balls, a little smaller than golf balls.
Place the sausage balls about 1/2 inch apart on a foil-lined cookie sheet.
Bake at 370 degrees for about 20 minutes. The Bisquick balls should be lightly browned with the meat cooked through.
