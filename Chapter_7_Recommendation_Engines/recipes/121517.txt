Ingredients:
1 cup sliced carrots
1 cup finely chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon pepper
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 cups cubed cooked turkey
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup, undiluted
1 cup frozen cut green beans, cooked and drained
1 Pastry for double-crust pie (9 inches)
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
In a skillet, saute carrots, onion, celery, thyme and pepper in butter until vegetables are crisp-tender. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine turkey and flour; shake to coat. Add turkey, soup and green beans to the vegetable mixture; mix well. Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom crust. Add turkey mixture. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie; seal and flute edges. Cut slits in pastry. Brush with milk. Cover edges loosely with foil. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.

Description: 
Need ways to use up leftover turkey? This is what I like to do. The cubed poultry, tender vegetables and herbs encased in a flaky crust is a favorite at our house.
