Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup light soy sauce
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons lemon pepper seasoning
2 teaspoons minced garlic
6 pork loin chops, trimmed

Directions:
Mix all marinade ingredients in a deep bowl.  Add pork chops and marinate at least 2 hours.
Remove chops from marinade and cook over medium-high heat on a greased grill - 5-6 minutes per side for chops 3/4" or thinner, 6-7 minutes per side for chops thicker than 3/4".  DO NOT OVERCOOK or chops will become tough and dry. Turn over when juices pool on upper surface and meat appears to be cooked half-way through.
