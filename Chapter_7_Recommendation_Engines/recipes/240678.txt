Ingredients:
1 fluid ounce spiced rum (such as Sailor JerryÂ®)
1 fluid ounce butterscotch schnapps
1/2 teaspoon imitation butter flavoring
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle cream soda
1 small scoop vanilla ice cream (optional)

Directions:
Stir rum and butterscotch schnapps together in a frosted 14-ounce mug.
Pour butter flavoring into the cream soda, then turn cream soda over to pour quickly into the chilled mug. Gently drop the ice cream into the soda mixture.

Description: 
I've tried a couple of butterbeer recipes I found online, and they all were either so sweet they made me sick or they had oily butter in them that made me sick. I opted for a simplified version that tasted a little bit like less-sickly butterscotch and was strong enough to slightly inebriate something larger than a house elf. Great for Harry Potter-themed parties or Halloween. Served super-chilled in a frosted mug, it can magically warm up even the coldest wizards.
