Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1 cup sugar
1 egg, separated
1/2 tsp. vanilla or almond extract (I prefer almond)
2 cups flour
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
pinch salt
1/2 cup chopped pecans or cut mix glace fruit (I've always used fruit)

Directions:
Cream butter and sugar together.
Add egg yolk and extract; mix well.
Mix flour, cinnamon and salt together; gradually add to creamed mixture.
Spoon into a greased 10" x 15" baking pan.
Using a piece of plastic wrap, press evenly into pan with your hand or a spoon. Remove wrap.
In a clean mixing bowl, beat egg white until foamy.
Brush egg white over dough.
Sprinkle with pecans or fruit (or a combo equivalent to 1/2 cup).
Bake @ 300 x 30 min.
Cut into 1 1/2" diamond shapes while warm.

Description: 
I usually make these around Christmas, but they would be good anytime. A nice change of shape to add variety to a baking tray. And for those who don't like things super sweet, I think you'd approve of these.
