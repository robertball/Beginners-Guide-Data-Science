Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds baby potatoes, halved
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add potatoes, cover, and steam until just fork tender, about 10 minutes or longer, depending on the size of the potatoes.
Transfer potatoes to a bowl. Add parsley, garlic powder, salt, and pepper; toss to coat.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add potatoes to the hot oil. Cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, until potatoes are browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Baby potatoes, garlic powder, dried parsley, and a little salt and pepper is all that you need for these little gems. Easy to prepare and they can be made well in advance, a bonus when planning a dinner party or for an easy night meal. I've used parsley and garlic but you can choose any seasoning that will complement your meal.
