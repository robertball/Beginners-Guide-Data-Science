Description: 
A very flavorful Puerto Rican soup I got from one of my co-workers.  It is fast, easy, and most of all delicious!  I start it the night before serving by cooking the broth, onions, potatoes, and chorizo.  That way the next day after work, all I have to do is add the remaining ingredients and heat through.
