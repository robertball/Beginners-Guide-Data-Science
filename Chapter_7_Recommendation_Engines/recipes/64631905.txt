Ingredients:
300 grams tofu
1/2 piece scallions (white part)
50 grams crab sticks
50 grams shimeji mushrooms
1 small can of scallop pillars (with juice)
1 tablespoon mirin
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon sake
1/2 teaspoon oyster sauce
pinch of salt
pinch of pepper
1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon ginger, grated
1 tablespoon sesame oil
15 grams cheese

Directions:
Pat dry the tofu with the use of a kitchen paper. Then, dice it into 1-cm cubes.
Mince the scallions. Shred the crab sticks. Cut the root of the shimeji mushrooms then separate the pieces individually.
In a small bowl, combine mirin, soy sauce, sake, oyster sauce, salt and pepper. Mix well.
Combine the tofu, scallions, crab sticks, shimeji mushrooms, seasoning mixture and the canned scallops. Mix well.
Cover the bowl then cook in the microwave for 5 minutes.
Take out the bowl then add the cornstarch water and mix. Press the grated ginger to get the juice then pour it in the bowl. Add sesame oil then mix carefully to avoid breaking the tofu.
Add the cheese on top then put back the cover. Cook for 2 more minutes in the microwave then you can serve.

Description: 
Steamed tofu and scallions with canned scallops. It’s simple but tasty. I’ve used canned scallops to make this dish but you can also use the fresh ones.
