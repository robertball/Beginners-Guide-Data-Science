Ingredients:
1/3 cup JIF速 Reduced Fat Peanut Butter
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 cup marshmallow creme
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (6 ounce) package semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup white chocolate chips
1/2 teaspoon CRISCO速 Butter Flavor All-Vegetable Shortening
Colored gumdrops

Directions:
Grease 8-inch pan.
Combine sugar, marshmallow creme, milk, JIF(R) Reduced Fat Peanut Butter and salt in a large saucepan. Stir constantly on low heat until blended and mixture comes to a boil. Boil 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add semi-sweet chocolate chips. Stir until well blended. Stir in vanilla. Pour into pan. Cool.
Cut into squares or with cookie cutters.
Melt white chocolate chips with CRISCO(R) Butter Flavor All-Vegetable Shortening in microwave, stirring at 20-second intervals, until smooth (1-2 minutes). Place mixture in zip top bag. Cut a tiny piece off bottom corner to create a pastry bag. (If chocolate hardens, place in microwave for 7-10 seconds).
Decorate fudge to look like gifts. Uses x's or zigzags to make ribbons and or patterns.
Cut colored gumdrops into slivers. Gather a multi-colored ''bouquet'' of slivers and press the ''stems'' into the candies. Place each piece of decorated fudge in a candy cup, place in a gift box.
