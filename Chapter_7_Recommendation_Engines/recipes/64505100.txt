Ingredients:
2 tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons crushed black pepper
2 tablespoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon granulated garlic
1 tablespoon granulated onion
1 tablespoon crushed coriander
1 tablespoon dill
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon of dehydrated onion flakes (optional, for texture)

Directions:
Toast coriander, dill, pepper flakes, and onion over medium heat until fragrant.
Let the spices cool slightly.
Place mixture in a spice mill (I use my nutri bullet).
Pulse a few times to break the spices down and into uniform size.
While the mixture is slightly warm add the remaining spices.
Blend well.
Use immediately and/or store in an airtight container.
