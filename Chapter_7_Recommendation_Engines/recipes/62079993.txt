Krispie Fudge Roll Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
Base:
3/4 cup corn syrup
3/4 cup peanut butter
3/4 cup sugar
1 tsp vanilla
pinch salt
4 1/2 cups rice krispies
Icing:  1 1/2 cups chocolate chips
3 tbsp softened margerine
3/4 cup icing sugar
2 tbsp water (approx)

Directions:
Base:
Heat first 2 ingredients until they just start to bubble. DO NOT BOIL.  If it does boil, add a bit more corn syrup. Remove from heat. Add the rest except for rice krispies. Stir till smooth- then add rice krispies.
Line a 15 x 13 inch cookie sheet with greased waxed paper, and press the base mixture into sheet.  Let cool while you prepare the icing.
Icing:
Melt chocolate chips on low heat. Stir in softened margerine. Beat in icing sugar and then water, until good spreading consistancy. Spread on the base.
Roll it up like a jelly roll, using the waxed paper to help mold it into a nice roll (but peel it away as you roll it up).  Cool in the refridgerator slightly before you cut it into slices.  Freezes well!
Optional: for quicker or easier recipe, use Betty Crocker chocolate icing instead of making the icing from scratch.

Description: 
This recipe is a favorite of ours, and was passed on to me by my mom.  I don't make it too often- only because I have very little self control when it comes to these!
