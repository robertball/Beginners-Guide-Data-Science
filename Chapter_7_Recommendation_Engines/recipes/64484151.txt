Really Tasty Sunchoke Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
-about 12 sunchokes, scrubbed clean
-1 can of butterbeans or cannellini beans
-1 zucchini, cut into matchsticks
-3 bacon strips
-1/2 of a yellow onion, chopped
-2 teaspoons black pepper
-1 cube chicken bouillon
-pinch salt
-2 teaspoons garlic powder
-1 teaspoon thyme
-1 teaspoon minced parsley
-1/2 cup cream
-2 cups spinach
-1 cup water

Directions:
1.	Boil a medium to large saucepan of water. While waiting for the water to boil, cut sunchokes into small pieces (around 1 inch). Add sunchokes to water and boil until they are very soft.
2.	While boiling the sunchokes, fry the three strips of bacon in a medium skillet. Set the bacon aside on a plate, leaving the bacon grease in the skillet. Add the onions and zucchini and cook over medium heat until tender. Chop the bacon strips into small pieces.
3.	Drain the beans from the can and the sunchokes from the pan. Place them both in a large bowl and mash with a potato masher. Alternatively, you can put them into a blender or food processor if you want it to be less chunky.
4.	Put the beans and sunchokes back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat (remembering to first empty it of water), then add the zucchini, onion, and bacon. Stir until incorporated.
5.	Add water and turn heat up to medium-high. Add black pepper, salt, thyme, Bouillon, garlic powder, and parsley. When that is well-blended, add cream. Heat through. If desired, you can simmer it for a longer time to enhance flavors.
6.	Serve over fresh spinach leaves.
