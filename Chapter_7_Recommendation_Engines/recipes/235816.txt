Description: 
My mom used to tell us that back home they would eat snow with 'thick, sweet milk', which can be easily known as sweetened condensed milk. This recipe is easy and will be leaving you asking for more. Place a large bowl outside when snowing. If there is already a lot of snow, you can pick up the clean, fresh snow.
