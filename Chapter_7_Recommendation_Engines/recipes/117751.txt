Ingredients:
3 pounds frozen boneless turkey roast, thawed
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
8 cloves garlic, peeled
1 cup chicken broth, divided
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup white wine, or additional chicken broth
1/4 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
Cut roast in half. Combine the garlic powder, paprika, oil, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper; rub over turkey. Place in a 5-qt. slow cooker. Add the garlic, 1/2 cup broth, water, wine or additional broth, orange juice and lemon juice. Cover and cook on low for 5-6 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F.
Remove turkey and keep warm. Discard garlic cloves. For gravy, combine cornstarch and remaining broth until smooth; stir into cooking juices. Cover and cook on high for 15 minutes or until thickened. Slice turkey; serve with gravy.

Description: 
'I was skeptical at first about fixing turkey in a slow cooker,' admits Kathy Kittell from Lenexa, Kansas. 'But once I tasted this dish, I was hooked. With a little cornstarch to thicken the juices, the gravy is easily made.'
