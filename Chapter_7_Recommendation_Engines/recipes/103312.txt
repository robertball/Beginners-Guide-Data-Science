Ingredients:
8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni
3 (6 ounce) cans white tuna, drained and flaked
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup frozen green peas
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups French-fried onions

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni pasta and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, stir together the tuna, cream of mushroom soup, cheese and peas. Season with dill and pepper then add the drained macaroni and stir to coat. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until heated through. Sprinkle the French-fried onions on top and return to the oven for 5 minutes or until lightly toasted.
