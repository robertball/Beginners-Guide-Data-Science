Ingredients:
Chicken:
1 lb Skinless Boneless Chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces
4 Tablespoons Flour
Salt and Pepper
1 Tablespoon Vegetable or Canola Oil
Steamed Broccoli (Optional)
Whole Wheat Noodles (Optional)
Add flour, salt and pepper to a medium ziplock bag.
Orange Sauce:
1/3 Cup Orange Juice
½ Cup Rice Wine Vinegar (Must be rice wine and not regular white vinegar)
½ Cup White Sugar
2.5 Tablespoons Soy Sauce
1 Tablespoon Orange or Lemon Zest (I use lemon)
½ Tablespoon Toasted Sesame Oil
2 Teaspoons Corn Starch
1 Tablespoon Red Pepper flakes (more or less depending on your preference for heat)

Directions:
Add chicken and toss until all chicken pieces are evenly coated.
Heat oil over medium high heat in a large skillet.
Add chicken pieces and cook for 3 minutes until browned on one side and then turn over and cook another 3 minutes until cooked through.
Turn heat down to very low and add enough sauce to fit your tastes.
Sauce: Mix corn starch into orange juice until lumps are gone.  Add orange juice mixture and rest of the ingredients together in a small sauce pan over medium heat.
Bring to a boil and cook until sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon – about five minutes.
If it doesn’t get thick, then add a little more cornstarch mixed in water. Set aside.
