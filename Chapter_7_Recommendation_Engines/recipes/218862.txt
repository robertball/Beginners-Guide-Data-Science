Ingredients:
25 medium portobello mushrooms
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (6 ounce) can lump crabmeat, drained
1 (5 ounce) package frozen cooked salad shrimp, thawed
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (16 ounce) package JohnsonvilleÂ® All Natural Ground Italian Sausage
1 egg

Directions:
Remove stems from mushrooms; chop stems and set aside. Place mushroom caps on waxed paper, bottom side up. Mist or brush caps with oil; sprinkle with salt, pepper and garlic powder.
In a food processor, combine the crabmeat, shrimp, cheeses, garlic, pepper, and mushroom stems. Pulse for 10-15 seconds until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a large bowl. Crumble sausage over crabmeat mixture. Add egg; mix just until combined. Spoon into mushroom caps.
Place in greased shallow baking pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a thermometer inserted into filling reads 160 degrees F.
