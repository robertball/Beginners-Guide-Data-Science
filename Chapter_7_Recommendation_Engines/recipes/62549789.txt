Ingredients:
1 whole wheat tortilla (about 11 inch diameter)
2 egg whites
3 tbsp. sharp cheddar cheese, shredded, low fat
2 oz. ham, lean
¼ medium potato, very thinly sliced (or shredded)
1 tbsp. scallions, chopped
1.5 tbsp. tomato salsa
1 tsp. olive oil

Directions:
Heat tortilla in the oven for 2 minutes at 350F or heat up in the microwave about 20 seconds (times will vary). In a bowl, whisk the eggs. Heat olive oil to a skillet over medium; add the eggs and cook until they reach desired consistency.
Meanwhile, heat another skillet to medium high heat, spray with nonstick spray and add potatoes. Arrange the potatoes into a round “patty” shape and cook on both sides until golden brown. To assemble the burrito, spread salsa on heated tortilla; add potato “patty”, eggs, cheese, ham and scallions. Fold tortilla into a burrito and serve.
