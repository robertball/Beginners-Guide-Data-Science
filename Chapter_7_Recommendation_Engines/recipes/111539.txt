Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
1/2 pound cooked or raw shrimp, tails removed, cut in pieces
2 cups fat-free half-and-half
1 cup no-salt-added tomato sauce
1/4 teaspoon hot chile sauce, or to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon butter
1/4 cup grated fresh Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In saucepan, heat olive oil. Add red pepper and onion; saute on low heat until soft, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add shrimp, half-and-half, tomato sauce, hot sauce, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes. Add butter.
Put 1/2 hot mixture in a blender and carefully process at high speed about 10 to 15 seconds, or until no large pieces remain. Transfer bisque into soup bowls.
Repeat with remaining mixture. Sprinkle on Parmesan cheese.
Optional garnishes: herbs and additional shrimp.
