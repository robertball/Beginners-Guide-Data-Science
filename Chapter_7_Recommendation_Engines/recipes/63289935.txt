Ingredients:
6 ears of corn, shucked
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup crème fraîche or sour cream
1/2 cup freshly grated cotija or Pecorino-Romano cheese (about 2 ounces)
2 teaspoons chile piquín
Lime wedges, for serving

Directions:
Light a charcoal grill or preheat the oven to 500°. In a large pot of boiling water, cook the corn until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain well.
2. Grill the corn, turning frequently, until well-browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Alternatively, roast the corn on a baking sheet for 10 to 15 minutes, turning the ears occasionally.
3. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise with the crème fraîche.
4. Attach corn holders to each ear of corn, or press a bamboo skewer through the centers. Generously brush the mayonnaise mixture all over the ears and sprinkle with the cheese and chile piquín. Serve right away, with lime wedges.
