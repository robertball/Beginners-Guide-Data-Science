1 (12 ounce) package ground sausage
18 fresh mushrooms
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened

1 cup red wine

Directions:
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Clean the mushrooms. Remove, chop and reserve the stems.
In a medium bowl, gently mix the chopped mushroom stems, cream cheese and bread crumbs. Mix in the sausage and 1/4 cup red wine.
Using a spoon, stuff the mushroom caps with the chopped stem mixture. Transfer to a large baking dish, and cover with the remaining red wine.
Bake in the preheated oven 25 to 30 minutes, or until the mixture is lightly brown.
