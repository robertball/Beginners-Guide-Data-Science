Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
4 tablespoons chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)
1 banana, cut into 24 slices
12 tablespoons light whipped cream
4 tablespoons chopped hazelnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
Cut each pastry sheet into 6 equal squares. Line the bottom and sides of each muffin cup with 1 pastry square.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and flaky, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and lightly press the bottom of each pastry cup with a spoon to make room for the filling.
Place pastry cups on a platter and dust with confectioners' sugar. Layer 1 teaspoon chocolate-hazelnut spread, 2 banana slices, and 1 tablespoon whipped cream, in that order, in each warm cup. Sprinkle with hazelnuts.
