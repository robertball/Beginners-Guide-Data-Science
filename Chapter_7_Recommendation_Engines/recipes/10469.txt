Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup shortening
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 cup crushed peppermint hard candies

Directions:
Cream together butter or margarine, shortening, sugars, eggs and vanilla.  Add dry ingredients (except candy) and mix well.  Dough will be greasy.
Using a floured surface and rolling pin, roll out dough.  Cut out 2 inch heart shaped cookies.  Using a 1 inch heart shaped cookie cutter, cut out a smaller heart in the middle of the larger one.  Put cookies on a foil lined cookie sheet.
Inside of cut-out heart, sprinkle crushed candy crumbs (such as red life savers or candy canes).  Spread the crumbs to the inside edges of the cookie.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degees C) for 10-12 minutes.  When cookes have cooled, remove from sheets.  The cookie can be frosted if you desire.
