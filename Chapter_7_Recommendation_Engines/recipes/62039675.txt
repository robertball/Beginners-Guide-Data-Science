Ingredients:
Juice of 2 lemons
Zest of 1 lemon
2 cups semi-skimmed milk
1 can (405g)skimmed, sweetened condensed milk

Directions:
1. Make sure milk and condensed milk are well chilled and do not take out of fridge until you are ready to pour into your machine.
2. Squeeze juice from both lemons into bowl.  Add zest from one of the lemons into same bowl.
3. Add lemon juice, zest, milk and condensed milk to your ice-cream machine, following your machine's particular instructions.
4. For best results, I churned my mixture in my machine for about 15-20 minutes and while still slushy, poured it into individual containers and placed in the freezer for approx. 2 hours.  They came out brilliantly, with no ice crystals, not too soft, not too hard and very, very tasty indeed! Enjoy!
