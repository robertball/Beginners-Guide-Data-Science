Ingredients:
4 cups white bread flour
1-1/2 teaspoons salt
1-1/4 cups buttermilk
2 Tablespoons powdered sugar
3/4 stick (6 Tablespoons) butter, softened
1 Tablespoon baking powder
3/4 cup onion, finely diced or shredded onion
3/4 cup cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large mixing bowl, combine all ingredients except the onion and cheese, and mix by hand for 5 minutes.  Add onion and cheese and incorporate into the dough.  Do not over-mix!
Divide the dough into two balls; place on the lined baking sheet and flatten each one to about 2 inches thick.  Dust with flour.
Bake in the pre-heated oven for 30 minutes.  Cool on a rack until warm and serve.

Description: 
I begged this recipe from my co-worker when he accidentally mentioned he had a great soda bread recipe.  It was perfect timing, because St. Patrick's Day is only 10 days away!
