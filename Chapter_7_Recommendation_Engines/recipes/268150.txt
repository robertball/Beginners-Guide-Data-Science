Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 eggs
1/4 cup oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups sliced bananas
2 cups chopped pecans
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple
Frosting:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup softened butter
1 (16 ounce) box powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease three 8-inch cake pans.
Combine flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Beat in eggs, oil, and vanilla extract. Stir in bananas, pecans, and pineapple. Divide batter among the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes. Invert onto wire racks and let cool completely.
Make frosting while cake layers are cooling. Combine cream cheese and butter in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract; mix until creamy.
Spread frosting onto the cooled cake layers. Stack layers; frost top and sides.
