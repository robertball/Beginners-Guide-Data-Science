Ingredients:
pound lean ground beef (will make 6 muffins, 2=5 ounces cooked, 1 lean)
Pinch salt and pepper
½ cup chopped raw zucchini or cauliflower (1/3 green per serving)
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (1/8 condiment per serving)
½ t garlic powder (1/3 condiment per serving)
½ teaspoon onion powder (1/3 condiment per serving)
2 tablespoons sugar free bbq sauce  I used Walden farms (a little less than 1/3 condiment per serving)

Directions:
Spray 6 muffin cups with a little non-stick cooking spray. Mix all together and fill 6 muffin cups with meat making a muffin. Take 2 more tablespoons of the bbq sauce and divide among the muffins on top of each one. (1/3 condiment per serving) Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Yummy!!! 2 muffins = 5 ounces (1 lean) Makes 3 servings. **Be careful when removing from oven. If you used a very lean beef you shouldn’t have much fat at all, if you used a beef with high fat content, you will have a lot of fat. Remove them and place on paper towels to soak up fat.
