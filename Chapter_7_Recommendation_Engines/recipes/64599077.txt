Ingredients:
2 1/2 c. Goat milk, warmed
4 t. Active yeast
1/2 c. Vegan butter substitute, room temperature
1/4 c. Honey
2 eggs
2 t. Salt
7 c. Flour
1/4 c. Vegan butter substitute, melted

Directions:
1) Mix warmed goat milk with yeast, allow to set for about 5 min.
2) Add honey, 1/2 c. vegan butter, eggs, and salt into the goat milk and yeast. Mix together.
3) Add flour, mix till a soft dough is formed. Divide into two large bowls.
4) Cover the bowls with plastic rap, place in a slightly warmed oven (be sure it's not over 120 degrees or the yeast won't do as well) or in a warm spot. Allow to rise for 1 hour, then punch down and allow to rise an additional 30 minutes.
5) Turn dough out onto a slightly floured surface, knead for a few minutes, till smooth. Grease a large glass pan, and place 2-3 inch dough balls into the pan. Continue intill all the dough is gone. Brush on melted vegan butter. Turn oven on to 400 degrees, and wait till it is preheated, allowing dough balls to rise some more. Bake for 20 minutes, intill slightly golden on top, and they sound hollow when tapped. Cool a bit and enjoy!
