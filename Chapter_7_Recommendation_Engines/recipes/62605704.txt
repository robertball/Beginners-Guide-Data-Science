Ingredients:
1 Cup cooked/leftover steel cut oats (this recipe was flavored with brown sugar, light maple syrup and a sprinkle of cinnamon)
1/2 C warm water (I nuke mines in the microwave for a minute)
2 Tablespoon of honey
3 teaspoon of vital wheat gluten w/vitamin c
2 Cups whole wheat flour
1 Cup bread flour (and maybe more if your dough looks too wet)
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tsp of breadmaker yeast

Directions:
Add ingredients according to your bread machines directions. I used the white/basic bread setting with a light crust. If you find that after the 1st and second rise that the dough looks a little wet, add more flour.

Description: 
I always cook 5 cups of steel cut oatmeal on Sunday night so during the weekdays, I can have my oatmeal at work. Didn't feel like eating my cup of oatmeal on Friday so decided to make bread with it!
