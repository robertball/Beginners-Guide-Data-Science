Description: 
This is truly BBQ chicken pizza in soup-form. Sweet and spicy BBQ sauce, chicken, red onions, and cilantro come together with the addition of corn for a comforting bowl of goodness on a chilly autumn day. I've also used frozen chicken cutlets in this with great results. Whatever you have on hand will work!
