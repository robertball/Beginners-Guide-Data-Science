Description: 
THIS WONDERFUL RECIPE is just too good to keep to myself! My daughter shared it with me.     The portions are just right to suit my appetite, and the muffins are so pretty when they're pulled from the oven with the cheese all bubbly and hot. I also serve these to guests. -Violena Carver, Potosi, Missouri
