Ingredients:
3 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup vegetable shortening
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup cherry juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 pinch salt
1 cup maraschino cherries

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Whisk together the eggs, shortening, milk, cherry juice, and vanilla extract in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside. Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a separate large bowl; make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour the cherry juice mixture into the well and stir just until combined. Fold in the cherries. Pour the batter into a loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the top springs back when lightly pressed, about 1 hour. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack before cutting to serve.
