Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
4 ounces soft goat cheese (chevre)
2 1/2 cups coarsely chopped fresh sorrel
4 scallions, chopped
1 1/2 cups milk
3 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon shredded Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Press pie crust into the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan and prick several times with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool at least 10 minutes.
Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Spread goat cheese into the bottom of the cooled pie crust. Cover with sorrel and scallions.
Beat milk, eggs, and salt together using a fork in a bowl. Pour over sorrel mixture. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.
