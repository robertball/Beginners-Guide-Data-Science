Ingredients:
•Cooking spray
•2-1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
•1/3 cup half-and-half
•2 tablespoons bourbon
•1/3 cup firmly packed light-brown sugar
•1-1/2 teaspoons kosher or sea salt
•1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
•1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
•1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
•2 large eggs
For the streusel:
Ingredients
•3/4 cup chopped pecans
•2/3 cup packed light-brown sugar
•1/4 cup all-purpose flour
•3 tablespoons salted butter, melted
•1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with vegetable oil and set aside. Next, make the puree:
Put the sweet potatoes into a 4- to 5-quart pot and cover with water; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until tender, about 20 minutes.
Preheat your oven to 350° and set a rack to the middle position. When the potatoes are cooked, drain and transfer to a large mixing bowl.
Add the next 8 ingredients (through the eggs) and beat with a mixer at high speed until smooth, about 1 minute.
Pour into the prepared baking dish and sprinkle evenly with streusel.
Transfer to the oven.
Bake until the potatoes are cooked through and the topping is browned and fragrant, 35 to 40 minutes.
Streusel: In a bowl, stir together the pecans, brown sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon. Set aside.
