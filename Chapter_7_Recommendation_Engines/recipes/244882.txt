Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) box Barilla® Pronto™ Elbows
3 cups cold water
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup Barilla® Tomato & Basil Sauce
2 tablespoons chipotle pepper sauce
1 cup rotisserie chicken, shredded
1 (15.5 ounce) can hominy, rinsed and drained
1 onion, diced
1/2 cup radishes, sliced
5 sprigs cilantro
3 limes, sliced into wedges

Directions:
Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Turn the burner to high and set your timer to 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste).
Cook on high, stirring occasionally until most of the water is absorbed about 10 minutes but may vary by stove.
With about 3 minutes left add chicken broth, Tomato & Basil sauce, chipotle sauce, chicken and hominy. Stir to combine. Remove the skillet from the heat.
To plate, portion out bowls and top with onion, radish and cilantro.  Garnish with lime.
