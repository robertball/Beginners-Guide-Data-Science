3/4 cup white sugar

2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch square pan.
In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and cocoa. Stir in the milk and melted butter. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.
In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar and cocoa. Spread over the top of the batter in the pan. Pour the hot water over the entire pan of batter.
Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven. The cake is done when the cake part is on top and the bottom is of a pudding consistency.

Description: 
This is a recipe from my Mom. She made me a cookbook of favorite recipes when I left home. Her note is, 'this is handy when you don't have an egg in the house and you need something other than gelatin for dessert'.
