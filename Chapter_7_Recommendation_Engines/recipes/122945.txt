Ingredients:
3 cups diced peeled potatoes
1 cup diced carrots
1 medium onion, chopped
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 pound ground beef
1/4 pound ground pork
1 tablespoon butter, melted
PASTRY:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 cup shortening
3/4 cup cold water

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, carrots, onion, salt and pepper. Add beef and pork; mix well. Add butter and toss; set aside.
For pastry, combine flour and salt in a bowl. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add water, tossing with a fork until a ball forms.
Divide dough into five portions; roll each into a 10-in. circle. Place 1 cup of filling in the center of each circle. Fold pastry over filling and seal edges tightly with a fork; cut slits in the top of each.
Place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
PASTIES were a must years ago when men worked the mines in northern Michigan. The housewives made them in the morning and wrapped them tightly in newspaper so they would stay warm until lunch break.     Everyone used to say my mom made the best pasties in the world. This is her recipe. -Vivienne Abraham, Detroit, Michigan
