Ingredients:
1 bunch watercress, torn into bite sized pieces
1 mango - peeled, seeded, and sliced
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Preheat the oven broiler.
Arrange the watercress on a serving platter. Top each piece with a slice of mango.
Place the eggs and the bread crumbs in separate small bowls. Coat goat cheese pieces with bread crumbs, dip in the egg, and coat again with bread crumbs.
Arrange coated goat cheese pieces in a single layer on a medium baking sheet. Broil in the preheated oven 2 to 4 minutes per side, until lightly browned. Arrange atop the watercress and mango to serve.
