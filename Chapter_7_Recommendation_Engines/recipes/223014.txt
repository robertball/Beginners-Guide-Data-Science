Ingredients:
10 eggs
4 cups canned pumpkin puree
2 2/3 cups vegetable oil
6 cups white sugar
4 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cloves
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
4 1/2 cups matzo cake meal

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 40 muffin pan cups with paper muffin liners.
Beat eggs, pumpkin puree, and vegetable oil in a large bowl until thoroughly mixed. Stir sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar, salt, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg into the egg mixture. Slowly stir matzo cake meal into the batter until combined; pour into prepared muffin cups nearly to the top, as they will not rise much.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
These Passover pumpkin muffins are absolutely fabulous! I have made them many times and my kids can not tell that they are for Passover and not 'regular.' A true family favorite!
