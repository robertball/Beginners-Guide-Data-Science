Ingredients:
1 cup coconut gluten-free Amish Friendship Bread starter
1 tablespoon flax seed meal plus 3 tablespoons warm water (let sit for 10 minutes before adding to batter)
2 teaspoons Ener-G Foods Egg Replacer plus 2 tablespoons of warm water (whisk together until fluffy before adding to batter)
1 cup oil
1/2 cup coconut milk
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups Bob’s Red Mill all-purpose gluten-free flour
2 cups coconut flakes and dried tropical fruit medley, chopped (we used pineapple and papaya)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325° F (165° C).
In a medium-sized bowl mix Amish Friendship Bread starter, egg replacements, coconut milk, and vanilla.
In a large bowl mix sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and flour. Fold in dried fruit and coconut flakes until lightly coated (this helps prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the muffin wells).
Add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated. Be careful not to overmix.
Grease two large loaf pans.
Dust the greased mini muffin pans with sugar or use paper cups.
Pour the batter evenly into muffin tins and sprinkle sugar on top.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the bread loosens evenly from the sides and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.
ENJOY!

Description: 
We finally did itour gluten-free, vegan version of Amish Friendship Bread. This bread is sweet and dense, the sugar caramelized on top to form a nice crust.
