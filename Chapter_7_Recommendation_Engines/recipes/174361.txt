Ingredients:
1 bunch asparagus
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/3 cup pine nuts
1/3 cup dried cranberries
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Break off or trim the woody ends from the asparagus and discard. Set the spears aside.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the pine nuts, cranberries, and salt. Cook and stir until the pine nuts start to look translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the asparagus spears and cook, adding a little more olive oil if needed, until stalks are bright green and tender, about 5 to 8 minutes. Serve on a platter with the cranberries and nuts spooned over the top of the asparagus.

Description: 
This is a quick, easy way to saute asparagus. The dish has a light flavor and makes a great accompaniment to Italian meals. I make this year-round, but we especially enjoy it on Thanksgiving.
