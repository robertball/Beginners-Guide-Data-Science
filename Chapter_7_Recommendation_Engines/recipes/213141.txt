Ingredients:
8 chicken drumsticks
8 chicken thighs
salt and black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups cubed cooked ham
1 1/2 cups canned pineapple chunks
1 (12 ounce) package bacon slices, cut into 2 inch pieces
1/2 cup raisins (optional)
8 cups freshly squeezed orange juice
1/4 cup chicken bouillon granules
1/4 cup butter, cut into small chunks

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking dish with a cover.
Place the chicken drumsticks and thighs in the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Evenly distribute the ham, pineapple chunks, bacon, and raisins over the chicken.
Stir together the orange juice and chicken bouillon granules in a bowl, and pour the mixture over the top of the dish. Dot the top evenly with chunks of butter.
Cover, and bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is very tender and the sauce has started to reduce, about 1 1/2 hours. Uncover, baste the chicken pieces with the juices in the bottom of the pan, and return to the oven until the chicken is golden, about 30 more minutes.

Description: 
This is my Mexican sister-in-law's recipe. It's so tender and delicious, most people say it doesn't even taste like chicken! Serve it with the juices left in the pan and a good bread to soak it all up! Yum! Hope you enjoy it!
