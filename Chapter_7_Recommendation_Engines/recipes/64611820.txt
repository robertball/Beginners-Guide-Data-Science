Ingredients:
2 cups Crispy Rice cereal
1 cup mini marshmallows
½ cup creamy peanut butter
1 lb white chocolate
*optional - ¼ cup mini chocolate chips to sprinkle on top

Directions:
1. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, set aside.
2. Mix cereal and marshmallows in a large bowl. Set aside.
3. Melt white chocolate and peanut butter together in a double boiler. I prefer using a double boiler for melting white chocolate so it will melt slow and smooth, but if you prefer the microwave, you can do it that way too.
4. Once the white chocolate is melted pour it over the cereal mixture and stir until completely coated.
5. Drop using a tablespoon onto the lined pans.
6. Sprinkle with mini chocolate chips, if desired.
7. Place in refrigerators until chocolate is set.
NOTES
store airtight for up to 5 days in a cool place. You don't have to refrigerate these, but if they are kept in a warm place they could become sticky.
