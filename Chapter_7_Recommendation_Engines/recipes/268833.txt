Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable broth
1 cup brown lentils, rinsed
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
2 eggs, beaten
1 small onion, finely chopped
4 tablespoons ketchup
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine broth and lentils in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until lentils are soft and broth is absorbed, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain extra broth, if necessary. Mash lentils slightly and transfer to a large mixing bowl.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.
Add oats, Cheddar cheese, panko, eggs, onion, ketchup, garlic, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, basil, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper to the bowl with the lentils and mix well. Transfer mixture to the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until loaf starts to brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving. Loosen sides using a spatula before slicing.

Description: 
I've been trying many vegetarian 'meatloaf' recipes trying to find one we thought was just right. This is a conglomeration of several recipes and my own spin. You can top it with sauce or ketchup before baking, but I don't bother.
