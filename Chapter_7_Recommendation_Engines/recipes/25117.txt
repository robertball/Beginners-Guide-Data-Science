1 cup creamy peanut butter
1/4 cup shortening
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a medium bowl, cream together the peanut butter, shortening, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Stir in the water and baking mix. Mix in the chocolate chips. Roll into walnut sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheet. Flatten slightly with the tines of a fork.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Easy, delicious recipe for peanut butter chocolate chip cookies.  No one will ever know they took so little work.  I like them a little underbaked.
