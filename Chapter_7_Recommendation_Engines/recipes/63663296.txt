Ingredients:
1	cup orzo pasta
4	tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
3-4	tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
1 ½	cups sliced button mushrooms
2-3	cloves garlic, minced and divided
½	to ¾ cup minced green onions
1	to 2 cups coarsely chopped fresh baby spinach
Shredded Parmiggiano Reggiano  cheese (about ½ cup or more)
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1.	In a medium saucepan bring 4-5 cups of salted water to boil for the orzo.
2.	Meanwhile, while orzo is cooking, start a skillet over medium heat for the mushrooms.  Add 1 tablespoons of the olive oil, and 2 tablespoons butter, and 2 cloves of the garlic.  Stir in the mushrooms and toss to coat.  Let set and sauté until very browned and caramelized.  Then flip until both sides re very caramelized.
3.	when pasta is just about done, turn off the saucepan, and let set in the hot water until the mushrooms are ready.
4.	Once the mushrooms are ready, add the remainder of the butter and olive oil to the pan, and if you like more garlic flavor add the remainder of the garlic now.  Toss and cook a couple of seconds.  Then add pasta and maybe a little bit of the pasta water to the skillet with the mushrooms, and spinach;  add green onions and mix well.  Once warmed through and spinach is wilted, add the cheese and serve.
