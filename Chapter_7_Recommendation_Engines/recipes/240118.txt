Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 pound hot sausage
1 pound ground beef
2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup water
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 small jalapeno pepper, finely chopped (optional)
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and green bell pepper in hot oil until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Add sausage and ground beef to onion mixture; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Mix pinto beans, diced tomatoes, water, chili powder, jalapeno pepper, cayenne pepper, and salt into sausage-beef mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors have blended, about 1 hour.

Description: 
I won a chili cook-off with this recipe in Tennessee in 1996. My family and friends all love this chili. It is requested for all family get-togethers. Great dish for a chilly day. Serve with shredded cheese and crackers.
