Ingredients:
2 boneless duck breasts with skin on
2 tablespoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons cracked black pepper
3 tablespoons maple syrup
2 teaspoons maple syrup
maple wood chips

Directions:
1. Season duck breasts on all sides with salt and pepper. Place in a shallow dish, cover with 3 tablespoons maple syrup. Cover, place in refrigerator, allow to marinate 12-24 hours.
2. Preheat electric smoker according to manufacturer's directions to 225 degrees using maple wood chips.
3. Remove duck breasts from marinade, rinse well. Pat dry with paper towels. Using a sharp knife, cut shallow cross-hatch marks into the skin of the duck breasts. Do not cut all the way through to the meat. Brush with 2 teaspoons of maple syrup.
4. Place duck breasts, skin side up, on grill rack in the smoker. Place a drip pan beneath them. Smoke at 225 for 3-4 hours, adding more maple wood chips as necessary to keep smoke continuous, until duck breasts reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees. Cool to room temperature before slicing. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
