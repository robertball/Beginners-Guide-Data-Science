Ingredients:
2 pounds uncooked elbow macaroni
2 pounds ground beef
1 medium onion, chopped
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 (4 ounce) package feta cheese
2 (8 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
salt and pepper to taste
3 cups milk
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni noodles, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium-high heat until beef is evenly browned. Remove from heat, and drain grease. Stir in the tomatoes, feta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and cinnamon. Mix in pasta, and transfer to a large baking dish.
In a saucepan over medium heat, mix together the milk and cornstarch until no lumps remain. Add butter, and bring to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, then remove from heat, and pour the sauce over the mixture in the baking dish.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until the top is golden brown. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
