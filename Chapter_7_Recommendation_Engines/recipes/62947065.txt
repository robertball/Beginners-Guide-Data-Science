Step 4: Bake for 25-30 minutes and serve warm.

***Tip from Helen*** I prefer mid-sized red apples for this dish, but green will also be fine. Just they shouldn’t be too firm. Yellow apples won’t taste as good, because they will be too sweet and soft ***

Description: 
This recipe is as easy as it can only get. I think the hardest part is to take the apples’ seeds out, so that the apples would be intact.  

I am cooking these apples since the time I remember myself cooking. My Daddy cooks these apples in red wine, but, let’s not get too crazy here. I’m on a quest for a healthy, kid-friendly dessert.
