Ingredients:
1 8 oz package cream cheese
1 cup chocolate hazelnut spread (I used Jif's Mocha Cappuccino flavor)
1 Tbsp milk
1/2 Tbsp creme sherry (optional)

Directions:
In a bowl, use hand mixer to soften cream cheese. Add hazelnut spread, milk, and creme sherry. Continue to mix until well-blended and smooth.

Description: 
When I realized I had no frosting, pudding, or even whipped topping, I decided to make this one up! We love that it's not as super-sweet as most frostings.
