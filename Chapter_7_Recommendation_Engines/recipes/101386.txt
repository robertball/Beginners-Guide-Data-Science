Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) boneless pork loin chops, 1 1/4-inch thick
4 slices thick-cut bacon
Garlic-Mustard Butter:
1/4 cup butter, softened to room temperature
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 clove garlic, minced

Directions:
Dry the chops with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper. Wrap a strip of bacon around each one, securing with a toothpick. Cook as directed below to medium doneness. Remove toothpick; serve chops with Garlic-Mustard Butter (see directions below).
Broil: Broil 4 inches from heat source, 6-7 minutes. Turn and continue broiling to desired doneness, approximately 5-6 minutes until internal temperature on a thermometer reads 145 degrees.
Panbroil: Heat grill pan over high heat; add chops, lower heat to medium-high and cook for 6-7 minutes, until nicely browned. Turn and continue cooking for about 5-6 minutes until internal temperature on a thermometer reads 145 degrees F.
Grill: Prepare medium-hot fire in grill; grill chops over direct heat for 6-7 minutes; turn and grill 5-6 minutes until internal temperature on a thermometer reads 145 degrees F.
Garlic-Mustard Butter: In a small bowl, stir together ingredients until well mixed. Wrap in waxed paper to shape like a stick of butter. Chill while pork is cooking. When ready to serve, cut into fourths and top each pork mignon before serving.
