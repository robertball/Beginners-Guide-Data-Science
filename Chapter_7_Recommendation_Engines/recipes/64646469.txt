2 shallots, diced
1 small yellow onion, cut into thin strips
1/2 pound pancetta cut into strips or chopped

1 (16 ounce) package fettuccini pasta
3 egg yolks
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon
3/4 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Saut√© shallots until softened. Stir in onion and pancetta, and cook until bacon is evenly browned. Stir in garlic when pancetta is about half done. Remove from heat.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain pasta, and then return it to the pot.
In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks, cream, lemon juice and shredded Parmesan. Pour the bacon mixture over the pasta, and then stir in the cream mixture. Season with salt and pepper.
Garnish with fresh parsley.
