Ingredients:
1 cup black beans
1 cup quinoa cooked
1 teaspoon cumin
1/3 lime
1 tsp salt and pepper
1 tsp cayenne pepper
2 garlic cloves
1/3 yellow onion
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1 egg
6 large carrots
2 tablespoons  olive oil
½ teaspoon celtic sea salt

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 425 F.
Baked Carrot Oven French Fries: Cut each carrot into 2-inch long sections. Cut each section into thin sticks. In a large bowl toss carrot sticks with olive oil and salt. Spread out carrot sticks on a  parchment paper baking sheet. Bake at 425° for 18-22 minutes until carrots are browned.
Black Bean Quinoa Burgers: In a medium mixing bowl, mash the black beans with a fork. Mix with the quinoa, cumin, lime juice, salt, pepper, minced garlic cloves, yellow onion (finely diced) diced cilantro, Extra Virgin Olive Oil and egg. This will make 2-4 patties depending on how big you like them.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, fry the patties until they are nicely browned, about 5 minutes. Turn and fry the other side.
