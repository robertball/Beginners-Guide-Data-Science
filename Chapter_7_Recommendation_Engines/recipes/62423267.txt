Ingredients:
1 cup white rice (long grain or medium are just fine)
2 ½ cups water (or chicken broth)
1 8 oz. can tomato sauce
½ cup chopped onion
1 garlic clove roughly chopped
1 tsp salt (or to taste)
1 handful bunch cilantro (optional)
1 plum tomato sliced or chopped (optional)
1 tblsp oil (or enough to coat the bottom of a large 6 qt. stock pot)

Directions:
Heat oil on medium – high heat, add rice and stir around until slightly browned.  Add garlic to rice and oil and stir around until the rice and the garlic are both browned.  Add the can of tomato sauce…be careful it will create a lot of steam.  Add the rest of the ingredients.
Cook on high until it reaches a boil.  Once it reaches a boil, turn it down to low-medium heat, cover and allow it to simmer for 15-20 minutes.
Turn off heat and allow it to sit in the pot for a few minutes. (It is okay at this point to check for the rice consistency).
