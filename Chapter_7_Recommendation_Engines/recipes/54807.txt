Ingredients:
2 cups chicken broth
2 cups heavy cream
8 ounces linguine pasta
6 slices bacon
2 cups chopped cooked chicken
1 cup frozen English peas, thawed
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring chicken broth and cream to a boil in a heavy saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced by half, about 30 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine and cook 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and set aside in a large serving bowl.
Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
Once the cream has reduced, stir in crumbled bacon, chicken, peas, and Parmesan cheese; cook for a few minutes until hot. Pour sauce over pasta to serve.

Description: 
This is such an easy but fabulous recipe. My husband thinks it's better than most pasta dishes he has eaten in restaurants. Substitute shrimp for chicken, if you prefer. It's great either way.
