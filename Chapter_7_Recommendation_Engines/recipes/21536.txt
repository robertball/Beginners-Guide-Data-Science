Ingredients:
1 pound potatoes, peeled
2 slices bread, cubed
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 sprigs fresh cilantro, chopped
1 cup bread crumbs
1 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool.
Mash potatoes and bread cubes together in a large bowl. Mix in egg, salt, cayenne, jalapeno, and cilantro. Shape potato mixture into patties and coat with bread crumbs.
Heat oil in a large tall-sided skillet until almost smoking. Carefully slide cutlets into oil. Cook, turning once, until golden brown on both sides. Remove from heat and drain. Serve warm.
