Description: 
Tahini is a staple in Middle Eastern cooking. It's added to mashed garbanzo beans to make hummus, mixed with date paste, or drizzled with pekmez in Turkey for breakfast. It tastes great in sandwiches or baked into cookies. Really, there are many many uses for this tasty dip. Start with the freshest sesame seeds you can find.
