Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1 3/4 cups shortening
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
1 egg
1/2 cup ice water
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups pumpkin puree
3/4 cup honey
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup honey
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
To Make Pastry: In a large bowl, mix together flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 2 teaspoons salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse meal.
In a small bowl whisk together vinegar, 1 egg, and ice water. Pour into flour mixture and stir until dough forms a ball. Divide into 4 portions. Freeze 3 of them or use for other pies. Reserve one for Pilgrim Pumpkin Pie.
To Make Pumpkin Filling: In a large bowl, combine 2 beaten eggs, pumpkin, 3/4 cup honey or sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, cloves, and evaporated milk. Mix well.
Roll out pastry and fit into a 9 inch pie plate. Pour in pumpkin filling.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake an additional 45 minutes, until filling is set.
To Make Honey Ginger Cream: In a large bowl combine whipping cream, 1/4 cup honey, and 1/2 teaspoon ginger. Whip until soft peaks form. Chill 1 hour before serving. Place a spoonful on top of each slice of pie.

Description: 
My husband never liked pumpkin pie until he tasted mine.  I don't know what makes mine so different but here is the recipe. White sugar may be used in place of honey.
