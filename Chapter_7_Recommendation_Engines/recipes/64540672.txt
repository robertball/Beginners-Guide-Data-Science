While fish is cooking make the sauce:
Place the Knorr pod contents in a microwave safe bowl with the water and heat for 2 minutes.  Stir to dissolve pod. Set aside.
Place butter in large saute pan with the garlic.  Cook for a few minutes over medium heat or until garlic is golden.  Add flour and whisk until thickened. Whisk for another minute.
Add wine and while whisking add the broth.   Add the dill and bring sauce to a simmer.
