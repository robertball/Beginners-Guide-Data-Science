Ingredients:
1/2 cup ranch dressing
1 cucumber, sliced
1 (10 ounce) basket cherry tomatoes
1 yellow bell pepper, cut out 1 small triangle, and the rest into strips
2 carrots, cut into sticks
1/4 green bell pepper, cut into 2 triangles

Directions:
Use an oval platter for your veggie tray. Pour ranch dressing into 2 small bowls. Place 1 cherry tomato in the middle of each of the bowls of ranch dip to create the eyes. Set them toward the end of the oval platter. Place 2 green bell pepper pieces on top for the ears.
Use cucumber slices to make an oval-shaped body below the eyes. Place a row of cherry tomatoes around the cucumbers to outline the body. Place yellow bell peppers on the sides of the body as wings. Use carrot sticks for feet and side feathers.

Description: 
I made this  fun veggie plate for my daughter's birthday, and kids ate it up in no time. I now sometimes make it for play dates, and you'd be surprised how quickly kids will eat their veggies!
