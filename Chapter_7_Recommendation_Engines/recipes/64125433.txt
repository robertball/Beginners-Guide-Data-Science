Ingredients:
2 salmon steaks (about 6 oz each)
2 Tbs lemon juice
1/2 tsp dill weed
1/4 tsp sea salt (optional)
1 Tbs chives, minced
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350° F.
Place individual salmon steaks on pieces of aluminum foil large enough to wrap each steak.
Pour a tablespoon of lemon juice over each steak, sprinkle with dill, and sea salt (if desired).
Fold over the edges of foil to seal each steak in an aluminum pouch.
Place the sealed steaks in a glass dish and bake for 12-20 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.
Serve salmon with sprinkled chives and lime wedges.
