Ingredients:
1 cup cold butter
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
10 tablespoons sugar, divided

Directions:
In a large bowl, cut butter into flour until crumbly. Stir in sour cream and lemon peel until well blended. Place on a piece of waxed paper; shape into a 4-1/2-in. square. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Cut dough into four 2-1/4-in.  squares. Place one square on a piece of waxed paper sprinkled with 2 tablespoons sugar. Cover with another piece of waxed paper. Keep remaining squares refrigerated. Roll out dough into a 12-in. x 5-in. rectangle, turning often to coat with the sugar.
Lightly mark center of 12-in. side. Starting with a short side, roll up jelly-roll style to the center mark, peeling paper away while rolling. Repeat rolling from other short side, so the two rolls meet in the center and resemble a scroll.
Wrap well  in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Repeat with remaining squares, using 2 tablespoons sugar for each. chill for 1 hour.
Unwrap dough and cut into 1/2-in. slices; dip each side in remaining sugar. Place 2 in. apart on foil-lined baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 14 minutes or until golden brown. Turn cookies over; bake 5 minutes longer. Remove to wire racks to cool.
