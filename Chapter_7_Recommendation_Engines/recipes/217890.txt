Ingredients:
½ cup ranch dressing
¼ cup reduced-fat sour cream
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided
1 tablespoon mild chunky salsa
2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken
8 (6 inch) corn tortillas
shredded lettuce
1  tomato, chopped
4  green onions, sliced
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives
1  avocado - peeled, pitted and diced (optional)
1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Combine ranch dressing, sour cream, 1 teaspoon taco seasoning, and salsa in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until serving.
Toss chicken with remaining taco seasoning. Cover bowl loosely with wax paper or plastic wrap. Microwave chicken until chicken is heated through, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Warm the tortillas in a skillet for about a minute on each side to make them pliable. Place a scoop of chicken on the tortilla and top with lettuce, tomato, green onion, olives, avocado, cheese, and a spoonful of the ranch dressing mixture.

Description: 
A great change from regular Mexican style tacos. A cool summer dinner, made quick with leftover rotisserie chicken. Naturally you can use any type of chicken cooked the way you like; just be sure to shred it for real tacos.
