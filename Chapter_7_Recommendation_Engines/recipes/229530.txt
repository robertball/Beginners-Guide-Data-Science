Directions:
Gently poach salmon in lightly salted water. Drain and reserve. At the same time, cook beans in lightly salted boiling water until just tender. Drain and reserve with salmon, keeping both warm. Lightly toast almonds in a dry non-stick pan and reserve.
Peel skin from salmon, carefully flake flesh into large pieces and place in a bowl with arugula and cooked green beans. Grind peppercorns coarsely. Mix dressing ingredients together and pour over salad. Toss lightly. Transfer to serving bowls or plates. Top with toasted almonds and white pepper.
