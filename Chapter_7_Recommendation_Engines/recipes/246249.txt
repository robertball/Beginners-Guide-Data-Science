Ingredients:
4 potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
1/2 cup canola oil
2 teaspoons garam masala
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Combine oil, garam masala, and seasoned salt together in a large bowl. Add potato pieces and toss to coat. Spread on an ungreased baking sheet.
Broil potatoes in the preheated oven until starting to brown, about 7 minutes. Remove from oven and flip potatoes over. Return to the oven and continue broiling until golden brown, about 5 minutes more.
