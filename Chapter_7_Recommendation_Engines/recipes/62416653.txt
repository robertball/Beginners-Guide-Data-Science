Ingredients:
125 gms butter softened, plus 1 extra Tablespoon for greasing  - note that 1 Stick of butter is 110 gms, so add a further 1 Tablespoon to 1 Stick to get 125 gms!
150 gms Lavender sugar (see footnotes)
2 Eggs, beaten
400 gms (2 Cups) Blueberries, washed and dried
250 gms (1 3/4 Cups) Wholewheat flour
4 teaspoons baking powder (or 1 teaspoon if your flour is self-raising)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 180°C (360°F)
Take a 2&frac12; pound baking tin, grease it lightly with butter and line it with parchment
In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar, mixing thoroughly until pale and light in consistency
Add the beaten egg a bit at a time, thoroughly incorporating each bit before adding the next
Add in the berries, folding them in until mixed evenly and thoroughly
Sift in the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. If any pieces of bran remain in the sieve, you can add them as well.
Ensure that the final mixture is evenly and thoroughly combined
Pour the mixture into the loaf tin and put it into the oven
Bake for 50 to 60 minutes until risen and it feels firm.
Cool on a wire rack.
----
Your choice of icing (frosting), but a nice touch is to mix up a violet coloured one!
Serve with some lavender stalks as decoration.
