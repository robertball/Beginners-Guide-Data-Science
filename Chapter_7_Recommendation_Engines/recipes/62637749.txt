Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon ground coriander
1 can of black beans, drained and lightly rinsed
juice of one lime
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, plus extra for garnishing
1 chipotle chile in adobo sauce
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
kosher salt to taste
finely grated Monterrey Jack cheese, for garnishing

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until softened.  Add the garlic and cook for another 60 seconds.  Add the cumin and coriander and cook for 30 to 60 seconds, until fragrant.  Remove from the heat.
In a food processor, combine the remaining ingredients.  Add the spiced onion mixture.  Process until smooth.  Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.
To serve warm:  Add the pureed dip back to the large skillet and warm over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes.  Remove to a serving dish, garnish with the parsley and the cheese, and let the dip sit for 20 minutes (if you have the time) to allow the flavors to blend. Also may be served at room temperature.
