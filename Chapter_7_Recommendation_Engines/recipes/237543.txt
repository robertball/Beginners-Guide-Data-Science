Ingredients:
3 (16 ounce) packages dried lima beans
water to cover
2 1/2 pounds fully-cooked pork sausage, cut into 2-inch pieces
2 tablespoons red pepper flakes

Directions:
Place lima beans in a large pot with enough water to cover by 2 inches; bring to a boil. Remove pot from heat and let stand for 2 hours. Drain and rinse beans under cold water.
Transfer beans back to large pot and pour in enough water to cover; add sausage and red pepper flakes. Bring water to a boil, decrease heat, and simmer, adding water as needed to keep beans from sticking to the bottom, until beans are tender and liquid has thickened, 1 to 2 hours.
