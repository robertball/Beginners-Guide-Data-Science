Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds zucchini, grated
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 large egg, beaten
2 cloves garlic, minced
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Toss zucchini and salt together in a large colander and place in sink to drain for 10 minutes.
Put zucchini in the middle of a piece of cheesecloth; wrap cheesecloth around zucchini and squeeze to drain as much moisture from zucchini as possible.
Mix flour, Parmesan cheese, egg, garlic, kosher salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Stir in zucchini.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Scoop batter by the tablespoon into the hot skillet and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.
