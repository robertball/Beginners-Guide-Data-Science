Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 (8 ounce) package yellow rice mix
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 large green bell peppers, tops and seeds removed
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans, or as needed
1 (11 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
1/4 (8 ounce) jar salsa
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican blend cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan and stir in yellow rice mix and olive oil; boil for 1 minute. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, about 25 minutes.
Spoon 3 tablespoons yellow rice into the bottom of each pepper. Cover rice with layers of refried beans, corn, and black olives, filling peppers almost to the top. Spoon salsa into peppers. Stand stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are tender and filling is hot, about 30 minutes. Divide Mexican cheese blend over the peppers, return to oven, and bake until cheese has melted, about 5 more minutes.

Description: 
I'm not a big fan of traditional stuffed peppers, so I make mine Mexican-style! This dish was inspired by the Mexican seven-layer dip. I love to make them on Halloween and carve them to look like jack-o'-lanterns. Serve topped with sour cream and guacamole.
