Ingredients:
12 digestive biscuits (such as McVitie'sÂ®), crushed
5 teaspoons unsalted butter, melted
1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese
1/2 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree, stirred smooth
1/2 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
24 whole pecans (optional)

Directions:
Place crushed biscuits into a bowl and pour melted butter over them; mix until combined and the crust mixture holds together.
Combine mascarpone cheese, pumpkin puree, sweetened condensed milk, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a large bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until filling is smooth and airy.
Line 24 cups of a mini-muffin pan with paper liners. Press 1 teaspoon of crust mixture into the bottom of each cup. Spoon 1 teaspoon filling over each crust and smooth the top. Place a pecan on top of each.
Chill cheesecakes in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
