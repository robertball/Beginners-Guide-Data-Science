Ingredients:
1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup wheat germ
1/3 cup brown sugar, packed
1/4 cup white granulated sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 TBSP baking powder
1 lg egg
3/4 cup peanut butter (creamy or crunchy, your choice)
6 TBSP butter or margarine, melted
1 cup milk
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup jelly or jam of choice (strawberry is ours!)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees & line muffin pan with cupcake papers.
In large bowl combine dry ingredients.  In mixing bowl, blend peanut butter with egg & milk.  Add melted butter & vanilla.  After mixing well, pour into dry ingredients and stir by hand to mix.  Batter will be very stiff.
Fill 1/3 of each muffin cup with batter (heaped tablespoon), use the back of a spoon to make a dimple in the center of each and put about a teaspoon of jelly/jam into it.  Add another heaped tablespoon of batter on top of each muffin and spread slightly to gently cover the jelly so not visible.
Bake 20 minutes.  Caution:  centers will be very hot!
