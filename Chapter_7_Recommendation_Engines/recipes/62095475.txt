Ingredients:
4 chicken breasts
4 slices of thick cut bacon
4 sprigs of fresh rosemary
4 teaspoons of garlic powder
Salt and pepper

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium-high.
Trim any extra fat off chicken breasts.
Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of garlic powder on each chicken breast.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.
Lay one sprig of rosemary on each chicken breast.  Wrap the bacon around in a spiral lengthwise to hold the rosemary on.  Secure bacon with toothpick or thick rosemary stem.
Lightly grease grill.  Grill for 8 minutes on each side, or until cooked through and juices run clear.  Stay near the grill to combat any flare ups from the bacon.
Serve- removing toothpicks.  You may keep the rosemary sprig on or remove depending on preference.  Great with grilled vegetables and rice.

Description: 
This recipe goes together so easy with minimal prep. Chicken breasts with garlic powder, bacon, and rosemary are grilled.  What could be better? I'm always thinking up easy rosemary recipes, since my yard has 5 huge bushes of rosemary!  Enjoy!
