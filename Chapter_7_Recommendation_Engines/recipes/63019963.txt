Ingredients:
2 TB canola oil
2 lbs stewing beef (if you want to chop a "steak", that's fine. I am too lazy for that. LOL)
1 head green cabbage
3 carrots
1/2 large yellow onion (if you want to use a whole one, that's fine. I don't like onion much)
5 large red potatoes
1 cup red wine
1 cup low sodium V8 juice
1 TB paprika
few pinches of ground black pepper
few small pinches of salt
2 bay leaves (to be removed when done cooking)

Directions:
brown beef in canola oil in a large pot until mostly cooked. remove and sautee all vegetables until soft (potatoes won't be close to done, but they will be started). put beef back into pot with vegetables and add all other ingredients.
bring to boil.
reduce heat to simmer for 45-60 minutes.
potatoes should be so soft they break with a fork without any effort.
