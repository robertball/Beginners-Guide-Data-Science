Description: 
Beans and ham and kale cooked together to make a fragrant and hearty soup.  I discovered this recipe in an attempt to find ways to use up the kale in my garden. I threw the ham bone left over from Thanksgiving in the pot too to boost the flavor.   It is terrific with parmesan cheese sprinkled on it and a crusty loaf of bread.
