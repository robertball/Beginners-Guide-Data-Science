Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable oil for frying
1 (12 ounce) jar peach preserves
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
2 tablespoons prepared spicy mustard
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
2 large eggs
1 cup beer
2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix the peach preserves, horseradish, and mustard together in a small bowl until well blended; set aside.
Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, basil, eggs, and beer in a large bowl until smooth.
Add the shrimp in batches to the batter, turning to coat.
Remove with a slotted spoon, shaking off excess batter.
Fry the shrimp in the preheated oil until golden, about 2 minutes.
Transfer the fried shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
Serve with the peach sauce.
