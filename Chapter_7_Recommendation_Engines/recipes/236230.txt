Ingredients:
7 tomatoes, or more to taste
1 sweet onion, chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons dried basil
1 tablespoon chives
1 pinch grated orange zest
1 pinch grated lemon zest
2 potatoes, diced, or more to taste
4 crimini mushrooms, or more to taste
1 1/2 cups cooked black beans, or to taste
2 teaspoons salt (optional)

Directions:
Puree tomatoes in a food processor.
Pour pureed tomatoes into a large pot and place over medium heat. Stir onion, garlic, basil, chives, orange zest, and lemon zest into the tomatoes; cook at a simmer until slightly frothy, 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir potatoes, mushrooms, black beans, and salt into the tomato mixture; continue simmering until the potatoes are tender, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
Simple, healthy soup with no necessary extra salt, sugar, oils, or processed food or what not. I had the idea for the recipe while reading Dr. Neil Fuhrman's book 'Eat to Live,' where he suggested making your own tomato paste with tomatoes, garlic, and onions; I figured that'd make an excellent soup base! It also goes wonderfully with fresh biscuits.
