Ingredients:
3 (12 ounce) packages refrigerated biscuit dough
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 cup margarine
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup animal crackers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease mini bundts.
Mix white sugar and cinnamon in a plastic bag. Cut biscuits into quarters. Shake 6 to 8 biscuit pieces in the sugar cinnamon mix. Arrange pieces in the bottom of the prepared pans. Continue until all biscuits are coated and placed in pans.
In a small saucepan, melt the margarine with the brown sugar over medium heat. Boil for 1 minute. Pour over the biscuits.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 - 30 minutes. Let bread cool in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a plate. Place animal cookies on mini loafs. Do not cut! The bread just pulls apart.

Description: 
I love to make my family Monkey Bread on Sunday mornings. When I make it, I make mini loafs and then the kids get one with little animal shaped crackers on it. They love seeing the animals peaking out from the cracks.Modified from: Monkey Bread I
