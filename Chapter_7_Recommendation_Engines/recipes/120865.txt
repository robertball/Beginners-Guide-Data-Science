Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups bread flour
1 1/4 cups instant mashed potato flakes, divided
3 tablespoons sugar
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2 teaspoons salt
2 cups milk
1/2 cup butter or margarine
4 green onions, sliced
2 eggs
all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour, 1 cup potato flakes, sugar, yeast and salt. In a saucepan, heat the milk, butter and onions to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until moistened. Add eggs; beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Turn onto a floured surface; divide into 24 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Dip each ball into remaining potato flakes. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool.
