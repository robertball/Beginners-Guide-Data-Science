Ingredients:
2/3 cup cocoa, sifted
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant coffee granules
1 1/2 cups unsweetened orange juice (or use 3/4 cup each juice and water or 1-1/2 cups water)
3 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 1/4 cups canola oil or vegetable oil

Directions:
Set oven to 350 degrees F.
Set rack to second-lowest position.
Generously grease and flour a 12-cup bundt pan (I use my Pan Release for this, make certain to well-grease your pan!).
In an extra large mixing bowl, combine all the cake ingredients; mix on medium speed of an electric mixer for about 3 minutes or until very well combined.
Bake for about 50-60 minutes or until the cake tests done (if using the streusal the cake will take slightly longer to bake).
Cool in pan for about 15-20 minutes before removing.
Frost or glaze if desired when completely cooled.
STREUSAL; this is only optional and may be sprinkled in the middle of the batter, mix together 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts with 1/4 cup shredded coconut, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1-1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder.

Description: 
OMG this is good! So simple to make and so moist, chocolatey and delicous! It stuck to my bundt pan like crazy, but I always have trouble with that pan. I also didn't have orange juice, so used orange sun quick drink I had in fridge. Tasted like one of those chocolate oranges!
