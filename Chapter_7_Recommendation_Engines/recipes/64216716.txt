Ingredients:
- 2 Lbs. skinless boneless Chicken breasts
- 1/2 Cup Flour
- 1 Tbsp. Garlic powder
- 1 Tbsp. Onion powder
- 1 Tbsp. Paprika
- 1 Tbsp. Poultry Seasoning (or any you like)
- salt/pepper
- 6 small Red potatoes
- small container of Mushrooms, sliced
- 3 green onions/scallions, diced
- 3 garlic cloves, diced
- Olive oil
- 1 Tbsp. of Butter
- 1 small can of condensed Cream of Chicken soup or Cream of Mushroom soup
- 1 Cup Low-Sodium Chicken Broth
- 1/2 Cup of Sherry cooking wine (you can use Any wine as I did in the past, same results)
- 1 bag. Fresh Spinach (or thaw frozen)
- 1 (8 oz.) bag Mozzarella Cheese (or Any cheese)
- 1/2 Cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese

Directions:
In the large plastic bag, add: flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, poultry seasoning and salt/pepper. Trim and cut the chicken into thick strips and add to the bag. Toss to coat well. Shake off excess.
In the skillet, heat Olive oil over Med-Hi heat. Brown chicken on both sides until almost done. Transfer chicken to an oiled baking dish.
I've used previously boiled small red potatoes or you can brown the potatoes in the skillet until almost done. Transfer to a baking dish.
Add more oil and butter to the skillet and sauté the mushrooms for 2 minutes. Then add diced green onions and garlic, sauté until garlic is browned. Add cream of chicken soup, broth and wine. Bring to boil and mix well until the sauce thickens. Add bag of spinach and mix until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat.
Pour the sauce on top of the chicken and potatoes.  Top with Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
Preheat oven to 350F. Bake Covered with foil for 20 min. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes.
