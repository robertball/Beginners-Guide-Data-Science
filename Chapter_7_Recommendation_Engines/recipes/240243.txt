Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
2 tablespoons coconut oil
4 cups sliced crimini ('baby bella') mushrooms
1/2 large yellow onion, thinly sliced
1 large red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
salt to taste
1/4 cup red wine
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Mix water, quinoa, 1 tablespoon coconut oil, and chicken bouillon granules in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until white threads appear on the quinoa grains, about 15 minutes.
Melt 2 tablespoons coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms, onion, and red bell pepper in hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt.
Stir red wine and soy sauce into the vegetable mixture; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the liquid is reduced, about 10 minutes.
Mix quinoa and vegetables in a large serving bowl; top with Parmesan cheese.
