Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 teaspoon green food coloring
1/4 cup coarsely chopped pistachios

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, beat butter until softened.  Add sugar and beat until fluffy.  Add egg, vanilla and almond extract and beat well.
Stir together flour, baking powder and salt.     Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until well mixed.
Divide the dough in half and stir food coloring into one half.  Cover and chill at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
On a lightly floured surface, roll about 1/2 tablespoon of plain dough into a 6-inch rope.  Repeat with green dough.
Place ropes side by side and twist together about 6 times.   Form twisted ropes into a circle and gently pinch ends together.
Place on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Repeat with remaining dough, leaving 2 inches between cookies.  Place small amount of chopped pistachios onto each wreath where ends are pinched together.
Bake for about 10 minutes.  Cool on cookie sheet for about 1 minute. Remove and cool thoroughly on rack.
