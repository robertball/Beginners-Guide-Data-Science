Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup thick, unsweetened applesauce
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup raisins
2 cups packed brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
2/3 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8 inch square pan with parchment paper.

Cream shortening and sugar until fluffy, add eggs and beat well. Fold in applesauce and flour mixture. Mix well. Fold in raisins.
Pour batter into a parchment-lined 8 inch square pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45  to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool to room  temperature before frosting.
