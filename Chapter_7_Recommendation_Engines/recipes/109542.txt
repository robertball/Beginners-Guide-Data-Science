Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) can spicy fat-free refried beans*
1 cup salsa, divided
1 (12 inch) pre-baked Italian pizza crust
2 cups shredded hearts of romaine lettuce
3 medium green onions, thinly sliced
1/4 cup ranch dressing
1/4 cup crumbled tortilla chips
1 cup shredded pepper Jack or Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to lowest position, and heat oven to 450 degrees. Mix beans and 1/2 cup salsa in a medium bowl. Place crust on a cookie sheet, then spread the bean mixture over crust. Bake until it's crisp and warm, about 10 minutes.
Remove from oven; top with lettuce, green onions and dollop with the remaining salsa. Drizzle (or, if dressing has an easy-pour top, squirt) dressing over pizza. Top with chips and cheese, then return to oven and bake until the cheese melts, about 2 minutes longer. Cut into 6 slices and serve.
