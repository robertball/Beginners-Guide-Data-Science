Title:
Teriyaki Cobb Salad Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
4 ounces maple-cured bacon
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
½ cup thick teriyaki sauce
½ cup blue cheese salad dressing, or to taste
2 tablespoons milk, or as needed
1 head red leaf lettuce, torn into bite-size pieces
4  vine-ripened tomatoes, cut into wedges
2  avocados, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

Directions:
Cook bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crispy, about 3 minutes per side. Remove and let cool.
Cook and stir chicken and teriyaki sauce in the same skillet until chicken no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let cool, about 15 minutes.
Whisk blue cheese dressing with milk in a large bowl to a consistency that will toss well with the salad. Add bacon, teriyaki chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocados. Toss thoroughly until salad is evenly mixed.

Description: 
This is our personal twist on the cobb salad. We cook the chicken in teriyaki sauce for a surprisingly good flavor combination.
