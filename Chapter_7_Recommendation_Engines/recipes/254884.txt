Ingredients:
1 cup sugar-based curing mixture (such as Morton® Tender Quick®)
1/4 cup liquid smoke, or more to taste
1 (12 pound) thawed whole turkey, neck and giblets removed
2 tablespoons cooking oil

Directions:
Combine curing mixture and liquid smoke together in a bowl; mix into a paste. Pat paste on inside and outside of turkey. Place turkey in a resealable plastic bag; refrigerate for 24 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Wash turkey inside and out with cold water; dry. Pat with cooking oil. Place turkey in an oven bag; poke holes into bag for ventilation according to manufacturer's instructions. Set bagged turkey into a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Reduce heat to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Bake until turkey comes easily off the bone and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 6 hours.
