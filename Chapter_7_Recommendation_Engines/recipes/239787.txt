Description: 
This gorgeous salsa would shine on any big-game snack table. The fire-roasting brings out a tremendous amount of flavor and provides just the right touch of smoky goodness. I'm sure your friends are more than happy with the jarred stuff, but once in a while it's nice to see if they're paying attention.
