Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp allspice
1/3 cup oil
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 large apple, peeled, cored and diced
1 cup Amish Friendship Bread Starter
1 cup rolled oats
3/4 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped
1 cup currants

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325° F (165° C).
In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients.
In another bowl, cream oil and brown sugar. Add eggs, applesauce, apples and starter. Combine thoroughly.
Stir oats, walnuts and currants into dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients to dry and combine just enough to moisten all.
Spoon into greased pans that have been dusted with a cinnamon-sugar mixture of 1/2 cup sugar and 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon.
Bake for 45 minutes or until the bread loosens evenly from the sides and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.
