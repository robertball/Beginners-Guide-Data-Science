Description: 
Hummus is very easy to customize and make your own. As long as you use the base of garbanzo beans, tahini, lime/lemon juice, substitutions and customizations can be successfully made. This recipe makes a thai-curry-flavored hummus with a nice amount of heat. Very good with pita and fresh raw veggies such as carrots or broccoli.
