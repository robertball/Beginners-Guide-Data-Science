Ingredients:
CAKE INGREDIENTS:
3 eggs
1 banana (pealed and previously frozen)
1 yellow cake mix
1 15-20 oz. can Apple Pie Filling
MARBLED SPICE INGREDIENTS:
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 Tablespoon cinnamon
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1/2 cup chopped pecans
ICING INGREDIENTS:
3/4 cup powdered sugar
5 teaspoons milk

Directions:
Using an electric mixer:  Mix the thawed banana and the eggs together until they are liquified.  Add the dry cake mix to the banana and egg mixture and blend until smooth.  Pour the batter into a greased 9" x 13" baking dish.
In a separate bowl, mix the "Topping Ingredients" together.  Sprinkle the topping mixture over the top of the batter and 'marble' in into the batter.
Bake at 350-degrees for 60 minutes.
Mix the icing while the cake is baking.  As soon as the cake is finished baking, drizzle the icing over the top of the cake.  Let the cake cool, then refrigerate it covered.

Description: 
This recipe came to me by way of my brother.  I enjoyed it at his home and asked for the recipe. It has become a standard dessert in our home.  I enjoy it plain and sometimes I warm it up and put a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on it.  Either way, it is delicious.
