Ingredients:
4 slices Italian bread
4 slices ripe tomato
4 leaves fresh basil
4 slices fresh mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Lay the 4 slices of Italian bread out on the prepared baking sheet; top each piece of bread with a tomato slice, a basil leaf, and a slice of mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted, about 7 minutes. Drizzle each sandwich with 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

Description: 
This is a good way to use up some leftover Italian bread -- or any bread for that matter. Fresh mozzarella melted over vine ripe tomatoes and basil, then drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Yummy! A nice glass of red wine and you're in heaven! Enjoy with a nice salad or a cup of soup; makes a lovely lunch or afternoon snack.
