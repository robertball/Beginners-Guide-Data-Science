Ingredients:
2/3 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
2 cubes chicken bouillon
4 whole cardamom pods, broken
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup water
ground nutmeg to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup water
1 large onion, cut into wedges
3 lamb shanks
1 (15 ounce) can carrots, drained
1 (15 ounce) can whole new potatoes, drained
1/2 pound button mushrooms, quartered (optional)

Directions:
Stir the sour cream and all-purpose flour together in a small bowl until smooth and set aside. In a separate small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and water to make a paste.
Combine the chili powder, coriander, ginger, bouillon cubes, cardamom, tomatoes, water, nutmeg, salt and pepper in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat. Slowly add the cornstarch paste to the tomato mixture, stirring constantly; simmer for 2 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and slowly stir in the sour cream and flour mixture.
Arrange the onions across the bottom of a slow cooker, lay the shanks on top of the onions and pour the prepared tomato mixture over the meat. Place the carrots, potatoes and mushrooms on top of the sauce.
Cover and cook in the slow cooker on High for 8 hours.

Description: 
This lamb shank recipe was initially given to me as a family favorite from a work buddy.  I've prepared it in a slow cooker and made it as easy as possible to prepare.  It has a fantastic flavour and the meat just falls off the bone.  I have made this in the oven as well and doubled the quantities for 4 people and it tasted just as good, only everybody went in for seconds and there were no leftovers.
