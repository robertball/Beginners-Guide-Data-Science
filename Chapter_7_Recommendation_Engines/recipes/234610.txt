Ingredients:
1 cup MUSSELMAN'S® Apple Butter
1 cup flour
1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats
3/4 cup light brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat an 8x8-inch baking pan with vegetable cooking spray. Line with heavy-duty foil, leaving an overhang on two sides to facilitate removal of bars from pan. Coat foil with cooking spray.
Mix flour, oatmeal, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir in butter with a fork until well mixed and clumps form, and then spread half the oatmeal mixture over foiled pan bottom, pressing to form a thin crust.
Spread apple butter over crust and then sprinkle remaining oatmeal mixture on top.
Bake until crisp and golden brown, 30-40 min.
Cool to room temperature. Use foil handles to remove bars from pan. Cut into squares and serve.
