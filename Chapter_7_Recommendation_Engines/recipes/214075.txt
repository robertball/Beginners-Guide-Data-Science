Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skinned salmon fillet, cut into 4-inch pieces
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves garlic, crushed
salt to taste
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles
2 tablespoons salted butter
1/2 cup chopped fresh sage
2 cloves crushed garlic
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 cups frozen peas, thawed
1 lime, juiced
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 lime, juiced

Directions:
Place the salmon pieces into a mixing bowl. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, then toss with 4 cloves of crushed garlic. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place the salmon onto the foil, and season with salt and thyme. Fold the foil over the salmon to form a sealed pouch. Bake in the preheated oven until the salmon is no longer translucent in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink, then return to the cooking pot.
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the butter has browned lightly. Stir in the sage and garlic until the sage has wilted. Stir in 1 tablespoon of olive oil ,the frozen peas, the juice of 1 lime, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. Stir into the pasta, and place into a serving bowl. Remove the salmon from the foil, and place onto the pasta. Squeeze another lime over top to serve.
