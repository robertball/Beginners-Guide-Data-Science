Ingredients:
3 small potatoes, scrubbed
1 tbsp. olive oil
1 tsp. curry powder
1/2 tsp. dried parsley
salt to taste
nonfat cooking spray (such as Pam)

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium high heat for several minutes while scrubbing potatoes.  Do not peel the potatoes.  Chop potatoes into french-fry sized pieces (not thick french fries).  Spray skillet with cooking spray, then add olive oil.  Turn heat down to medium.  Add curry powder and parsley.  Then add potatoes and salt.  Stir and saute potatoes for about 10 minutes over medium heat, or until done.  While cooking, continue to lightly spray skillet and potatoes with cooking spray to keep them from sticking to skillet and to add moisture.
