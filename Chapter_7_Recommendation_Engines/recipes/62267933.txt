Debby's Delicious Pumpkin Bread Recipe

Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups sifted all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 cups tightly packed brown sugar
1 1/2 cups white granulated sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 cups canned pumpkin (1 regular size can)
4 eggs
1 cup oil
2/3 cup water
1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)
1/2 to 1 cup raisins or chopped dates (optional)
cinnamon/sugar (for coating pans)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease loaf pans (or spray with cooking spray) and sprinkle generously with cinnamon/sugar.  This recipe will make 2 large loaves (regular loaf pans), 3 medium loaves, or 6 small loaves.
Combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the center.  Add eggs, oil, water and pumpkin.  Beat well.  Stir in nuts and dates or raisins by hand.
Pour into prepared loaf pans.  For large loaves, bake 1 hour and 15 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  It may take a little longer to cook, but I start checking after 1 hour and 15 minutes.  For medium loaves, I start checking after about an hour.  For small loaves, I start checking after about 35-40 minutes.  It really depends on the size of your loaf pans.
Let the loaf pans cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes.  Remove bread from pans.  Let bread cool an additional 10-15 minutes.  Wrap loaves in aluminum foil while bread is still warm.

Description: 
My cousin, Debby, gave me this recipe over 25 years ago.  It is wonderful (and will make your house smell wonderful).  Moist, sweet, and spicy.  Baking the bread in pans sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar rather than dusted with flour adds a special touch. As a bonus, it is also easy.
