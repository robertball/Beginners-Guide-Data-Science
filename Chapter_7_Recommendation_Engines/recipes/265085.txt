Ingredients:
4 cups water
1/2 cinnamon stick
2 1/4 cups uncooked white rice
4 cups whole milk
4 cups evaporated milk
1 1/4 cups white sugar
ground cinnamon (optional)

Directions:
Combine water and cinnamon stick in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil and cook until cinnamon releases its color and flavor, about 5 minutes. Add rice, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Gradually add whole milk to rice, then evaporated milk. Stir in sugar. Cook uncovered until sugar is dissolved and mixture has thickened, about 10 minutes.
Serve warm or cold. Sprinkle each portion with ground cinnamon.
