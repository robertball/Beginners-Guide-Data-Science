Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup shortening
1/2 white chocolate, chopped
1/3 cup blueberries
1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place 2 cups flour, baking powder, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor or blender; pulse a few times to combine. Add shortening; pulse until mixture has the consistency of fine crumbs.
Place flour mixture in a bowl; stir in white chocolate, blueberries, and orange zest. Stir milk into flour mixture gradually to form a smooth batter. Turn mixture out onto a floured board; sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup flour. Knead a few times to incorporate flour and form a smooth dough.
Roll dough out 1/2-inch thick; cut scones with a biscuit cutter to desired size. Place scones on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes.
