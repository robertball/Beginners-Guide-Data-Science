Ingredients:
2 teaspoons butter
2 eggs
salt to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/4 pound beef chorizo
2 cups potato chips (such as Lay'sÂ®)
1 slice smoked sharp Cheddar cheese, torn into pieces
1 pinch dried oregano

Directions:
Heat butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Gently crack eggs into pan and cook, undisturbed, just until whites turn opaque, about 2 minutes. Season eggs with salt and cayenne pepper; flip, taking care to not break yolks, and cook until set, about 30 seconds.
Cook chorizo in a skillet over medium-high heat until browned, about 10 minutes.
Arrange potato chips on a plate and lay eggs over top. Cover eggs and chips with chorizo and top with Cheddar cheese and oregano.
