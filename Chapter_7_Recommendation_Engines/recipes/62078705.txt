Ingredients:
3 chicken thighs
3 medium potatos (regular, sweet or both)
5-6 carrots
1 onion
2 cloves garlic
2 cans chicken broth
1 T. parsley
2 t. rosemary
1 t. freshly cracked pepper
2 t. chicken bullion
1/3 C. butter
1/3 C. flour
water

Directions:
Remove skin and fat from chicken thighs, and place on the bottom of a 4 qt. slow cooker.
Wash and chop into cubes potatos, carrots and onion and layer into cooker.  Mince garlic and sprinkle on top.
Add spices and pour broth over top.  Liquid should come ALMOST to the top of the vegetables.  If not, top up with more broth or water.
Set cooker to high and cook for about 4 hours.
After 4 hours, pour contents through a colander over a large bowl.  The chicken should be right on top and can be easily de-boned on a cutting board with a knife and fork.
The chicken, broth and vegetables can now be mixed back together and eaten as a clear soup OR:
Melt 1/3 C. butter in a heavy bottomed pot.  Add 1/3 C. flour and whisk smooth.  Cook for 3 min., stiring constantly.  Add 2 C.  stock, and whisk until smooth.  Add remaining stock and bring to a simmer. Check taste, add veggies and chicken, and serve with crusty french bread or corn bread!

Description: 
This is an easy way to fix a yummy stew!  It can be served as a clear soup or, for an extra 10 min, a creamy stew.  Thighs are used for that dark-meat flavor, and are easy to de-bone after they are cooked!
