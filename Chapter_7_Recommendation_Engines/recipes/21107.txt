Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups vegetable oil
2 cups white sugar
3 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups apple - peeled, cored and diced
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup margarine
1 cup light brown sugar
2/3 cup evaporated milk
chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 inch pans. Mix together the flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, sugar, eggs and vanilla.  Stir in the flour mixture, then fold in the apples and walnuts.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
To make the frosting:    In a saucepan, melt the butter and brown sugar over medium heat.  Stir in the evaporated milk.  Bring mixture to a boil, then cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.  Allow mixture to cool, then fill and frost cake layers.  Sprinkle with walnuts, if desired.
