Description: 
'I found the recipe for these cute crisp appetizers in an old cookbook several years ago,' writes Phyllis Pollock of Erie, Pennsylvania. 'They're fun to serve because people inevitably ask, 'What's in this?' Make sure your cucumber slices are dry so the fruit mixture will stick to the tops.'
