Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups butter
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon peppermint extract
3 drops red food coloring
3 drops green food coloring

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cream together the butter or margarine, confectioner's sugar, flour and peppermint extract.  Mix well.
Separate dough into two equal parts, put into separate bowls and  tint with food-coloring.  Roll dough into SMALL balls, approximately 1/2 tsp per cookie.  Place six balls in a circle, alternating colors  onto cookie sheet.
Bake for 8 minutes.    NOTE:  I guess you could omit peppermint flavoring or substitute it, but we like  peppermint, so I have not tried variations or substitutions .
