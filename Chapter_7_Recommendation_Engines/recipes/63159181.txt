Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs - cubed
1 cup sliced carrots
1 stalk celery, sliced
1 cup frozen green peas
1/2 cup sliced potatoes
3 teaspoons chicken bouillon
1/3 cup butter
1 whole onion, chopped
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 1/2 cups milk
2 (9 inch)  unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Trim tendons and excess fat from chicken.
In a soup pot, combine chicken, carrots, peas, celery and chicken bouillon. Add 4 cups water to cover and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain, reserving 3 1/2 cups liquid, and set aside.
In the soup pot over medium heat, cook onions in butter until soft and translucent. Stir in flour, salt and pepper. Slowly stir in reserved broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
Place the chicken mixture in bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
