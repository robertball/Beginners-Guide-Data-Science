Ingredients:
2 tbsp unsalted butter
1 cup white sugar
1 tbsp blackstrap molasses
2 cups + 1 tbsp apple cider, divided
1/4 cinnamon stick
1 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp corn starch

Directions:
Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. When the butter has begun to bubble, add the sugar and the molasses. Stir until the sugar has absorbed the molasses and the butter. The mixture will be very dry. Add the 2 cups of apple cider. Mix well and bring to a slow boil. Add the 1/4 cinnamon stick. Continue to simmer for about 10 minutes.
In a small bowl, whisk together 1 tbsp apple cider, 1 tbsp lemon juice, and 2 tbsp cornstarch.
Whisk the syrup continuously while pouring in the cornstarch slurry. Whisk until the mixture is fully incorporated. Simmer until thickened and the consistency is similar to warm maple syrup. The syrup will thicken upon cooling.
Serve warm. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three weeks.
