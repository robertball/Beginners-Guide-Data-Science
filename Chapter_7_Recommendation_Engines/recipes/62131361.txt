Ingredients:
1 lb. skinned & deveined calf's liver
4 lg. Sweet Vidalia onions, thinly sliced
olive oil (for sauteeing)
4 T. butter
3 T. finely chopped red & green bell pepper (opt)
1/2 c. fresh sliced mushrooms (opt)
2 c. cold water
1/4 c. flour
2 t. beef bouillon granules
generous splash red wine
salt & pepper, to taste

Directions:
Heat large frying pan over medium heat. (I use a chicken frying pan.) Add olive oil. Saut√© onions, garlic (along with green peppers & mushrooms, if using) until onions are translucent. Season to taste with salt & pepper. Push onions to one side.
Add butter to center of pan. Add liver, one slice at a time. Cover and cook until lightly browned on one side. Turn & cook, covered, a few minutes more, until desired doneness. (Liver cooks quickly, so keep an eye on it.)  Cut each slice liver in half.
Mix flour, water and beef bouillon granules in large jar with tight fitting lid. (I use a clean mayonnaise jar.)  Vigorously hake jar to blend ingredients; pour into pan. Cook, stirring, over medium heat until gravy thickens. Add a splash of red wine and cook a couple more minutes. Remove from heat and serve. Goes great with corn casserole and garlic mashed potatoes, or freshly sliced tomatoes and corn-on-the-cob. Serves 4.
