In skillet, cook bacon 'till crisp-done, remove from pan with slotted spoon & add pieces to beans.
To bacon drippings, add onion, celery, garlic, jalapeno & red pepper flakes.
Sautee on med. heat 'till onion is limp & translucent, then add all to beans.
Simmmer beans 1 1/2 hours or 'till tender, adding water if and when needed.
Remove, with slotted spoon, 1 1/2 cups beans to bowl & mash with fork or potato masher.
Remove bay leaves and discard.
Add remaining seasonings to bean pot & stir well.
Add mashed beans to pot & blend mashed beans into mixture very well (this gives the signature creamy texture).
Bring back to simmer, taste & adjust seasonings as needed.

Description: 
My mother-in-law is from New Orleans & grew up with this dish...Even she loves my beans!   Although it makes a good amount, it never lasts long!   Keep in mind, this is meant to be served with almost equal amounts of rice.   These beans are very seasoned, spicy & very RICH!   HINT:  I cut my bacon frozen before I cook it to save time.  You can also substitute a nice ham bone or some good spicy sausage...or all of the above!  Enjoy!
