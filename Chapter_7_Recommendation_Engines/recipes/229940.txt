Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - trimmed and pounded thin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
⅓ cup butter
¾ cup ranch dressing
½ cup Dijon mustard
⅓ cup dry white wine
10 ounces angel hair pasta
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil and set heat to medium-low; keep the water at a low boil while you complete remaining steps.
Sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and black pepper. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat and cook chicken breasts in the hot butter until browned and no longer pink inside, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a platter, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm.
Whisk ranch dressing and Dijon mustard together in a bowl. Pour white wine into skillet; scrape and dissolve any browned bits of food in the bottom of the skillet into wine. Whisk ranch dressing mixture the skillet, reduce heat to low, and bring sauce to a simmer.
Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain pasta and toss lightly with ranch sauce.
Divide pasta between 4 serving plates and top each serving with a chicken breast. Spoon remaining sauce over chicken breasts and sprinkle with parsley.
