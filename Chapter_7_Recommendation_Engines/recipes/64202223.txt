Ingredients:
2 medium apples, 1 tart granny smith and 1 sweet gala unpeeled and cubed about 3 cups
2 cups baby spinach
1 cup of sliced Belgian endive or sub a few pieces of chopped celery heart spears with a shallot
¼ cup of toasted chopped walnuts
3 tbsp blue cheese, crumbled
Dressing
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp Dijon mustard
½ tsp. honey
¼ cups olive oil
¼ tsp sea salt
¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp finely minced fresh chives

Directions:
In a large bowl toss the apples, spinach, endive, walnuts, and blue cheese to combine.
In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, lemon juice, mustard and honey. Add the oil in a thin stream, whisking to emulsify. Whisk in the salt and pepper.
Pour the dressing on the salad and toss gently. Place in a serving bowl and sprinkle to top with the chives.
One year I experimented and made it with pears instead of apples.

Description: 
One of my favorite healthy dishes, I enjoy making this around Thanksgiving time for a healthy side dish option. It always disappears quickly, so I learned to make larger batches of it.
