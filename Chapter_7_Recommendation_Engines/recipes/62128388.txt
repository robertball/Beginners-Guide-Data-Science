Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon nonfat dry milk powder
1/4 cup quick-cooking oats
1 cup shortening
8 tablespoons ice water; or more as needed

Directions:
Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Cut in the shortening until the size of peas. Mix in the water a tablespoon at a time with a fork until the dough comes together. This recipe takes a bit more water than standard pastry because the oats absorb some water. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill 30 minutes before rolling. Makes enough for a 10-inch double crust pie.

Description: 
Oats lend a slight nutty flavor to this flakey pastry. It stays nice and flakey, even when you re-roll the scraps. If desired, you may add 1 tablespoon grated orange rind to the dry ingredients before mixing. The orange pastry is especially good with strawberry rhubarb and other berry pies. For savory pies, like quiche, you can add a little grated Parmesan cheese or 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds to the dry ingredients before mixing.
