Ingredients:
1 fresh pineapple, peeled and cored
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 cup tequila
1 1/2 tablespoons ground chipotle chiles
1 lemon
1 lime
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut the pineapple lengthwise into 8 wedges. Place the wedges into a sealable plastic container or sealable plastic bag. In a small bowl, stir together the cilantro, tequila and chipotle. Pour into the container with the pineapple. Cut lemon and lime in half, squeeze out some juice and put the juice and fruit into the container. Season with salt and pepper. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least one hour, turning pineapple once.
Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat. When the coals are hot, brush a light coating of oil on the grate.
Grill wedges for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. If you like you can make a sauce by cooking the marinade  in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and cook until the sauce is thick and syrupy. It will be very spicy!
