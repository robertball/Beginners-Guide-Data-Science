Ingredients:
3 eggs, beaten
2 cups lowfat 1% milk
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 cups raisin bread, cut into 3/4-inch squares
2/3 cup dried tart cherries
1 large very ripe banana, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch-thick pieces
Creamy Topping (optional):
1/2 cup light sour cream
4 teaspoons packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon finely shredded orange peel
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Stir together beaten eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a medium bowl using a wire whisk.
Place two-thirds of the bread pieces in an 8x8x2-inch baking pan or dish. Top with cherries, banana slices and remaining bread pieces. Pour egg mixture evenly over bread mixture.
Bake, uncovered, in preheated oven for 65 to 70 minutes or until a knife inserted near center comes out clean. Cool slightly.
Meanwhile, for topping, stir together sour cream, brown sugar, orange peel and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon.  Serve bread pudding topped with sour cream mixture.
