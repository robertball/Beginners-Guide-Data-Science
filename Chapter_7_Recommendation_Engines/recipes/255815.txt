Ingredients:
4 large cloves fresh garlic, peeled and sliced
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or other course-grain salt
1 teaspoon lemon juice, or more to taste
1/2 cup light, extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon water to adjust texture, or more as needed

Directions:
Place garlic slices in a mortar with kosher salt. Mash with the pestle into a fine paste, 4 or 5 minutes. Mix in lemon juice. Add a teaspoon of olive oil; stir and mash until oil is incorporated. Add another teaspoon and mix in thoroughly. Continue incorporating olive oil, teaspoon by teaspoon, mashing and stirring until aioli thickens up. If the aioli gets thicker than you like, add a few drops of water.

Description: 
Aioli is arguably the greatest cold sauce of all time. Yet it's nothing more than olive oil emulsified into freshly crushed garlic, seasoned simply with salt and lemon. This is pure, fiery, intense garlic flavor like you may have never tasted.
