Ingredients:
1  (1/4 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/2  cup warm water  (105 to 115 degrees)
1  cup milk
3  tablespoons sugar
1  teaspoon salt
1/4  cup cooking oil
4 -4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4  cup margarine or butter melted
3/4 -1 cup packed brown sugar
1 -2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4  cup raisins  (optional)
1/4  cup chopped pecans  (optional)
1  cup sifted powdered sugar
1/4  teaspoon vanilla
1 -2 tablespoon water

Directions:
Soften yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Heat milk, sugar, salt and oil till warm (115-120 degrees). Turn into large mixing bowl. Add the yeast mixture. Stir in as much flour as you can.
Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead in enough remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (3-5 minutes total).
Shape into a ball in a greased bowl; turn once. Cover; let rise in warm place till double (about 1 hour). Punch dough down. Turn onto a floured surface. Cover; let rest for 10 minutes.
Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to an 18 by 12-inch rectangle. Spread melted margarine or butter over dough. Combine brown sugar and cinnamon; add raisins and nuts, if desired. Sprinkle sugar mixture over dough. Roll up from one of the long sides. Seal.
Slice into 12 pieces. Place, cut side down, in a greased 13 by 9 by 2-inch baking pan. Cover, let rise in a warm place till nearly double (30 mins.). Bake in a 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes. Cool slightly. Remove from pans.
For icing, combine the powdered sugar, vanilla and enough water to make icing of drizzling consistency. Drizzle over warm rolls.

Description: 
This was submitted by The Bellamy Brothers into a country singer cookbook. These are so nice and light and fluffy! They've been my favorite since I first tried them in 2000! Even better with extra icing! (A tip for you: to slice easily, use thread. Just wrap it around the dough once and pull both sides of thread in opposite directions.)
