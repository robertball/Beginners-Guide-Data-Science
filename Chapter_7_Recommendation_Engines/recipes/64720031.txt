Ingredients:
3 slices bacon
3 cups diced peeled potatoes
1 small onion, chopped fine
2 stalks celery, chopped fine (leaves OK)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
rivels (mixture follows)
2 cups milk
3 tablespoons butter
2 cups egg noodles, or make your own rivels ( Rivels are little homemade egg noodles. )

Directions:
Chop bacon fine and fry in a skillet until crisp and brown.
Put the cooked bacon in a large saucepan and add potatoes, onion, celery, salt, and pepper.
Cover with water and cook until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.
Put the noodles (or rivels) into gently boiling soup, stirring constantly so they stay separate.
Add milk and butter and cook 10 to 15 minutes more, or until noodles (or rivels) are done.
