Ingredients:
2 pkgs. cream cheese (8 oz. each)
2 large red onions, chopped
2 bunches green onions, chopped
2 green peppers, chopped
2 tomatoes, chopped
Nature's Seasons spice mix
2 cups grated cheese (I use Colby/Jack, but use what you prefer)
1 large can ripe olives, sliced
2 bottles seafood cocktail sauce
2 cans tiny shrimp

Directions:
Spread cream cheese on platter and layer first five ingredients, in order, on top of cream cheese. Sprinkle with Nature's Seasons spice mix.
Layer last four ingredients, in order, on top of other ingredients. Serve with tortilla chips, crackers or whatever your prefer. (Sometimes, I scatter a dab of cheese on top of cocktail sauce and before tiny shrimp.) Bon a petit!
