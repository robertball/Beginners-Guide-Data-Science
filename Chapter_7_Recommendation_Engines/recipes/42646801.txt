Ingredients:
1 can de COCO LOPEZ cream of coconut
2 cans coconut milk
1/2 cup of cornstarch
2/3 cup of sugar
1/2 tsp salt
ground cinammon

Directions:
In a heavy saucepan, dissolve cornstarch in 1/4 cup of coconut milk (without heat). This is important so that the cornstarch is completely dissolved and you don't get lumps. After dissolving completely, add the rest of the ingredients.
Cook at medium-high heat stirring constantly!  Be careful that the bottom does not stick and burn.  As it thickens, lower heat until it boils thick, still stirring.  Pour right away into molds, pans or cups. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Cool and then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
