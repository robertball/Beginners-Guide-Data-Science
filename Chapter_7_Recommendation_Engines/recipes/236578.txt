Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, or to taste
1/4 cup finely broken udon noodles
2 teaspoons water
1 teaspoon cornstarch (optional)
2 eggs, beaten
sea salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, soy sauce, and sesame oil together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir udon pieces into broth and cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but are still firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes.
Whisk water and cornstarch together in a bowl. Whisk cornstarch mixture into broth mixture until smooth and thickened slightly. Gradually pour in eggs, stirring gently and constantly, until eggs are wispy and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with sea salt and black pepper.

Description: 
I was not feeling well one evening and wanted soup. But I only had chicken broth and that sounded boring. I'd made egg drop soup before and thought that sounded perfect, so I started looking up recipes. Since I couldn't quite make any of the ones I found, I combined them to make this. It helped settle my stomach and was super easy to make. Garnish with crushed peanuts, chives, chili sauce, red pepper flakes, and lime wedges.
