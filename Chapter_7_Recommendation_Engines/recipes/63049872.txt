Ingredients:
salsa:
1 ear corn, husked
6 scallions, white and light green parts only (about 5 inches)
1 poblano chile
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1 large (or 2 small) haas avocado
1 small bunch cilantro, minced
juice of two small limes
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 tsp salt
1 T olive oil
tacos:
1 lb shrimp
corn or whole wheat tortillas

Directions:
Heat your grill up to medium high.
Brush corn, green onions and poblano chile with olive oil and place on grill. You want everything to have a nice char to itâ€”to chile should be black and the corn and onion should be charred. This will take about five minutes, flipping occasionally with tongs.
When done, remove veggies from grill and let cool on a plate. When cool, peel the now black skin off the pepper, remove the seeds and chop into small dice. Run your knife down the corn to remove the kernels from the cob and place into a bowl with the pepper. Chop onion and place into bowl as well.
Add chopped avocado, cherry tomatoes and cilantro to the bowl and add lime juice and salt. Season to taste and set aside while you prepare the shrimp.
Wash and devein if necessary then grill only a few minutes until pink. Be careful because shrimp cook extremely quickly! When done, place into tortillas, top with salsa and eat immediately.
