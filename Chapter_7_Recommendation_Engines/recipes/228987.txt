Description: 
This delicious blend of many robust ingredients will explode with flavor in your mouth. This was one of those nights where we sort of just opened the fridge to see what we had and this is what we ended up with. You can adjust any ingredients to suit your tastes. I used another couple cloves of garlic because our household loves it. You could easily add chicken to this dish as well. Enjoy!
