Ingredients:
1 egg
¾ cup milk
3 cups Bisquick
2 tbsp melted butter
1 cup brown sugar
2 tbsp cinnamon (or to taste)
Glaze:
1 cup confectioners sugar
½ tbsp melted butter
½ tsp vanilla extract
1-2 tbsp milk

Directions:
Heat oven to 400F.  Mix together egg, milk, and Bisquick mix.  Stir to make a soft dough, adding a sprinkle of Bisquick if mix needs to be less moist.  Roll out dough on counter to make a 12x10 rectangle.  Spread with melted butter, top with brown sugar and cinnamon, spreading evenly.  Roll up the dough tightly, on the wide side.  Seal by pinching edge of dough into the roll.  Slice roll into 1” pieces, and place in a greased round pan.  Bake 15-18 mins.  Top with glaze when slightly cool.  For glaze:  Mix together butter, vanilla and sugar.  Stir in milk in small increments until glaze is the consistency of a thick paste, but still spreadable.
