Ingredients:
English or seedless cucumbers (depending on size you prefer and amount you want to make.
3 large tomatoes chopped small
2 shallots, minced
1/4 cup chopped & packed fresh cilantro
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups V8
Raw 1 corn off cob and 1 avocado chopped small (optional)
Hot sauce or jalapenos to taste, I prefer a 2 tbs of Crystals (or cayenne) (optional)

Directions:
Peel cucumbers and cut into 2-inch pieces. Scoop out insides, leaving 1/4 inch on the bottom, to create a cup. Set aside.
Combine tomatoes and the next ingredients in a food processor. Pulse until blended but not smooth. Pour into a large bowl. Add V8, stirring until well blended. Cover and chill thoroughly before serving.
Pour gazpacho into cucumber cups, and sprinkle with chopped cucumber. Cover and refrigerate remaining gazpacho up to 3 days.
I have also tried different variations adding raw corn and avocado, which I can eat straight out of the bowl!
