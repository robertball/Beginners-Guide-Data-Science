Ingredients:
1/4 cup rice vinegar
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup matchstick-cut carrots
1 cup matchstick-cut daikon radish
2 cups water
1 cup basmati rice
Dressing:
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon lime juice
2 teaspoons grated ginger
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon chile paste (such as sambal oelek), or to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup chopped roasted peanuts
2 green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
Whisk rice vinegar, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a bowl; add carrots and radish and stir until well-coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, at least 1 hour. Drain.
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Spread rice out on a baking sheet and cool to room temperature.
Whisk vegetable oil, lime juice, ginger, sesame oil, garlic, chile paste, and remaining salt together in a large bowl. Add rice, drained carrot mixture, cilantro, peanuts, and green onions to the bowl; stir until salad is well-coated. Serve warm or cold.
