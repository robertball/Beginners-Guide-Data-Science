Ingredients:
1 lb Brussels Sprouts
1 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp coarse-ground pepper
2 tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Wash sprouts, chop off bases, and cut in half.
Toss in a bowl with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
Saut√© on medium for about 5 minutes, until sprouts are bright green and slightly browned.
Eat ASAP. (Over-cooking is what makes sprouts bitter.)

Description: 
This is a simple preparation that lets the sprouts speak for themselves instead of masking with another flavor. You may be surprised, but if you listen you'll hear them saying I am yummy! 

Makes a great side with turkey or tempeh.
