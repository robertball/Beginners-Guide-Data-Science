Ingredients:
2 medium size ripe avocados
1 ½ teaspoons Mrs. Dash garlic & herb seasoning
1 teaspoon Frank’s hot sauce (or ½ teaspoon Tabasco sauce)
½ teaspoon Lawry’s seasoning salt
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese or gorgonzola cheese

Directions:
Cut avocados in half, remove seed, and scoop out the fruit using a spoon.  Using a paring knife, cut the outer portion of the fruit (2/3rds to 3/4ths) and place in a wide bottom bowl.  Retain the inner portion of the fruit to cut and combine later.
Using a fork, mash the avocado until mostly smooth.  Add the seasonings and cheese and mix thoroughly.  Cut the remaining avocado into small pieces and gently stir into avocado mixture.
Start with the above seasoning measurements and adjust to your personal taste, if desired.
Serve with potato chips or tortilla chips.  This can also be used as a condiment.
