Ingredients:
3 Tbsp butter
4 Apples, paired and sliced
1/4 Cup brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1 Cup milk
6 eggs
1 Cup flour
2 tsp white sugar
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
1. In a 10‚Äù ovenproof pan, melt butter. Add apples, brown sugar and cinnamon and cook on the top of the stove until the apples are soft, about 5 mins. Taste for sweetness.
2. Meanwhile, mix milk, eggs, flour, sugar and salt, beating well.
3. Pour the batter over the cooked apples. You may want to sprinkle some sugar and cinnamon over the batter for added flavour.
4. Bake uncovered, in a 425F oven for 20-25 mins
NOTE: For a thinner pancake, half the ingredients for the batter but bake in the same size pan. Reduce baking time by 5 mins.
SERVING SUGGESTION: Cut the pancake in wedges and serve from the pan. Serve with a drizzle of maple syrup or ice cream for a desert.
