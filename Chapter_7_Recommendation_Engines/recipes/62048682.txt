Ingredients:
1 Italian bread or French bread from local bakery
2tablespoons per sandwich of flavored mayonnaise or spreadable cheese (to taste)
3-4 slices of your favorite deli meat or vegetable
2 slices/sandwich of your favorite sliced cheese(i.e. cheddar)
1 firm ripe tomato, sliced
1 onion, thinly sliced
Cooking spray
Extra light or extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
1) On each slice of bread drizzle a little of the olive oil on one side of the bread.
2) Spread 1 tablespoon(each) of mayo or spreadable cheese on the un-oiled side of the bread slices
3) Place sliced cheese on top of mayo/spreadable cheese.Add meat or veggies, tomato, onion. And "close" sandwich.
4) Heat grill on meduim high to high eat and spray lightly with cooking spray. If using a grill pan place sandwich on grill and weigh it down with a heavy pan. This gets those really neat grill marks. Cook on each side 3-5 minutes.
5)Remove and place in warm oven or serve immeadiately.
6)Repeat according to number of sandwiches being made.
*Tip* Make all your sandwiches ahead this saves time. I also recommend a George Foreman Grill, it eliminates the need for flipping.

Description: 
This is a great grilled sandwich! Paninis get their character or distinct look from the grill mark on the sandwich. If you don't have a grill pan use a regular cast iron or non stick skillet. I serve it with soup or even salad. This is the basic recipe. It's easily changed up with proscuitto, salami, ham, or even turkey. This is great veggie.Enjoy!
