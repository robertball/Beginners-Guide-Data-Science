Description: 
I live in the Columbia River Gorge.  So many cerries are produced in a very short period, that during cherry harves, farmers sell pounds of the stuff.  I created a savory recipe because there's only so much cherry pie and ice cream one man can eat.  Excellent on pork, duck breast, lobster or brie.
