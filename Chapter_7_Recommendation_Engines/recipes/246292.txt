Ingredients:
2 fennel bulbs
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pinch dried thyme
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Slice a very thin layer from the bottom of each fennel bulb using a vegetable peeler or paring knife, leaving the core in place to help hold bulb intact. Remove fennel stalks, reserving fronds. Slice bulbs vertically into 1/4-inch slices. Brush slices with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with ground black pepper and salt on each side.
Grill fennel slices until charred, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to serving platter.
Whisk remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, basil, parsley, lemon juice, lemon zest, freshly ground black pepper, thyme, and reserved fennel fronds together in a bowl. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and drizzle lemon mixture over fennel.
