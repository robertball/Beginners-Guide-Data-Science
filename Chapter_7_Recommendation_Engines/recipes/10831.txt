Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon mint extract
3 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, chopped
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat 1/2 cup butter or margarine until creamy.  Add the sugar, and beat until mixed well.  Beat in egg and mint extract.
Sift flour, cocoa, and salt together into a small bowl.  Add flour mixture by halves into creamed mixture, beating well after each addition.
Divide dough in half.  On lightly floured surface roll dough into two 1 1/2 inch diameter cylinders.  Wrap each cylinder in waxed paper, and refrigerate 5 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Thirty minutes prior to baking, place both cylinders in freezer.
Remove one cylinder at a time, and slice 1/4 inch thick pieces with very sharp knife.  Place on cookie sheets about 1 1/2 inches apart.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes.
Melt 1/4 cup butter or margarine and the semisweet chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave.  Drizzle over warm cookies.  Place on wire racks, and let cool and harden completely.
