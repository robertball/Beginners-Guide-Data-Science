Ingredients:
1/2 cup slivered almonds
3 tablespoons white sugar
3/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/3 cup salad oil

2 tablespoons yellow mustard
3/4 tablespoon poppy seeds

1 head romaine lettuce, torn into bite sized pieces
1 (6 ounce) bag baby spinach leaves
3/4 pound sliced mushrooms
3/4 pound shredded Swiss cheese
1 red onion, chopped
1 cup mandarin oranges

Directions:
Combine almonds and sugar in a small skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until sugar is melted over almonds, about 3 minutes. Spread almonds in a single layer on waxed paper to cool.
To make the salad dressing, whisk together the vinegar, salad oil, sugar, mustard, poppy seeds, and salt in a bowl; set aside.
Toss together the romaine lettuce, spinach, mushrooms, Swiss cheese, onion, and oranges in a large bowl. Sprinkle almonds and drizzle dressing over top of salad just before serving.
