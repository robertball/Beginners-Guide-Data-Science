Ingredients:
3/4 cup creamy salad dressing
1/2 cup Italian-style salad dressing
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
In a large glass dish, mix together the creamy salad dressing, Italian-style salad dressing and cayenne pepper. Add chicken breasts and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate. Marinate for 1 to 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.
Remove chicken breasts from marinade, and grill for 6 to 8 minutes each side, until no longer pink and juices run clear.
