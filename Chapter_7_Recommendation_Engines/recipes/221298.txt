Ingredients:
4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½ cup barbeque sauce
⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley
¼ teaspoon garlic, finely minced
8 (9 inch) flour tortillas
2 small plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a medium saucepan lightly salted water to a boil; add chicken breasts and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and gently simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 15 minutes. Drain.
Let chicken cool until it can be easily handled. Shred chicken with your hands; return to empty sauce pan. Stir barbeque sauce, parsley, and garlic into chicken.
Lay 4 tortillas on a baking sheet. Evening spread chicken mixture among the 4 tortillas, leaving a 1-inch border around the outer edge. Top each tortilla with 1/4 tomatoes and 1/4 Cheddar cheese. Place another tortilla atop each filled tortilla.
Bake quesadillas in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 5 to 7 minutes. Cut into wedges to serve.
