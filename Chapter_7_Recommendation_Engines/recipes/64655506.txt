Ingredients:
3 Cups Vanilla Ice Cream
6 Peanut Butter Cups
1 Cup Reese Pieces

Directions:
Pour the ice cream into your blender and blend it for a brief amount of time so that it resembles the consistency of Dairy Queen's soft serve ice cream. Add the peanut butter candies and milk and blend all of the ingredients until thoroughly combined. Pour into glasses and serve.
