6 large potatoes,peeled and cubed
1 teaspoon of salt
2 egg whites
4 eggs beaten
2cups dry bread crumbs
*meat mixture
1 lb.of ground beef
1/2 cup of chopped onions
1 teaspoon of seasoning salt
1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon of chopped garlic
1/2 can of tomato paste

Directions:
boil your potatoes until fully cooked
while they are boiling add beef,seasoning salt,crushed red peppers and garlic to a sauce pan and cook on medium until no longer pink,drain your beef of all fat.
add the tomato paste and mix well,set aside and let cool
when the potatoes are fully cooked mash them with the salt and egg whites until no lumps(DO NOT ADD ANY BUTTER OR MILK TO THE POTATOES)let them cool
when everything is cool enough to handle grab a handful of mashed potatoes(the size of a golf ball,split in half,and make each half into a little bowl by pressing with your fingers
stuff the indentations in each half with the ground beef mixture
bring the two halves together and smooth to make a round ball
dip the ball into the beaten egg and then roll into the flour until lightly covered
dip ball in egg again then into the bread crumbs
IMPORTANT:rerigerate for about three hours before preceeding to the next step,you may also freeze for later use,see "deep frying"note below
use a frying pan with enough oil to cover half of the ball at a time
heat oil to 375'F
cook in oil about two minutes each side or until golden brown on all sides
*if you have a deep fryer,heat oil to 375'F place a single layer of frozen potatoes in the basket and fry 3 minutes or until golden brown.
