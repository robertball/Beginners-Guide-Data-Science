Ingredients:
3/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 Tbs grated onion
1 minced garlic clove
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp each: basil, thyme, oregano, paprika, pepper
1 Tbs Sherry
1 Tbs worcestershire sauce
1 large red bell pepper
1 large green bell pepper
1 large yellow bell pepper
1 package of baby bella mushrooms
2 large tomatoes
1 large zuchini
1 yellow squash
1 large sweet onion
wooden or metal skewers

Directions:
Cut all vegetables into large pieces, preferably 1-1/2" wide x 1" thick.
In a 1 gallon ziploc bag add:
olive oil, lemon juice, onion, garlic, salt, basil, thyme, oregano, paprika, pepper, sherry and worcestershire sauce. Mix all ingredients well.
Add all vegetables to the ziploc bag and close. Try to make sure you get as much air as possible out of the bag.
Place in refrigerator and let marinate for a minimum of 2 hours, flipping bag over at least once.
If using wooden skewers make sure you let sit in a water bath for at least 20 minutes before grilling.
place vegetable pieces on skewers, butting each piece next to each other and alternating vegetable to ensure each skewer gets at least one of each.
Grill over medium heat for 5-7 minutes, rotating skewers so that vegetables evenly cook.
