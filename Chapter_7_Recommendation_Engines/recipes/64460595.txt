Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons cocoa powder
3 tablespoons flour
1 pinch salt
3 teaspoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3 teaspoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
For optional chocolate ganache frosting
½ cup chocolate chips
¼ cup milk

Directions:
*Note:  this is supposed to be a mug recipe, but I used a ramekin*
Combine dry
Add wet and whisk to incorporate
Taste (I added an additional 1/2 tsp of sugar as it seemed to need it)
Microwave for 1 minute
Remove from heat and make (what for me turned out to be) syrup
I used 1/4 cup chocolate chips
Added a splash of milk and nuked for 15 seconds.  It turned out to be more like chocolate syrup than ganache, but was perfect for cake.
Drizzle over top.  Add huge dollop of whipped cream, and serve.
