Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half
1 tablespoon dried Italian seasoning
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) package sliced mushrooms
1/4 cup water
1 (10 ounce) bag washed fresh spinach
1 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust
1 (14 ounce) jar pizza sauce
1 tomato, sliced
4 ounces crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stir in the chicken breast, and cook for a few minutes until the pieces begin to plump. Stir in the Italian seasoning, onion, garlic, and mushrooms; cook and stir until the mushrooms have softened and the onion has turned translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the water and spinach, and cover; cook a few minutes until the spinach has wilted.
Place the pizza crust on a pizza pan, and spread with sauce; top with the chicken and spinach mixture. Arrange the tomato slices over the pizza, then sprinkle with Gorgonzola and mozzarella cheeses.
Bake in preheated oven until the cheese has melted and lightly toasted, 10 to 15 minutes.
