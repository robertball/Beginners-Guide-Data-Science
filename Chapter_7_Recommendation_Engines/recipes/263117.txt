Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chopped carrots
1 cup chopped celery
1/2 yellow onion, chopped
1 leek, chopped
1 shallot, diced
6 cups vegetable broth
3 teaspoons vegetable bouillon (such as Better Than BouillonÂ®)
1/4 cup parsley
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package rotini pasta
1 (16 ounce) package chicken-flavored seitan

Directions:
Saute carrots, celery, onion, leek, and shallot in a soup pot over medium-high heat until onion is translucent and carrots lose their crunch, 7 to 10 minutes.
Pour broth over vegetables in the pot and bring to a rolling boil. Dissolve bouillon into broth; reduce heat to a simmer.
Add parsley, bay leaves, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook until carrots are soft, about 10 minutes more.
Add pasta and seitan and cook until pasta is al dente, another 7 to 10 minutes.
