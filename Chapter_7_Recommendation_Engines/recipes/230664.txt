Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1  egg
½ cup seasoned bread crumbs
2 tablespoons butter
1 ¾ cups pasta sauce (such as Barilla Napoletana(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Press chicken breasts with the palm of your hand to flatten to an even thickness.
Beat egg into a shallow bowl; place bread crumbs into a separate shallow bowl. Dip each chicken breast into beaten egg and press into bread crumbs to coat.
Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat and fry coated chicken breasts until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.
Pour pasta sauce over chicken, cover, and bring sauce to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Sprinkle chicken with mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and parsley. Cover and simmer until cheeses melt, about 5 more minutes.
