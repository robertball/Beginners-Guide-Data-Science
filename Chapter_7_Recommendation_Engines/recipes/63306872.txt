Ingredients:
1 large eggplant, cut into cubes with peel intact
12 pearl onions, halved
9 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tablespoons cilantro, chopped
2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons preserved lemons
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup sesame seeds, toasted

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except sesame seeds. Stir to mix. Cover and refrigerate  for at least two hours and preferably overnight.
Preheat oven to 400ºF
Drain salad and reserve marinade in separate bowl. (Toss salad with some of reserved marinade, if necessary,  just before serving.) Spread salad in shallow roasting pan and roast for about 15 minutes. Remove from oven when eggplant is soft and slightly burnt but not mushy.
Toss baba ghanoush with toasted sesame seeds and salt, pepper and reserved marinade to taste and serve.

Description: 
Instead of mixing everything together, creating the consistency of something that can be consumed with a straw, this salad has chunks of roasted eggplants, fresh lemon, and whole sesame seeds. Instead of eating mush, enjoy something chewy and satisfying. You don’t need challah to make this baba ghanoush digestible; it’s great on its own. It stays true to its roots by being fresh and bold, but stays far away from anything you can find in the supermarket.
