Ingredients:
3 cup Flour
3 tablespoons Baking Powder
1 teaspoon Salt
1 cup Sugar
1 cup milk
1 Egg
1/2 cup Margarine or shortening
Oil for frying

Directions:
Cut margarine into dry ingredients until crumbly.
Mix the milk and egg together and slowly add to the crumb mixture. Combine thoroughly and knead on a floured board until well incorporated and not too sticky.
Break off pieces a little smaller than a tennis ball. Flatten and fry in shallow oil (about 1/2 an inch) over a low-medium flame until golden. Repeat on other side.
Drain on paper towels and serve with butter and/or cheese.
Enjoy!
(Frying this can be a little tricky. You don't want the bread to be too flat because you won't be able to split and butter them properly. Too thick, and they'll be gummy on the inside.
I guess an easier method would be to roll out the dough and cut with a large circle cutter. )
