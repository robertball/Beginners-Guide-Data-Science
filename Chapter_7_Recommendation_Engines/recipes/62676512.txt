Ingredients:
1 can refried beans
1/2 c. diced onion
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 mini red pepper, minced
1/2 tsp. Worcstershire sauce
1/2 c. Italian-style bread crumbs

Salt and pepper, to taste
3 tbs. Olive oil
1 egg, beaten
2 c. flour, seasoned with salt and pepper
4 slices Gouda cheese
1 c. carmelized onions

Directions:
Drizzle 1 tbs. olive oil in a skillet.  Place onions, garlic and peppers in skillet.  Sautee 5-10 minutes, until softened.  Set aside, let cool slightly.  Mix refried beans, onion mixture, Worstershire sauce, bread crumbs, seasoning, salt and pepper in a large bowl.  Form into four patties.  Dredge both sides in beaten egg, careful not to pierce the patty.  Dredge both sides in flour.  Drizzle remaining olive oil in skillet.  Once bubbling, add patties.  Cook 5-10 minutes on each side until a nice brown crust forms.  Drain on paper towel, top with cheese and carmelized onions.
