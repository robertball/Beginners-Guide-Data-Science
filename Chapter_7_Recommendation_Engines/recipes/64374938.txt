Ingredients:
3/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
3 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon instant powdered milk
1/4 cup white sugar
3/8 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 egg white
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
3/4 cup dried currants
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
l t. lemon peel
l t. dried orange peel
1/2 t. allspice
l t. vanilla
l t. butter flavor
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons water
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons milk

Directions:
Put warm water, butter, skim milk powder, 1/4 cup sugar, salt, egg, egg white, flour, and yeast in bread maker and start on dough program.
When 5 minutes of kneading are left, add currants and cinnamon. Add lemon peel, dried orange peel, butter flavor, allspice and vanilla. I used dried apricots in my first ones I made.  Leave in machine till double.
Punch down on floured surface, cover, and let rest 10 minutes.
Shape into 12 balls and place in a greased 9 x 12 inch pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place till double, about 35-40 minutes.
Mix egg yolk and 2 tablespoons water. Brush on balls.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 minutes. Remove from pan immediately and cool on wire rack.
To make crosses, put a little dough in a plastic bag, snip the corner and make small crosses on the buns.

Description: 
An Easter tradition, these lightly sweetened cinnamon yeast buns feature tender little currants strewn throughout.  An egg yolk wash gives these buns a browned, glossy finish, making a canvas for the namesake cross, a painting of milk and sugar icing.Modified from: Hot Cross Buns I
