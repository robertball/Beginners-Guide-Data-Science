Ingredients:
6 eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups white sugar
4 cups milk
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 (1 pound) loaf bread, cut into 1 inch cubes
1/2 cup golden raisins
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup butter
3/4 cup corn syrup
1/2 cup whiskey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, whip together eggs and sugar. Mix in milk, heavy cream, vanilla extract and cinnamon. Whip until smooth.
Arrange bread cubes in a medium baking dish, and top with golden raisins. Cover with the whipped mixture. Allow the bread to become saturated with the mixture.
Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned.
To make the sauce, mix sugar, butter and corn syrup in a medium saucepan over low heat. Remove from heat when thoroughly blended, and whisk in the whiskey. Serve warm over bread pudding.
