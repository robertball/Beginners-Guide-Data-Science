Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 tablespoon garlic granules
1 ½ teaspoons chili powder
1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
1 ½ teaspoons mild paprika
1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper
1 ½ teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
½ teaspoon ground ginger
1 pinch cumin seeds
sea salt to taste
cold water to cover
2 cups tomato puree
8  shallots, peeled and left whole
1 large red onion, cut into small thin strips
1  red bell pepper, cut into chunks
1  yellow bell pepper, cut into chunks
3 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook chicken thighs until browned on the outside, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a slow cooker.
Grind garlic granules, chili powder, ground cumin, paprika, pepper, sugar, mustard powder, coriander, oregano, thyme, cayenne, ginger, cumin seeds, and sea salt in a mortar and pestle to make the spice mix.
Sprinkle 1/2 the spice mix over the chicken and pour in enough water to cover. Add remaining spice mix, tomato puree, shallots, onion, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and honey to the slow cooker.
Cover and cook on Low until flavors are well combined and chicken is no longer pink in the center, 6 to 8 hours

Description: 
A hearty, flavorful casserole. I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs to reduce fat but you could use thighs with skin and bone for extra flavor if you prefer.
