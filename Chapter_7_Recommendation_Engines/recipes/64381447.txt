Ingredients:
3 cups lukewarm water
8 tbsp psyllium seed husk powder
2 tbsp dry yeast
1 tsp salt
1 1/2 cup rice flour
1 1/2 cup buckwheat flour

Directions:
Place the husk and water in a large mixing bowl and stir, before adding in the salt and yeast as well. Lastly, add in the flours while stirring thoroughly.
Using your hands, start to knead the dough for a minute or two. If necessary add more water until a fairly wet dough forms. Cover with a kitchen towel and allow it to rise for 30 minutes.
Once the 30 minutes are up, knead the dough for a few minutes again. If you find the mixture a bit too sticky, start to gradually add in more flour until it holds together nicely.
Form about 20 bread rolls and place it on a baking tray lined with parchment. Let this rise for another 30 minutes. Brush a little bit of water on top of the buns before placing it in a pre-heated oven at 400 degrees. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until they have a nice golden crust. It is paramount that you let them cool on a wire rack before serving! Otherwise the texture will be a bit odd. It tastes best within the first two days, but it will keep for at least 4. You can also choose to freeze them if you wish. If so, simply put them in the oven for 5-10 minutes before you serve them.
