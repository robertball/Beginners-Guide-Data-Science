Ingredients:
1 lemon
7 cloves garlic, divided
1/3 cup mayo, such as Hellmann's®
1/2 t dried parsley
1/2 t smoked paprika
4 L fresh artichokes
1 bay leaf
2 sprigs fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup water

Micro plane or finely chop 2 cloves of garlic,  about 1 t and add to the mayo mixture.

Roughly chop the lemon shell and place in a med bowl of cold water
Cut 1 inch off the top of the artichoke and pinch off any dry leaves, snip the spikes with kitchen shears.
Place the artichokes in the lemon/water mixture for 30 minutes. This will prevent the chokes from oxidizing.
Roughly chop the other 1/2 lemon  and place in the bottom of the pot along with remaining lemon juice, if any.
Add 1 cup water, bay leaf, salt, pepper, 1 clove garlic and fresh parsley to the pot
Add 1 whole garlic clove to the centre of each choke
Insert the steam rack and place the artichokes , stem side up, on the rack.
Put the lid on and close the vert.
Adjust the manual option for 11 minutes, if necessary.
Use manual release when the timer goes off.
The chokes are done when a knife can easily be inserted into the stem.
Note: The stems, if any, can be peeled and place in the bottom of the pot.
