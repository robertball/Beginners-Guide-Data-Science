Ingredients:
1/2 pound salmon, cut into chunks
1/2 cup thinly sliced kale, or to taste
2 green onions, chopped
1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, thinly sliced, or to taste
1 tablespoon water, or more if needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup cooked rice, or to taste
1 sheet seaweed, torn into small pieces
1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Combine salmon, kale, green onions, and ginger in a saucepan; add water and turn heat to medium-high. Bring liquid to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Add more water if needed. Season salmon with salt and pepper.
Stir rice into salmon mixture; cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir seaweed into mixture and top with sesame oil.

Description: 
I love salmons and an advocate of healthy eating and quick cooking. In one bowl, I can uptake many nutrients at once and change the way kale can be served.
