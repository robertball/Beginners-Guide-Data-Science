Ingredients:
1 pound macaroni - elbows or cavatapi
1 head of cauliflower
2 Cups of shredded mozzarella
2 Cups of shredded cheddar
4-5 cloves of garlic
1/4 Cups of extra virgin olive oil
Salt
Red pepper flakes (optional

Directions:
Fill 2 large sauce pots with water. Add salt.
Wash and cut cauliflower into large chunks and add to the salted water. Bring to a boil and cook cauliflower until fork tender.
At the same time, cook macaroni in the other pot until al dente.
Mince the garlic while cauliflower and macaroni are cooking.
Drain cooked cauliflower.
Using the same pot, heat olive oil and sauté the garlic for about 1 minute. Add red pepper flakes if desired.
Add the cauliflower to the garlic and oil and sauté for a couple minutes on medium low heat.
Add the cooked macaroni to the cauliflower.
Stir in the mozzarella and the cheddar until all ingredients are well combined.
Transfer to a baking dish.
Sprinkle top with some cheese.
Bake for 30 minutes until nice and bubbly.
It tastes even better the next day. I love it cold!
