Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 tablespoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 (10 ounce) box frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups heavy cream
3 tablespoons dry white wine
1 teaspoon brandy extract
1 pinch ground nutmeg to taste
2 ounces crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Beat eggs with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg in a large bowl. Mix in ricotta cheese and spinach until evenly blended. Continue mixing in the flour, 1/4 cup at a time until a soft dough forms. If the dough is still sticky, add an additional 1/4 cup of flour. Cover, and place into refrigerator.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Divide the gnocchi dough into 4 pieces, and roll into 1/2 inch thick ropes on a floured surface. Slice each rope into 1/2 inch pieces. Gently boil the gnocchi until they float in the water, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain in a colander, and set aside.
Meanwhile, pour cream, wine, brandy extract, and 1 pinch of nutmeg into a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat and whisk in the Gorgonzola cheese; season to taste with salt and pepper. Toss the gnocchi with the Gorgonzola sauce, and serve immediately.
