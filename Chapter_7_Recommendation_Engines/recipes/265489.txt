Ingredients:
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 carrots, peeled and grated
1/2 cup frozen corn
1/2 cup frozen peas
3 cups cooked brown rice
2 cups diced pineapple
1/2 cup diced ham
2 green onions, sliced

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, sesame oil, ground ginger, and white pepper together in a bowl; set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds. Stir in carrots, corn, and peas and stir-fry until vegetables are tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir in brown rice, pineapple, ham, green onions, and soy sauce mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
