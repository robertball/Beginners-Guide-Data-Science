Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained
1 (8 ounce) package extra wide egg noodles
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 bunch celery, chopped
1/2 sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), chopped
2 zucchini, quartered and sliced
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of potato soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup
1 3/4 cups milk
4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 pound imitation crabmeat, flaked
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place the can of drained peas into the freezer.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and cook the celery and onion until the onion has started to turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the zucchini and cook until bright green but tender, another 5 to 8 minutes. Mix in the potato and celery soups and milk, then fold in half the Cheddar cheese; allow the mixture to stand for 5 minutes. Gently stir in the cooked noodles, then the imitation crab, and finally the peas from the freezer. Freezing the peas helps keep them intact. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and spread the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top the casserole with the remaining 2 cups of Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; remove the casserole and cover with foil; allow to stand for 10 to 15 minutes to set up.

One of my husband's favorites! It's full of creamy, cheesy, crabby goodness that warms you up on a cool rainy night. It's very vegetable savvy, you can add as many or few as you want!
