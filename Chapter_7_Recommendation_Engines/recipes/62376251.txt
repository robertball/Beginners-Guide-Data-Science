Ingredients:
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
3 tablespoons butter, melted
3 tablespoons honey
1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
5 pound salmon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the mustard, butter, and honey. In another bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, pecans, and parsley.
Season each salmon fillet with salt and pepper.  Place on a lightly greased baking sheet.  Brush with mustard-honey mixture.  Cover the top of each fillet with bread crumb mixture.
Bake for 10 minutes per inch of thickness, measured at thickest part, or until salmon just flakes when tested with a fork.  Serve garnished with lemon wedges.
