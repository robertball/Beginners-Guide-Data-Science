Ingredients:
2 Eggs
250 g 2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp Cinnamon optional, ground
1 pinch Salt
2 tsp Vanilla sugar optional
1/2 tbsp Oil
500 ml 2 cups milk
1 Butter

Directions:
Start by adding flour, salt, sugar and cinnamon to a bowl.
Whisk the dry ingredients and make a little well in the middle.
Add eggs and while whisking, add milk.
Once all the milk has been added I usually switch to a hand blender to make sure there are no lumps in the batter.
Add in the oil and mix it a little bit more to make sure all the oil is incorporated into the batter. You’ll end up with a liquid batter.
Cover the batter with plastic wrap and set it aside for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes you’ll see the batter has thickened a little bit.
Now it’s time to start baking, add a some butter to a frying pan.
Add just enough batter to the pan to cover the bottom. I like to use a ladle and tilt the pan while pouring the batter into the pan. You don’t want a thick pancake. Only add more batter if after tilting the pan you don’t have enough batter to cover the bottom of the pan.
You will start to see the batter dry up in the pan as you’re baking the pancake.
Once the batter is dry, you can flip the pancake and bake it for another minute.
Once the pancake has some nice golden spots on both sides the pancake is ready to serve.
