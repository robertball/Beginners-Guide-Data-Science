Ingredients:
cooking spray
4  very ripe bananas
1 (30 ounce) can pumpkin pie mix
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup brown sugar
¾ cup butter, softened
3  eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Mash bananas into a paste in a large bowl. Add pumpkin pie mix, flour, brown sugar, butter, eggs, baking soda, and salt; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Pour into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is the first recipe that I have created on my own. It was a complete miscalculation of ingredients, hence the 'gooey' portion of the name. It turned out pretty darn good. I like it, my husband likes it, and the guests I force to try it actually like it. I hope you do too.
