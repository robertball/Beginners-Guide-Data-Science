Ingredients:
3 slices hearty country bread
3 cups water
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1/4 cup fresh spinach leaves (optional)
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained and flaked
6 mushrooms, diced (optional)
1 zucchini, diced (optional)
1 stalk celery, diced (optional)
2 eggs
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill, or more to taste (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon oregano
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Soak bread in water in a large shallow dish until softened completely; remove from dish and squeeze as much water from bread as possible.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, spinach, and garlic in the hot oil until the onion softens, about 5 minutes.
Mix the onion mixture with softened bread, tuna, mushrooms, zucchini, celery, eggs, dill, salt, pepper, basil, and oregano in a large bowl until combined. Form the mixture into about 24 thin, palm-size patties.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the patties in the skillet until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
This is a great recipe I came up with to get rid of leftover bread. I generally use the contents of my vegetable drawer here so I kind of throw in whatever I have at the time, so you can use your own judgment. They taste really nice when eaten with sour cream or low-fat mayo or even on their own -  though my husband prefers ketchup. I generally use this recipe as a guideline, so have fun with it!
