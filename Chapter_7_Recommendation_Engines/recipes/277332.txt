Ingredients:
2 cups rice flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups boiling water
2 pounds sausage
1 pound shredded cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine rice flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Pour boiling water over the mixture and mix together with a whisk or electric mixer. Add sausage and mix together with an electric mixer or potato masher. Stir in cheese.
Shape sausage mixture into small balls using your hands and set onto a baking sheet or a baking rack with small holes (preferred). If using a baking rack, place a drip tray underneath to catch drippings.
Bake in the preheated oven until sausage balls are cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
