1/2 teaspoon nutmeg

1/2 teaspoon salt

Sift together first 7 ingredients into a small bowl. Set aside.
Beat butter with the sugars, eggs, extracts and frangelico in a large bowl until fluffy.
Gradually stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Stir in apples and nuts, if using. Mixture will be really thick. Spread into a lightly greased 9 x 9 baking pan.
Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour, shielding with foil after 35 minutes to prevent excessive browning. Cool in pan on a wire rack. Cut into squares.
