Ingredients:
1 cup raisins
1 cup water
1/2 cup shortening
1 egg
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 inch pans. In a saucepan, simmer the raisins in the water on medium low heat.
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and shortening until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg. Sift together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.  Blend these dry ingredients into the sugar mixture.  Mix thoroughly.
Strain the raisins.  Discard the raisin pulp.   Add water to the raisin juice to make 3/4 cup liquid, and add to the batter.  Add the chopped nuts. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top springs back when lightly touched. Cool the cake on a wire rack, and frost.
