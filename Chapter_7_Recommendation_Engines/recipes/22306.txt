Description: 
This bread was suggested at a class I gave on making breads using whole grains. A woman in the class wanted to make some bread for her husband who was allergic to wheat.  She called me the next day to report it was very good.  I was so happy for them, because her husband hadn't eaten bread in such a  long time, and was so thankful.
