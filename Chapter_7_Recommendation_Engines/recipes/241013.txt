Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 pounds beef bones
6 cups cool water, or as needed
2 onions, thickly sliced
2 carrots
3 cloves garlic, crushed
2 bay leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a roasting pan with cooking spray.
Spread tomato paste onto beef bones and place in the prepared roasting pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until bones begin to brown, about 30 minutes.
Transfer bones to a slow cooker and pour in enough water to cover bones. Add onions, carrots, garlic, and bay leaves to broth mixture.
Cook on Low for at least 24 hours.
Strain broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a container and refrigerate.

Description: 
After bout upon bout of sickness with the start of the school year, a friend showed me her bone broth recipe. This is a great way to use up old chicken, pork, or beef bones (or just go buy some fresh!) that adds tons of amazing nutrients and amino acids to your diet! 10 minutes of prep, a day of your house smelling like a roast, and you have a fantastic, versatile base for soups, stews, and so much more!
