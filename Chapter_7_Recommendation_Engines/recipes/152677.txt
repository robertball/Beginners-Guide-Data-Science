Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup sugar
4 eggs
5 slices white bread, cut into 1 inch cubes
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
1/3 cup brown sugar, packed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 6x10 inch baking dish.
Cream the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Stir in the bread cubes and pineapple until well blended. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over the top.
Bake in preheated oven until bread points on top are golden brown, 45 to 60 minutes. Cool before serving.

Description: 
So simple and so delicious you'll want to make an extra one for the next day. It's always the requested dish to bring to parties, from picnics to Thanksgiving. You don't know whether to eat it as a side dish or dessert, but it will be gone either way. My mom calls it 'white trash souffle' because it's best made with that long-lasting, favorite white bread! If desired, garnish with pineapple slices or maraschino cherries.
