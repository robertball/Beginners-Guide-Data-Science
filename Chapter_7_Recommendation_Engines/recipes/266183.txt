Ingredients:
Crust:
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
1/2 cup stevia sugar substitute (such as Truvia®)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt
Pie Filling:
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
4 large eggs
3/4 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as Splenda®)
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine melted butter, pecans, stevia, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Press into the bottom of a 10-inch pie pan.
Bake crust in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and increase temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Combine pumpkin puree, eggs, sweetener, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves in a bowl and mix completely. Pour filling into pie crust.
Bake in the hot oven for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until a knife inserted into the pie comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes more. Cool for 1 hour before refrigerating. Refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours before serving.
