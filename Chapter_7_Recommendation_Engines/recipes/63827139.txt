Banana Walnut Muffins Recipe

Ingredients:
For the muffins:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 4 over ripened bananas
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 2 eggs, room temp
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup pecans, chopped
For the topping:
- 1/2 stick butter, melted
- 1/4 cup chopped walnuts
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup flour
- pinch of salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and prep 2 muffin tins (or bake in batches).
In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside. Mash 2 of the bananas with a fork in a small bowl so they still have a bit of texture. With an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk, whip the remaining bananas and sugar together like you mean it, for a good 3 minutes. Add the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla and beat well, scraping down the sides of the bowl once or twice. Mix in the dry ingredients just until incorporated. Fold in the nuts and the mashed bananas with a rubber spatula. Spoon the batter into the muffin tins to fill them about halfway. Give them a rap on the counter to get any air bubbles out.
Combine the topping ingredients in a small bowl and stir to create pea size crumbles. Divide among muffins.
Bake until a toothpick stuck in the muffins comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes before turning the muffins out. Serve warm or at room temperature.
