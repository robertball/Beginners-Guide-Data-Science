Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 egg
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast thinly sliced
2 cups of your favorite Marinara sauce
8 slices part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon salt
8 ounces spaghetti or linguine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-low heat. Beat egg and 1/4 teaspoon of salt in a shallow dish. Mix bread crumbs, basil and pepper in another shallow dish. Dip both sides of each breast in egg mixture, then into bread crumb mixture to coat. Set on a platter.
Increase heat to medium-high. When oil starts to shimmer, add chicken and saute, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes on each side.
Pour marinara sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place chicken in dish and top each with a portion of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Bake until cheese completely melts and browns, about 20 minutes.
Bring 2 quarts of water and 1 tablespoon of salt to boil in a large pot. Add pasta, use package times as a guide, and boil until just tender. Drain, cover and set aside till chicken is ready.
Transfer a portion of pasta to each plate. Place sauce and chicken on top of pasta and serve.
