Ingredients:
3 cups self-rising flour
1 & 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon sugar
1 cup shortening
When baking:
milk
melted butter

Directions:
To make the biscuit mix:
Sift dry ingredients into mixing bowl.
Cut in shortening with knives or pastry blender until evenly distributed.
Store in covered container in refrigerator until ready for use.
To make biscuits:
For 6 biscuits, 2 inches in diameter, combine 1 cup mix with enough milk to moisten.  Knead lightly on floured surface 5 or 6 times.  Roll out 1/2 inch thick for high biscuits or 1/4 inch for thin crusty biscuits.
Cut with a biscuit cutter but do-not twist the cutter simply place cutter down on dough and pick it straight back up.  This will allow biscuits to rise.  Twisting the cutter can change the rising.
Place on prepared cookie sheet and brush tops with melted butter or milk.  Space dough close together for soft biscuits or one-inch apart for crusty biscuits.
Bake at 450 for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.
