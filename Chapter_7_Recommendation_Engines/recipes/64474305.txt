Ingredients:
1 bunch green onions
1/4c hoisin sauce
1T liquid aminos (or soy sauce)
1T minced fresh ginger (I freeze mine and grate it)
1T minced garlic (you can always add more!)
1t Sambal Olek (use more/less for your own heat level)
1/4t Chinese 5-spice
4 bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed
4 chicken drum sticks, skin removed
1 1/2t toasted sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9x13 baking dish with cooking oil.
Thinly slice tops of the green onions, set aside.
Mince the bottom white part.
Whisk the white part, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, hot sauce and 5-spice in a large bowl (big enough to hold all the chicken)
Add chicken, toss to coat.
Arrange chicken in an even layer in the prepared baking dish, meatier side down.
Pour remaining sauce over chicken.
Bake, turning once halfway through, until meat reaches 165 degrees, about 1 hour.
Before serving, sprinkle with sesame seeds.
