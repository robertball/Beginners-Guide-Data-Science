Ingredients:
1 cup chopped celery
4 green onions, chopped
2 (6 ounce) cans crabmeat, drained and flaked
1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin
3 tablespoons cold water
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Process celery, green onions, and crab in a food processor until finely chopped, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle gelatin over cold water in a small bowl; let stand until softened, about 10 minutes.
Bring chicken soup to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat; stir gelatin mixture into soup, dissolving completely. Remove from heat and cool until slightly warm. Stir cream cheese and mayonnaise into soup mixture until smooth; stir Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce into soup mixture.
Pour soup mixture into food processor with crab mixture and process until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour into a 5-cup mold. Chill in refrigerator until set, about 4 hours.

Description: 
I bring this crab mold every Christmas and it doesn't last long. I have served it with saltine crackers and cocktail rye bread, but you can use whatever you'd like.
