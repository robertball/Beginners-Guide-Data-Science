Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup butter, softened
6 egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
1/2 teaspoon orange extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat egg yolks, vanilla extract, lemon extract, and orange extract together in another bowl. Add egg yolk mixture to butter mixture; beat well.
Sift flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar together in a bowl. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is well-blended. Roll dough into walnut-size balls and place on prepared baking sheets. Press dough balls to slightly flatten.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden around the edges and set, 8 to 10 minutes.
