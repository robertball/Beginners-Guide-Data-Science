Ingredients:
3 eggs, beaten
2/3 c. sugar
1 c. pancake syrup(butter flavored if you have it)
1/2 tsp. salt
1/3 c. butter, melted
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 c. chopped pecans or halves
1 unbaked deep dish pie crust

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375*. Place pie crust into a 9" pie pan and crimp the edges. Then layer the pecans on top of the crust in the bottom of the pan.
****NOTE**** The following steps should be mixed by hand.  A electric mixed will cause it to become too frothy and cause the texture of the pie to change.
2. Mix the eggs, sugar, syrup, and salt together well. Slowly, add the melted butter to the  egg mixture a little at a time. Finally, add the vanilla extract and mix it one last time.
3. Pour the egg mixture over the pecans in the pie shell. Bake in 375* preheated oven and bake for 40-50 minutes until it is golden brown and the filling is set.
