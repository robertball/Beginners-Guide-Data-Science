Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegan margarine
1 cup shredded carrot
1 cup chopped celery
1 medium onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
8 cups seasoned bread cubes
2 cups chopped apple
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup vegetable broth, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Add carrot, celery, and onion; cook until onions are tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add salt, cinnamon, and pepper. Remove vegetable mixture from heat.
Combine bread cubes, apples, and walnuts in a large bowl. Add vegetable mixture and drizzle with vegetable broth until evenly moist.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.

Mom tinkered with vegetarian stuffing recipes until we settled on this one that the whole family enjoys. I've continued to serve it, even to my meat-eating family, and everyone loves it.
