Ingredients:
1 package dried yeast, 2 Tbsp warm water, 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup butter, 3 Tbsp sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 egg at room temperature, 2 cups flour, 2 dozen Italian prune plums OR 1 dozen regular plums

Directions:
1) Grease two 8" round cake pans or one jelly roll pan.  2) Combine yeast and water in a bowl  3) In a saucepan over medium-low heat, combine and heat the milk, butter and sugar.  Allow to cool (it should be warm but not hot when you pour it over the yeast mixture).  Pour it over the yeast mixture.  4) Beat the egg.  Add the salt and beaten egg to the yeast mixture.  5) Stir in flour.  6) Turn dough out onto a floured board and knead until smooth and elastic.  Place in a slightly greased bowl, cover with a dish towel and let rise until doubled in bulk (approximately 1 hour).  7) Preheat oven to 375  8) While dough is rising, cut plums in half (or quarter them if you're using larger plums) and remove the pits.  9) Punch dough down.  Divide dough in half if using the two round cake pans.  Press dough into each pan.  Top with plums, cut side up, pressing them down a little.  Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar to taste.  10) Bake for 45 minutes

Description: 
My great-grandma immigrated to the US from Germany in 1926.  Every spring, as soon as plums came in season, she made her pflaumenkuchen, or plum cake.  She always used Italian prune plums, but if you can't find them, regular plums will do (just quarter them instead of halving them, since they're larger).
