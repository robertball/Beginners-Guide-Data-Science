Ingredients:
2 tablespoons honey, or more to taste
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1/2 (3 pound) pork loin
1/2 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix honey, Dijon mustard, and black pepper together in a bowl until texture of a paste.
Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork loin in the hot skillet until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer pork loin to a baking dish. Spread honey paste over entire pork loin. Spread pineapple chunks around pork loin and sprinkle salt over pork loin.
Place a cooking thermometer into the pork loin and cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Decrease oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Continue cooking until pork is cooked through, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Transfer pork loin to a work surface and let rest, 3 to 5 minutes. Blend pineapple chunks and drippings in a blender until sauce is smooth; serve alongside pork loin.
