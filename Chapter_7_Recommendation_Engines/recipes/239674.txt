Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound ground beef or turkey
1 medium onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Black Bean, Cumin & Cilantro Soup
4 ounces queso fresco, crumbled
1 (14 ounce) package empanada dough, thawed
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef, onion and salt and cook until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat.
Reduce the heat to medium. Stir the soup in the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling.  Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the queso fresco.
Spoon about 1/3 cup beef mixture in the center of each dough circle. Brush the edges of the dough circles with water.  Fold the dough in half over the filling. Crimp the edges with a fork to seal. Brush the empanadas with the egg. Place the empanadas onto a baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the empanadas are golden brown.
