Ingredients:
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, diced
3 carrots, peeled and diced
2 ribs celery, diced
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups chicken broth
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 teaspoon thyme
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
3 1/2 cups shredded chicken
1/2 cup frozen peas
8 biscuits (use canned biscuits from refrigerator section (ex:pillsbury) unless you are a biscuit master, then make from scratch using your own recipe)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9x13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.
To make the filling, melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic, onion, carrots and celery, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes. Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in chicken broth, milk and thyme, and cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in chicken and peas; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Add chicken mixture to prepared baking dish. Place into oven and bake for 15 minutes. Top with biscuits and bake until tops are golden brown, an additional 10-12 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving.
