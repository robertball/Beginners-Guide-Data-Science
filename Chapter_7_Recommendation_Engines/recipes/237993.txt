Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 small yellow onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, diced
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 (11 ounce) package pizza dough
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 small green onion, minced

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add yellow onion, garlic, taco seasoning, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until onion is tender, about 10 minutes.
Heat oil in a separate skillet over medium heat.
Roll dough into a thin crust onto a work surface; cut into 6 equal pieces.
Fry each piece of dough in the hot oil until golden, about 1 minute per side. Transfer cooked flatbread to a paper towel-lined plate.
Top each flatbread with ground beef mixture, Cheddar cheese, and green onion.

Description: 
Was looking for a quick and easy dinner for me and the man. Had leftover pizza dough that I like to use for flatbreads. It is simple to add veggies to meat mixture and play with the flavors! Feel free to add your favorite hot sauce for a spicier kick. Serve with a side salad to complete the meal. You can switch out ingredients as you like; turkey or chicken for beef or experiment with different cheeses. Fold flatbread like a taco and enjoy!
