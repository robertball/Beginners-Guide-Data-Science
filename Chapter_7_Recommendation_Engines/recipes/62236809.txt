Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, chopped
1 onion, chopped
4 eggs
1/2 cup buttermilk baking mix
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 cups shredded cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 mini muffin pans. In a large skillet over medium heat, fry bacon and onion together for about 5 minutes, or until bacon is crisp. Drain and set aside.
In a medium bowl, beat the eggs. Stir in the baking mix, parsley, shredded cheese, bacon and onion. Spoon into greased muffin cups.
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops are lightly browned. Allow mini bites to cool in the pan before carefully removing with a small knife or spatula.

Description: 
The original title called them a Quiche - which they clearly are not. I have always called them  ___ Bites (Bacon Bites, Crab Bites, Breakfast Bites, etc) depending on the main ingredients. This is a variation on the Impossible Pie recipe, so any of those recipes could easily be adapted to this as well. I modified this based in part on the reviews, but also my experience with their larger cousin (Impossible Pie).Modified from: Easy Mini Quiches
