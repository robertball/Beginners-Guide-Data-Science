Description: 
'When my great-grandson was a teenager, he and his friends could hardly wait for these muffins to come out of the oven. The aroma is heavenly as they bake,' writes field editor Ruby Williams of Bogalusa, Louisiana. 'I like them because they're not crumbly like some lighter corn muffins.'
