Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable oil
1/2 yellow onion, diced
4 potatoes, peeled and sliced
3 yellow squash, sliced
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt (optional)
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat until oil is hot; decrease heat to medium. Cook and stir onion and potatoes in the hot oil until potatoes are lightly browned and partially cooked, 15 to 20 minutes. Add squash, butter, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, salt, and red pepper flakes; cook until potatoes are golden brown, 15 to 20 more minutes, turning occasionally. Remove from skillet with a slotted spoon.

Description: 
My boyfriend suggested I add some squash to the fried potatoes as a way to use up the extra squash. It tastes really good as a side dish to pork or chicken.
