Ingredients:
3/4 cup Catalina salad dressing
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
1 pinch dried dill weed
6 (4 ounce) fillets salmon

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Whisk Catalina salad dressing, melted butter, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, and dill together in a bowl. Brush over the salmon fillets.
Cook salmon on the preheated grill, basting regularly with the sauce, until the flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
