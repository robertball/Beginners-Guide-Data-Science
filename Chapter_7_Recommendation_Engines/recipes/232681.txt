Ingredients:
2 pork tenderloins
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup ketchup
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup Chinese rice wine
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
1/2 teaspoon red food coloring (optional)
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder (optional)

Directions:
Cut pork with the grain into strips 1 1/2- to 2-inches long; put into a large resealable plastic bag.
Stir soy sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, hoisin sauce, red food coloring or red bean curd (see Cook's Note), and Chinese five-spice powder together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until just combined and slightly warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the marinade into the bag with the pork, squeeze air from the bag, and seal. Turn bag a few times to coat all pork pieces in marinade.
Marinate pork in refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove pork from marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Discard remaining marinade.
Cook pork on preheated grill for 20 minutes. Put a small container of water onto the grill and continue cooking, turning the pork regularly, until cooked through, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
Char siu literally means fork burn/roast-'Char' being fork (both noun and verb) and siu being burn/roast-after the traditional cooking method for the dish: long strips of seasoned boneless pork are skewered with long forks and placed in a covered oven or over a fire. This is best cooked over charcoal, but importantly to cook with indirect heat.
