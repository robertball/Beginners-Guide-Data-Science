Ingredients:
6 cups "puffed rice cereal" (you know which one I mean)
3 T Butter plus a little extra
1 package mini-marshmallows
1 package "strawberry licorice" (you DEFINITELY know which one I mean)
Blue food coloring

Directions:
1. In a large pot or saucepan, melt the butter. Once the butter is fully melted but not brown, add the mini marshmallows. Attempt to stir the increasingly sticky mess as the marshmallows melt.
2. After the marshmallows are completely melted, add 3 drops of blue food coloring and stir. Decide that you need more food coloring (you're going for SKY blue, not BABY blue). Add 4 or 5 more drops of food coloring and stir until no streaks remain.
3. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in six cups of "puffed rice cereal." You heard me. Six cups. If you don't have the arms of a bodybuilder right now, you will after you've finished stirring this.
4. Rub butter all over your hands lest you turn into some kind of "puffed rice cereal" monster (will they sue me if I tell you they're Rice Krispies?). Then form oblong shapes about the size of the palm of your hand out of the extraterrestrial-looking blue mixture that's congealing in the pot. Rebutter your hands as necessary.
5. Using a knife, kitchen shears, or your black belt in karate, chop several of the "strawberry licorice" into six pieces. Press the licorice legs into the bottoms of the oblongs so that they stick out the sides. Aw, they look just like little termites. How appetizing.
