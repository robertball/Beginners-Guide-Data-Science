Ingredients:
5 well ripened bananas (lots of little brown spots)
16 oz semi-sweet chocolate
1 tablespoon butter
shredded coconut, chopped nuts, sprinkles, or other toppings (optional)
popsicle sticks

Directions:
Peel bananas.  If bananas are small, you may leave them whole.  Otherwise, cut in half.  Insert 1 popsicle stick into cut end of banana.  Place on wax paper covered sheet pan in freezer.  Freeze until bananas are frozen through, several hours.
Melt chocolate and butter in microwave safe bowl, 30 seconds at a time, stirring between heatings, until melted. Dip bananas in chocolate, spooning chocolate over them to cover banana completely.  Immediately sprinkle with toppings, or roll in nuts or coconut.  Place on wax paper and return to freezer until chocolate is firm.
If you desire to drizzle chocolate: melt a small amount (about 1/2 cup) white, milk, or dark chocolate in the same way as above, and place in small plastic bag. Snip end of bag, and drizzle over hardened chocolate. Return to freezer again, until chocolate is firm.

Description: 
These chocolate covered frozen bananas are a great summer treat.  The ripe bananas have a wonderful creamy consistency when frozen, and the rich chocolate coating is delicious.  You can vary the toppings to suit your taste, including drizzling with melted white or milk chocolate, or caramel.
