Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups sliced canned beets, juice reserved
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
2 whole cloves
3 black peppercorns
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 small onion, sliced

Directions:
Place the beets into a medium bowl and set aside.
In a medium saucepan, combine vinegar and 1/2 cup beet juice and bring to a boil.  Add sugar, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaf, salt and onion, and return to a boil.  Remove from heat, and pour mixture over the beets. Toss until coated, cover and chill.  Serve the beets very cold.

Description: 
Sweet and spicy; and the juice makes an excellent marinade for pickled eggs. This recipe is great with freshly cooked beets instead of canned, if you have time.
