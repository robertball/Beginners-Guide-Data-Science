Ingredients:
2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 teaspoons ground cumin
½ teaspoon ground cardamom
½ teaspoon hot chile powder
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon ground cloves
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon salt, or more as needed
5 large chicken wings, cut in 2, tips discarded

Directions:
Combine coriander, cumin, cardamom, chile powder, pepper, and cloves in a dry pan over low heat. Stir until fragrant. Remove from heat, add oil and water, and stir until combined. Set spice paste aside.
Rub salt over wings in a shallow dish, then rub spice paste all over. Cover and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Add wings and cook, turning halfway, until well browned, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
