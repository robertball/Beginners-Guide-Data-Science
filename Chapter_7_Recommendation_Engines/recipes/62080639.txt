Ingredients:
1 cup cooked short grain (Japanese) rice
2 bananas (can use 3 small)
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon butter
2 egg yolks
3 tablespoon sugar
1 cup milk
pinch salt
1/2 cup whipping cream (or whipped topping)

Directions:
slice half of one banana and sprinkle it with one tablespoon sugar.  Cut up the remaining bananas and put them in a skillet over medium heat.  No oil is needed.  Stir and mash as the chopped bananas warm until it forms one large slightly browned mass.  The bananas should taste concentrated and be reduced in size.  Remove from pan.  Put 1 cup milk, 2 egg yolks, 3 tablespoons sugar, and 1 cup cooked rice in pan and stir until well blended.  Heat through over low flame until slightly thickened and steamy, stirring constantly.  (This doesn't take very long).  Stir in mashed bananas until well blended and heated through.  Put in fridge or set aside.  Whip cream until peaks hold up.  (I use whipped topping.  Its easier and takes less time.) Stir whipped cream together with rice pudding until well blended.  Chill or serve hot.  For serving, garnish with banana slices.  You can clean the pan and caramelize the sugared banana slices for added flavor or use sugared slices raw.
