Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 quart heavy cream
4 ounces Havarti cheese

Directions:
Melt butter in a medium sauce pan over medium heat.  Whisk in flour.  Remove from heat and add a small amount of cream, stirring to prevent clumping.  Return to low heat and add cheese.  Stir until cheese melts and sauce thickens.
