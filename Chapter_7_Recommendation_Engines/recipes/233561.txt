Ingredients:
½ cup milk
1  egg
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
5  bone-in, skin-on chicken breast halves
2 cups crushed cornflakes cereal

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Stir milk, egg, flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.
Dredge each chicken breast in milk mixture; roll in cornflakes to coat. Transfer to a baking sheet or dish.
Bake until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
