Ingredients:
1/2 onion, diced
2 1/2 tablespoons curry powder
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken broth
1/2 lemon, sliced
1 1/4-inch-thick slices fresh ginger, peeled
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
salt to taste
1 pound assorted mushrooms
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
salt to taste
8 kaffir lime leaves

Directions:
Prepare a saucepan with cooking spray and place it over high heat. Place the onion in the saucepan; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Sprinkle the curry powder over the onion; stir to coat evenly. Add the chicken broth, lemon, ginger, sugar, and salt to the onions. Reduce heat to medium; cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and cook another 3 minutes. Mix in the coconut milk and lemon juice; stir and remove from heat.
Drop the lemon leaves into the soup; allow to sit for 5 minutes. Remove leaves before serving.
