Ingredients:
4 oz. POM Wonderful Juice
2 Tbsp sugar
1 Tbsp cornstarch
1 tsp red pepper flakes
3 Tbsp light soy sauce
3 tsp ginger, minced
3 tsp garlic (3 cloves), minced
1/4 cup orange juice.
1 lb. boneless pork chop
1 whole fresh pomegranate, opened with seeds removed

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce (coconut aminos), ginger, garlic, and orange juice. Pour over pork chops and marinade for 30 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet (or spray a non-stick skillet with cooking spray)on medium-high (8 heat setting)
Layer pork chops in single layer in skillet and brown
for 1 minute.
After 1 minute, turn porkchops, turn heat down to medium low (3 heat setting) and cover while pork continues to cook for 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and let sit covered for an additional 10 minutes (do not remove the lid)
While porkchops are cooking, in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat, mix together the pomegranate juice, sugar, cornstarch, and red pepper flakes. Simmer over medium heat until a thick syrup forms. Remove from heat and set aside.
Remove the pork chops from the pan. Turn off the heat and add the syrup mixture into the skillet. Stir for a couple minutes to thicken and scrape up any pork bits. Spoon the syrup over the pork chops. And sprinkle some pomegranate arils on top.
