1/4 cup whipping cream
3 cups pecans, chopped

Sugar Dough:
3/4 cup butter
3/4 cup sugar
2 eggs

3 cups sifted flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Sugar Dough:
Cream butter and sugar.  Add eggs and lemon rind; beat well.
Sift flour and baking powder together, add to creamed mixture, beat well.
Chill dough until firm enough to handle.
Meanwhile:
Preheat oven to 375.
Grease and flour bottom and sides of a 9x12x1 baking pan.
Once dough is firm enough to handle after being chilled press dough onto bottom and sides of prepared pan.  Dough will be approximately 1/8 inch thick.  Prick dough all over with a fork.
Bake 12-15 minutes at 375 or until dough looks 'half done'.

Filling:
Place butter, sugar and honey in a deep heavy bottomed saucepan stir and boil for 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Cool slightly; add cream and chopped pecans, mix well.  Change oven temperature to 350.
This is when you spread filling over the half baked dough using a buttered wooden spoon or flexible spatula.
Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes.
Cool pan and cut into 1x2 inch bars.
