Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/3 cups fructose (fruit sugar)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup oat bran
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
2 tablespoons water
1 1/2 teaspoons dry egg replacer (such as Ener-GÂ®)
1/2 (14 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin tins with cooking spray.
Mix fructose, flour, oat bran, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl.
Whisk water and egg replacer together in another bowl until smooth. Stir in pumpkin puree and vegetable oil. Add fructose mixture; mix well to blend batter.
Spoon batter into the greased muffin tins, filling each cup halfway.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
