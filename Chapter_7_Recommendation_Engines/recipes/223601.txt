Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups milk (70 to 80 degrees F)
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons butter, softened
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup bread flour
1 egg, beaten
1 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 3/4 cups bread flour
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
Combine milk, sugar, butter, and salt in small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until butter melts. Remove from heat and allow to cool to lukewarm.
Combine 1 cup bread flour, egg, yeast, and milk mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook; beat at lowest speed for 1 minute. Let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Add 2 3/4 cups bread flour; mix at next-to-lowest speed until dough cleans sides of bowl and sticks to dough hook, about 2 minutes.
Place in lightly greased bowl, cover, and let raise in warm place until doubled (about 1 hour).
Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface, punch down to get out air bubbles, and shape into rolls, placing rolls onto 2 lightly greased baking sheets. Cover with waxed paper and let rise for another 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Brush tops of buns with melted butter. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
My entire family absolutely loves these buns with sloppy joes. They hold their shape and don't fall apart when combined with the 'juiciness' of the sloppy joes. I'm not going to buy sandwich buns again. They couldn't compare to these.
