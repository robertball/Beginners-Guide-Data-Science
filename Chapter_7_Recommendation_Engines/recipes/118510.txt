Ingredients:
16 slices bread, crust removed, cubed
1 1/2 cups fresh or thawed frozen cranberries
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
6 eggs
4 cups milk
13 tablespoons sugar, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
ORANGE CUSTARD SAUCE:
3 egg yolks
1/4 cup sugar
1 cup whipping cream
1 orange peel strip (1/4 inch)
1/2 teaspoon orange extract

Directions:
In a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish, layer half of the bread cubes, cranberries and orange peel. Repeat layers. Drizzle with butter. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, milk 3/4 cup sugar and vanilla; pour over bread mixture. Let stand for 15-30 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining sugar. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 65-75 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
For sauce, in a heavy saucepan, beat egg yolks and sugar. Stir in cream and orange peel. Cook and stir over low heat for 20-25 minutes or until mixture reaches 160 degrees F and coats the back of a metal spoon. Remove from the heat; discard orange peel. Stir in extract. Cover and refrigerate until chilled. Serve with bread pudding.

Description: 
'This down-home dessert takes on a touch of elegance when I serve it warm and drizzled with a thin orange custard sauce,' relates Margery Richmond of Fort Collins, Colorado. 'It's so pretty that I often make it for dinner guests using either fresh or frozen cranberries.'
