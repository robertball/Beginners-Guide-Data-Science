Scrambled Eggs, Lindsey's Way Recipe

Ingredients:
4 eggs
6 slices pickled jalapeno peppers, minced
1 teaspoon water
Teeny bit of butter
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley flakes

Directions:
Crack the eggs into a small bowl. Add the minced peppers and the water. Stir with a fork (or whisk) until mostly combined, so about 15 seconds.
Put a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. When pan is hot (but not TOO hot), rub the business end of a stick of butter on it, just enough to give yourself a thin film of butter. Probably about 1/8 of a tablespoon, I guess.
Pour the eggs into the pan. Let them sit for about 30 seconds until you see them start to set on the edges. Then, using a spatula or flattish spoon, push the hardening edges back into the middle of the pan, letting the uncooked eggs flow out to the edge. Continue until eggs are as firm as you like.
Put eggs on plate and sprinkle with dried parsley flakes. Serve!

This is how my girlfriend likes scrambled eggs. And, therefore, how I am required to like them as well. :)
