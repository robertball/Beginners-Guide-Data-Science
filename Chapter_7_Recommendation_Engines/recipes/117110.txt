Ingredients:
2 Italian sausage links, casings removed
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 garlic clove, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1/4 cup tomato paste
3/4 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 egg, beaten
3/4 cup ricotta cheese
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
4 lasagna noodles, cooked and drained
3/4 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Crumble sausage into a small skillet. Add onion and garlic; cook over medium heat until meat is no longer pink. Drain. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar and seasonings. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, 20 minutes. Combine the egg, ricotta and parsley.
Spread 1/4 cup sauce in an 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Trim noodles to fit dish. Layer a third of the noodle pieces over sauce; top with a third of the remaining sauce, a third of the ricotta mixture and 3 tablespoons mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers twice.
Cover; bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes or until browned. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting.
