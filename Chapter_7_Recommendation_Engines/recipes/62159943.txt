Ingredients:
1/2 lb. Fajita Steak
1 oz. vegetable oil
1 oz. olive oil
1/4 cup diced onion
1 garlic clove minced
1/2 jalepeno pepper diced
1/4 cup fresh chopped cilantro
1/2 cup water
1 tsp. dried oregano
1-1/2 tsp. ground cumin
1/2 tsp. chili powder
1/2 tsp. paprika
1 cup grated Chihuahua Cheese
1/2 lime juiced
4 (8 inch) tortillas
Lettuce/Salsa/Sour Cream as desired for Garnishment

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook garlic, jalepeno and onion together for about 10 seconds before adding meat.  Brown meat and drain any excess drippings.  Mix oregano, cumin, chili powder and paprika into 1/2 cup of water, and pour over meat, continue cooking for about 5 minutes on low heat.  Pour lime juice over meat about 15 seconds before removing from heat.
Brush one side of each tortilla with olive oil.  Cover 2 tortillas with Chihuahua Cheese (on non-oiled side).  Spoon meat mixture over cheese, sprinkle on cilantro, and cover the meat mixture with another layer of cheese (this will help secure the tortilla) and place the other two tortillas on top.
Grill the quesadillas on medium or medium-high heat for about 2 minutes on each side or until cheese is melted and tortillas are crispy.
Serve with lettuce/salsa/sour cream if desired.

Description: 
Simple and easy to make, consider substituting 8 oz of sliced sirloin for the fajita steak, and you can use monterey jack cheese if you don't have access to Chihuahua Cheese.
