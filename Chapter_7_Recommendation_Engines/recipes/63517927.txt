Ingredients:
1 single pie crust
3 eggs
1 (14 oz) can (1 1/4 cups) sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup lemon juice (more or less to taste)
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp cream of tartar
6 T sugar

Directions:
Allow eggs to stand at room temperature at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 325F.
Prepare and roll out pastry for single crust pie.  Line a 9" pie plate with pastry.  Trim and crimp edge.
Separate egg whites from yolks being very careful not to get any yolk or oil from hands into the whites. Set whites aside.
Filling: In mixing bowl, beat egg yolks.  Gradually add sweetened condensed milk.  Mix in lemon juice.
Pour filling into pie crust.
Bake for 30 minutes at 325F.
Make meringue about 5-8 minutes before pie is done in oven: In large mixing bowl combine egg whites, vanilla, and cream of tartar. Beat with mixer on medium speed about 1 minute or until soft peaks form (tips curl).
Gradually add sugar, 1 T at a time.  Beat on high speed about 4 minutes more or until forms stiff, glossy peaks (tips straight) and sugar dissolves.  Do not overbeat (will look and break like styrofoam).
Remove pie from oven.
Increase oven heat to 350.
Immediately spread meringe over hot pie.  Seal edges by pushing meringue into the crimped edges to prevent shrinking.
Bake for 15 minutes at 350F.
Cool on wire rack for 1 hour
Chill 3-6 hours or eat warm.
Do NOT put hot pie in refrigerator or meringue will shrink and become watery.
