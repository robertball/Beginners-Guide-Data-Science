Ingredients:
1 cup of rolled oats
1 cup of all-purpose flour
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
1/2 teaspoon of salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon
1/4 cup of finely chopped walnuts, toasted
1/3 cup of raisins
1/3 cup of chopped dates
1 stick of butter (1/2 cup), melted and cooled
1 cup of buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg, beaten

Directions:
1 Preheat the oven to 400Â°F and grease a twelve-slot muffin tin or line the slots with paper baking cups.
2 Mix together the rolled oats, flour, brown sugar, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, walnuts, dates, and raisins. In a separate bowl mix together the buttermilk, egg, vanilla extract, and butter.
3 Pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture and stir together. Be sure not to over-stir as that will cause the muffins to develop too many gluten bonds. It should be thick and gloppy. About 10 seconds of stirring should do; just enough to barely bring the ingredients together. Scoop into prepared muffin tray and bake for 20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in the tray for a minute or two before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
