Ingredients:
6 tablespoons Dijon mustard
6 tablespoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons unsweetened apple juice
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
4 (8 ounce) bone-in pork loin chops

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first four ingredients; mix well. Pour 2/3 cup marinade into large resealable plastic bag; add the pork chops.  Seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade for basting.
Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Drain marinade from pork. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 6-10 minutes on each side or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C); basting occasionally with reserved marinade.

Description: 
'My mom gave me the recipe for these savory chops with a sweet and tangy marinade,' relates Babette Watterson from Atglen, Pennsylvania. 'The apple juice and Dijon mustard complement the pork nicely. With a vegetable and some rice or pasta, you have a meal.'
