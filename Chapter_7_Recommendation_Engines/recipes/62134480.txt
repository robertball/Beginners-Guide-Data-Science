Ingredients:
5 cups flour
1 tsp Baking Powder
1 tsp salt
1 lb lard
1 egg
3 TBSP Brown Sugar

Directions:
Mix together first 4 ingredients (flour, baking powder, salt and lard)with pastry blender or 2 knives until resembling coarse crumbs.
In a 1 cup measuring cup gently mix together remaining 4 ingredients (egg, brown sugar, vinegar, water). Just add enough water to fill the 1 cup measuring cup. (If dough is too crumbly add 1 tsp water at a time until it sticks together)
Divide into 3 equal amounts. Wrap in plastic wrap and store in fridge. Will keep in fridge about 2 weeks. Can be frozen. Makes enough for 3 double pie crusts.
