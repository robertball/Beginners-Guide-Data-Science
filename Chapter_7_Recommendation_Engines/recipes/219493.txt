Ingredients:
1 pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie
1 (15 ounce) can pitted sour cherries, drained
2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
1/2 cup white sugar
1/8 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat  oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Unroll the pie crusts, and cut 2 6-inch rounds from the dough; cut the remaining dough into 1/8-inch strips for a lattice crust. Fit the rounds into 2 5-inch mini pie dishes.
In a bowl, stir together the cherries, tapioca, sugar, and almond extract; let the filling stand for 5 minutes to soften the tapioca. Stir the filling again, and spoon into the pie shells. Use the strips to weave a lattice crust on each pie, and pinch the crusts together.
Bake in the preheated oven until the crusts are golden brown and the filling is bubbling and thickened, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool before serving.

Description: 
I used to always make a traditional cherry pie and there would always be half a pie left over after serving. I love this mini version because I can make just two at a time. Perfect for me and my husband when we are eating dinner together.
