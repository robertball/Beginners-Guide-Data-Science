Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch ground nutmeg
2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream, or more to taste
1 (8 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese, or more to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Drain thawed spinach in a sieve and press out as much liquid as possible with your hands. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and place 1 sheet of puffed pastry on each baking sheet.
Combine cream, feta cheese, and garlic in a blender; blend until smooth.
Distribute spinach evenly over the 2 puff pastry sheets, leaving a border on all sides. Spread feta cheese mixture on top of the spinach.
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed up and lightly browned on the edges, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
The recipe makes 2 baking sheets full. We call it puff pasty pizza in our house and it tastes best at room temperature or cooled. Great for parties or a buffet, cause you can make it the day before. Use salt sparingly as feta cheese is salty.
