Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds Tyson® Crispy Chicken Strips
1 (8 ounce) package vermicelli pasta
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup onion, diced
4 Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes, with juice
1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
1 (8 ounce) package fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place Crispy Chicken Strips on a foil-lined baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 18 to 20 minutes.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.
While Chicken Strips and vermicelli are cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and saute garlic and onion for 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and heat for an additional 5 minutes. Stir in diced tomatoes and sauce; bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in tomato paste, salt, pepper, and basil and continue to heat for 10 minutes.
When Crispy Chicken Strips are cooked, remove from oven and leave on the same baking sheet. Place 1 slice of mozzarella cheese on each Chicken Strip and cover with 1/4 cup of the basil tomato sauce. Return to the oven and heat for 5 minutes or until cheese has melted. Serve over drained vermicelli.
