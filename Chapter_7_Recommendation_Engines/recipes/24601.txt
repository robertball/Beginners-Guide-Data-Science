Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package fresh or frozen cranberries, coarsely chopped
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, with juice
2 cups white sugar
1/2 pint heavy whipping cream
1 cup chopped walnuts
2 cups miniature marshmallows

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the cranberries, pineapple (with juice) and sugar.  Let stand for about an hour, to let sugar dissolve, and then pour the mixture into a strainer over a bowl.  Let drain, covered, in the refrigerator for at least two hours, or overnight. (Note: The drippings make a wonderful cranberry punch, when mixed with lemon-lime soda!)
Before serving, whip the cream until soft peaks form.  (You can sweeten the whipped cream with a little sugar, if desired.)  In a large bowl, mix together the cranberry mixture, walnuts and marshmallows.  Fold in the whipped cream and store in refrigerator until serving.
