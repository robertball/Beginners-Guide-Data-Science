Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4  chicken thighs
1 large onion, halved lengthwise and cut into thick slices
1 tablespoon minced garlic
½ cup unsulfured apricots, halved
½ teaspoon ground ginger
½ teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon ground allspice
1 cup beer (preferably lager)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken thighs on both sides until golden, about 3 minutes per side. Set chicken aside, then stir in onion and garlic; cook for 1 to 2 minutes until the onion has softened. Stir in apricots and season with ginger, cumin, and allspice. Cook for 1 minute until spices are fragrant.
Pour beer into pan, scraping the bottom of the pan to dissolve the browned bits. Add chicken, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer gently until the chicken begins to fall away from the bone, about 30 minutes.
