Ingredients:
4 squares unsweetened chocolate
3/4 cup (1-1/2 sticks) butter or margarine
2 cups sugar
4 eggs
1 cup flour
1 14-oz. package of soft caramels, unwrapped
1/3 cup whipping cream
2 cups chopped pecans or walnuts
1 pkg. (12 oz.) semi-sweet chocolate chunks/chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Line 13x9-inch baking pan with foil, with ends of foil extending over sides of pan. Grease foil.
Microwave chocolate and butter in a large bowl until butter is melted (~2 min.) Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Stir sugar into chocolate mixture until well blended. Mix in eggs. Stir in flour until well blended. Spread half of the brownie batter into a prepared 13x9-inch baking pan.
Bake at 350°F for 25 minutes, or until the brownie is firm to the touch.
Heat caramels and cream in a saucepan on the stove. Stir until everything is melted and smooth. Stir 1 cup of nuts into the caramel.
Gently spread the caramel mixture over the baked brownie. Sprinkle with ½ of the chocolate chunks. Spread remaining brownie batter over the top, sprinkle with remaining chocolate chunks and nuts. Some caramel may peek through, that’s no problem.
Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes more, or until the brownie is firm to the touch. Cool in pan on wire rack. Once cool lift out of pan and onto cutting board. Cut into 24 squares.
