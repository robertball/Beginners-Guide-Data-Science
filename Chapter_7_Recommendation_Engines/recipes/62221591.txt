Ingredients:
15 lbs whole bone-in ham
1 lb brown sugar
1/2 cup yellow mustard
aluminum foil

Directions:
In a medium size mixing bowl, mix yellow mustard and brown sugar until you have a thick"paste".
Take all wrappers off of ham and trim away excess fat.
Line baking pan (I spray with Pam in case some of the brown sugar mixture escapes, clean up is easier) with Aluminum foil.
Place ham on foil and spread brown sugar/mustard paste on top.
Fold and seal foil.
Do not open again until ham is done.
Bake at 350Â° for 4 hours.
Let set for about 1 hr then carve.
One of the best tasting hams you will ever have!

Description: 
Found on RecipeZaar -by Boopster. Boopster says I love this recipe because it is so easy, and calls for hardly any ingredients and always have these in my pantry. This recipe came from a good friend's mother, who was always asked to bake the ham for get-togethers and family dinners. Now I get those requests. People who ordinarily aren't too fond of ham, rave over this one. After I carve, I spoon a little of the glaze over the meat in the platter-yummmm!
