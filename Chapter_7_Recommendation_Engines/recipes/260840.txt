Ingredients:
Salmon Bake:
1 (3 ounce) fillet salmon fillet
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 brioche buns, halved
1 tablespoon butter
1 yellow onion, sliced
3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Season salmon evenly with salt, pepper, and dill. Drizzle with lemon juice. Transfer to a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Toast brioche buns on a baking sheet in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Toss in onion slices and stir occasionally until brown and soft, about 15 minutes.
Spread cream cheese on the bottom half of each bun. Place one half of the salmon fillet on each bun and top with onion.
