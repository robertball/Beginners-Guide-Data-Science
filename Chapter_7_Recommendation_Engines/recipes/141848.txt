Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons peanut oil
15 cloves garlic, peeled
3 tablespoons Shao-Hsing cooking wine or dry sherry
2 tablespoons light soy sauce
1 1/3 cups chicken stock

Directions:
Season chicken with salt and black pepper. Toss with flour until coated.
Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke. Add chicken, and stir fry until the pieces are lightly browned on the outside, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn heat to medium and stir in whole garlic cloves; continue stir frying for 5 minutes.
Turn heat to low, and add Shao-Hsing wine, soy sauce, and chicken stock. Cover, and simmer for 20 minutes until the chicken is tender. Remove garlic cloves before serving.
