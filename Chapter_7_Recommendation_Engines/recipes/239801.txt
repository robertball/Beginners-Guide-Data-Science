Ingredients:
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
1 1/2 cups gram flour (chickpea flour)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup lukewarm water, or as needed
4 large potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced lengthwise

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk gram flour, salt, cayenne pepper, cumin seeds, and baking powder together in a bowl. Stir lukewarm water into flour mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, until batter has a thick pancake-batter consistency.
Dip potato slices in batter until well-coated.
Working in batches, cook coated potatoes in hot oil, turning once, until golden and crispy, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a paper-towel lined plate to drain.
