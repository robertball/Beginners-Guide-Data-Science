Ingredients:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil - for frying
5 Eggs
3 Potatoes - sliced to about ¼in to ½in thick
½ onion - chopped
Salt and freshly ground Black Pepper

Directions:
In a large frying pan, add sufficient oil to cover and fry the potatoes;
Cover and fry over a low heat for some 10 minutes or so until soft; It is very important that the potatoes are soft and not crunchy;
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat the eggs and season with some salt and pepper;
When the potatoes are soft, remove from the pan and mix, without breaking, into the egg mixture and let stand for some 5 minutes or so;
Drain the oil and set aside in a dish;
While the mixture of eggs and potatoes are resting, chop fry the onion in a little oil for some 5 or so minutes until softened;
When ready, spoon into and mix well the egg/potato mixture;
Pour 2tbsp of oil back into the pan and heat until hot;
Pour in the egg mixture and fry over medium heat;
After a couple of minutes or so, turn the tortilla over (be careful here but using a plate is probably the easiest and most secure way);
When turning you can add another 1tbsp oil to ensure the tortilla doesn’t burn or stick when you return to the pan.
When done on both sides can serve hot (in slices or whole) or leave to cool and eat;
