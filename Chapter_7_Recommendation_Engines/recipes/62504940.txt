Description: 
I am posting this recipe in honor of my grandmother who passed away last night. This has been my favorite Christmas cookie since I was a child. My Grandma would have these on her cookie tray every year. Now, my mom and I make them every Christmas. They are nothing fancy, but I just love them, I hope you do too!Modified from: Chocolate Spritz Christmas Cookies
