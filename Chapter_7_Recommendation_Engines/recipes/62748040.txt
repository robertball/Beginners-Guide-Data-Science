Ingredients:
Red bell pepper, sliced
20 asparagus spears, approximately
2 slices of onion, rings all punched out
Small can of sliced mushrooms
Shredded pizza cheese
Extra virgin olive oil
Salt and Pepper
Dill weed
Dried basil
2 sandwich size slices of a parmesan garlic french bread

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. On a cookie sheet lined with tin foil, arrange peppers, asparagus, and onions.  Drizzle about two teaspoons olive oil over veggies.  Season with salt and pepper and mix together. Roast in oven for 15 minutes.
Heat grill pan on medium heat.  Brush grill pan and bottom of bread slices with olive oil.  Place bread on pan and alternate in a single layer the roasted asparagus spears and red pepper slices.  Top with the roasted onions and some mushroom slices.  Put a handful of the shredded pizza cheese on the veggies.  On the bottom of the top slice of the bread drizzle olive oil.  Sprinkle with a little dill weed and dried basil.  Place on top of cheese.  Wrap a brick with tin foil and smash it down on top of the sandwich.  When the bottom is light brown and there are grill lines, brush the top of the sandwich with olive oil and flip.  Smash down with the brick.  When the bottom is browned and has grill lines, remove and slice sandwich in half and serve.
