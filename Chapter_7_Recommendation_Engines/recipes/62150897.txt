Description: 
Living in Cape Verde, West Africa, far away from home, I make this inexpensive, fast and easy comfort recipe at least once a week.  Of course, those of you back in the States will be able to find the ingredients a lot easier than I do here, and you won't have to have your mom send you the spices!
