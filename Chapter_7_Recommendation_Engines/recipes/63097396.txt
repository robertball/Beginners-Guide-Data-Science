Ingredients:
2 8oz packages of light or fat-free whipped cream cheese
1 can refried beans
2 TBsp chili powder
2 tsp cumin
1 tsp tumeric
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1 16oz jar salsa, medium. (Use hot if you like more spice!)
2 cups shredded low fat mixed mexican cheeses
1-2 cans sliced black olives - to your taste
1 lg bag low fat baked taco chips

Directions:
Make this in about a 11"x13" flat pan.  Let the cream cheese come to room temperature for easier spreading, and spread evenly in bottom of pan.
In a medium skillet, heat the refried beans over medium heat.  Add the chili powder, cumin, tumeric, salt, garlic powder and onion powder and mix in well. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.  You can also add tabasco if you really want to turn up the heat!  When the beans are heated through and a spreadable consistency, layer them on top of the cream cheese.
Next spread the salsa in the next layer.
Then sprinkle the mexican cheeses as the next layer.
Finally, add the black olives to the top, sprinkling them evenly over the top.
Cover with cling wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate until cool, about two hours.
Serve with low fat baked taco chips.

Description: 
This is a great dip for parties and get togethers, and by using low fat ingredients you get a dip that doesn't skimp on flavor. Seasonings are easily adjusted to your personal taste, and it goes great with taco chips or scoop chips.  I never have leftovers on this one, people love it!
