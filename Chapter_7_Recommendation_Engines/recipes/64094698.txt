Ingredients:
24 chicken leg quarters
1 1/4 cups lemon juice (may use reconstituted but fresh is better)
1/3 cup fresh ginger, finely minced
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1/2 cup olive oil
1 1/2 tsp granulated garlic (or one whole head fresh)
1 tsp rubbed sage
1/3 tsp red pepper flakes
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp paprika

Directions:
To prepare marinade, combine all ingredients(except chicken)in a blender.
Remove all excess skin and fat from chicken. Pour marinade over each of the chicken quarters to evenly coat until no marinade remains. Place in a large sized (2 1/2 gallon resealable) plastic bag and marinate three to five hours under refrigeration.
When ready to prepare, preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Remove chicken from marinade and discard any remaining marinade. Bake chicken for 30 to 40 minutes or until chicken is browned well. (Internal temperature should read 165 degrees F. When using an instant read thermometer be sure not to touch bone when taking temperature.)
Place chicken in serving dish and sprinkle chicken with paprika. Garnish with slices of lemon and a sprig of curly parsley.
