Ingredients:
2 Medium Eggs
1 Bagel
1 TBSP butter
Pinch of pepper

Directions:
Cut the bagel in half and then cut the centre of the bagel large enough to accommodate a medium sized egg.
Heat up butter in a pan, preferably cast iron. Once pan is heated and butter has melted, turn down to medium heat.
Place bagel halves, cut side down into the pan. Toast for one minute.
Crack an egg into each of the bagel centres and sprinkle pepper on top. Cook for approximately two minutes (will vary according to pan type and heat)
Turn off heat completely and flip bagel halves gently. Let sit for approximately five minutes.

Description: 
This is a delicious variation of Toad in the Hole. I started making this because I don't always have bread, but I almost always have bagels.
