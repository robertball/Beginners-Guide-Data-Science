Ingredients:
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
½ cup canola oil
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
2  limes, zested and juiced
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
½  jalapeno pepper, ribs and seeds removed, finely minced
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts

Directions:
Combine chiles, canola oil, cilantro, lime zest and juice, garlic, jalapeno, honey, salt, and pepper in a 1-gallon freezer bag and seal completely. Gently massage the bag to combine ingredients well. Add chicken and turn to completely coat with marinade. Place in the refrigerator and allow to marinate for at least 4 hours for best flavor, turning bag occasionally.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
Grill chicken, covered, on the preheated grill until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear, 4 to 6 minutes per side.
Remove chicken from the grill and let rest under aluminum foil to redistribute juices back into the meat, 4 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
I came up with this cilantro-lime marinated grilled chicken when I was craving Mexican food one night. Try using the marinade on pork tenderloin or beef flank steak. Amazing! Use one recipe of marinade per pound of meat.
