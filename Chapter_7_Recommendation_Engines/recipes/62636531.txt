Ingredients:
2 hard-boiled eggs
4 ounces sausage meat or 2 sausages
1 beaten egg for coating
very fine breadcrumbs
deep oil

Directions:
If using sausages, remove skins and using a little flour; shape each one on a board into a circle large enough to wrap around each egg.
Coat eggs completely with meat, making sure all the joints are sealed. Dip the sausage covered eggs into beaten egg and then toss in breadcrumbs.
Toss gently to remove excess crumbs. Fry in hot oil until evenly browned. Drain on kitchen paper.
Serve hot or cold.
Garnish with parsley, watercress or tomato wedges and accompany with a salad if you want.
