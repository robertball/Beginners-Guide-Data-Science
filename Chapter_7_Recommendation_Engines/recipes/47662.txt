Ingredients:
1/3 cup miso paste
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1/4 cup chopped green onion, white and green parts separated
1/3 cup ground pork
1 (14 ounce) package tofu, cubed

Directions:
Whisk miso into the water until dissolved; set aside.  Heat the sesame oil in a frying pan or wok over medium-high heat.  Cook the white parts of the green onion until lightly colored and fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Stir in the ground meat, and cook for a few minutes until nearly done.
Gently stir in the tofu with the miso paste.  Bring to a simmer, and cook for a few minutes to warm the tofu.  Sprinkle with the green parts of the green onions before serving.
