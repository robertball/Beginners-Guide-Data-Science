Ingredients:
Chicken:
4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons curry powder
4 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
6 garlic cloves, minced
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips
Sauce:
1 cup of plain Greek yogurt Â– I used Fage
4 tablespoons tahini
4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 garlic cloves, minced
Other:
8 pitas
1 head romaine lettuce, chopped
16 tomato slices

Directions:
Combine the ingredients up to the chicken in a large bowl. Add the chicken, toss to coat and let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes.
To make the sauce combine the yogurt, tahini, lemon juice, salt and garlic, combining with a whisk or a fork.
Heat grill pan on stove with medium-high heat. Alternately you can grill the chicken outside on your gas grill. Place all of the chicken on the grill pan and cook for five minutes, turn and cook for another five minutes or until internal temperature is 160 degrees.
If using a outdoor grill, place pita on rack and grill for one minutes on each side or until lightly toasted.
Assemble pita by topping with lettuce, tomato slices, chicken pieces and sauce to your liking!

Description: 
Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern sandwich composed of meat, simply seasoned & spiced, slowly cooked on a vertical rotating spit, then portions are shaved off the block of meat. It is wonderfully flavored! Since probably most home cooks do not own a vertical spit alternate adaptations to the recipe have evolved. This recipe is from Cooking Light.
