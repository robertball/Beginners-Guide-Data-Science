Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 large yellow onion
1 cup finely chopped celery
1 cup finely chopped carrots
2 cups chopped baby portobello mushrooms
1 green bell pepper, diced
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup Pinot Grigio wine
1 teaspoon salt
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
4 (28 ounce) cans organic whole peeled tomatoes (such as San MarzanoÂ®), with juices
6 tablespoons dried parsley
3 tablespoons dried oregano
3 tablespoons dried basil
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add oil to the warm pot and heat until shimmering, 1 to 2 minutes. Add onion, celery, and carrots; cook and stir until the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and bell pepper; cook until softened, 3 to 5 minutes.
Make a well in the center of the veggies and add garlic to the bottom of the pot. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, then stir garlic into the veggies. Stir in wine and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt, tomato paste, and then all 4 cans of tomatoes. Break up tomatoes with a potato masher.
Puree sauce with an immersion blender until all veggies and tomatoes are broken up and smooth. Cook sauce until hot and bubbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Add parsley, oregano, basil, 1 tablespoon salt, red pepper flakes, and bay leaf. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes.
Let sauce cool completely, then store in the refrigerator until flavors marry, 8 hours to overnight.
Transfer 1- or 2-cup portions of sauce into airtight containers or 1-quart resealable plastic freezer bags and store in the freezer for up to 4 to 6 months.
