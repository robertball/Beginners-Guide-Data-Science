Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds Portuguese linguica sausage, cut into 1/2-inch think slices
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium onions, chopped
6 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
8 cups chicken broth
4 medium white potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1 pound kale, stemmed and cut into strips
1 cup cannellini beans, drained
salt to taste

Directions:
Saute sausage slices in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer sausage to a plate, leaving any fat in the skillet.
Add olive oil to the skillet and heat oil over medium heat; stir in onions. Cook and stir until the onions begin to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Return sausage to the pot and add chicken broth, potatoes, and pepper; bring to a boil. Add kale and cannellini beans, reduce heat slightly, and simmer until sausage is cooked through and potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Season with salt.
