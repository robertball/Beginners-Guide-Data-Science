Ingredients:
2-3 lbs yellow squash
9" cornbread - cooked & cooled
2 cans Cream of chicken soup
2Tb butter (or oleo)
1 large onion - chopped
1 large bell pepper - chopped
3-4 stalks celery - chopped
3-6 eggs
1 lb Velveeta (mexican if you can find it)

Directions:
The time varies depending on if you already have the cooked cornbread, or if you have to make that as well. I normally will make the cornbread up a day or two ahead, as well as chop all the veggies. The times listed are for that method.
Make a 9" skillit of cornbread. let cool. Take about 4-8 yellow squash (depending on size, about 2-3 lbs) and boil until soft. While the squash is cooking, put the cornbread in a bowl and cut with a butter knife (dull bladed dinner knife) until crumbly. I know there are other ways to crumble it, but there really is a difference. Melt butter in skillit, saute veggies until soft, let cool. Mix soup with eggs (I use between 3 and 6 eggs depending on how it looks). Add cooled veggies, stir well. Stir into cornbread. Add squash and "enough" of the water. Should be the consistancy of oatmeal. (lumpy & soupy at the same time) Stir in salt & pepper. Cut cheese into 1" cubes and stir in. People use between 1/2lb and 1 lb depending on how well they like cheese. I use the mild mexican, but others will prefer the hot. Pour/slide into baking dish allowing at least 1-2" growing room. Bake at 350f until done, lightly brown, and not runny (from the eggs). Allow to settle for 10-15 minutes. stuffing...but this is one of my favorite dishes.
