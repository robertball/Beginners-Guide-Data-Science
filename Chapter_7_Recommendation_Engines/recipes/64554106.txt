Title:
Leslie's Random Acts of Kindness Casserole Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 6-ounce piece of wild smoked salmon, pulled into small pieces
1 16-ounce package dried pasta (corkscrew-shaped fusilli works well)
1 16-ounce package frozen petite peas
1 pint cream
salt and pepper, to taste
1 cup plain breadcrumbs
Lemon zest from 1 lemon
Juice of 1 lemon
1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 cup Italian flat-leaf parsley, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Prepare pasta, according to the package directions, but cooking it at least 3 minutes less than recommended. The pasta should be just shy of al dente, so still fairly chewy because it's going to bake in the oven for a short time.
Before draining, place the frozen peas in a large colander and drain pasta over the frozen peas.
Return the pasta and the peas to the pot and stir in the smoked salmon and the cream, mixing well. Taste and season with salt and freshly ground pepper.
While the pasta is cooking, make the topping by combining the breadcrumbs, the lemon zest, lemon juice, the olive oil and parsley. Mix lightly with a fork.
Place the pasta mixture in a casserole dish and top with the seasoned bread crumb mixture. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes. If refrigerating the casserole before cooking it, double the baking time.

Description: 
I make this easy peasy, one-pan pasta dish for new parents or stressed-out friends and it always seems to make the evenings go a little more smoothly. The smoked salmon and green pea combo plays up the salty-sweet flavors loads of people crave, and the lemon zest/breadcrumb topping brightens up what could be an over-the-top rich dish.
