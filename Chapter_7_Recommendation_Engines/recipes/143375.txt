Ingredients:
3 stalks celery, sliced thin
1 large onion, coarsely chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup ketchup
1 cup barbeque sauce
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
1 cup beer
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar, packed
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed of fat
16 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
To make the sauce, combine the celery, onion, garlic, ketchup, barbeque sauce, mustard, beer, cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, chili powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl; stir until well blended.
Place the chuck roast in a slow cooker. Pour the sauce evenly over the meat. Cover and cook the roast on HIGH for 3 hours. Reduce heat to LOW, and continue cooking until very tender, about 4 hours more.
About 1/2 hour before serving, remove the chuck roast from the slow cooker and shred the meat with a large fork. Return the meat to the slow cooker, and cook uncovered so the sauce thickens, on LOW for 20 minutes.
To serve, dip the flat sides of hamburger buns into the sauce and top with meat.

Description: 
This recipe is adapted from a famous local favorite served at Ting-Town, a drive-in closed since 1970, in the Iron Range or Arrowhead region of northeastern Minnesota. Serving the beef on hamburger buns makes the dish extra authentic.
