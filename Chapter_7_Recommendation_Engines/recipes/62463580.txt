1 pound lean ground beef
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  teaspoon Italian seasoning
2-3 medium tomatoes chopped with a splash of water
3/4 cup sour cream
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese
Pasta Shell:
1 (7 ounce) package uncooked spaghetti
1/3 cup shredded Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese
1 egg

Meanwhile, heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add ground beef; cook 8 to 10 minutes, breaking up into 3/4-inch crumbles and stirring occasionally. Remove from skillet with slotted spoon; pour off drippings. Return beef to skillet; season with 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and cumin; stir in tomatoes. Bring to a boil; cook 3 to 5 minutes or until liquid is almost evaporated, stirring occasionally.
Reserve 2 tablespoons beef mixture for garnish. Stir sour cream into remaining beef; spoon into pasta shell. Place 1 cup cheese in center, leaving 2-inch border around edge. Spoon reserved beef mixture onto center of cheese; bake in 350 degrees F oven 15 minutes or until heated through.
