Ingredients:
¼ cup all-purpose flour for coating
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon dried oregano
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded 1/4-inch thick
4 tablespoons butter
1 cup sliced mushrooms
2 tablespoons Marsala wine
2 tablespoons red wine
1 tablespoon sherry, or to taste
¼ cup chicken broth

Directions:
Mix flour, salt, pepper, and oregano together in a shallow dish or bowl. Coat chicken pieces in flour mixture, shaking off excess.
Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet; pan-fry chicken in butter until lightly brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn over chicken and add mushrooms. Pour Marsala wine, red wine, and sherry into the skillet. Cover skillet and simmer, turning once, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This was a great recipe and I make it a little healthier by cutting down the wine and sherry and only frying in butter instead of butter and oil.
