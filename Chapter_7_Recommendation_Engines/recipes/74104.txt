Ingredients:
1/4 cup port wine
1/4 cup pilsner or dark beer
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 1/2 cups shredded Swiss cheese
1 (1 pound) loaf sourdough bread, cubed

Directions:
Heat a pan over medium heat, and pour in the port wine. When the wine is heated, pour in the beer. Sprinkle in the nutmeg, and simmer for about 5 minutes to burn off the fumes. Whisk in the cheese a small amount at a time until smooth. Remove from heat, and let stand for a minute. (A good time to drink the rest of the beer.) Serve with chunks of sourdough bread.

Description: 
I don't know if this was done in the 70's, but I happened to throw these together for a fondue night with some really rustic sourdough and it was awesome. Port wine and beer blend with Swiss cheese in this no nonsense fondue. If round sourdough is hard to find, use a baguette sliced into rounds.
