Ingredients:
-Crust
3/4 Cup Butter, Melted
100 grams Graham crackers (1 cup)
-Cheesecake
2 Cups Whipping Cream
80 grams sugar (2/3 Cup)
160 grams Honey (1/4 Cup)
1 Lemon Squeezed
2 blocks Cream Cheese, Softened
1 3/4 tsp Powdered Gelatin
1/4 Cup Lukewarm Water
-Sauce
6 oz Raspberries
1/4 Cup Water
1/4 Cup Sugar
-Garnish
Mint Leaves

Directions:
1. Smash graham crackers until you get crumbs. Melt butter. Combine.
2. Line an 8-inch spring-form pan with baking paper along the bottom. Press crust down in an even layer on the bottom of the pan. Set in the freezer to chill.
3. Whip the cream slightly using a hand mixer. Add in the sugar, honey, and lemon juice. Whip until soft peaks form.
4. Whip in the softened cream cheese.
5. Allow gelatin to bloom by sprinkling it over the 1/4 cup water. Wait about 5 minutes, or until gelatin has absorbed the water. Microwave about ten seconds, and stir to smooth out any lumps. When it is room temperature, add to the mix and stir through.
6. Sieve the cheese mixture. Spread it into the springform pan, so that the crust is completely covered and the top is smooth. Set in the fridge for about three hours, or overnight.
7. To make the raspberry sauce, add the water, sugar, and raspberries to a saucepan over high heat. Allow to come to a boil, stirring every few minutes, for about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain out the seeds. Chill the raspberry sauce until ready to use.
8. Finally, garnish cake with mint leaves. Serve each slice with a generous portion of the raspberry sauce. Enjoy!
