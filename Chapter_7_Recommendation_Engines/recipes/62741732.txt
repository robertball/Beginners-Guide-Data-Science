Description: 
A friend introduced me to the best of two worlds (chocolate and veggies) with hidden benefits!  My kids have no idea that this yummy Zucchini Chocolate Carrot Cake combination has real zucchini and carrots in it.  This is a chocolatey moist cake that is somewhat, guilt free.  I have nicknamed it the OMG Cake because my taste buds have died and gone to heaven!!!
