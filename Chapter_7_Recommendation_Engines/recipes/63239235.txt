Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 pound chicken breast, cut into bite sized pieces
1 cup onion, diced
1 cup celery, cut into small pieces
1 cup carrot, cut into small pieces
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons flour
3 cups chicken stock
* Franks Red Hot Sauce or wing sauce to taste (I used 1/4 cup)
1-2 cups of potatoes, peeled and cut into bite sized pieces
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup blue cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large sauce pan over medium heat.
Add the chicken and saute until golden brown, about 8-10 minutes.
Add the onion, celery and carrots and cook until tender, about 10-15 minutes.
Add the garlic and flour and cook until fragrant, about a minute.
Add the chicken broth and deglaze the pan.
Add the hot sauce and potatoes, bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes until potatoes are tender.
Reduce heat to low. Season with salt and pepper, mix in the cream and blue cheese and remove from heat when the cheese has melted.
