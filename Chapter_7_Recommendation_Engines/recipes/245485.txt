Ingredients:
Pie:
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
3 eggs
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup honey
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch ground cloves
1 pinch salt
1 (9 inch) graham cracker crust
Topping:
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup honey
1 cup coconut flakes
1/2 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix pumpkin puree, eggs, cream, 1/2 cup honey, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt together in a bowl until smooth. Pour filling into pie crust.
Bake pie in the preheated oven until filling is almost set and edges are beginning to brown, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove pie from oven.
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat; stir in 1/4 cup honey. Add coconut and almonds; toss to combine. Spread over pie.
Place pie back in the oven and bake until topping is toasted and golden, about 10 to 15 minutes more.
Remove pie from oven and allow to cool completely.
