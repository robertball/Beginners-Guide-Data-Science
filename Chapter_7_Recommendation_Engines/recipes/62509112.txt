Ingredients:
* 1 lb chicken strips
* 3 eggs, beaten
* 1/2 cup and 3 tsp cornstarch
* 5 dried pepper pods
* 1-1/2 tbsp rice vinegar
* 2 tbsp sherry
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 can of pineapple rings
* 1 small bottle of Peanut Oil

Directions:
In a large bowl, thoroughly blend the 1/2 cup of cornstarch and the eggs; add the chicken and toss to coat. If the mixture bonds too well, add some vegetable oil to separate the pieces.
In a small bowl, prepare the sauce mixture by combining the 3 tsp cornstarch with the sherry, vinegar, sugar and soy sauce.
First-Stage Frying: Heat 1-2 inches of peanut oil in a wok to medium-high heat (350-400o). Fry the chicken in small batches, just long enough to cook the chicken through. Remove the chicken to absorbent paper and allow to stand (this step can be performed well in advance, along with the sauce mixture, with both refrigerated).
Second-Stage Frying: Leave a tablespoon or two of the oil in the wok. Add the pepper pods to the oil and stir-fry briefly, awakening the aroma but not burning them. Return the chicken to the wok and stir-fry until the pieces are crispy brown.
The General's Favorite Sauce: Add the sauce-mixture to the wok, tossing over the heat until the sauce caramelizes into a glaze (1-2 minutes). Add the juice from the can of pineapples, stir just long enough for the juice to reach the serving temperature. Serve immediately. Serves 4, along with steamed broccoli and rice.
