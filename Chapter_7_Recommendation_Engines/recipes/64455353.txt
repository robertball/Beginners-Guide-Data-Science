Ingredients:
2 portobello mushrooms, whole
4 ounces roast beef (deli), sliced thin
4 ounces hard salami or pastrami (deli), sliced thin
1.5 ounce fresh mozzarella cheese
1 Roma Tomatoes, sliced
1 handful (2 oz) basil, fresh (or spinach)
bell pepper, sliced and roasted or sauteed
1/4 cup marinara sauce
sprinkle Italian seasoning
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oven to 350F
Wash mushroom and remove stem. Be careful not to break the mushroom.
Using a small spoon, scrape the "gills" or dark, flaky layer under the cap located around the stem. Remove this until you see white underneath.
Build the sandwich: lay one mushroom cap with the round side down
lay basil (or spinach) to cover the mushroom; about 15 leaves or more
lay sliced Roma tomatoes
lay the sliced Roast Beef (let it hang over the side a little)
lay the Mozzarella cheese on top
spread the Marinara sauce on top of cheese
sprinkle a little Italian seasoning on top
top with the other mushroom cap
Secure the sandwich with a skewer. You may also need to support the edges with aluminum foil around the base to make sure the sandwich stays upright.
Bake in oven for 15 minutes (at 350F) or until mushrooms are thoroughly cooked.
