PASTRY

1/2 tablespoon cumin powder
1 tablespoon hot chili powder
1/4 cup crisco shortening, cold
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter (do not substitute)
1/3 cup cold, flat beer
Sift flour, cumin,chili powders & salt into a food processor. Cut in butter and crisco until crumbly. Add the cold beer, a little at a time, until dough leaves side of processor bowl.Lightly flour a silicone pastry matt and roll out the dough about 1/8-inch thick. Cut out 8-inch circles. (I use the cover of the Crisco can for a circle; not quite 8 inches, but it works) Cover with wax paper or damp cloth until ready to use. You can place the dough in the refrigerator overnight. If you do refrigerate, remove the dough at least 15 minutes before using.

MEAT FILLING:
In heavy skillet, heat oil and saut√© onion and garlic until they become limp. Add the ground beef,salt, pepper, cumin powder & thyme and mix well. Brown the meat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the harissa and combine all the ingredients well. Add the rest of the spices, the bread crumbs and the beef stock. Cover skillet & simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. When all liquids have been absorbed, filling is ready. It should be moist but not watery. Remove the skillet from the stove, cool the meat filling and preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Uncover the dough circles; place 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling on half of each. Moisten edges of dough with egg/beer mixture and fold the dough circle over the meat filling. Pinch the edges closed with a fork. Lightly brush pastry with a mixture of egg/ beer. Bake on lightly greased baking sheet for 20 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown.
