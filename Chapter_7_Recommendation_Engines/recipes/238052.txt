1 (15 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 (14 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup diced bell pepper
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 5x7-inch casserole dishes.
Stir cream-style corn, whole kernel corn, Cheddar cheese, eggs, butter, flour, bell pepper, sugar, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl; divide between prepared casserole dishes.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of either casserole comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
