Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 medium shallots, diced
1 medium fennel bulb, diced
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds, crushed
2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary, divided
1 large tart, firm apple (like Granny Smith), diced
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon apple brandy
1/2 cup crumbled Gorgonzola dolce or other blue cheese
2 bacon strips, cooked crisp, fat drained and crumbled
1 3/4 pounds boneless pork loin roast, butterflied
Kitchen twine
Reynolds Wrap® Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the garlic and shallots and cook on medium heat until fragrant and translucent, about 1-2 minutes. Add the fennel, fennel seed, 1 tablespoon of the rosemary, apple, salt, black pepper, honey, vinegar, and apple brandy. Cook on medium heat until the apple and fennel are browned, about 15 minutes. Fennel should be soft but not mushy and still have some firmness. Remove the filling from heat and cool to room temperature. Toss in the blue cheese and the crispy bacon.
Line a baking sheet with a heavy sheet of Reynolds Wrap® Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil, making sure the sheet is long enough to wrap up over the ends of the roast. Layer another two sheets of Reynolds Wrap(R) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil over the first one. Set aside.
Place the pork loin fat side down on a work surface, season the inside lightly with salt and pepper and then evenly spread the filling. Roll the pork up lengthwise and tie it securely with kitchen twine. Rub with remaining olive oil and season evenly with kosher salt. Heat a large heavy skillet (big enough to hold the entire loin) over high heat until very hot. Add the pork loin and brown very well on all sides, about 1 minute per side.
Using tongs, place the roast in the center of the foil. Sprinkle with pepper and the rest of the rosemary. Bring up foil sides. Double fold top and ends to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside.
Bake the wrapped loin for 45 minutes or until an instant-read meat thermometer reads 130 degrees F. Let the pork rest, wrapped, for 10 minutes. Open packet carefully by cutting along top fold with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape; then open top of foil packet. Slice and serve.
