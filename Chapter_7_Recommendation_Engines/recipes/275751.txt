Ingredients:
2 large carrots, cut in half
2 large stalks celery, cut in half
1 large onion, quartered
3 large cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
1 fryer chicken
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons low-sodium chicken base (such as Better Than BouillonÂ®)
1 8-inch square of cheesecloth, or as needed
3 sprigs fresh thyme
3 sprigs fresh rosemary
4 large fresh sage leaves
16 cups water, or as needed

Directions:
Place carrots, celery, and onion in a large stockpot. Place garlic on top of vegetables, making sure it does not touch the bottom of the pan. Lay chicken on top of garlic. Add enough water to cover chicken by about 1/2 inch. Add pepper and chicken base.
Make a bouquet garni bag by placing cheesecloth on a work surface and adding thyme, rosemary, and sage leaves. Tie cheesecloth into a bundle, and place in the stockpot.
Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is falling apart, no longer pink at the bone, and the juices run clear, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove chicken to a large shallow bowl, allow to cool, and reserve for later use. Strain broth into a very large bowl, discarding vegetables, garlic, and bouquet garni bag.
