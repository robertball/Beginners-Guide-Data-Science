Ingredients:
2 pounds beef eye of round roast
1/4 cup Dijon-style mustard
1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1 cup beef broth
1 small onion, cut into thin wedges
1/4 cup water
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
1/2 cup low-fat milk
3 tablespoons whole wheat flour

Directions:
Trim fat from beef. In a small bowl stir together 2 tablespoons of the Dijon-style mustard and the pepper; rub onto the beef. Place the beef on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer. Roast beef in a 325  degrees F oven until thermometer registers 140 degrees F for medium-rare (1 1/2 to 2 hours) or 155  degrees F for medium (1 3/4 to 2 1/4 hours). Cover roast with foil and let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. The temperature of the meat after standing should be 160  degrees F.
Meanwhile, for sauce, in a medium saucepan combine the mushrooms, beef broth, onion, water, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and thyme. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, about 5 minutes or until vegetables are tender. In a small bowl stir together milk and remaining Dijon-style mustard; gradually stir into flour. Add to mushroom mixture in saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1 minute more.
To serve, thinly slice beef across the grain. Arrange on a serving platter. Spoon some of the sauce over beef. Pass remaining sauce.
