Ingredients:
⅔ cup uncooked white rice
1 ⅓ cups water
2  eggs
2 teaspoons milk
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives (optional)
1 teaspoon dried onion flakes (optional)
2 teaspoons butter

Directions:
Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow rice to cool.
Whisk together the eggs and milk in a large bowl. Stir in the cooked rice, salt, pepper, and chives or onions, if desired.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium high heat. Using a 1/2 cup measure, spoon pancake shaped scoops of rice mixture into hot skillet. Cook until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.

Description: 
This is a great use for leftover rice.  These pancakes can be eaten alone for breakfast, or served as a side dish for dinner.  I even take them to work and eat them cold for a snack.
