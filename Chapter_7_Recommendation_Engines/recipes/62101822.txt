Ingredients:
1 tbsp cooking oil
1 clove garlic
1/2 cooking onion
1 package extra-lean ground chicken, defrosted
2 Green or Red Peppers
3/4 cups rice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a medium size pan to medium heat with about a tbsp of oil. Peel and chop the clove of garlic and onion and sautee them in the pan. Add the chicken, check it occasionally.
Cut around the stem of the pepper, making a hole about 3-4 inches in diameter. Scoop out the seeds and white-ish parts of the pepper, discard. Cover in saran wrap and place in the fridge.
Cook the rice according to directions on the box, or using your favourite recipe. When the chicken is thoroughly cooked, mix it together with the rice. Scoop into the pepper and press in. Serve as is!
