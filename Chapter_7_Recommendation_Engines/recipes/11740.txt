Ingredients:
3 tablespoons tahini
1/8 cup lemon juice
1 cup plain yogurt
3/4 cup water
3 cloves garlic
1/4 cup olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 large portobello mushrooms, sliced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
1/2 cup chopped parsley
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, cook pasta 10 to 12 minutes, or until al dente.
While pasta is cooking, stir together tahini and lemon juice.  Place in a food processor with yogurt, water, and garlic cloves; process until smooth.
Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until soft.  Add the mushrooms, and cook until soft. During the final few minutes of cooking add the bell pepper; the pepper should be still crispish.
Drain the pasta.  Toss with the yogurt-tahini sauce, chopped parsley, and freshly ground black pepper. Serve the vegetable saute over the noodles.
