Ingredients:
1 cup peanut butter
2/3 cup honey
1/2 cup coconut oil (no substitutes, this is what gives its creamy texture and flavor)
2 cups oats (not instant)
1 1/4 cups mini chocolate chips
3/4 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
In a medium sized saucepan, melt together peanut butter, honey and coconut oil.
Remove from heat and add oats, chocolate chips and dried cranberries. Stir until combined and chocolate chips are melted.
Spread into a 9x13 pan. Refrigerate until hardened, about an hour. Store in refrigerator.

**these are a healthy snack and to die for!!**

 it is sorta like a chocolate oatmeal no bake cookie, but extra creamy and special. it almost reminds me of fudge, but with the added texture of the oats and occasional chewy sweetness of the dried cranberries--yum!
