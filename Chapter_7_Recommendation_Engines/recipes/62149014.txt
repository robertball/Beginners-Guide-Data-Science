Pour batter into prepared pan and bake for 20-30 minutes or until toothpick inserted near center comes out clean. Cool completely.
Meanwhile, for Ganache, place chocolate in a small bowl. In a small saucepan, heat cream and bring just to a boil. Pour hot cream over chocolate and whisk until smooth. Allow to cool slightly before using.
For filling, in a medium bowl, combine cream cheese and butter and mix to combine. In a double boiler or microwave, melt white chocolate and shortening and mix well. Add to cream cheese and beat just until smooth.  While mixture is beating, add extract and food coloring, if desired.  Fold in Frango mints. Smooth filling over top of cooled brownie base and chill until firm, about two hours. Top with Ganache and chill until firm; 30- 60 minutes. To serve, remove sides of spring form pan, garnish as desired. Cut into small wedges.
