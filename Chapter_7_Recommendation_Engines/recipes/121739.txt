Description: 
'My husband and two kids rave over these moist chops,' reports Robin Czachor of Appleton, Wisconsin. 'Use the mild sweet-and-sour sauce to make a gravy that can be served over mashed potatoes or rice,' she suggests. 'Then add a salad and you have a very satisfying meal that didn't keep you in the kitchen for hours.'
