Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
1/4 cups brown sugar
1/4 cups Karo syrup (or honey)
1/4 cups peanut butter (smooth)
2 1/2 cups Rice Krispies Cereal
1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1/2 cups mini m&ms
2 ounces milk chocolate candy (coating plus extra for drizzle.)

Directions:
1. In a saucepan over medium heat, stir together the brown sugar, butter, honey (or Karo) and peanut butter. Cook until evenly combined and smooth, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and add vanilla, stirring in. Pour over the Rice Krispies in a large bowl and stir until evenly coated. Spread into a greased 8x9" baking dish and sprinkle with mini m&m's, pressing them into the bars gently, chill for at least 1 hour or overnight.
2. Remove from the dish and place the wax paper into the bottom. Melt the chocolate down and pour into the dish. Spread evenly and place the bars on top and chill again until chocolate is hardened. Remove from the dish, cut into bars and drizzle with remaining chocolate. Store in an airtight container for one week.
