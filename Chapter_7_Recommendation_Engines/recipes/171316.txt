Ingredients:
2/3 cup Safeway SELECT™ Blackberry Preserves
1/3 cup O Organics™ Pure Country Style Orange Juice
4 firm-ripe peaches or nectarines
1 pint Safeway SELECT™ French Vanilla Ice Cream

Directions:
Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, medium-high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 3 to 4 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions).
While grill heats, in a small bowl mix jam and orange juice. Halve and pit peaches; if pit cant be removed easily, use a paring knife to cut around pit to remove.
Place peaches with cut sides down on oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook until cut edges begin to brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Turn peaches over with tongs. Spoon about 1 tbsp. of the jam mixture into the hollow of each peach half and continue cooking until fruit is hot, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Lift peaches to a platter.
Spoon a 1/2-cup scoop of ice cream into each of 4 dessert bowls and, with tongs, set peach halves in bowls. Drizzle fruit equally with remaining jam mixture and serve immediately.
