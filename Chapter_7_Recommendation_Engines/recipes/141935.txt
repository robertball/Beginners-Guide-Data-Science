Directions:
Place the apples in a medium serving bowl and sprinkle with sugar, lemon juice and salt. Stir in the celery, dates and walnuts.

Description: 
I've kept this recipe from my Grandmother. Apples, celery, dates and walnuts are dressed in a light fluffy marshmallow cream. It's very good and children seem to love it.
