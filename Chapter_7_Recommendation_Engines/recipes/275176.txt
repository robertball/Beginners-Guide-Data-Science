Ingredients:
2 slices bacon
2 tablespoons minced shallot
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/4 cups chicken stock, divided, or more to taste
2 ears fresh corn, kernels cut off
1/2 cup arborio rice
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup white wine
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch granulated garlic
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add bacon to the hot pot and cook until crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove bacon to a rack to drain. Add shallot and garlic to the pot and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Mix in 1 cup chicken stock. Stir in corn kernels, rice, and butter. Pour in remaining 1/4 cup chicken stock and white wine. Cancel Saute function.
Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
While risotto is cooking, chop bacon.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Add chopped bacon, Parmesan cheese, oregano, granulated garlic, and salt and stir until thoroughly combined. Add more chicken stock, 1 tablespoon at a time, if risotto is too dry.
