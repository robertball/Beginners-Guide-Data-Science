Ingredients:
1/3 cup soy sauce (I used reduced sodium)
2 tbsp fresh lime juice
2 tbsp minced garlic
2 tbsp fresh peeled minced ginger
2 tsp curry powder
6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1 tsp cornstarch
1 tsp water

Directions:
In a glass container or a ziploc bag, combine soy sauce, fresh lime juice, minced garlic and ginger, and curry powder. Stir the ingredients together. Add the chicken breasts. Cover and refrigerate for 1-3 hours.
Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Spray with cooking spray. Remove the chicken from the marinade and reserve it. Cook it on the grill until done, about 4-6 minutes per side.
When the chicken is done remove it from the grill and let it rest.
While the chicken is cooking, pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with the water and stir to combine. Add the cornstarch mixture to the marinade. Add chicken broth. Bring the sauce to a boil and cook until the sauce has thickened a bit (10-14 minutes).
Serve curry-soy sauce over the chicken.

Description: 
This recipe is great for curry lovers or people who want to give a little bit of curry a try. You can easily just grill the chicken and not bother with cooking the marinade into a sauce. Delicious both ways! 

I served this with Saffron RIce (1 cup rice sauteed with a little bit of olive oil, then added saffron threads steeped in 1/2 white wine + 1 1/2 chicken broth = 2 cups cooking liquid total). The sauce is delicious over the rice as well!
