Description: 
I'VE SHARED this recipe with many friends who also cook for two. We all agree - small recipes are hard to find!    This dish remains one of my favorites since it takes little effort to prepare and is so tasty. Plus, if you are serving a larger group, it is easy to double. -Margery Bryan, Royal City, Washington
