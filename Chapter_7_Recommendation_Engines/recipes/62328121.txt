Ingredients:
10 ounces baby spinach
10 ounces sliced strawberries (divided)
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/3 cup quality balsamic vinegar
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced shallot
1 tablespoon warmed honey

Directions:
To make the vinaigrette, combine balsamic, shallot, garlic and one of the strawberries (crushed). Slowly whisk in the oil. Combine spinach, strawberries and dressing, serve immediately.
If your not going to eat this all at one serving, pour a little of the dressing over individual servings instead of mixing it all together.

Description: 
A delicious, light side to what was an otherwise heavier meal. The salad and dressing was only 78 calories, with 6 grams of fat and 1 of fiber. If you're worried about fat intake, substitute chicken broth for half the oil or make it a creamy dressing and substitute non-fat Greek yogurt.
