Ingredients:
3  sweet potatoes
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained (reserve liquid) and rinsed
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons tahini
2 tablespoons lemon juice
½ teaspoon lemon zest
¼ teaspoon ground cumin
¼ teaspoon ground coriander
¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Poke holes all over sweet potatoes with a fork.
Roast sweet potatoes in the preheated oven until soft, about 45 minutes; let cool. Cut sweet potatoes in half lengthwise.
Combine garbanzo beans and olive oil in a blender and pulse several times to mash. Scoop flesh out of sweet potato peels and add to the blender; pulse to combine. Add tahini, lemon juice, lemon zest, cumin, coriander, white pepper, and sea salt to mixture; blend until smooth, adding reserved garbanzo bean liquid as needed to make a smooth, creamy hummus.

Description: 
I wanted something easy and fitting for an autumn gathering. I found this recipe and altered it to make it even easier to make. It is a nice combination of naturally sweet and typically savory. Serve with pita wedges, crackers, or cut veggies.
