Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 large onions, peeled but whole
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon tomato paste
4 cups tomato sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup water
1 pound spaghetti

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Cook garlic in oil until slightly browned.  Stir in tomato paste, tomato sauce, salt, pepper, basil and water.  Once heated, add the whole onions to the sauce. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes, until thickened and the onions are cooked through.
While sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Toss sauce with hot pasta.
Serve onions to those who want them!

Description: 
Stewed onions make up the bulk of the flavour in this tomato sauce for spaghetti. I have adapted it using a method my ex-mother in law taught me. Leave the onions whole in the sauce to allow the flavour to amalgamate then give the onions to those people who enjoy eating them! No problems for the kids.Modified from: Onion Spaghetti
