2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 cups shredded peeled potatoes

In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour; mix well. Stir in potatoes, Swiss cheese, onion, salt, pepper and cayenne pepper. In a large skillet, heat butter and oil over medium heat. Drop batter by 1/4 cupfuls; press lightly to flatten.
