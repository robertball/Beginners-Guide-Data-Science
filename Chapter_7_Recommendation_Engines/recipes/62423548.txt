Description: 
I found this chipotle sauce in Padma's Hot and Spicy cookbook.  She called it chutney and used it to make hot wings. I have found SO many ways to spice up other items: chili, burgers, and mayo.  I double the recipe, place in 1 cup freezer containers, and pull out by Tablespoons as it soft freezes.  Thanks to Padma, my husband falls in love with me all the time.
