Ingredients:
6 medium beets, scrubbed and ends trimmed
1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon cracked black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dill

Directions:
Thinly slice beets to about 1/16-inch thickness using a mandoline. Place beet slices in a bowl and add salt. Toss to combine. Allow beets to sit about 30 minutes. Drain excess liquid.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Pour olive oil over beets and toss to combine. Mix together garlic powder, black pepper, and dill in a small bowl. Sprinkle over beets and toss to coat. Place beet slices on baking sheets in a single layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until crispy, 40 to 50 minutes. Sprinkle with additional salt, if desired.
