Ingredients:
4 Poblano peppers
1 lb Ground Turkey
2 tsp Taco Seasoning
4 oz Green Chili peppers
4 oz Cream Cheese
1/2 cup Salsa
2 Green onions chopped
3 oz Monterey Jack Cheese shredded

Directions:
In a large skillet or wok, brown the meat; drain off any excess grease. Stir in the seasoning and chiles. Add the cream cheese in spoonfuls and blend into the meat well. Stir in the salsa and green onions; adjust the seasoning with salt. Simmer a minute or two until the sauce is bubbly. Add the Monterey jack cheese; cook and stir until the cheese melts.
Roast peppers under a broiler or on the grill. Put peppers in zip top bag when charred, let steam for 15 min. Peel off the outer skin being careful not to tear the peppers. Slice down one side and remove the seeds. Take stuffing and add to the peppers. Bake for 20 min.
