Kittencal's Easy Cinnamon Flop (Cinnamon Brunch Cake) Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups sugar (add in more for a sweeter taste)
1 1/4 cups milk
1-2 teaspoon vanilla (optional) or almond extract (optional)
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 pinch salt
1 large egg (optional)
TOPPING
1/2 cup brown sugar, more if desired
1-2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup melted butter
chopped walnuts (optional) or pecans (optional)

Directions:
Set oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare a greased 13 x 9-inch baking dish, or two 8 or 9-inch round cake pans (although the batter will seem like it will fit into only one 8 or 9-inch pan, this flop rises very high and will run over the sides if baked in just one pan).
In a bowl mix the 2 cups flour, 1-1/4 cups white sugar, milk, vanilla or almond extract, baking powder, pinch of salt and egg (if using) until just combined careful not to overmix.
Pour into prepared baking pan/s. Generously spread brown sugar and cinnamon on top. If desired sprinkle chopped walnuts or pecans over top. Drizzle melted butter over top. Bake for about 20-25 minutes for 8 or 9-inch round cake pan, and about 30 minutes for a 13 x 9-inch pan.
(My family really enjoyed this and I think I'll be making this pretty often. I like that it's versatile and you can pretty much add whatever your imagination can come up with. I added vanilla to the batter and will try the egg next time.)
