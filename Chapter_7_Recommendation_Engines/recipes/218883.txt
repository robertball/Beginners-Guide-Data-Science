Ingredients:
1 egg
1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more if needed
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 (15 ounce) can unsweetened crushed pineapple, drained
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour 18 muffin cups, or line with cupcake liners.
Crack the egg into a measuring cup, then pour enough vegetable oil to make 1/2 cup. Whisk the egg and oil together in a large bowl with the ricotta cheese until smooth. Stir in the pineapple, then add the white cake mix. Stir until just combined. Evenly distribute the batter into 18 muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes.  Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
These muffins take only minutes to put together, require little clean up and are easy enough for even inexperienced cooks to make! I have used white, yellow, and French vanilla cake mix with this. They all turn out well, but the white cake mix is my favorite. These muffins are good when first baked, but they are best when served the next day.
