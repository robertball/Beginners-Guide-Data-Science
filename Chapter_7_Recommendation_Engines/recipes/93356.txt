Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package Jimmy Dean Regular Roll Sausage, cooked, crumbled, drained
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup green onions, chopped
1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped green chiles
2 (4.5 ounce) packages crepe shells
Topping:
1 1/2 cups sour cream
8 ounces butter
1/2 cup salsa

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In large mixing bowl, combine cooked sausage, shredded cheese, cream cheese, onions and chilies; mix well. Spread about 3 tablespoons of filling along the right side of each shell; roll shell over filling to form a log. (To make triangle-shaped crepes, spread filling over one quadrant of each crepe; fold in half, then fold in half again).
Place filled crepes on a lightly greased cookie sheet and bake 12-15 minutes, until heated through.
Topping: melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat; stir in sour cream and heat until warm. Drizzle 1 tablespoon over each baked crepe and top with your favorite salsa or chopped tomatoes and cilantro.
