Description: 
Sauteed chicken breasts topped with a mayonnaise/mustard/rosemary spread and graced by 2 slices of garlic rosemary focaccia bread. These sandwiches are great when you want a quick supper, but not something from the freezer.  They remind me of an expensive sandwich from an upscale deli. The spread and the chicken can be made in advance, and the chicken can be eaten hot or cold.
