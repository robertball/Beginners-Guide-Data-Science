Ingredients:
3 pounds red potatoes, peeled and sliced
6 ounces Gouda cheese, shredded, divided
3 tablespoons butter
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In the prepared dish layer 1/2 of the potatoes, 1/2 of the cheese, then the remaining potatoes.
Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat.  Saute garlic until fragrant and golden brown; pour over potatoes.
Combine cream, salt and pepper; pour evenly over potatoes and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 75 minutes.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
An unbelievable rich twist on au gratin potatoes, this casserole develops a caramelized, cheesy, roasted-garlic crust as it bakes. However, this dish does not save well (leftovers tend to separate and become oily), so eat up!  Wonderful with a ham dinner.
