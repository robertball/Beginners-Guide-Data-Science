Ingredients:
3 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
2 tablespoons light sour cream
2 tablespoons jalapeno-flavored cream cheese
2 tablespoons butter
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; cook until tender, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine cilantro and jalapeno in a food processor. Process until finely chopped, about 30 seconds. Add sour cream and cream cheese. Blend for another 30 seconds.
Drain potatoes and transfer to a bowl. Mash with a potato masher. Beat in jalapeno mixture and butter. Season with salt.
