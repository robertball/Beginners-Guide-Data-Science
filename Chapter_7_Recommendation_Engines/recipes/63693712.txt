Ingredients:
1 Tbsp olive oil
2/3 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
5 - 6 cups cubed bread (Italian, French, artisan or mixture)
4 eggs
2 cups half & half (or milk)
2 tsp prepared basil pesto
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella
1/4 cup grated pecorino romano cheese
1 Tbsp Italian seasoning
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
2 tbsp chopped parsley
1/2 cup diced pepperoni (or crumbled cooked Italian sausage)
1/4 cup grated parmesan
Add'l 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella
1 Tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease a 2-quart casserole baking dish (or 9x9 deep dish pan)
In skillet over medium heat, heat 1 Tbsp olive oil; saute onion and garlic until tender and translucent - about 10 minutes.  Stir in sun-dried tomatoes and saute another 5 minutes until softened. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
Place bread cubes in prepared baking dish.
In separate bowl, whisk together eggs, half & half, pesto, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper, red pepper flakes and parsley.  Stir in onion mixture, 1 1/2 cups mozzarella and 1/4 cup romano cheeses, and pepperoni.  Pour over bread cubes - stir to combine.  (Add more half & half or milk, if necessary - bread should be moistened)
Top with additional mozzarella and parmesan, and drizzle with 1 Tbsp olive oil.
(You can let this sit or refrigerate for a few hours, if desired)
Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown.  Let sit at least 10 minutes before serving, or serve at room temperature.

Description: 
Pepperoni-pizza flavor in a savory bread pudding.  Came up with this to use up some stale bread and cheese.  Would love to add some mushrooms and peppers, but didn't have any on hand.  I served this with a fresh tomato/basil salad.
