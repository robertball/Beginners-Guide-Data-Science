Ingredients:
4 corn tortillas (I used Mission ®)
1 Tbsp Corn oil (or to taste)

Directions:
Set airfryer to 200° C.
Brush each tortilla with 1/4 tsp oil. Cut into fourths.
Place each triangle into the basket, separating each one. It's ok if they are overlapping. Close the drawer. Set timer for two minutes.
Shake at two minutes, use tongs to separate.
Cook one minute more and check for doneness.
Place the chips on a piece of paper towel. Serve hot.

Description: 
The crunchiest, tastiest tortilla chips made in an airfryer. Barely any oil needed and takes very little time and effort. They can be used for nachos or your favorite dip.
