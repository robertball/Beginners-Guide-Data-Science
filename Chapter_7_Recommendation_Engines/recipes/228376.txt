Mix milk, sugar, vanilla bean with seeds, and a pinch of salt together in a saucepan. Cook and stir over medium-low heat until sugar is dissolved and milk is warm, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove vanilla bean and add farro to milk mixture. Cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Farro perlato is the Italian word for emmer wheat. It is a wheat grain, actually a kernel that resembles barley from Popola di Foligno in the heart of Umbria. I have been looking for ways to incorporate this grain that has lots of fiber and protein into our meals. Enjoy this creation!
