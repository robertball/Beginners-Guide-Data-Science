Description: 
This simple squash and sausage stew represents my idea of the perfect summer supper. It's very comforting, relatively fast, wonderfully flavorful, and helps solve a problem that's existed since neighbors started planting gardens: what to do with all that squash! Serve it with a big slice of crusty bread for dipping into the broth.
