Ingredients:
1  16-ounce loaf  frozen bread dough, thawed
2  medium  potatoes, finely chopped (2 cups)
1  medium  red or green sweet pepper, cut into bite-size strips
1/2  cup  sliced green onion
2  tablespoons  margarine or butter
1/2  cup  mayonnaise or salad dressing
1/2  cup  dairy sour cream
2  tablespoons  snipped fresh parsley

1- 1/2  cups  diced fully cooked ham

Directions:
On a lightly floured surface, roll bread dough into a 16 x 12-inch rectangle. Press dough into the bottom and up the sides of a greased 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking pan. Prick generously with a fork. Bake in a 375 degree F oven about 20 minutes or until light brown.
Meanwhile, in a large nonstick or well-seasoned skillet cook potatoes, sweet pepper, and green onion in margarine or butter over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender, stirring often.
In a medium mixing bowl stir together mayonnaise or salad dressing, sour cream, parsley, and pepper; spread over hot crust. Top with potato mixture and ham. Sprinkle with cheddar or Swiss cheese.
Bake about 12 minutes more or until cheese melts and pizza is heated through. Makes 6 servings.
