Ingredients:
1 box yellow cake mix
3 eggs
1/3 cup oil
1 1/3 cup water

Directions:
Grease and flour cake pan.  I used a 26 ounce coffee can, with 'the top cut off. I floured it with cake mix.  Set aside.
Put cake mix into a bowl and add wet ingredients, according to instructions.Beat according to instructions on the box.
Pour cake into the prepared pan.  place pan into the crock-pot.  Cover with 2 paper towels to prevent water from dripping onto the cake.  Cover.
Cook on HIGH for 4 hours.  Turn off slow cooker and allow to cool until you can handle cake pan.  (I used pliers to get it out of the pot.)  Allow to cool at least 30 minutes before removing from the pan.  Cake will be about 4-inches high, and can be cut into layers.

Description: 
From 'Crock-Pot Slow Cooker Cuisine by RIVAL, I found recipes for baking cakes in a slow cooker.  It called for a Rival Bread-N-Cake bake pan, which I couldn't find, so I improvised. I think that it came out pretty good!
