Ingredients:
6 medium beets, trimmed and scrubbed
2 tablespoons aged balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons real maple syrup
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Wrap beets loosely in aluminum foil and place on a rimmed baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a knife or skewer, 50 to 60 minutes. Unwrap and cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Peel beets and cut into chunks.
Mix vinegar and maple syrup together; season with salt and pepper. Pour over beets. Refrigerate until beets absorb the flavors, at least 1 hour. Serve cold.
