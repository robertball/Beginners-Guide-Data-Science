Ingredients:
10 pieces bone-in chicken drumsticks or thighs
2 cups buttermilk
4 Cups flour - divided
2 T Garlic salt
1 T Paprika
1 T Pepper - divided
2 1/2 tsp. Poultry Seasoning
2 Eggs
1 1/2 Cups water
1 tsp. Salt
Vegetable cooking oil

Directions:
Pour buttermilk in a large bowl and add chicken pieces.  Set in the refrigerator for a couple hours.  Place a baking sheet in oven and heat oven to 250 degrees.
In a large plastic bag or bowl, combine 2 2/3 cups flour, garlic salt, paprika, 2 1/2 tsp. pepper and poultry seasoning.  In another bowl, beat eggs and water; add salt and remaining 1 1/3 cups flour and 1/2 tsp. pepper.  Dip chicken pieces in egg mixture then dredge in flour mixture.
In a large cast iron skillet fry chicken in small batches until nicely golden in color and juices are clear.  As chicken pieces come out of the oil, place in warm oven. Continue cooking all the chicken.  When all the chicken is in the oven, turn heat up to 350 degrees and bake for another 15 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe tastes like good old fashioned fried chicken.  It takes a bit of work to make but it's worth it!  We serve this with smashed taters & gravy, corn on the cob, greens, and biscuits.
