4 cups chicken stock
2 cups quinoa
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound asparagus, chopped
2 green bell peppers, chopped
1 red onion, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, or more to taste (optional)

Directions:
Combine chicken stock and quinoa in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat.

Pour in 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar and cook until reduced, about 4 minutes. Add lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Stir in cooked quinoa. Drizzle 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar over pilaf before serving.
