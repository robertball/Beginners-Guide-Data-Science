Image:

Ingredients:
1 pound pork roast, diced
3 teaspoons minced garlic
1 (15 ounce) can gandules (pigeon peas), drained (such as Goya®)
1 cup recaito (such as Goya®)
1 (1.41 ounce) package sazon seasoning with achiote
1 (5 ounce) jar pitted green olives
3 cups long grain rice, rinsed
water as needed

Directions:
Heat a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add pork and saute until browned, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and heat until fragrant. Add gandules, recaito, sazon seasoning, and olives. Reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes.
Add rice to the pot and stir to coat. Add 1 1/2 cans' worth of water; bring to a boil and cover. Simmer until rice has absorbed most of the liquid and formed a "crust" on the bottom, 20 to 30 minutes. Stir mixture near the top, avoiding the crust, after 20 minutes.

Description: 
Very tasty Puerto Rican rice and beans recipe. Thanks Anita for the recipe! My kids LOVE the crust and fight over it. Great with hot sauce. You can also add leftover chicken. It's a very forgiving recipe.
