Ingredients:
cooking spray
12 ounces shredded carrots
2 extra large eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup granular no-calorie sucralose sweetener (such as Splenda®)
1/2 cup canola oil
1/4 cup applesauce
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon gluten-free baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 (12 fluid ounce) can crushed pineapple, partially drained
1 cup gluten-free flour (such as Tom Sawyer™)
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
Frosting:
1 (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup granular no-calorie sucralose sweetener (such as Splenda®)
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon buttery spread (such as Smart Balance®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray.
Place shredded carrots in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover and cook in the microwave until slightly softened, about 3 minutes.
Combine eggs, white sugar, and 1/2 cup sucralose sweetener in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until thick and creamy. Add canola oil, applesauce, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; beat until well blended.
Fold carrots and pineapple into the bowl until well mixed. Add flour and xanthan gum; mix batter until no floury streaks remain. Scrape batter into the prepared pan using a rubber spatula.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, at least 20 minutes.
Combine Neufchatel cheese, confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup sucralose sweetener, cream cheese, and buttery spread in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until frosting is light and fluffy.
Spread frosting over cooled cake.
