Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar

Icing:
1 1/4 cups powdered sugar

Sift flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a large bowl.
Cream butter and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy. Mix in lemon juice. Add flour mixture gradually, beating well after each addition.

Slice chilled dough into roughly 1/8-inch slices. Place onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and golden, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely, 15 to 30 minutes.
Combine powdered sugar and lemon juice in a bowl until smooth. Frost cooled cookies.
