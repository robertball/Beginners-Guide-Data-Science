Description: 
I wanted to create a simple drink during a Green Bay Packers game. I thought green and yellow, lemon and lime.  Unbeknownst it was during the same game where B.J. Raji scored his first touchdown in the championship game between the Packers and the Bears. His last name sounded pretty cool for this. Enjoy!
