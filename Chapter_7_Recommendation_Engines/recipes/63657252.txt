Chipotle Chicken Lettuce Cups Recipe

Ingredients:
1 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil,
1 cup frozen corn (Phase 4 only) All other dieters could just use more bell peppers instead of corn
1 pound chicken breast
2  3 chipotle peppers (depending on your love of heat)
3 Tbs. adobo sauce (that comes from the jar)
1/2 cup freshly chopped cilantro
1 lime
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
3 scallions, thinly sliced
1 head butter lettuce, rinsed and leaves separated
coarse salt and freshly ground pepper

Directions:
Turn on the broiler. Arrange the corn on a rimmed baking sheet with a tsp of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Broil the corn for about 5 minutes, or until they start to slightly char and turn crispy. You can toss them a couple of times throughout. Set aside. (Again corn is only ok for Phase 4 dieters) Phase 1-3 dieters should just skip this step.
Heat the remaining olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and sear for 6 minutes on each side until cooked through and browned all over. Move to a cutting board and let sit for 5 minutes. Then dice the chicken.
In a food processor, combine the cilantro, lime juice, chipotle peppers and the adobo sauce. Process until smooth.
Add the chicken back to the pan, along with the chipotle sauce, freshly diced red bell pepper and roasted corn. Toss until combined.
Serve a couple of Tbs. (or more if you’re a freak like me) of the chicken mixture in each lettuce cup and garnish with scallions!
