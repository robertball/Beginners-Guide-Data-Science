Description: 
I love soup in those large authentic pho bowl (54 Ounce).  The key to any Pho soup is the stock, you can add to stock garlic, cinnamon stick, and star anise.  I like to make my own chicken stock but you can doctor up chicken broth.  Making this soup is a lot easier than you probably think it's going to be.  Most of the work is preparing the vegetables to be a garnish for your soup.  I had some leftover beef from a chuck roast that I used in soup.
