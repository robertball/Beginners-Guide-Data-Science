Description: 
My niece is allergic to cinnamon, so I came up with this variation of a classic sweet potato casserole with pecans recipe. This recipe is for a 3-quart slow cooker, but it can be easily doubled for a 6-quart slow cooker. I prefer to use fresh mashed sweet potatoes as it makes the recipe less sweet, but canned will also work.
