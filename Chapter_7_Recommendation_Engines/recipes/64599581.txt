Ingredients:
1/2 stick butter
1/3 flour
12 oz beer of choice
1 lb flank steak, well seasoned
2 halves bell peppers, 1 red, 1 green
1 package egg noodles
2 cups milk
1 small brick cream cheese
1 package cheddar cheese
1 package pepper jack cheese

Directions:
Step 1:
Remove steak from freezer. When thawed, season with cumin, chili powder and balsamic drizzle. Broil in oven at 375Â° for 25 minutes.
Step 2:
Throw noodles into medium size pan 3/4 filled with water. Cook at medium to high heat. Add sea salt to reduce sticking. Allow to simmer until noodles become tender.
