2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
6 (8 inch) (8 inch) flour tortillas
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

1 dash cayenne pepper (optional)

Directions:
Brush butter over one side of each tortilla.  Combine the seasonings; lightly sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon over each tortilla.  Make two stacks of tortillas, with three in each stack.  Using a serrated knife, cut each stack into nine thin strips.  Place in an ungreased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan.  Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned.  Serve warm.
