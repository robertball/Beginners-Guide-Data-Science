Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
6 small red potatoes, thinly sliced
1 cup diced roasted red peppers
2 tablespoons minced garlic
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh basil
6 eggs
1/3 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Heat the olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat, and spread the potatoes into the hot pan in an even layer.  Cover the skillet, and cook the potatoes until they start to turn tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the red peppers and garlic, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook and stir the potato mixture until the garlic begins to soften, about 2 minutes, sprinkle on the basil, and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the basil is cooked, about 2 more minutes.
Whisk the eggs and cream together in a bowl, and pour the egg mixture over the vegetables in the skillet. Sprinkle the top with goat cheese, cover the skillet, and reduce the heat to low. Cook until the eggs are set but not dry, 3 to 5 minutes. Uncover the skillet, and place it under the broiler until the top of the frittata has browned, about 2 minutes.
