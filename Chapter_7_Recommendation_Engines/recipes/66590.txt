Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into strips
1 large sweet onion, diced
2  Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1  red bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips
1 tablespoon red curry paste
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Â½ cup chicken broth
1 cup plain yogurt
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the chicken until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
Add the onion and apple to the skillet and reduce the heat to medium. Cook and stir until the onions are translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the bell pepper; continue to cook and stir for another 5 minutes. Season with curry paste and cinnamon; cook for a few more minutes to intensify the flavors.
Stir in the chicken broth and yogurt. Return chicken to the skillet and simmer for a few minutes to heat through. Remove from the heat, season to taste with salt and pepper, and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
