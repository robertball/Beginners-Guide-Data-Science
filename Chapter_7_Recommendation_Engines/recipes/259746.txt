Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 tablespoons boiling water
1 tablespoon flax seeds
1 cup mashed ripe bananas
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup chopped Medjool dates
1 cup oat flour
1/2 cup tapioca starch
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
Mix boiling water and flax seeds together in a bowl.
Combine bananas, applesauce, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until blended. Add dates slowly, while the food processor is running. Add flaxseed mixture and blend until smooth.
Mix oat flour, tapioca starch, baking powder, cinnamon, and baking soda in a large bowl. Pour in banana mixture; mix well until a batter forms. Stir in walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
