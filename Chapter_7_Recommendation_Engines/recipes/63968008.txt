Ingredients:
8 oz egg noodles
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
1/2 c. flour
1/2 cup half and half
1 1/2 cup milk (I used 1%)
1 t. salt
1/2 t. pepper
6 oz shredded Swiss cheese
2 T. White wine
5 oz diced ham
2 cups diced cooked chicken
1 cup garlic butter croutons
1 T. grated Parmesan cheese
1 T melted butter

Directions:
Cook chicken and dice into large chunks.
Boil water and cook egg noodles as directed but leaving a little bite to them. Drain.
Make roux by melting one stick of butter.  When butter is melted add flour and mix, stirring constantly until bubbly and light brown.  Add half and half, milk, salt and pepper.  Continue to stir frequently until mixture thickens.
Remove from heat and add shredded swiss, wine, diced ham, cubed chicken and mix well.
Mix cooked noodles, and ham/chicken/cheese mixture in a large bowl until well mixed.
Pour into a greased 9x13 casserole dish.
Using food processor, pulse croutons with Parmesan until finely ground up.  Mix in melted butter.
Top casserole with crouton mixture.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes or until hot, bubbly and lightly browned on top.

Description: 
I developed this recipe due to a need to find a comforting casserole out of items already in my house.   The result is a rich, creamy and decadent casserole that is sure to please even picky eaters!  Comes together quickly if you have cooked chicken to use up.
