Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup fresh mushrooms, chopped
1 small sweet onion, diced
1 jalapeno pepper, diced
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (10 ounce) container refrigerated pizza dough
12 dill pickle slices
1 cup shredded American and Cheddar cheese blend
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cook ground beef, mushrooms, sweet onion, and jalapeno pepper in a large skillet over medium heat until the beef is browned and crumbly and the mushrooms are softened, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease and stir in ketchup, yellow mustard, salt, and black pepper. Remove from heat.
Roll out pizza dough on a floured work surface and cut dough in half. Spoon half the ground beef onto each dough half; top each with 6 dill pickle slices and half the American-Cheddar cheese blend. Fold dough over to enclose filling and press edges together with a fork to seal the calzones. Place calzones onto a baking sheet, brush tops with olive oil, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Bake in the preheated oven until calzones are golden brown and the cheese has melted, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
These are a great alternative to regular cheeseburgers! They're also good to take with you on-the-go. Serve with ketchup, mustard, and pickles. I also love to make homemade French fries with this recipe. You can try other toppings like bacon, tomatoes, and lettuce.
