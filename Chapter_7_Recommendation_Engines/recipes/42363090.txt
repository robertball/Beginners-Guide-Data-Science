Description: 
An easy microwave potato dish from my Mom that is great for large groups and special occasions. Frozen hash brown potatoes are combined with a tasty mixture of sour cream, onion, cream of chicken soup, and cheese. This is a favorite of ours during Christmas as a side to ham and polish sausage.
