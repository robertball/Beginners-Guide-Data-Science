1 (5 ounce) can chunk chicken, drained and flaked

½ stalk celery, chopped
½ cup chopped pecans
3 tablespoons plain fat-free Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon sweet pickle relish
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Description: 
This recipe uses canned chicken, but if you want to use leftover chunked chicken or turkey, it 's even better. A dab of sweet relish is a nice taste surprise, and we love the apples, pecans, and raisins. The creamy salad dressing finishes it off nicely.
