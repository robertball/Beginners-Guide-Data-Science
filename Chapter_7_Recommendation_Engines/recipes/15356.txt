Ingredients:
16 ounces bratwurst, casings removed
2 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 onion, chopped
2 cups water
1 medium head cabbage, chopped
3 cups milk, divided
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 ounces Swiss cheese, diced

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the sausage for 10 minutes, or until browned and crumbled. Drain well and discard the fat.
In a large pot over high heat, combine the browned sausage, potatoes, onion and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the cabbage, return to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for another 20 minutes. Add 2 1/2 cups of the milk and heat slowly to just under a boil. (Note: Don't try to do this too fast, or the milk will burn on the bottom of the pot.)
In a separate small bowl, mix the flour with the remaining milk, and add to the pot slowly, stirring constantly, so that the flour does not clump. (Note: Make sure you get out all the lumps because they will not cook out on their own.)
When the mixture in the pot thickens, add the cheese and stir off and on until the cheese has melted.
