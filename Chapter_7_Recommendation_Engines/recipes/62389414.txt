Ingredients:
1 15 oz can Garbanzo beans/Chickpeas (reserve 2 TBS liquid)
1 ½  tsp Sesame Oil
2 cloves of Garlic
1/8 cup Olive Oil
1/8 cup Lemon Juice
¼ cup Water
¾ tsp Garlic Salt
½ tsp Ground Cumin
½ tsp Black Pepper
1 tsp Red Pepper Flakes

Directions:
In a food processor or blender, pulse all ingredients until pureed. I add the water a little bit at a time until I achieve the texture I like. I don’t always need the full ¼ cup. Refrigerate until ready to eat and serve with fresh baked Pita Chips

Description: 
Tahini is expensive and I don’t have any use for it except Hummus. I love using Sesame Oil for the same hint of flavor!
