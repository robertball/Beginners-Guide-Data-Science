Ingredients:
1 package phyllo pastry
1 lb lean ground beef
1 medium onion, chopped
1 medium potato, finely chopped
3 tsp allspice
3 tsp Hungarian paprika
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1/4 cup melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400Â°F.  Cook ground beef over medium heat in a non-stick pan.  Add allspice and paprika, salt and pepper.  Drain as much fat as possible.
Place drained beef in separate bowl and add finely chopped potato and chopped onion; stir to mix.
Unroll phyllo pastry onto a flat surface.  Use two sheets of phyllo per roll; add mixture along the length of two sheets of phyllo and roll into a tube, then roll into a snail shape.
Brush the top of the roll with melted butter, and place on an ungreased pan.  Repeat with the remaining beef mixture, placing rolls up against one another to keep them from unrolling.  Bake for 20-30 minutes, until golden brown.
Serve with Balkan style yogurt for authenticity.
