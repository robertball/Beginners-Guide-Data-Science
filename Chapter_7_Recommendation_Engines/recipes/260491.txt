Description: 
Chia pudding is one of our favorite breakfasts and if you like peanut butter and jam together then this deliciously sweet almond butter and jam delight is for you. It makes a fantastic breakfast or dessert and it's so easy to make too. We like to make ours before bed so it's all ready for when we wake up in the morning.
