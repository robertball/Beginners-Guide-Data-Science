1 cup butter
8 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup yellow mustard
1/3 cup ketchup
1 lemon, juiced
1 dash Worcestershire sauce

Combine the butter, garlic, soy sauce, mustard, ketchup, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce in a small saucepan. Heat very slowly over medium-low heat. Do not allow it to come to a boil, or it will separate. Serve slightly warmer than room temperature.

Description: 
This recipe is a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. It might sound weird, but it is delicious on barbecued salmon. For decades no one in my family has served our favorite 4th of July fish without it!
