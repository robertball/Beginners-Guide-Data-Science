Instructions
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking sheet with non-stick spray and set aside.
Combine asparagus and olive oil in a large zip close bag and shake to coat. Add the breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the bag and shake to coat.
Spread in an even layer on the baking sheet and bake for 7 to 10 minutes until the cheese is melted and the asparagus is still slightly crisp-tender.  If needed broil for a few minutes to brown the cheese.
