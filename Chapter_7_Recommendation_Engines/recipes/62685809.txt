Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups honey
6 tablespoons soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
splash of Cider Vinegar
10 dashes hot sauce
1/2 tsp ground ginger
2 pounds tipless chicken wings
sesame seed

Directions:
Heat honey, soy sauce, and garlic in a saucepan until boiling.
Place the wings in the bottom of a 9 x 13 inch baking pan, and pour the honey mixture over the chicken.  Cover with foil.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 2-4 hours.
Bake, covered,  at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour; turning wings after 1/2 hour, re-cover and continue baking for 30 minutes.
Remove foil, and bake for another 15 minutes.
Take the wings out of the sauce (keep sauce hot to serve with meal), sprinkle wings with sesame seed and finish on the grill (my favorite) or place a rack in a pan and continue baking on rack for 10 minutes. Turn wings, and bake another 10 minutes.  Serve.
