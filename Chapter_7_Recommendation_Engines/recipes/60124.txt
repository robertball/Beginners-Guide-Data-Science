Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/2 medium head cabbage, cored and cut into wedges
1 ear corn
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/8 cup dry vermouth or white wine
1/2 teaspoon minced shallots
2 large cloves garlic, minced
salt and black pepper to taste
crushed red pepper flakes to taste

Directions:
Pour the water into a large pot. Separate cabbage into leaves, and place in a steamer basket. Set the basket into the pot with the water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and place the ear of corn over the cabbage. Cover, and steam for 15 to 20 minutes, or until corn is tender. Remove the basket from the pot, and cool slightly.
Cut the ear of corn into four pieces and place them in a serving bowl with the cabbage.  Combine the butter, vermouth, shallots, garlic, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes; pour over the cabbage, and stir to coat evenly. Separate the salad onto four plates, and garnish each one with a piece of the corn.

Description: 
My interpretation of a spicy Caribbean side dish served at a legendary Jamaican restaurant in my town. I like to serve this with a full Caribbean-style meal of Jerk Chicken, Jamaican Rice and Peas, Fried Plantain and cornbread.
