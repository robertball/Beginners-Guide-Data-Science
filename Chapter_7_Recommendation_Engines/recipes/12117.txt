Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust
1 (21 ounce) can light cherry pie filling
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/3 cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Beat cream cheese until light and fluffy.  Gradually add sweetened condensed milk, and continue beating until smooth and combined.  Add lemon juice and vanilla; mix well.
Fill graham cracker crust evenly.  Refrigerate until set; this will take between 2 to 4 hours.  Just before serving, spread the cherry pie filling over the top of the pie.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite and easiest recipes.  It is always a hit at parties, bake sales, and pot-lucks.  I have modified the original to decrease the fat and calories.  It is still delicious.
