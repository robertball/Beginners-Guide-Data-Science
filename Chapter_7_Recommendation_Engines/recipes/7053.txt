1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour two 8 x 4 inch loaf pans.
Combine flour, sugars, pumpkin, oil, coconut milk, baking soda, salt, and spices.  Mix until well blended.  Fold in coconut and nuts.  Pour into prepared pans.
Bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.  Remove from oven.  Cover with foil tightly, and allow to steam 10 minutes.  Remove foil, and turn out onto cooling rack.  Tent lightly with the foil, and allow to cool completely.
