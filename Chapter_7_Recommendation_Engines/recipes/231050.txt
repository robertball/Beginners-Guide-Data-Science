Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 Granny Smith apple, cored and chopped
1/3 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries, diced - or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and brown sugar in a bowl. Beat vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture to make a batter; gently fold apple and cranberries into batter. Pour into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are lightly browned on top and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 22 minutes.

Description: 
Growing up a friend's mother used to make these every fall. They are the perfect breakfast muffin, not too sweet with the tartness of the cranberries.
