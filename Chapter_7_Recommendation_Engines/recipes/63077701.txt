Ingredients:
•6 boneless pork loin chops (1 inch thick and 8 ounces each)
•1 teaspoon salt
•1/2 teaspoon pepper
•1 tablespoon vegetable oil
•1 can (21 ounces) apple pie filling
•12 gingersnaps, crumbled
•2 tablespoons cornstarch
•2 cups unsweetened apple juice

Directions:
•Cut a pocket in each pork chop. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, brown chops in oil on both sides. Cool for 5 minutes. Combine the pie filling and gingersnaps; stuff some of the mixture into the pocket of each chop. Set remaining mixture aside.
• Secure pork with toothpicks. Place in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Cover and bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 160°. Discard toothpicks.
• In a small saucepan, combine cornstarch and apple juice until smooth. Stir in reserved pie filling mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until thickened. Serve over pork chops. Yield: 6 servings.
