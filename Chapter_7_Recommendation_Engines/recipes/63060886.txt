Ingredients:
3 extra-large eggs
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup pure applesauce, without any extra sugar added
1 1/4 cups sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla
2 cups unpeeled, tightly packed, shredded zucchini
3 cups unsifted all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Beat eggs until light-colored and foamy. Add butter and sugar. Beat at least 3 minutes on medium-high speed of mixer until very light and lemon-colored. Add vanilla and zucchini. Mix lightly but thoroughly.
Into a bowl, sift or stir together flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and allspice. Stir walnuts and chocolate chips into flour mixture. Gradually stir flour mixture into egg mixture, mixing lightly but thoroughly. Divide batter between two lightly greased loaf pans (9 by 5 inches).
Bake on center shelf 45-50 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.
Cool in pans on rack 10 minutes. Turn out of pans and cool completely on racks before wrapping in foil.

Description: 
This recipe was published in the Denver Post, entitled Nina Newton's High Altitude Zucchini Bread in August 2007 and I put my own twist on it. This is a great recipe for anyone who loves zucchini bread and has struggled to find a good high altitude recipe to use. Makes 2 loaves, 9 by 5 inches each.
