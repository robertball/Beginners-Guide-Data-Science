Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 pinch dried marjoram
1 pinch dried basil
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (5 pound) boneless pork loin roast
2 onions, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 cups light beer

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine salt, marjoram, basil, pepper, and garlic powder in a small bowl. Rub spice mixture all over the pork roast. Place roast in roasting pan, and surround with onions. Pour beer into pan, and cover.
Roast pork for 30 minutes in preheated oven. Uncover, and turn meat over. Continue to roast, checking for doneness every 30 minutes; add additional liquid if pan runs dry.  Roast until internal temperature reaches 180 degrees, approximately 2 hours.

Description: 
Here's another take on pork as traditionally prepared in Wisconsin.  This recipe actually uses spices other than salt and pepper, making it something like Wisconsin Gourmet.
