Description: 
Pre-made polenta, Cajun seasoning, olive oil, and a little salt are all you need for these crispy polenta fries. They are great right out of the oven but also good cold. Polenta fries are a healthier alternative than fries made from potatoes; they have fewer carbs. Serve with a simple aioli, ketchup, or desired dipping sauce.
