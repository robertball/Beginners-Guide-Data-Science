Ingredients:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup butter
1 cup vegetable oil
2 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract (optional)
4 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup granulated sugar for decoration

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C ).
In a large bowl, cream together sugar, butter, and oil. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and cream of tartar; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in the pecans. Roll the dough into balls the size of walnuts.  Place balls onto ungreased  sheet.  Press each ball down with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. (Find a glass with a decorative bottom to give cookies a pattern.)
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes or until golden brown around the edges.
