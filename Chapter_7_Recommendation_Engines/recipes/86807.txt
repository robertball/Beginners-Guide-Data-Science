Ingredients:
3 1/2 tablespoons butter
4 tablespoons golden syrup
4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
2 3/4 cups cornflakes cereal

Directions:
In a saucepan over low heat, combine the butter, golden syrup and chocolate. Cook and stir until butter and chocolate have melted and everything is well blended. Mix in the cornflakes cereal. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto waxed paper or a buttered baking sheet. Place in the refrigerator until set, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
For all the gorgeous chocolate cakes around (and there are many), I still have a soft spot for these crunchy, chewy little cakes. I include them partly because when looking for a recipe for them recently, I found it surprisingly difficult to find one. Oh come on, don't tell me you don't like them - so get COOKING!!!
