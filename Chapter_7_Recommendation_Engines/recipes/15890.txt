https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1 (9x9 inch) pan cornbread
8 slices white bread, lightly toasted
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup diced onion
8 ounces baby portobello mushrooms, sliced
2 teaspoons granulated garlic
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 egg, beaten
1 cup white wine
1/2 cup chicken broth

Directions:
In a heavy skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir in onions and mushrooms. Cook and stir until mushrooms release liquid and onions soften, about 5 minutes.
Crumble cornbread and place in large bowl. Tear toast into bite-sized pieces; add to cornbread.
Add mushrooms and onions, granulated garlic, pepper, egg and white wine. Mix thoroughly; add enough broth to moisten.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
This recipe makes enough to stuff a 12- to 14-pound turkey, with 4 to 5 cups left over. Place excess stuffing in a baking dish and bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes.
