Ingredients:
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound chicken tenders
6 slices bacon, or more to taste
1 pound asparagus spears, trimmed and halved crosswise
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 (14 ounce) package cauliflower rice
1/4 cup Buffalo-style hot pepper sauce (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 12x18-inch rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Combine garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle over both sides of chicken tenders. Wrap each tender with a slice of bacon and set in the middle of the baking sheet.
Place halved asparagus spears on one side of the chicken. Season with salt and pepper to taste and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil.
Place riced cauliflower on the other side of the chicken and season with salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
Roast in the preheated oven for 13 to 15 minutes, stirring cauliflower and asparagus halfway through.
Set oven to broil and cook until bacon is browned and sizzling and chicken is no longer pink in the center, an additional 2 to 3 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove from oven and drizzle tenders with hot sauce. Serve immediately, or divide into storage containers and refrigerate.
