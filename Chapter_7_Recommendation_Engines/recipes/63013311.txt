Ingredients:
1 medium butternut squash
3 medium onions
1/4 cup butter
2 Tbsp. olive oil
1 tsp. sea salt

Directions:
Cut ends off of butternut squash.  Peel and cut into 1-inch chunks after removing seeds.  Place squash pieces into large kettle, such as a dutch oven, and cover with cold water.  Bring to a simmer and continue to simmer gently with lid on approximately 20-30 minutes until soft, but not mushy.  Test frequently with fork.  Drain and place in sprayed 2-quart casserole.  While squash is cooking, peel and halve onions.  Slice thinly.  Place in saute pan with butter and olive oil.  Saute on low heat until caramelized (very golden brown).  Layer onions over squash.  Sprinkle lightly with sea salt.  Bake in 350-degree oven for 25 minutes.
