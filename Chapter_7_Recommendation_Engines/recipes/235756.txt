Ingredients:
3 cups masa harina
1 tablespoon salt
2 cups warm water, or as needed
1 quart oil for frying

Directions:
Whisk masa harina and salt together; stir enough water into mixture until dough is smooth and holds together. Form dough into 2-inch balls. Flatten each ball to a 1/2-inch thick circle.
Heat oil to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) in a deep-fryer or large saucepan.
Fry dough in the hot oil until sopes are just lightly browned, about 30 seconds per side. Remove sopes with tongs and place on a paper towel-lined plate; cool just until sopes can be handled. Pinch the edges of each sope together forming little 'boats'. Return to hot oil and fry until golden and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.
