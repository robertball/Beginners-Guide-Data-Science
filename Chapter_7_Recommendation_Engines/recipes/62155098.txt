Ingredients:
6oz dark chocolate (I use 70% cacao)
6oz butter, melted
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup flour
3 eggs

Directions:
Melt chocolate over very low heat or use a double boiler.  Do not scorch.
Once melted, add melted butter to chocolate.  Mix well with a fork.  Set aside.
In another bowl, mix sugar and eggs with a fork until mixture whitens at edges.
Slowly add flour to egg/sugar mixture.  Mix well with a fork and avoid lumps.
Add chocolate and butter mixture to eggs/sugar/flower mixture.  Mix thoroughly.
Spoon batter into lightly buttered or ramekin dishes.  Bake 10 minutes for oozing middle or 13 minutes for more cakey, less chocolatey middle.
Enjoy!
