Cherry-Centered Cheesecake Cookies Recipe

Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 large eggs
2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
3 (20 ounce) cans cherry pie filling, drained

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in another bowl.
Combine cream cheese, butter, and sugar in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs and vanilla extract and mix until incorporated. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture, and mix until just combined. Refrigerate dough until firm, at least 30 minutes.
Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Roll dough into 1 1/2-inch balls. Pour graham cracker crumbs into a shallow bowl; roll dough balls in the crumbs. Place balls 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Make an indentation in the center of each ball with the back of a tablespoon measure. Place 3 cherries in each indentation.
Bake in the preheated oven, switching and rotating the sheets halfway through, until edges are golden, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
My grandmother has been making these cheesecake cookies for years. They are always a huge hit! Because of the cream cheese, these cookies won't keep as long as others. Be sure to refrigerate any left over.
