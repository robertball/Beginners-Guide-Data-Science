Ingredients:
5 cups bread flour, divided
1/4 cup white sugar
4 (.25 ounce) packages instant yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup water
1/3 cup coconut oil
1 tablespoon coconut oil

Directions:
Combine 2 1/2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.
Heat milk, water, and 1/3 cup coconut oil in a saucepan until a thermometer inserted into the mixture reads 120 degrees F (49 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes.
Pour milk mixture over flour; beat together on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Stir in remaining 2 1/2 cups flour until a soft, sticky dough forms.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
Place dough in a bowl; cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
Grease 24 muffin cups. Divide dough into 48 equal-sized balls; place 2 balls into each prepared muffin cup. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Brush tops with 1 tablespoon coconut oil.

Description: 
I grew up in my family's restaurant. I revamped this recipe to make it a little healthier. The original recipe was one of my dad's, who was a master chef. People came from all over West Texas to eat 'Stanton's Hot Rolls' and cake doughnuts. I had gained almost 200 pounds and decided to make some changes. At 75 pounds lighter, I'm changing the recipes. Took out the bad cholesterol and added the good. I took out the eggs and cut the salt in half.
