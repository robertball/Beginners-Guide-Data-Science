Ingredients:
1 baguette, sliced
2 drizzles olive oil, or to taste
1 large ripe Hass avocado
3/4 cup ricotta cheese, or more to taste
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon finely sliced fresh basil
kosher salt to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 cup cherry tomatoes, sliced, or to taste
5 radishes, sliced, or to taste
1 pinch flaky sea salt
1 teaspoon snipped fresh chives

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat. Add baguette slices in a single layer and drizzle olive oil on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crunchy, about 25 minutes. Let crostini cool completely.
Halve and pit avocado. Scoop flesh out into a bowl and add ricotta cheese. Mash together using a potato masher until as smooth or chunky as you like. Add lemon juice, basil, salt, and cayenne; mix together, taste, and add more salt if needed. Spread mixture over the cooled crostini.
Garnish crostini with tomatoes and radishes. Add a few drops of olive oil; sprinkle sea salt and chives on top.

Description: 
When I saw avocado and ricotta cheese being combined on a menu recently, I was intrigued. Not enough to order it, but enough to buy the ingredients for this homemade version! I found this to be a very delicious combination that was sort of unusual, and yet familiar, at the same time. These beauties would make for a great appetizer or snack in time for the height of entertaining season. Start spreading the news!
