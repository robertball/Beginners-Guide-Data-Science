Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup finely diced onion
2 tablespoons taco seasoning mix
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
2 cups beef broth
2 cups canned diced tomatoes, with juices
2 cups elbow macaroni
1/2 cup sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add beef and saute, breaking meat up as it cooks, until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove beef and drain in a colander to remove excess fat.
Return beef to Instant Pot(R) and add onion. Cook for 3 minutes. Add taco seasoning, garlic, parsley, and chili powder; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add a dash of beef broth to deglaze the pot, scraping up any brown bits. Add remaining broth and tomatoes. Stir to combine. Mix in macaroni, stirring until noodles are completely submerged in liquid. Close and lock the lid. Turn off Saute mode.
Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 3 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, for 5 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Serve with a dollop of sour cream.

Description: 
A quick and easy dish for a weeknight. While the pressure is building you can make a side salad and have dinner on the table in 45 minutes. You can add 1 cup of shredded medium cheddar cheese to the pot, I don't due to allergies.  Enjoy!
