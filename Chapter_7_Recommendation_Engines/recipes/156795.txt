Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, diced
1  red onion, chopped
1  green bell pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (18 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce
1 (8 ounce) package phyllo dough
1 stick unsalted butter
4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook chicken in the oil until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Stir the onion, green bell pepper, garlic, and barbecue sauce into the skillet.  Cook and stir until vegetables are tender, 5 to 6 minutes.
Remove phyllo dough from package and unfold onto a baking sheet. Cover with a damp kitchen towel to prevent the dough from drying out.  Melt the butter in a small saucepan.  Use a pastry brush to grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with the butter. Place 4 sheets of phyllo dough in bottom of the prepared pan; brush top of phyllo with butter.  Spread a thin layer of chicken mixture on the top of the phyllo; sprinkle layer with cheese.  Place 2 sheets of phyllo dough on top of the cheese; brush with butter.  Continue layering chicken mixture, cheese, and buttered phyllo until chicken mixture is gone.  Top final layer of chicken with cheese and 2 sheets of phyllo dough, brush top with butter, and sprinkle with remaining cheese and Italian seasoning.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 to 35 minutes.
