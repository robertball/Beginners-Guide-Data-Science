Ingredients:
2 cups cooked white rice (jasmine is best)
1 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
1 medium potato
1/2 large carrot, diced
1/2 onion, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
3/4 cup peas
1/4 cup ketchup
4 eggs
4 egg whites
1/4 cup milk
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Prepare 2 cups rice per directions or use leftover rice.
Microwave potato and carrot until soft.  Let cool, then peel and dice.
Saute onion and peppers over medium heat in 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter until soft.
Add the peas, potatoes, carrots, rice and saute for 2 minutes.
Add ketchup, and stir to blend well.  Set aside.
Whisk together the eggs, egg whites, milk, salt and pepper.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Melt 2 tsp butter then pour half of the egg mixture into the skillet. Cook until firm, pulling sides in with high-temp silicone spatula to let uncooked egg run under cooked egg.
When the egg is just set (do not overcook) put half of rice mixture down center of omelette and fold one side of egg up and over rice then continue to roll until seam is on bottom.  Slide omelette onto serving plate.
Repeat with the remaining butter, eggs and rice mixture.
Before serving do a sguiggly line of ketchup on top of the omelettes.

Description: 
We found Japanese Omurice when searching for a new Meatless Monday dish.  I made it my Om by adding more veggies.  In Minnesota it is common to have ketchup with your eggs,  but if that seems odd, just try it, the flavors go really well together.
