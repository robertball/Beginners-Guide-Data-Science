2 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt

1 1/2 teaspoons bread machine yeast
1 tablespoon cornmeal

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first five ingredients in the order suggested by the manufacturer.

When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide in half. Roll each portion into a 10-in. x 8-in. rectangle. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seams to seal.
Sprinkle a greased baking sheet with cornmeal; place loaves seam side down on prepared pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 20 minutes.
Whisk egg and water; brush over loaves. With a sharp knife, make four shallow slashes across the top of each loaf.
