Ingredients:
1 cup mayonnaise (such as Hellman'sÂ®)
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 cup chopped fresh basil
1 cup chopped fresh dill
1 quart oil for frying
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 eggs, beaten
1 (1 pound) package bacon strips, halved
16 small sandwich rolls
4 tomatoes, sliced
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 head lettuce, chopped

Directions:
Make the aioli by stirring the mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice, basil, and dill together in a bowl. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir the flour, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Whisk the heavy cream and beaten eggs together in a separate bowl.
Dip each piece of bacon into the egg mixture and then into the flour mixture. Repeat the process a second time to assure each piece is heavily coated.
Fry the bacon in the hot oil until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Set aside onto a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
Spread a generous amount of the aioli onto each roll. Add a slice of tomato to each and season with salt and pepper. Finish the sandwiches with a portion of the lettuce and a few slices of bacon.

Description: 
Bacon is considered by many (myself included) to be the ice cream of meats. Breading and frying it in oil takes it to a completely new level. I serve these on slider buns as appetizers for parties.
