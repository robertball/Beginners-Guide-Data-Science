Ingredients:
1 sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®)
3 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cut off enough from the bottom of the onion for it to sit flat. Scoop out 1/3 of the flesh starting from the top of the onion. Fill the core with blue cheese.
Wrap the onion in aluminum foil and grill, blue cheese-side-up, until tender, about 40 minutes.
