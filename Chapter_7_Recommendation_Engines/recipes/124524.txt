Ingredients:
6 cups buttermilk baking mix
1/4 cup sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/3 cup shortening
1 cup warm water (120 to 130 degrees F)
1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the baking mix, sugar and yeast. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in enough warm water to make a soft and slightly sticky dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead gently 3-4 times. Roll dough to 3/4-in. thickness; cut with a 2-1/2-in. round biscuit cutter. Place on ungreased baking sheets.  Brush tops with melted butter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned.

Description: 
'I USUALLY used a glass or baking powder can lid as a cutter so the biscuits would be bigger than average size...and I always baked some extras to send home with the kids. They liked to split them and fill them with cheese or peanut butter and strawberry jam.'
