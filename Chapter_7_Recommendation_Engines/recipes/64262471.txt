Ingredients:
1 12 pack of King's Hawaiian Original Rolls
1 lb. deli ham, shaved
1 lb. Swiss cheese, thinly sliced
1 1/2 sticks butter
3 tablespoons Dijon (or Bavarian) mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
3 teaspoons of poppy seeds
1 onion, chopped

Directions:
Melt butter, mustard ( I like bavarian mustard, it's a little sweeter), add Worcestershire sauce, finely chopped onions, and poppy seeds.Simmer for 5 minutes.
In a greased 9x13 pan, slice the package of Hawaiian Rolls horizontially in half.
Spread 2/3 of the sauce on the bottom of the rolls.
Top with ham and cheese.
Cover with the top of the buns
Add remaining sauce on the top of the buns.
Cover with foil and bake at 350 for 20 minutes.
I've made these ahead of time and even froze them for an easy and delicious meal for a busy day or to give to a family in need.
