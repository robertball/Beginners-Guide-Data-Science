Ingredients:
2 cups fresh (1 pint fresh; 1 cup canned) blueberries
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup butter, softened
3 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1.5 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 dash of blueberry liquor

Directions:
Rinse / clean blueberries, reserve 1/4 cup liquid if canned. For smoother frosting they should be pureed. If you want bits in the frosting use a slower speed and chop in slower intervals until the desired consistency. In a medium bowl, cream together the cream cheese and butter until creamy. Mix in the vanilla, then gradually stir in the confectioners' sugar. Next add in the berries until smooth. Add in a dash of blueberry liquor if desired. Store in the refrigerator after use.
