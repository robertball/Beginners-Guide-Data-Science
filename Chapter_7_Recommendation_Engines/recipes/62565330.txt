Ingredients:
1 - 2 medium size pears
5 Tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
2 tsp olive oil
1 tbsp butter
2 - 3 large shallots, chopped
2 tsp fresh thyme, chopped
Salt and pepper to taste
Garlic clove, cut in half
Olive oil for brushing on bread
Baguette

Directions:
Heat 1 tsp olive oil with butter on medium high heat in a skillet.  Add chopped shallots and cook for about 25 - 30 minutes, until golden and starting to caramelize.  Spoon into glass bowl and let cool completely.
Finely chop pear and add to shallots with parmesan, 1 tsp of olive oil (add more if mixture is too dry), thyme, salt and pepper.  Mix well, cover and refrigerate for a few hours.
Before serving, slice baguette and spread slices on a cookie sheet.  Rub each slice with garlic and brush with olive oil.  Toast slices for 8 to 10 minutes in 325 degree oven, until golden.  Top with pear mixture, sprinkle with more Parmesan if desired, and put back in oven under broiler for 1 - 2 minutes, until golden and bubbly.
