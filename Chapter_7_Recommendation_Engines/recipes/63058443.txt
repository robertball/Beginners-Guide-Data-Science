Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 bell peppers (any color), chopped
1 1/2 cups chopped mushrooms
1 large onion, chopped
2 celery stalks, chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 (15-ounce) cans pinto beans
1 (14.5-ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes, with juices

Directions:
In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add peppers, mushrooms, onion, celery, and garlic; cook, stirring, until vegetables begin to soften, about 7 minutes. Add chili powder, oregano, cumin, and salt; cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes more.
Add beans and tomatoes with their juices. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until chili is fragrant and slightly thickened, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm.

Description: 
This basic vegetarian chili is thick and hearty. Garnish with a dollop of low-fat or nonfat plain yogurt if you like. Brush whole-wheat pita triangles with olive oil, sprinkle with a mix of Italian seasoning and cayenne, lightly toast, and serve alongside the chili or crumble and serve on top.
