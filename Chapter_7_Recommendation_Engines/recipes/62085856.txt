Description: 
My mother made this recipe for years while I was growing up.  She's gone now but every time I make it, it reminds me how much she loved to bake.  This cake is fairly plain but so easy to make and so great with a cup of coffee or tea. You could drizzle the top with a confectioners icing but I prefer it plain, just like Mom use'd to make.
