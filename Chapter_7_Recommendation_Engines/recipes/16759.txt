Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons Italian-style seasoning
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
3 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with ground cinnamon, seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper. (Note: You can be liberal with the seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper; however, the cinnamon should only be a dusting and not clumped.)
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.

Description: 
Chicken breasts baked with cinnamon and other seasonings. This is a recipe that I created while working at a flight kitchen. We had cinnamon in the spice collection that nobody used for anything, so I decided to try it on chicken and the flight crews and my family loved it!
