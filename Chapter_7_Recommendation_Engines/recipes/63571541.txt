Ingredients:
Muffin Ingredients:
1 c. flax meal
1 c. almond meal
1 Tbsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 1/4 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp cinnamon
1 c. equivalent Artificial sweetener - zero carb (such as liquid) preferred
1/2 c. butter, melted
4 eggs, beaten
1/2 c. plus 2 Tbsp water
Topping Ingredients:
1/2 c. equivalent powdered artificial sweetener
2 tsp cinnamon
2 Tbsp melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F; butter muffin pans.
Mix dry ingredients well (exclude those used for topping).
Add beaten eggs, melted butter, water, and sweetener to the dry mixture. Mix well.
Fill muffin cups a bit more than half way with the mixture.
Bake for about 20 minutes, until tops are golden brown. Allow muffins to cool in pan for a few minutes, remove.
Mix the cinnamon and powdered sweetener for the topping in a clean bowl.
When the muffins are cool enough to handle, dip the tops in the melted butter you allocated for the topping, followed by the sweetener/cinnamon mixture.
Buttermilk Version: Switch out 1/2 cup buttermilk for the same amount of water. Substitute 1 teaspoon baking soda and 1 teaspoon baking powder for the baking powder in the regular recipe. This variation adds half a gram of carb to each muffin.
