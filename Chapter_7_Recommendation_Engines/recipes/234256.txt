Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup long grain white rice
1 cup frozen peas and carrots, thawed

Directions:
Stir water, vegetable oil, garlic, vinegar, turmeric, and salt together in a 2-quart saucepan. Place a cover on the saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil.
Slowly stir rice into the boiling mixture. Replace cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer rice mixture until the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Transfer rice to a large bowl. Gently fold peas and carrots into rice.

Description: 
This is my husband's favorite rice. It took me awhile to finally come up with this version. One can add chicken, tuna, ham, etc., to make it a one dish meal. It is also great for rice patties. The vinegar is traditional in rice in Spain; it keeps the rice fluffy.
