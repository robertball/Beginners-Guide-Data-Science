Ingredients:
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup oat flour (or ground oats)
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup almond milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
3 egg whites
2 T natural peanut butter
1 cup fresh berries

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix flour, oat flour, baking soda, and salt. In another bowl, combine together the milk, vanilla extract, and eggs; beat until well-blended. Next add the dry mixture to the wet mixture until a moist batter has formed.
Pre-heat a skillet on medium heat and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Drop the batter onto the skillet by large tablespoons and cook for 1-2 minutes before flipping and cooking for another minute or two on the second side. Continue until all pancakes are completed.
Place the peanut butter in the microwave for 20-30 seconds to soften and then drizzle over pancakes; top with the fresh berries.
