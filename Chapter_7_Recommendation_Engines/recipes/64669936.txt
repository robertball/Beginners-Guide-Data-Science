Ingredients:
6 (1.5 pounds) Pork Chops
1 Cup Crushed Pecans
1 Cup Crushed Almonds
3 Large Eggs
2 Cups Flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Lightly toast the nuts either in a toaster oven or regular oven.
Heat oil in skillet.
Get three shallow bowls big enough for dipping.  Place nuts in one bowl, eggs in another and flour in the third.
Mix Honey into the eggs.
Dip pork chops individually in flour then egg mix then nuts.
Place in heated skillet and cook for 3 minutes on each side.
Place chops on nonstick cookie sheet (or using nonstick aluminum foil) and put in oven for 10 to 15 minutes until juices run clear.
All done!! Take a picture and enjoy!

Description: 
Super easy, nutritious and delicious!!  My four year old grand daughter helps me prepare this.  I use center cut pork chops but any kind will do.  You can add garlic powder, ginger powder, salt and/or pepper if you like.  I keep it pretty simple because my grand daughter doesn't like a lot of spice.
