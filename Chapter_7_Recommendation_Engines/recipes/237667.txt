Ingredients:
1/3 cup dried parsley
1/4 cup dried marjoram
1/4 cup dried thyme
3 tablespoons rubbed sage
2 tablespoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons onion powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 boneless pork loin chops
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or to taste
1 tablespoon canola oil

Directions:
Mix parsley, marjoram, thyme, sage, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl.
Rub 1/2 teaspoon of the herb mixture over each pork chop. Store remaining herb mix in an airtight container for later use.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook pork chops in skillet until no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
