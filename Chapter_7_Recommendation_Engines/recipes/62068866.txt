1 link of linguica sausage sliced lengthwise into 4 slices
2 large sweet onions
4 slices American cheese

Directions:
Mix hamburger with garlic, pepper and water. Form into 4 large patties. Keep chilled till onions are cooked.
Thinly slice onions. Add olive oil to a large skillet. Add onions. Sprinkle the cumin over the onions and saute over med-high heat till lightly brown and limp. Remove onions from pan. Lightly brown the linguica slices and set aside. Divide onions into 4 equal portions and keep warm. Place burgers in skillet or grill and cook to desired doneness. Place a slice of cheese on each burger. Continue cooking till cheese is just beginning to melt. Add the linguica slice on top of cheese. Butter the outer slice of bread. Place burger with cheese and linguica on the unbuttered side of bread. Add mustard to taste. Top with sauteed onions. Place the other buttered slice of bread on the outside to be grilled. Grill to light brown on both sides. Enjoy!

Description: 
This is a simple burger with a Portuguese flair.  My husband is Portuguese and almost everything we cook has some form of garlic,onion and olive oil. This is our take on a traditional Patty Melt. The linguica really puts this over the top!
