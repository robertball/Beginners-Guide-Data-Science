Ingredients:
Ingredients per 8 oz serving
Water 8 oz
1 slice grapefruit

½ cucumber, sliced
2 peppermint leaves
Ice – as much as you like

Directions:
FAT FLUSH WATER !!!
You should drink at least three 8 oz glasses per day, they say the longer it sits, the better it tastes. You can eat them as well but they are intended as flavoring and still work, so that is a personal choice. The Vitamin C turns fat into fuel, the tangerine increases your sensitivity to insulin, and the cucumber makes you feel full. Try it for 10 days and see what you think!
