Ingredients:
3 cups fresh cranberries
3 cups coarsely chopped, peeled apples
3/4 cup white sugar
1 cup rolled oats
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 3 quart casserole dish.
In a medium bowl, toss together the cranberries, apples and white sugar. Pour into the prepared casserole. Mix together the oats, flour, pecans and brown sugar in the same bowl. Spread evenly over the fruit in the dish. Pinch off small pieces of butter and arrange them on top of the oat mixture.
Bake, covered, for 50 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the lid and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the top is toasted.

Description: 
My family fights over this great Thanksgiving side dish that was first brought to our table by my Aunt Joan more than ten years ago.  It's the only thing I've found that will convert even the most die-hard canned cranberry eater to a fresh berry advocate.
