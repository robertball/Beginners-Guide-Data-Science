Description: 
Not happy with any at-home recipes for nacho sauce, I made up my own!  A thick, creamy nacho cheese sauce that you will swear came out of a jar.  Cheesy, subtly spicy, and bursting with nacho flavor--it rivals ANY storebought nacho cheese sauce.  Just be sure to save some aside for yourself!
