Ingredients:
4 fresh peaches, or as needed
1/3 cup white sugar, or to taste
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 cups heavy cream

Directions:
Cut each peach in half along the crease, twist open, and remove the pit. Peel and slice. Cut slices in half to get roughly 2 cups of sliced peaches.
Bring sugar and water to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Boil until a syrup forms, about 3 minutes. Stir in peaches until coated. Bring syrup back to a light simmer, about 1 minute. Immediately remove from heat and pour mixture into a bowl.
Transfer peaches into a large bowl using a slotted spoon. Pour in heavy cream and stir to combine. Divide mixture between serving glasses, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until completely chilled and cream has absorbed all the peach flavor, at least 3 hours.

Description: 
The classic combination of peaches and cream is as simple as it sounds: peaches, lightly sweetened and simmered, need only a splash of cold heavy cream and nothing more. Just remember to make this ahead of time for the peachiest results.
