Ingredients:
4 pounds beef sirloin roast
3 carrots, chopped
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 (.75 ounce) packet dry brown gravy mix
2 tablespoons water
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
10 fluid ounces cola-flavored carbonated beverage

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place meat in a roasting pan. Sprinkle carrots, celery and minced garlic around roast.
In a small bowl, combine the brown gravy mix and water, mixing into a smooth paste. Add onion soup mix, cream of mushroom soup and cola-flavored carbonated beverage. Pour over the roast.
Cover pan, and cook 1 hour in the preheated oven.
Reduce oven temperature to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C), and continue cooking 2 hours. Remove from oven, and turn roast over so that the top is now covered with the gravy. Cover pan, and return to oven for a minimum of 2 hours.
Remove from oven, and let meat rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
The rich brown gravy this makes is wonderful, with just a slight hint of sweetness. Everyone asks for the recipe, and NO ONE ever guesses the secret ingredient...cola!
