Ingredients:
* 1  pound  boneless beef chuck roast
* 2  tablespoons  all-purpose flour
* 2  tablespoons  vegetable oil
* 1  pound  tiny new potatoes, quartered
* 1  pound  butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 2-1/2 cups)
* 2  small  onions, cut into wedges
* 2  cloves  garlic, minced
* 1  14-ounce can  beef broth

2. In 3-1/2- to 4-1/2-quart slow cooker, combine meat, potatoes, squash, onions, and garlic. In a large bowl, combine broth, vegetable juice, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, sugar, paprika, pepper, and allspice. Pour over meat mixture.
3. Cover and cook on low-heat setting for 10 to 12 hours or on high-heat setting for 5 to 6 hours.
4. If using low-heat setting, turn to high-heat setting. Stir in green beans or peas. Cover and cook for 15 minutes more. Makes 6 servings.
