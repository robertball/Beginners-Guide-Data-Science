1 egg, beaten
3/4 cup quick-cooking oats

2 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
1 envelope onion soup mix

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into a loaf in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Drizzle with ketchup. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Using two large spatulas, carefully transfer meat loaf to a serving platter.
