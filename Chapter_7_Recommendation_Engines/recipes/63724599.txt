Description: 
This is a recipe the cook make at the cafeteria where I work.  I normally abhor cafeteria food and was amazingly surprised that this was the best Mac & Cheese I had ever eaten.  
I asked the cook what ingredients he used in his rue and he told me cottage cheese, sour cream, and cheddar cheese. 
I played with the measurements at home and tweaked it with some of my own twists and figured out the my own version.  
May family all agrees this is the best Mac & Cheese ever.
