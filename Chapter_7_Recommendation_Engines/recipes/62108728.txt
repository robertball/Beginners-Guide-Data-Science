Ingredients:
1 banana
1/4 c. mini marshmallows
1 peanut butter cup
1 square of graham crackers
vanilla ice cream (optional)
whipped cream (optional)
large square of foil

Directions:
Place banana on foil square.  Carefully split the banana lengthwise, not going thru bottom of skin.  Squeeze banana ends together gently to form a "canoe" shaped opening.
Break peanut butter cup into pieces and stuff into the "canoe".  Break Graham Cracker into pieces and place in and around the peanut butter cup pieces.  Top with mini marshmallows, pushing down gently to seat them in the "canoe".
Bring ends of foil up around the banana so it is not touching the top of the marshmallows (or it will stick).  Seal edges, then place the banana packet on a hot grill for 5-8 minutes or in a 350 oven for 8 min.  You can tell they are done when you gently squeeze the banana with tongs and it is very soft.
To eat, carefully open foil and scrunch down around the banana to form a bowl.  Gently push the ends of the banana together again to open the "canoe" up a bit.  Top with a scoop of ice cream and whipped cream.  Dig in with a spoon, making sure to get the warm and yummy banana at the bottom!
