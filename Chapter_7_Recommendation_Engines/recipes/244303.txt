Description: 
This is a absolutely wonderful, yet easy-to-make dessert which can be simple or elegant. It consists of a 'no fail' baked custard filling with fresh raspberries. The custard is mildly sweet and the fresh raspberries add a fresh tartness to the flavor. This dessert will impress anyone and trust me, everyone will ask for the recipe. Serve plain as a 'simple' dessert or add to the elegance by adding a dollop of creme fresh with a fresh raspberry to really give a nice presentation. Add a little mint leaf on the side, this will impress everyone. Serve warm or allow to cool for a firmer consistency.
