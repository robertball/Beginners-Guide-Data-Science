Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups shell pasta
2 cups broccoli florets
1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced-fat condensed broccoli cheese soup
1 cup milk
1 (4.5 ounce) can mushrooms
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups diced cooked ham

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add shell pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes; drain.
Combine broccoli florets, broccoli soup, milk, mushrooms with liquid, onion, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a large skillet; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until broccoli is tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir pasta and ham into broccoli mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until hot and bubbling, 5 to 7 minutes more.
