Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups ketchup
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon dry mustard powder
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons celery salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 drops hot pepper sauce
1 (4 pound) elk roast, cut in half
10 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Whisk together the ketchup, brown sugar, mustard powder, lemon juice, liquid smoke, onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, nutmeg, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl. Place the elk roast into a large slow cooker, and pour the sauce overtop.
Cover, and cook on High until the meat shreds easily with a fork, about 5 hours. Shred, and serve on the hamburger buns.

Description: 
Reminiscent of sloppy joes, this recipe can be used with elk or venison - it takes away that gamey taste!
