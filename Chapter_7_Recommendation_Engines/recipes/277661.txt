Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups peeled and grated carrots
3/4 cup roughly chopped walnuts
3/4 cup raisins
1 1/2 tablespoons whole wheat flour, or as needed
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 eggs, at room temperature
1 cup plain Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon turbinado sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray 20 muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray.
Whisk 1 3/4 cups flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, ginger, and nutmeg together in a large bowl until well blended. Add grated carrots and walnuts and stir to combine.
Place raisins in small bowl and sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoons flour. Mix with your hands until raisins are separated and coated in flour. Add to flour mixture and stir to combine. Discard any remaining flour.
Whisk maple syrup and olive oil together in a medium bowl. Add eggs and whisk until well combined. Stir in yogurt and vanilla extract until well mixed. Pour yogurt mixture into the flour mixture and mix with a big spoon until just combined (a few lumps are okay.) Transfer batter into the prepared muffin cups and sprinkle the tops with turbinado sugar.
Bake muffins in the preheated oven until golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 13 minutes. Place muffin tins on a cooling rack to cool.
