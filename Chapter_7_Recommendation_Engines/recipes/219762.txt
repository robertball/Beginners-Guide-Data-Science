Description: 
The secret ingredient which makes this cacciatore stand out is pancetta, an Italian bacon. Once a specialty deli item, it is now readily available at most major supermarkets. The pancetta gives the sauce richness and body. I've also found that fresh basil leaves and baby portobello mushrooms make it my own. It is kid-friendly and fills the house with a wonderful aroma.
