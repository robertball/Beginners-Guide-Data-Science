1(8 oz) can water chestnuts, finely chopped(I omit)
3 green onions, finely chopped

Directions:
Squeeze thawed spinach until dry.(I wring it out inside paper towels)
Mix all ingredients together.
Cover and chill for at least 2 hours.
Serve in hollowed out pumpernickel bread,cutting up the bread you remove into chunks to put dip on.
Beer bread and french bread thinly sliced also works well in serving dip in a bowl.
