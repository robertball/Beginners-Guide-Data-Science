Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh tuna steaks, 1 inch thick
2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Generously coat tuna with Cajun seasoning.
Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over high heat. When oil is nearly smoking, place steaks in pan. Cook on one side for 3 to 4 minutes, or until blackened. Turn steaks, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or to desired doneness.

Description: 
It may seem simple, but it's my favorite way to have tuna. Seared fish steaks are a Cajun tradition.
