Ingredients:
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups coarsley crushed flaked cereal (I used Total)
1 1/2 cups cinnamon chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
In a large mixing bowl, beat together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add vanilla, salt and egg - mix until combined.
In a medium bowl, stir together flour, crushed cereal and cinnamon chips.
Stir the flour mixture into the creamed butter.
Take pieces of dough with a tablespoon and roll into balls - around 1" in size. Place dough onto parchment lined baking sheets. Gently flatten with your hands, or use a fork and make a crisscross pattern.
Bake until golden around the edges, about 15-18 minutes. Remove cookies from the sheets and place on a wire rack to cool completely.
