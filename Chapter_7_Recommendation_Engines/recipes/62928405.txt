Ingredients:
3/4 cup skim milk
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup shortening
1/4 cup warm water
1 package active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)
1 egg, beaten
4 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
1/4 cup maraschino cherries, red and/or green
1/4 cup raisins
1/4 cup icing sugar
4 whole maraschino cherries, chopped finely

Directions:
Scald milk.  Stir in sugar, salt, and shortening and mix until sugar is completely dissolved.  Cool to lukewarm.
In another bowl, measure warm water and sprinkle in yeast; stir until dissolved.  Add lukewarm milk mixture to dissolved yeast.  Add egg and mix well.  Add flour and beat until smooth.  Gradually add, while beating, flour and beat until mixed.  Turn out on lightly floured board.  Knead until smooth and velvety – about 10 minutes.
Place in a greased bowl; brush top with oil.  Cover, let rise in a warm place, free from draft for about one hour, or until double in bulk.  Punch down.  Knead again until soft and velvety – about 5 minutes.
Cut dough into small pieces, the size of walnuts.  Form into balls.  Roll in melted butter or margarine.  Place buttered balls, so that they are almost touching, in a well-greased 10” tube pan to cover bottom.  Top with cherries and raisins.  Place the remainder of the balls over cherries and raisins.  Cover and let rise again, in a warm place for about 45 minutes or until double in bulk.
Bake at 375F. for 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove from oven.  Let stand for 5 minutes.  Remove from pan and frost with icing sugar.  Sprinkle with chopped cherries.
