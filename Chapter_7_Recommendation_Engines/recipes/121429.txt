Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups butter (no substitutes), softened
1/2 cup fresh or frozen cranberries
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
SCONES:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup butter (no substitutes)
1 cup chopped fresh or frozen cranberries
3/4 cup buttermilk

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter. Stir in cranberries, confectioners; sugar and orange peel; mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, combine the dry ingredients in a bowl. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add cranberries. Stir in buttermilk just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; gently knead 6-8 times. Divide in half. Pat each into an 8-in. circle. Cut into eight wedges. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pans to wire racks. Serve warm with cranberry-orange butter.

Description: 
I bake these simple fruit-filled scones during the holidays or any time our children come home for a visit. We all agree there's nothing better for breakfast than these scones, spread with homemade cranberry-orange butter.
