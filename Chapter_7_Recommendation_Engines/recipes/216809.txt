Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
4 cups sliced Brussels sprouts
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
1/4 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Generously grease a 9x9-inch baking dish with butter.
Spread the sliced Brussels sprouts out into the prepared baking dish in an even layer. In a bowl, whisk together the cream, Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt, and black pepper until thoroughly combined; pour the cream mixture over the Brussels sprouts. Sprinkle the top with nutmeg.
Cover the dish with foil, and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour; remove foil, and bake uncovered until the top has browned, 15 more minutes.
