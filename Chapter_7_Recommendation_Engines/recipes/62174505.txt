Ingredients:
1 teaspoon salt
4 -5 fresh minced garlic cloves
2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon crumbled dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 (4 pound) boneless pork shoulder roast
2 bay leaves
2 cups chicken broth

Directions:
Mix together salt, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, coriander, and cinnamon in a bowl. Cut the pork in large chunks and then coat with the spice mixture. Place the bay leaves in the bottom of a slow cooker and place the pork on top. Pour the chicken broth around the sides of the pork, being careful not to rinse off the spice mixture.
Cover and cook on Low until the pork shreds easily with a fork, about 10 hours. Turn the meat after it has cooked for 5 hours. When the pork is tender, remove from slow cooker.
Place in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake at 400F for 15 to 20 minutes until brown on all sides. Take out of the oven, and shred with two forks.
Use cooking liquid as needed to moisten the meat.

Description: 
Carnitas means 'little meats' and is traditionally fried then braised. This recipe is made much easier using the slow cooker but the results are just as tasty. This makes a great filling for tamales, enchiladas, tacos and burritos.Modified from: Slow Cooker Carnitas
