Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, sliced
1 large eggplant, cut into chunks
1 large orange bell pepper, cut into chunks
1 large tomato, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 tablespoon minced parsley, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add remaining olive oil to the skillet; add eggplant and bell pepper. Saute until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add tomato, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper; cook 2 to 3 minutes more. Return sauteed onion to the skillet. Adjust seasonings if necessary. Transfer eggplant mixture to a baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Cool before serving, about 1 hour.
