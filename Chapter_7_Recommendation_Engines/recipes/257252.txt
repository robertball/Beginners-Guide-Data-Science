Description: 
I needed an easy strawberry frosting to frost my daughter's birthday cake. I used the same cream cheese frosting recipe my mom used to make for my cakes when I was a kid and just tossed in the gelatin. This works well for frosting or as a filler between cake layers. Keep refrigerated.
