Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 egg
1 cup canned pumpkin
2 teaspoons vanilla
1/3 cup milk

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt.  Cut in shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Beat egg with milk; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.
Turn onto a well-floured surface; knead 20 times, which will help the dough thicken (it should still be softer than normal biscuit dough). Flatten to 3/4-in. thickness; cut with a floured 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter.  Place on a lightly greased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.

Description: 
If you're looking for a twist on a traditional biscuit, with the flavors of fall, this is it. Not overly sweet, these golden-brown rolls bake up tall, light and tender. Top with a little butter or honey...or my personal favorite, apple butter.Modified from: Fluffy Biscuits
