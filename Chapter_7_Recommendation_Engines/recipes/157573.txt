Title:
Ari's Sweet Indian Coconut Curry Chicken Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
8  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon mild curry powder
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3  whole cloves
1 ¼ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
olive oil, or as needed
2  onions, thinly sliced
1 (15 ounce) can cream of coconut
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce

Directions:
Slice chicken breast halves to half their original thickness; you should have 16 pieces.
Mix curry powder, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and garlic together in a small bowl to make the spice mixture.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute chicken until browned on the outside and still pink on the inside, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place chicken on a plate.
Cook onions in the same skillet until they start becoming translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour spice mixture in and mix with the onions. Add cream of coconut and tomato sauce; add chicken. Reduce heat to low. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
Chicken that tempts your tongue like candy. This is sweet with a bit of tang. It's light and deep at the same time. Everyone asks for the recipe - it's based on Kristi Martinez's Indian Curry Chicken I, but heavily adapted for sweet tooths! Works great for larger meals.
