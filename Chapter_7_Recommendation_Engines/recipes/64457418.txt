Vegan Jaffa Cakes Recipe

Ingredients:
3 tablespoons aquafaba (I used chickpea)
50g caster sugar (1/5 cup or 3 heaping T)
65g self raising flour (4 1/2 T)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
Oil, for greasing
250g orange marmalade (1 c)
100g 70% cocoa chocolate (little less than 1/2 c)
2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200C/gas 6 (390 Degrees). Whisk the aquafaba and sugar (I placed both in the bowl at the same time) with electric hand whisk until thick and creamy, add vanilla and fold in self raising flour.
Grease a 12 hole muffin tray and place one tablespoon of mixture in each hole. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown, then remove to cool on a wire rack. (I used a teaspoon to pry up all the edges and the popped up fairly easily)
Once cool, cut in half horizontally so you have two thin cakes. (I found the edges were quite hard when cool so the first few were quite tricky to cut - and ended up with some not so round ones - but you get the hand of it, handy to use a serrated knife)
Gently heat the marmalade in a saucepan for a few minutes, until it had thickened but is still spreadable. Sift to remove peel and allow to cool. Spoon a dollop in the centre of each cake.
Melt the chocolate, add the oil, cool until it starts to thicken and spoon over the cake. Allow to set. (I couldn't wait for the chocolate to cool for the second batch I melted and so it spread quite thin and spilt over the edges and in the end the thicker layer chocolate ones were better so this turns out to be important lol)
