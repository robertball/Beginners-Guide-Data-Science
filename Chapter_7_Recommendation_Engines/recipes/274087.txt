1 1/2 pounds 80% lean ground beef
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 medium sweet onion, diced
1 (16 ounce) package frozen yellow and white whole kernel corn
1 (15 ounce) can light red kidney beans
1 (15 ounce) can dark red kidney beans
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans

Cook ground beef in a large pot over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add bell pepper and onion. Cook and stir until the pepper and onion have softened, about 5 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
