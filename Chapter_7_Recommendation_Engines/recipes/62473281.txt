Description: 
Having trouble getting your kids to eat bran and apples? Well this is a muffin recipe they'll love! With its warm and comforting tastes of cinnamon and appple, and its other spices, the kids and the adults will love these! Although, it is very, very important to make sure your butter has cooled, so first off, melt the butter, set it aside to cool, and start prepping the other ingriedients.
