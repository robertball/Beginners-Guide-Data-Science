Description: 
This Italian sausage and ground beef recipe is full of vegetables and Italian herbs -- the longer it cooks the better!  Full of flavor, and makes a great base sauce for lasagna.  It's critical to use fresh basil, other herbs may be dried.  Do not use canned tomatoes which have any corn syrup in them.  Home canned tomato equivalent is 3 quarts.   If you want a spicier sauce add either crushed red pepper to taste or use hot Italian sausage.
