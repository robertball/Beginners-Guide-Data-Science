Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) package cherry flavored Jell-O® mix
2 (.25 ounce) envelopes unflavored gelatin
2 cups boiling water
4 (.25 ounce) envelopes unflavored gelatin
1 cup boiling water
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (6 ounce) package blue raspberry flavored Jell-O® mix
2 (.25 ounce) envelopes unflavored gelatin
2 cups boiling water

Directions:
Place cherry gelatin mix into a heatproof bowl, stir in 1 packet of unflavored gelatin, and mix with 2 cups of boiling water, stirring until the gelatin has dissolved and the mixture is clear, about 2 minutes. Pour into the bottom of a 9x13 rectangular  glass baking dish. Place in refrigerator until completely cold and set, about 1 hour.
Sprinkle 4 packets of unflavored gelatin onto 1 cup of boiling water in a heatproof bowl, allow to stand for about 3 minutes, and stir until dissolved; mix in the sweetened condensed milk. Allow to cool but not thicken, about 10 minutes; gently pour into a layer on top of the cherry layer. Return to refrigerator and allow to chill completely, about 1 more hour.
Place blue raspberry gelatin mix and 1 packet of unflavored gelatin into a heatproof bowl, and mix with 2 cups of boiling water, stirring until the blue gelatin is clear, about 2 minutes. Allow to stand and cool but not thicken, about 10 minutes; gently pour onto the white layer. Chill in refrigerator until the dessert is firm and cold, about 1 hour. To serve, cut into squares.

Description: 
A hit with kids and those young at heart.  My childhood neighbor made it our block party and now, even though I have moved far away, I still make it with fond memories...it just isn't Fourth of July without it! I have seen similar recipes where the white layer is made with sour cream or whipped topping, but this one uses sweetened condensed milk...easy and delicious!
