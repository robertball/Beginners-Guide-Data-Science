Ingredients:
1 avocado, diced
1 mango - peeled, seeded and diced
1 tablespoon lime juice
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon wasabi powder
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds
2 teaspoons canola oil
2 (4 ounce) (1- to 1 1/2-inch-thick) tuna steaks

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat. Lightly oil grate.
Mix together the avocado, mango, lime juice, ground ginger, and wasabi powder in a bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside until ready to serve.
Spread the sesame seeds over the bottom of a shallow dish. Brush the tuna steaks with the canola oil, and dip into the sesame seeds, evenly coating both sides.
Place tuna steaks on prepared grill. Cook until fish turns opaque, turning once, about 4 minutes for 1 inch thick steaks. Serve immediately with summer salsa and additional wasabi on the side.
