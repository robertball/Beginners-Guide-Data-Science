1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornmeal
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon dried basil

1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon pepper
4 (6 ounce) fillets catfish
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
In a large resealable bag, combine the first nine ingredients. Add catfish, one fillet at a time, and shake to coat.
