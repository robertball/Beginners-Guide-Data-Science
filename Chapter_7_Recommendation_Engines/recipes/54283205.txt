Ingredients:
1/2  cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup butter, softened
3 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 t. cinnamon
1/4 t. nutmeg
Filling:
1 cup chopped walnuts
3/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 stick butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a heavy bundt pan well.
In a large bowl, cream together  sugars and butter. Add the eggs and sour cream and beat well. Mix in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and spices.  Stir until just combined.
Spread 1/2 of the batter (it will be very thick) into the prepared pan then sprinkle with filling. Top with remaining batter by actually 'patting out' the batter into flats and placing on top of filling.  Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40-50 minutes.
To Make Filling: Combine chopped nuts, cinnamon, 3/4 cup white sugar and butter.  Mix well.
