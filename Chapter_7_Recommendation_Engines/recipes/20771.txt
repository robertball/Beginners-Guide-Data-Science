Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated crescent roll dough
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 teaspoon dried dill weed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a lightly greased 9x13 inch pan or 13 inch round pizza stone, arrange the crescent roll dough in a single layer. Pinch together the edges of the dough. Bake for 12 minutes, or until it becomes a golden brown crust. Remove the crust from the oven and allow it to cool.
In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, mayonnaise and dill. Evenly spread the cream cheese mixture on the crust. Sprinkle toppings on top of the cream cheese spread. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the spread to thicken.
Cut the chilled pizza into wedges or squares with a pizza cutter to serve.
