Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
3 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Coat a large saucepan with cooking spray and place over medium heat.  Cook beef in pan until browned, 5 to 8 minutes.  Stir in onions, bell pepper and garlic and cook 5 minutes more.
Stir in kidney beans, pinto beans and tomatoes.  Season with brown sugar, cocoa powder, chili powder and cumin.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 to 30 minutes.  (To make in a slow cooker, simply transfer beef mixture to a slow cooker, stir in remaining ingredients, cover and cook on low 5 to 6 hours.)

Description: 
Best Bean Chili tweaks the traditional recipe, coupling red kidney and pinto  beans with ground beef and all the chili seasonings.  It can be prepared on the stove or a slow cooker.  Although B.E.A.N. recipes usually call for a specific variety, any canned or dry-packaged bean variety can be easily substituted for another.
