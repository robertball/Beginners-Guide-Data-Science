Ingredients:
2 cloves of garlic, cut up
2 tbsp sherry wine vinegar
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 slices of crusty day-old bread, crusts removed, torn into pieces
6 large ripe tomatoes, or about two lbs., cut into wedges (top core removed)
1 large red pepper, quartered and seeded, membrane removes
1 large cucumber, peeled, quartered, and seeded
Up to 3 cups of cold water
Salt to taste
Garnish, choice of:
Diced green pepper
Chopped hard-boiled egg
Diced cucumber
Croutons
Ice cubes if the soup is too warm

Directions:
In a medium-sized bowl put the garlic, torn bread, vinegar, and olive oil. Add water to cover. Let it soak while you prepare the vegetables.
Put the vegetables in a blender mixing on a high speed, adding water and some of the soaked bread in stages. This will take three or four times of mixing the veggies into the bowl of the blender until all ingredients are well blended.
After each round of blending, pour the mixture into a food mill with a fine mesh or grating. This will remove the seeds and skin of the vegetables, and any other coarse ingredients, to produce a very smooth soup.
Pour into bowls. Add choice of garnish, and enjoy!

Description: 
This Gazpacho recipe comes from Sevilla, Spain. it is quicker and easier than most of the recipes On this site.  While I was living in Spain I did all the seeding and peeling of tomatoes by hand until I picked up a food mill. This revolutionized my life!
