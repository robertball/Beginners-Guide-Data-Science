Ingredients:
1 1/2 quarts milk
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
In a large saucepan over high heat combine sugar and milk.  When bubbles form at the edges, stir in rice and reduce heat to medium-low.  Cook 60 minutes, stirring often, until rice is tender.  Do not allow to boil.
Remove from heat and vigorously stir in beaten eggs, a little at a time, until well incorporated.  Serve warm.

Description: 
My mom would always make this delicious, creamy rice pudding when we were kids. If a thicker rice is desired, increase rice to 1 1/4 cups and add another egg.  Sprinkle with cinnamon.
