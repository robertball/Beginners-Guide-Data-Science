Ingredients:
16 even-sized open cup mushrooms, stalks cut level
3 Tbsp corn or vegetable oil
1/4C & 1 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened
3 cloves garlic, chopped very finely
2 Tbsp fresh thyme, chopped
1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 C fresh breadcrumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400F.
Lightly fry the mushrooms, cap-side down, in hot oil for 20 seconds.
Arrange the mushrooms in a shallow roasting tin with the stalks facing upwards.
Mix together the butter, garlic, thyme, lemon juice and seasoning.
Spoon a little garlic butter on to each mushroom, then lightly press the breadcrumbs on top.
Either refrigerate for later use, or cook immediately in the oven for 10 minutes.
