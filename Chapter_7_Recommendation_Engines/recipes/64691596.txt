Ingredients:
Nine Uncooked Lasagna Noodles
28 oz. Tomato Purée
Three 12 oz. cans Tomato Paste
One Medium-Sized Onion, chopped
One Clove Garlic, minced
32 oz. Ricotta Cheese
8 oz. Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
5 oz. Grated Parmesan Cheese
2 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 Tbsp Dried Oregano
1 Tbsp Dried Basil (optional)
½ Cup Water for sauce
One Pot of Water

Directions:
Mince the garlic and chop the onion, and sauté in a large pot in olive oil for five minutes.
Add tomato purée and tomato paste, water, and mix well. Mix in oregano and basil (if using), bring to a bubble, then cover and simmer for at least 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
In the meantime, preheat the oven to 350°F, and bring some water to a boil in another large pot. Add lasagna noodles and cook as the package directs. Once they are al dente, strain them, then lay them out on the side of the pot to cool.
In a mixing bowl, mix all three cheeses well.
If desired, you can blend the tomato sauce with an immersion blender for a smoother mixture after the simmer is complete.
Dab some of the finished sauce on the bottom of a baking dish and spread it around. Add three noodles to the bottom of the dish. Top with about a third of the sauce, followed by a third of the cheese mixture, and then three more noodles. Repeat one more time, and then add the remaining sauce and cheese.
Bake uncovered for about 30 minutes. Let it cool, then use a spatula and knife to serve.

Description: 
This was my first attempt at a lasagna dish. I tried to make it as smooth as possible. It can be made with a number of different combinations of herbs and cheese.
