Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) salmon filets, skin on
1/4 cup barbeque sauce
1/4 cup seedless raspberry jam

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Grease an 11x7-inch baking dish.
Place the salmon fillets into the prepared baking dish with skin sides down.
Stir the barbeque sauce and raspberry jam together in a small bowl.
Generously brush the mixture over the salmon.
Bake in the preheated oven until the salmon is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, 35 to 40 minutes. Brush again with the sauce mixture after the first 15 minutes of baking time.
