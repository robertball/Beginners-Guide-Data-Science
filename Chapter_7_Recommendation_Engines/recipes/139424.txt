Ingredients:
2 quarts hot water
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 cup long grain rice
1 cup milk
ice cubes, for serving

Directions:
Pour sugar, cinnamon, and rice into hot water; stir until sugar dissolves. Cover, and let stand at room temperature for at least 3 hours, but preferably overnight.
Stir in milk, then puree with a hand blender, or in batches in a standing blender until the rice resembles fine sand. Strain through several layers of cheesecloth, or through a very fine strainer. Serve over ice.

Description: 
Horchata is a refreshing summer drink.  I learned this recipe a couple years ago from a Mexican coworker, and I was immediately addicted!
