Ingredients:
1 (9.5 inch) baked graham cracker pie crust in pyrex
1/4 cup splenda brown sugar
12 packets spenda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon pumpkin spice
2 eggs
1 (15 ounce) can LIBBY'S® 100% Pure Pumpkin
1 (5 fluid ounce) can NESTLE® CARNATION® Evaporated Milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Combine spenda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pumpkin spice in small bowl. Beat eggs lightly in large bowl. Stir in pumpkin and spenda-spice mixture. Gradually stir in evaporated milk. Pour into pie shell.
Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F.; bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until knife inserted near center comes out clean. Cool on wire rack for 2 hours. Serve immediately or refrigerate. (Do not freeze as this will cause the crust to separate from the filling.)
