Ingredients:
1 cup brown rice flour (or white rice flour if you can't find brown rice)
1/4 cup nutritional yeast flakes
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon rubbed sage (or more to taste)
1 Teaspoon finely ground black pepper (add more if necessary when cooking.)

Directions:
Blend everything together in a blender or food processor to make sure that it is evenly combined and that the nutritional yeast flakes are powdered. Store in a jar in your pantry for 6 months or more!
Alright, now when you're ready to make your gravy from the mix follow the directions below!
To make a batch of gravy -
1/4 cup gravy mix
2 cups unsweetened soy, almond or your favorite non-dairy milk (it must be unsweetened!)
Whisk your gravy mix and soy milk in a small pot over medium-high heat. Cook until thickened. Make sure you are stirring it while cooking, it should only take a couple of minutes to thicken up. The nice thing about rice flour is that it doesn't clump up though so you can be a little more careless with the whisking!
