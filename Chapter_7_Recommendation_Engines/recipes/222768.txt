Description: 
A quick and easy delicious aromatic mayo. I use it on feta chicken burgers served with grilled zucchini, peppers, and onions in pita bread. It went fast the first time I made it, so double up recipe, just in case, and you can have leftovers to refrigerate! It can be served immediately, but I like to let it blend in the fridge for a couple of hours.
