Ingredients:
2 large sweet red peppers
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 1/2 cups cooked brown rice
1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 cup chicken broth
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
4 tablespoons grated Parmesan or Romano cheese, divided

Directions:
Cut tops off peppers; remove seeds. Place peppers cut side down on a microwave-safe plate; cover with plastic wrap. Microwave on high for 2-3 minutes or until crisp-tender; set aside.
In a small skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Remove from the heat; stir in the rice, parsley, salt, cayenne and allspice. In a small saucepan, bring tomato sauce and broth to a boil. Stir in the vinegar, basil and 3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese; stir about 1/2 cup sauce into rice mixture. Spoon into peppers. Place in a greased shallow 1-qt. baking dish.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, for 5-10 minutes or until peppers are tender. Serve with remaining sauce.
