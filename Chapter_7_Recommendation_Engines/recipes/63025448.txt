Ingredients:
1 pound elbow macaroni
·         2 tablespoons unsalted butter
·         2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
·         2 cups milk, warmed, plus 2 tablespoons for egg wash
·         1 pound grated smoked Gouda
·         1 pound grated White Sharp Cheddar
·         Salt and black pepper
·         2 large eggs
·         3 cups seasoned bread crumbs
·         Vegetable oil, for frying

Directions:
Cook the macaroni according to package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. Drain again and set aside.
In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Sprinkle the flour into the butter and stir it with a whisk. Cook for 2 minutes.
Whisk the warmed milk into the flour mixture, working out any lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens, about 2 minutes.
Remove from the heat, add the cheeses, and stir until melted and smooth; season with salt and pepper.
Fold the cheese sauce into macaroni.
Pour the mac and cheese into a shallow pan and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours.
Shape the cold mac and cheese into meatball-sized balls and place them onto a waxed paper-lined tray. Freeze the balls overnight.
Beat the eggs and 2 tablespoons milk together to form an egg wash then into the bread crumbs. Put the balls back into the freezer until you are ready to fry.
Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 350 degrees F. Fry the mac and cheese balls until they are golden brown and center is hot, about 5 minutes. Serve hot with our favorite Marinara or Alfredo sauce or combination of both for dipping.
