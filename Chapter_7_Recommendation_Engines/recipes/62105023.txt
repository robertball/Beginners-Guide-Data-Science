Ingredients:
1 box Macaroni noodles
2 cups milk
1/2 stick butter
1/4 cup flour
1/2 cup milk
1 1/2 (8 oz.) packages of SHARP shredded cheddar cheese
Tobasco Sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Boil water in a large pan--cook one small box of macaroni
Microwave the 2 cups of milk on high for 2 minutes or until hot.
While macaroni is cooking, begin the sauce.
In a 2nd saucepan, melt the butter on medium. Slowly stir in the flour (will become a thick paste.) Add 1/2 cup of cold milk.
With a wisk, add to mixture the 2 cups of hot milk slowly to make it thick and soupy. Cook until bubbling--stir occasionally.
Add 1 1/2 packages of Sharp cheddar cheese (you don't have to use Sharp, but it's seriously recommended. Makes the meal cheesier and overall a lot better)to the mixture. Stir until well blended. Remove from heat. Optional: can add in a few splashes of tobasco sauce. This brings out the flavor of the cheese really well.
Once the noodles are done boiling, drain them well. Pour into a casserole dish.
Pour pan of cheese sauce into the macaroni and stir well. Top with the leftover cheese.
Bake for about 30 minutes, or until some of the cheese on top has turned into a golden brown.
Serve!
