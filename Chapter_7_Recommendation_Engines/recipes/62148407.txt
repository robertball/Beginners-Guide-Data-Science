Ingredients:
6 lg Potatoes, scrubbed, sliced into 1/4" rounds
1/2 t Thyme
1/2 t Basil
1/2 t Oregano
1 t Salt
1/2 t Pepper
1 1/2 t Paprika
1/4 t Cayenne pepper
1/2 t Chili powder
1/2 t celery salt
1 T garlic powder
1 c Flour
1 Egg, beaten
1/2 c Milk
Canola Oil for frying, if you choose to fry.
Ranch dressing or sour cream, optional for dipping.

Directions:
I have two ways to prepared these potatoes - fry them in oil or bake them in oven for a healthier version.  If you desire to bake them - Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  If you choose to fry them, preheat the oil to 375 degrees.
Mix flour and dry spices in shallow dish.  Note: You may  adjust the seasonings to your taste.
Mix egg and milk together in shallow dish.
Dip potato slices into the egg/milk, then into flour mixture until coated.
If frying, drop potatoes into the hot oil for 5 to 7 minutes until tender, brown and crispy.  If your oil is too hot, the coating may slip off in the oil.
If baking, preheat oven 450 F. Place on lightly sprayed pastry sheet or aluminum foil and drizzle with oil. Bake 25-40 minutes or until brown and tender, flipping carefully once to brown on both sides.

Description: 
These potatoes are similar to those served in the 1970's Shakey's Ye Old Pizza Parlor.
