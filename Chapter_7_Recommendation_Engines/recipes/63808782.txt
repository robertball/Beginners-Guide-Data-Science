Ingredients:
10 chicken drumsticks, or equivalent of drumsticks and thigh/breast
6 cups good-tasting chicken stock
3-4 cloves garlic, minced
2 thumb-size pieces galangal OR ginger, minced
3 bay leaves
2 Tbsp. soy sauce
2 tsp. oyster-flavored sauce
8-10 shiitake mushrooms, halved only if large
8-10 crimini or other type of mushrooms, sliced
3 tsp. fish sauce
1 Tbsp. cornstarch
2 Tbsp. vegetable oil

Directions:
Set a large pot to warm over medium-high heat. Add oil and swirl around, then add the garlic and ginger. Stir-fry 3 minutes until fragrant.
Add stock plus bay leaves, soy sauce and oyster sauce.
Add the chicken. Bring back to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, or until you get a good gentle simmer. Leave lid off of the pot.
Stir chicken every 5 minutes or so, letting its juices seep down into the stock for a total of 30 minutes, or until chicken has softened.
Add the mushrooms and gently stir them in. Keep simmering for another 20 minutes or until chicken is tender to your liking (I like mine just starting to come apart from the bone).
When chicken is at your desired tenderness, put cornstarch in a cup and add 3 tbsp. water, stirring until dissolved. Add this to the pot, stirring it into the sauce. Sauce should thicken in 3 minutes.
Add the fish sauce and stir well, then taste-test the dish. If it needs more salt or depth of flavor, add more fish sauce until you're happy with the results. Serve with Thai jasmine rice and ENJOY!
