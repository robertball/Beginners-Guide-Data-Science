Ingredients:
1 Tbs olive oil
1 yellow onion (cut into 1/2" dice)
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper (to taste)
1 1/4 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cooked & shredded)
1 3/4 cups enchilada sauce
9 corn tortillas (6" diameter)
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup shredded white cheddar cheese
3/4 cup shredded yellow cheddar cheese
Sliced green onions (garnish)
Chopped fresh cilantro (garnish)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
In a large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat, warm olive oil. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft (6 to 7 minutes). Remove from heat and let cool.
Add the chicken to the onion and stir well to combine.
Spread 1/4 cup of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of 3 1/2 quart round wide Dutch oven. Arrange 3 tortillas in a single layer on the sauce, overlapping as needed. Top with a generous 1 cup of the chicken-onion mixture, 1/2 cup of the sauce, and 1/4 cup of each cheese.
Repeat the layering 2 more times, alternating the direction of the tortilla layers and finishing with 1/2 cup sauce and 1/4 cup of each cheese.
Transfer to oven and bake for approximately 30-35 minutes or until ingredients are heated through and cheese is melted.
Remove from oven and garnish with green onion and cilantro.
