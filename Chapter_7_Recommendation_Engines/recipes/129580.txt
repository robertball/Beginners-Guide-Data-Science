Ingredients:
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)
1 1/3 cups rye flour
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup rye meal (pumpernickel flour)

Directions:
Sprinkle the yeast over the water in a small bowl. Set aside.
Combine the rye flour with all-purpose flour in a large bowl. Stir in the salt. Mix in the yeast mixture to make a soft dough. Turn dough out onto a board floured with rye meal. Knead lightly, mixing in rye meal as needed. Shape dough into a fat roll, and cut into 12 sections. Roll each section into a ball; cover balls with a towel and let rise 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 baking sheets.
On a floured board, roll out each ball into a flat round about 4 inches in diameter. Place rounds on prepared baking sheets and prick with a fork.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on a rack.

Description: 
This is a recipe for Norwegian rye crisp or hardtack called 'knaakebrod,' very similar to the Finnish variety named 'nakkileipa.' These crackers can be dried and stored a very long time, but they're better fresh!
