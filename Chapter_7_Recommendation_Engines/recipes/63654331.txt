Ingredients:
1 8oz package cream cheese, softened
4 Tbsps white sugar, divided
1 pinch table salt
1 tsp orange zest
1 Tbsp vanilla extract
1 pint heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Prepare by placing a medium mixing bowl in the freezer to chill. Place unopened box of cream cheese on the counter to warm and soften.
Once the cream cheese is soft enough to work, place it in a large mixing bowl with 2 Tbsps white sugar, salt, orange zest, & vanilla. Beat until smooth and well combined.
Pour heavy cream and remaining sugar into the chilled bowl. Beat until stiff peaks form, moving the blender around to incorporate plenty of air.
Fold the whip cream into the cream cheese mixture. Taste and adjust sweetness if desired. Serve immediately or store in the fridge for later use.

Description: 
This frosting works well on cakes, or as a fruit dip. Anytime I serve it as a dip it gets demolished and the bowl gets licked clean! Have fun adjusting the sweetness to your preference.
