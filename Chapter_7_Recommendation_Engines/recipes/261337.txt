Ingredients:
1 pound bulk pork sausage
1 large yellow onion, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
4 large russet potatoes, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1 (32 ounce) container chicken broth
2 cups water, or as needed
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 bunch kale, stems removed and discarded, leaves torn into bite-size pieces
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and garlic; saute until onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
Place potatoes in a slow cooker (such as Crock Pot(R)). Add the cooked sausage and onion mixture. Season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Pour chicken broth on top. Add up to 2 cups water to cover potatoes fully. Stir soup gently. Cover and cook on Low until potatoes are fork-tender, 5 to 6 hours.
Pour heavy cream into the soup. Stir in kale to combine. Cover and cook on High until flavors are incorporated, about 30 minutes more. Garnish with Parmesan cheese.
