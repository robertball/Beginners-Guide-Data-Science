Ingredients:
1 1/2 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
1/4 cup olive oil
4 garlic cloves, chopped
1 onion chopped very small
1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil leaves or 2-3 tsp dried basil leaves
1 1/2 tsp of dried oregano
1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes
1 bay leaf
freshly ground pepper to taste
2 tsp sugar
Kosher salt to taste
2 tbsp of balsamic vinegar or to taste

Directions:
If you like smooth sauce, you can pulse tomatoes with juices in a blender to form a coarse purée.  If not, use diced petite tomatoes with juice instead.
Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
Add garlic and onion and cook, stirring often, until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes.
Add all spices and simmer for an additional minute.
Add tomato purée and sugar and season with salt and pepper.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer gently until sauce is slightly thickened, 10-15 minutes.
Add balsamic vinegar and let stand 5 minutes.
DO AHEAD: Sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill, or freeze for up to 3 months.
