Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups quick-cooking rolled oats
1 cup ground flax seed
1 cup white sugar
2/3 cup sweetened flaked coconut
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups mashed ripe banana
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup melted butter
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Whisk together flour, oats, flax, sugar, coconut, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
Whisk together bananas, sour cream, applesauce, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl. Stir flour mixture into banana mixture just until all dry ingredients are moistened; fold in blueberries. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
When the local library ladies asked me to send them the recipe for the muffins that I'd brought to story time, I realized I'd created something special. They were enjoyed by the kids and adults alike. Delicious and wholesome, the coconut, banana, and flax add a little something extra to the boring old blueberry muffin.
