Ingredients:
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (1.27 ounce) packet dry fajita seasoning, divided
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 (11 ounce) can Mexican-style corn
3/4 cup salsa
1 (10 ounce) package mixed baby salad greens
1 bunch green onion, thinly sliced
3/4 cup cilantro leaves
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle both sides of each chicken breast with 2 tablespoons of the fajita seasoning. When skillet is hot, add chicken; cook until well-browned and cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken from pan, cut into bite-size pieces, and set aside.
Pour beans, corn, and salsa into the hot skillet, and season with remaining fajita mixture; simmer until hot, about 2 to 3 minutes.
In a large bowl, toss salad greens, green onions, and cilantro with remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil and lime juice. Add chicken and bean mixture; toss again, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm.
