Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup sliced fresh strawberries, mashed
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup sliced fresh strawberries
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust

Directions:
Mix cream cheese, white sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until smooth. Stir 3/4 cup mashed strawberries into cream cheese mixture.
Beat heavy cream and confectioners' sugar in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the cream will form sharp peaks. Fold whipped cream into cream cheese mixture until evenly mixed; fold in remaining 1/4 cup sliced strawberries.
Spoon strawberry mixture into graham cracker crust. Chill at least 3 hours before serving.

Description: 
A wonderfully easy recipe that even my young sister-in-law can make. She isn't the best cook in the world because she is new at it. But her family was impressed when she made this simple pie.
