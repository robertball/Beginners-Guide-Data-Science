Ingredients:
8 ounces whole-wheat penne
2 cups 1/2-inch cauliflower florets
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1/2 cup dry white wine
3 cups low-fat milk
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 cup shredded Gruyère, or Swiss cheese
3 cups shredded cooked chicken, or turkey (12 ounces; see Tip)
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, or scallion greens

Directions:
1.Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 5 minutes. Add cauliflower florets and cook until the pasta and florets are tender, about 4 minutes more. Drain, rinse and return to the pot.
2.Meanwhile, heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add wine and cook until reduced slightly, about 1 minute. Whisk milk, flour, salt and pepper together in a medium bowl and add to the pan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Cook, stirring, until thickened, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and stir in cheese until smooth. Stir chicken (or turkey) and mustard into the cheese sauce; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes.
3.Stir the sauce into the drained pasta and cauliflower. Serve sprinkled with chives (or scallion greens).
