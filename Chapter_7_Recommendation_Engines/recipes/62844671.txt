Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Whip everything together and pour into a large (deep dish) graham cracker crust. Refrigerate it and try not to eat the whole damned thing in one night! Was great with Peach Crisp, blueberry sauce and all alone with strong coffee (for breakfast as usual).

Description: 
This wonderful pie is a whipped cream cheese and condensed milk concoction flavored with vanilla and lemon juice. Takes no time at all! Put it all in a deep dish graham cracker crust! Cover it with any fruity thing or eat it alone, I gotta figure out some way to get dark chocolate involved with this one... or, hmmm, what about an Oreo Crust?Modified from: Cream Cheese Pie
