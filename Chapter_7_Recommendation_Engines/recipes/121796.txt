Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup butter (no substitutes)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
4 eggs
Filling:
2 cups finely chopped cooked chicken
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup chopped celery
1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions
1/4 cup chopped pecans
2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish
1/4 teaspoon onion salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon paprika
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a saucepan, bring water, butter and salt to a boil. Add flour all at once and stir until a smooth ball forms. Remove from the heat; let stand for 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until smooth and shiny. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto a greased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks. Immediately cut a slit in each puff to allow steam to escape; cool. Split puffs and set tops aside; remove soft dough form inside. In a bowl, combine the filling ingredients; mix well. Fill puffs and replace tops. Refrigerate until serving. Refrigerate leftovers.
