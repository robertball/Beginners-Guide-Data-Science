Description: 
This is a a grilled salad that is quite common throughout Tunisia. There are variations on how this salad is made throughout the different cities and regions of Tunisia. You can even use it as a spread in sandwiches. It's one of my family's best-loved recipes. Enjoy with nice warm crusty French bread or even crackers.
