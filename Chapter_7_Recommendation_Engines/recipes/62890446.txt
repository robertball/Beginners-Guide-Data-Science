Description: 
Unlike the ready-made supermarket variety, these eggs will bite you back. My tip - instead of slicing them on the long axis, gut a small sliver off the top and bottom, then cut along the short axis. They'll stand up nicely, and take up less room to store and serve. Ideal for a pot-luck!
