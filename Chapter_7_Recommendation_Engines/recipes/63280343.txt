Ingredients:
1 small jalapeno, brunoise cut
1 sweet orange, sectioned (add zest to mixture for an extra zing)
1/4 cup rice vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp Sriracha
1 tbsp grapeseed oil
5 sea scallops
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine first five ingredients in a small bowl and allow to sit for 15 minutes. Remove orange sections from the bowl and place in another small prep dish.
Heat grapeseed oil in large skillet over high heat. Pat scallops dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Working in batches, add scallops to skillet in single layer; saut√© until brown on outside and just opaque in center, about 2 minutes per side. In the last minute of cooking, add the jalapeno/rice vinegar/Sriracha mixture to the pan. Cook until mixture thickens a bit.
Remove scallops and plate. Drizzle any of the thickened glaze over top of the scallops and top with the pre-soaked orange sections. Enjoy!
