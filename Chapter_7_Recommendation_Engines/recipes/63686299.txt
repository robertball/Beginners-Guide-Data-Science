Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato
3 eggs
3/4 cup applesauce, unsweetened
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp ginger
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300Â° F
Spray a 9 muffin cup pan, or a mini muffin pan with baking spray.
Wash the sweet potato and poke holes all over with a fork.
Microwave the sweet potato until soft. (Depending upon your microwave, this may take 5 minutes or more. Start with less time, and gradually add more to make the potato soft.)
Once the sweet potato is cool to the touch, peel and place in a medium bowl.
Combine the peeled sweet potato, eggs, and applesauce.
In a large bowl whisk together the cinnamon, ginger, flour, and oats.
Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and scoop the potato mixture into the center.
Stir until thoroughly combined.
Spoon the mixture into the muffin pan.
Bake for 30 minutes with the 9 cup pan, or 20 minutes with the mini muffin pan.
Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove the muffins from the pan and let them cool completely on a wire rack.
