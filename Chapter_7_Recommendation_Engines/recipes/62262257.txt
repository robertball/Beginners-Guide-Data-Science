Ingredients:
4 carrots, 1 minced, 3 roughly chopped
4 stalks celery, 1 minced, 3 roughly chopped
1 onion, 1/4 minced, 3/4 diced
1 green bell pepper, 1/4 minced, 3/4 roughly diced
8 ounces Crimini mushrooms, roughly sliced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1-1/4 pounds extra-lean ground beef (I used 93% lean)
1/2 cup full-flavored red wine (I use a Cabernet Sauvignon)
28 ounces canned diced tomatoes, with juice
6 ounces tomato paste
2 tablespoons fresh basil, cut chiffonade
2 tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped
2 tablespoon fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
1-1/4 cups shredded Parmesan cheese
1-1/4 cups shredded Fontina cheese

Directions:
In a heavy sauce pan, heat oil over medium-high heat and saute minced carrots, celery, onion, green pepper and garlic until tender, about 5 minutes.
Add ground beef and brown, about 5 minutes. Add wine and simmer until the wine reduces by half.
Add tomatoes, tomato paste, carrots, celery, onion, green pepper, mushrooms, basil and oregano. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.
Serve over polenta or pasta, sprinkled with Parmesan, Fontina and parsley
