Beat in flour mixture until blended and consistency of brown sugar.
Gradually beat in the eggs.
Fold in just until combined the bananas and chocolate chips (sometimes I use half chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips).

Promptly remove baked banana bread from loaf pan and let cool.
Serve warm with an ice cold glass of milk!
