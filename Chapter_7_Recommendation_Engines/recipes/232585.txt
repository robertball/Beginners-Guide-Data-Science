Ingredients:
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, thinly sliced
1 (15.25 ounce) can pineapple rings, drained
1 (8 ounce) package Monterey Jack cheese, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange chicken breast slices on a baking sheet in a single layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Top each slice of chicken with 1 to 1 1/2 pineapple rings and a slice of Monterey Jack cheese.
Continue baking in the oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.
