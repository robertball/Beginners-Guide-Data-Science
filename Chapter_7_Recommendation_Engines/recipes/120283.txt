Description: 
'I had a hard time getting my three sons to eat vegetables when they were young.' recalls Lucille Wermes of Camp, Arkansas. 'So I fooled them with this casserole that looks just like stuffing when it comes out of the oven. Now that they're grown, they sill ask for 'broccoli stuffing' when they come for dinner.'
