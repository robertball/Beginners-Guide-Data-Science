Ingredients:
1 (15.5 ounce) can French-style green beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can sliced potatoes, drained
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup
1 1/8 cups milk
3 tablespoons French-fried onions, divided
salt and pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste
1 (8 ounce) package dry bread stuffing mix

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the green beans and potatoes into a 2 quart casserole dish. Stir in the cream of celery soup and milk. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and stir in 1 tablespoon of the French fried onions. Sprinkle the remaining onions on top.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. While the casserole is baking, prepare the stuffing according to package directions. Spread over the top of the casserole. I like to mash it flat with a spatula so that it covers the entire dish.
Return to the oven for about 10 minutes, or until crunchy. You can also broil for a few minutes for extra crunch.

Description: 
Creamy, crunchy, feel good side dish. Perfect as a side dish on Thanksgiving. Goes great with chicken and pork chops. Sometimes on a rainy day I'll just eat a great big bowl of it. You can save on calories by using water instead of milk and going a bit easy on the French fried onions.
