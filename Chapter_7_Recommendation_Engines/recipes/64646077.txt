Ingredients:
4 #10 Cans of Tomato Sauce
4 large Onions chopped
2 pounds Baby Bella Mushrooms
4 Tablespoons Butter
4 Tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil
2 Cups grated Parmesan Cheese
11 Heaping Tablespoons Italian Seasoning
5 TBSP Salt (I use 1/2 this amount because of high BP
2.5 TBSP White Pepper.
10 to 12 Garlic Cloves minced
4 TBSP Dried Basil or just a bunch of fresh basil.
2 Cups Sugar (I use raw Agave Nectar for a lower glycemic index but is sweeter so I use 1 cup Agave)
1 4 to 5 pound leg of lamb

Directions:
Melt butter in Stainless Steel Pan.
Add chopped onions and saute for 10 minutes
Add EVOO and mushrooms.  Saute until moisture is cooked out and mushrooms and onions start to turn golden.  Add minced garlic and cook for another couple minutes.
Meanwhile, put tomato sauce (I like Hunts best) in 18 quart Nesco Roaster Pan.  Add Parmesan, Italian Seasoning, Salt, and Pepper.
Add garlic, mushroom and onion mixture to sauce and stir with wire whisk.
Add leg of lamb and cook on 180 to 200 for 10 hours.  Stir every 20 minutes.
Add Sugar or Agave and cook an additional hour stirring very often so the sugar doesn't burn.
We like to slice the leg of lamb and serve with the first sitting of completed sauce.  Store sauce in 16 ounce containers in the freezer.
