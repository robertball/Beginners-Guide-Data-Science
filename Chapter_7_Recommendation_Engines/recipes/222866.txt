Ingredients:
1 cup warm water
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon sea salt
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried cilantro
1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
Put the water, olive oil, sugar, sea salt, flour, garlic, oregano, basil, black pepper, cilantro, paprika, and dry yeast into the pan of a bread machine individually in order as listed. Select Dough cycle; press Start. Let dough rest 5 to 30 minutes before using; the longer it rests, the thicker the crust.

Description: 
Borrowed from a handful of other pizza dough recipes and tweaked to yield a tasty, thick crust using a bread machine. If you use a pizza stone, sprinkle it with cornmeal before placing the pizza on it to help keep it from sticking. Feel free to try different spices if you don't like any of the ones in this recipe.
