Ingredients:
1 teaspoon unsalted butter
1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
8 ounces medium shrimp - peeled, deveined, and cut into 1-inch pieces
1/4 teaspoon chile flakes, or to taste
salt to taste
1/4 cup dry white wine
6 ounces cream cheese, cut into pieces
1/2 cup grated mozzarella cheese
1/3 cup sour cream
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
3 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley, divided

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a rack in the top third of the oven.
Melt butter in an 8-inch cast iron skillet or oven-safe pan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add shrimp, chile flakes, and salt. Cook until shrimp turn pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Add wine and simmer until about 1 tablespoon liquid remains, 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove from heat.
Stir cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and 2 tablespoons parsley into the shrimp mixture in the skillet. Season with salt. Top with remaining Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling, 18 to 20 minutes. Increase heat to broiling and cook dip until top is brown in spots, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Remove from the oven and top dip with 1 tablespoon parsley. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.
