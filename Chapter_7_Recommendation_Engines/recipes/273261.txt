Ingredients:
2 cups buttermilk
4 tablespoons shortening, melted
2 eggs
1 teaspoon Celtic sea salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup oat flour (such as Bob's Red Mill®)
1/4 cup teff flour (such as Bob's Red Mill®)
2 scoops protein powder (such as Z Natural Foods™)
2 tablespoons raw cane sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
coconut oil no-stick cooking spray

Directions:
Mix buttermilk, shortening, eggs, and salt in a bowl. Mix all-purpose flour, oat flour, teff flour, protein powder, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Pour flour mixture into buttermilk mixture slowly; stir to combine.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
