Ingredients:
7 eggs, divided
3/4 cup whole milk
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 ounces ricotta cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 slices deli ham
1/4 cup shaved Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place a cast iron skillet in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
Whisk 3 eggs together in a bowl until well blended and frothy. Add milk and 2 tablespoons melted butter; mix well. Stir in flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and blend until batter is smooth.
Place 1 tablespoon butter in the hot skillet and swirl until bottom is evenly coated and butter is melted. Pour batter into the skillet and place immediately in the oven.
