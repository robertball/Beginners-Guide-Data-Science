Description: 
This is easy and delicious, and the ingredients are slightly different than traditional hummus - great for when you don't have tahini!  It's a great mild but rich & warm flavour.  You can always pump up the ingredients to suit your tastes (a cup of cilantro for instance, or a full bud of roasted garlic).
