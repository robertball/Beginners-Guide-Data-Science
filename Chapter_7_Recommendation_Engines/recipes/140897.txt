Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
6 cups chicken broth or vegetable broth
1 pound potatoes - peeled and cubed
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon paprika
8 ounces smoked salmon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1/4 cup white wine
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon hot sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper
1 cup half and half

Directions:
In a large stockpot over medium-high heat, combine the butter, olive oil, onion, garlic, and celery. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, or until the onions are transparent. Sprinkle flour over the mixture and stir well to make a dry roux. Gradually add the chicken broth and stir until slightly thickened. Stir in the potatoes, dill, tarragon, thyme, and paprika. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.
Stir in the salmon, wine, lemon juice, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Simmer over low heat, uncovered for 10 minutes.
Mix in the half-and-half and continue to simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Do not let the chowder boil after adding the half-and-half. Serve hot.

Description: 
My sister made this recipe when we were camping in a rustic cabin on the Strait of Juan de Fuca running between Vancouver Island and Washington's Olympic peninsula. It's very, very warming and delicious.
