Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon salt
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two to three baking sheets.
Beat the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Mix in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Stir in the cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt until well blended. Mix in the flour, one cup at a time, until the dough gathers together. With floured hands, pinch off small, 1/2 teaspoon  amounts of dough, roll into tiny balls, and place on prepared baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until bottom of cookies are light tan, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool 15 minutes on baking sheets. Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
These are deliciously tiny, somewhat time consuming to make (but totally worth it), eaten-by-the-handful Danish shortbread cookies. This recipe was given to me by a local grandmother at the annual Scandinavian Festival in Junction City, Oregon. Stored in an airtight container, they'll last close to two weeks.
