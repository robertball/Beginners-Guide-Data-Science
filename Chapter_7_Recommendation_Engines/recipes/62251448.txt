Ingredients:
5-6 lb pork shoulder, bone-in
2 medium sized onion, cut into 1/2 inch slices
2-3 teaspoon seasoning salt
2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 bottle of BBQ sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven on 325 degrees.
Rinse and pat the pork dry.  Season generously with seasoning salt, garlic powder and paprika.
In a large dutch oven or a heavy-duty, all-metal pot (something that can be put into the oven), heat up 2 tablespoons of oil on medium high heat. Sear the pork on all sides until well-browned and a nice crust has formed.  Once browned, add the sliced onions into the pot.  Cover the pot, making sure the lid is oven-safe.  Bake for 2 1/2 hrs. in the oven until fork tender and meat is falling of the bone. (Depending on the size of the roast, bake time varies from 2-3 hrs.)  Cool slightly and shred.  Eat with your favorite BBQ sauce.
