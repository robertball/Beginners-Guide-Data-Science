Ingredients:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
Salt and pepper, to taste
2 slices mozzarella or Monterey Jack cheese
2 slices Canadian bacon or ham
2 large fresh basil leaves
Cheese Sauce:
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon flour
¼ cup heavy cream
¼ cup milk
½ cup shredded mozzarella or Monterey Jack cheese
Smidge cayenne pepper
Salt, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°.
Line an 8x8” pan with foil.
Pound chicken between 2 sheets of waxed paper until fairly uniform, about a 1/2-inch thickness.
Place chicken breasts in pan.
Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.
Bake 30 minutes, or until just about cooked through.
Remove from oven.
Place 1 basil leaf on top of each breast.
Place 1 slice of Canadian bacon on top of each basil leaf.
Top each with 1 slice cheese. Return to oven for 5-8 minutes, until cheese is melted. Meanwhile, prepare cheese sauce: In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in flour until bubbly.
Slowly pour in cream and milk.
Add cayenne and salt.
Bring to a boil over high heat.
Boil 1 minute, until thickened.
Remove from heat.
Place 1 chicken breast on each plate.
Generously drizzle with cheese sauce. Enjoy!

After visiting a local Italian restaurant my family had been raving about, I tried to recreate my mom's favorite dish that was served there.  I think we like this one better than the original!
