Ingredients:
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons soy sauce
14 ounces seitan, cut into bite-size pieces
1 yellow onion, diced
3 ribs celery, thinly sliced
2 carrots, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced
2 potatoes, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles Irish stout beer
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and soy sauce in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute seitan in hot oil until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.
Heat remaining olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion, celery, carrots, potatoes, and garlic in hot oil until onions are soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and slowly stir beer into vegetable mixture.
Stir brown sugar, flour, thyme, salt, and black pepper into beer mixture; add seitan. Bring mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook until stew reduces and thickens, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
You'll find some of the most versatile vegetables simmering in a pot of thick Irish beer that, when thickened with flour and sweetened with a bit of brown sugar and soy sauce, becomes a rich and flavorful stew. Serve when it's cold or when you're looking for a hearty stew that will satisfy vegetarian and non-vegetarians alike! Make sure to get the regular beer, not stout!
