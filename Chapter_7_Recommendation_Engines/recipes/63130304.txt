Description: 
Jen's notes: like Costa Rican recipe. Typically soaked in lime/lemon juice, drained; add mayo until it's a nice 'dressing' consistency. If it's too watery, drain more of lemon/lime juice out. I added cilantro too, but celery seed would be interesting. So good on salads, in tacos, you name it.Modified from: Crisp Onion Relish
