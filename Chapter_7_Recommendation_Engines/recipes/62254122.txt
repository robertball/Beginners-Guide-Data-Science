Ingredients:
3/4 cup low sodium chicken or beef broth (I use Swanson, it has the least sodium)
1/3 cup real unsalted butter
1 tsp. chicken or beef bouillon granuals (NOT cubes, too much sodium)
1/2 cup powdered milk
1 egg
3 cups whole wheat flour (NOT white)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325* F.
Place broth in a large bowl with butter and bouillon granuals.  Microwave on high 1-2 minutes.  Stir to blend in bouillon and melt butter.  With a mixer, mix in remaining ingedients.  Dough will be stiff.  On a lightly floured surface (floured with whole wheat flour), roll or pat dough to 1/2" thickness.  Cut into shapes with mini cookie cutters or with a knife, cut the dough into small diamond shape pieces.  Place on a parchment lined or Pam sprayed cookie sheet, close together (they do not spread), bake in a preheated 325* F. oven for 40 minutes (biscuits should be hard).  Turn off oven and leave biscuits in the oven for 1 hour to dry out (DO NOT open oven door during this time).  Transfer biscuits to a cooling rack, when cooled, store biscuits in a tin or a zip lock baggie.

Description: 
I have been using this recipe for my pups as well as for friends pups for over 10 years.  Like us, too much salt is not good for animals so only use the bouillon granules NOT the bouillon cubes since the granules have less sodium than the cubes. And white flour is also not good for animals so please do not substitute white flours for the whole wheat :)
