Image:

Ingredients:
12 ounce package smoked sausage, sliced
1 lb fresh green beans, trimmed
2 medium - large white onion, diced
4 - 6 large potatoes, quartered
10 - 12 cups chicken broth
1/2 tsp - 1 tbsp liquid crab boil seasoning
1 or 2 cans sweet corn, drained (optional)
Salt, to taste

Directions:
Place onions and green beans in a large pot, cover with chicken broth. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, about  10 minutes (for softer beans, cook 20 to 30 minutes) before adding potatoes and sausage. Add broth or water if needed to cover.  Bring to a simmer once again and cook 10 - 20 minutes more, covered, until green beans are tender and potatoes are easily pierced with a fork. Add 1/2 tsp to 1 tbsp liquid crab boil seasoning (to taste. It can be quite spicy, so use a smaller amount if you are unfamiliar with it) and corn. Cover pot and let it sit 5 to 10 minutes with the heat off. This seasoning gets more intense as sits, so if you reached "peak" spiciness after 5 minutes, you may want to drain the liquid some and replace it with more broth.  Taste and add salt if you desire.

This is recipe that developed from my fondness of this classic southern dish, and my boys' fondness of everything spicy.
