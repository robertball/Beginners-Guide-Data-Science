I've been making my guacamole for about 15 years; it's a party and family favorite. After tweaking it and making it absolutely perfect, I have decided it's time to share the recipe for all to enjoy. It's a perfect combination of tangy, creamy, and fresh. Serve with corn tortilla chips. This recipe will be requested by your friends and family for a long time to come. Enjoy!
