Ingredients:
2 Fresh quality peaches (in prime of season)
4 cups Instant (or quick)oats
3 Tbs butter
maple syrup (for drizzling)
corn syrup (for drizzling)
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 tsp. almond extract
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
1/3 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Granola base:
Heat large skillet over medium heat & melt butter in the pan. Pour quick oats over butter and stir as they cook. After about 30 seconds drizzle equal parts maple syrup and corn syrup until oats are coated. Continue to stir and turn oats. Either add brown sugar at the very end of cooking..turning constantly to not burn the sugar or pour the oats into a medium bowl and add the brown sugar then. Stir the sugar, extracts, and chocolate chips into the granola. Stir well.
Allow granola to cool and then serve with freshly cut peaches. *The peaches must be in their peak season to be sweet enough...canned peaches will not be as good!*

A chewier version of a no-bake Peach Cobbler or Peach crisp. I make this for my husband in our down home farm community where Calhoun County peaches are extra-sweet!
