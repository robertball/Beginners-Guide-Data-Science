Ingredients:
2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
3 teaspoons curry powder
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 (8 ounce) package fresh spinach
1/2 diced green chile pepper, or to taste
1 cube vegetable bouillon
2 teaspoons chili jam (optional)
1 (8.8 ounce) package halloumi cheese, sliced
1 (7 ounce) can chickpeas, drained

Directions:
Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Cook until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain.
Combine sweet potatoes, tomatoes, curry powder, chili powder, and cumin in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Add coconut milk, spinach, chile pepper, bouillon cube, and chili jam. Simmer until curry starts to thicken and has cooked down a little, 15 to 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, fry halloumi in a skillet over medium heat until browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Add cooked halloumi and chickpeas to curry and heat through, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
I saw this at a festival last year but never got to try it, so I came up with a recipe that I love and is very adaptable to different tastes. Serve hot with brown basmati rice and papadums.
