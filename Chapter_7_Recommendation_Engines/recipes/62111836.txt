Description: 
The Hungarian Potato recipe came from our junior high school secretary many years ago.
Bring this to your reunions, pot-luck dinners or serve during the holidays for buffets. 
Using common ingredients found in the pantry and fridge, takes a little time to prep the ingredients but it's worth it.
