Ingredients:
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/8 cup honey
1/8 cup butter
1/8 cup natural peanut butter
1/2 banana, mashed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
5/8 cup whole wheat flour
1/8 cup oat bran
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 pinch pumpkin pie spice
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons sunflower seeds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the brown sugar, honey, butter and peanut butter until smooth. Stir in the banana and vanilla. Combine the whole wheat flour, oat bran, oats, baking soda, salt and pumpkin pie spice in a separate bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until it forms a smooth dough. Mix in the cranberries, chocolate chips and sunflower seeds. Drop by spoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are lightly browned at the edges.

Description: 
An equal amount of cranberries to chocolate chips equals heaven! These are very high in fiber as well given the oat bran.
