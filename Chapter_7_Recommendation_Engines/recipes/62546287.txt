Ingredients:
1 cup soft butter
½ cup sifted confectioner’s sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 ¼ cups all purpose flour
¼ teaspoon salt
¾ cup finely chopped nuts (I use walnuts or pecans)

Directions:
Mix butter, sugar and vanilla thoroughly.  Measure flour by dip-level-pour method or by sifting.  Blend flour and salt; stir in.  Mix in nuts.    Chill.
Preheat oven to 400F.  Roll into 1 inch balls.  Place on ungreased baking sheet.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes.  While still warm, roll in confectioner’s sugar.  Cool.  Roll in confectioner’s sugar again.
