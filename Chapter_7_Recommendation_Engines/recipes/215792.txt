Place the jalapeno peppers into the work bowl of a food processor, then pour in the apple cider vinegar, brown mustard, soy sauce, and agave syrup. Pulse several times, then process for a few seconds to combine. Pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss. Refrigerate from 1 hour to overnight. Before serving, sprinkle with roasted ginger and black pepper; toss again to serve.

Description: 
This is not for the weak stomach; this spicy slaw is a nice addition when you want to add a side dish with an Asian flair.  Refrigerate salad for at least an hour, but 24 is better to allow flavors to set. Serve by itself or on an Asian salad. Also makes a good spring roll filling.
