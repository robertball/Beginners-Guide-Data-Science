Ingredients:
For the crust (if not using pre-made, refrigerated pie crust):
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon toasted wheat germ
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon olive oil, ideally infused with herbs
Cooking spray
For the filling:
1 small eggplant, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices
3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
Drizzle of olive oil
4 garlic cloves
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1 medium zucchini, cut lengthwise and then sliced into 1/4-inch thick slices
1 red pepper, cut into chunks
1 orange pepper, cut into chunks
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan (strict vegetarians can use smoked gouda or more mozzarella)
NOTE: If you’d like a fluffier, more quiche-like texture, whisk two eggs with about 3/4 cup of heavy cream and pour it over the vegetables and cheese before baking  making sure it doesn’t spill over the crust. Then, bake until the top is golden brown.

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
For the crust (otherwise, skip to step 5):
If you’re making your own crust, then start preparing it by lightly spooning flour into a dry measuring cup – level it with a knife. Mix the flour, wheat germ, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and stir it with a whisk. Make a well in the center of the mixture, and then add the water and 1 tablespoon of oil. Stir together to form a soft dough.
Put the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead lightly four times, then gently press the dough into a 4-inch circle on plastic wrap. Cover and let it chill for 15 minutes. Then, overlap two sheets of plastic wrap on a slightly damp surface, and unwrap the dough and put it on the plastic wrap.
Cover the dough with two more sheets of plastic wrap and roll the dough, while covered, into an 11-inch circle. Remove the top sheets of plastic wrap and fit the dough (plastic-side up) into a 10-inch round removable-bottom tart pan that has been greased with cooking spray. Remove the rest of the plastic wrap.
Press the dough against the bottom and sides of the greased, 10-inch round tart pan. Pierce the bottom and sides of the dough with a fork, and bake it for 10 minutes. Then, let it cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
summer vegetables and eggs quick tart...Tarts, quiches, and frittatas are all great ways to use whatever ingredients you have on hand to make something tasty  but what exactly is the difference between the three? Not too much  tarts can be both savory and sweet, unlike savory quiche  and don’t always have eggs. Frittatas don’t have a crust and don’t typically have milk or cream, either. 

For a true taste of summer, try this tart!
