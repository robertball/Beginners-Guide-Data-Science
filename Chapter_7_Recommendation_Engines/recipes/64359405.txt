Ingredients:
1 - 3/4 Cups Flour
1/4 Cup Almond Meal (can substitute another 1/4 Cup flour)
2 TBS Sugar
3 TBS Packed Brown Sugar
1 tsp Baking Powder
pinch Baking Soda
Zest of 1 Medium Orange
1 tsp Salt
6 TBS Butter, VERY COLD and cut into small cubes
3/4 Cup Sour Cream
1 Large Egg
1 tsp Vanilla
1 (12 Ounce) Bag Mini-Chocolate Chips
2 TBS Melted Butter
1/4 Cup Sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Mix flour, almond meal, both sugars, baking powder and soda, orange zest and salt.
Add flour mix to the bowl of a food processor. Add the COLD Butter one cube at a time with the processor running. Continue to process until the mix forms into tiny beads.
In a large bowl, whisk together the Sour Cream, Egg, and Vanilla.
BY HAND, do not add to the food processor as that would cause tough scones... By hand add the flour mix to the wet ingredients and mix until just blended. do not over mix.
Fold in the chocolate chips.
Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Form into a flat 7 inch circle and slice into 8 pie shaped pieces.
Transfer to a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, pieces separated by about an inch so they are not touching. Bake for 15-17 minutes until top just begins to brown on the edges
Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes. While the scones are still warm, brush with the melted butter and then sprinkle additional sugar on the top
Best served warm with a nice hot cup of coffee, but tastes great room temperature. If not served immediately, store in air tight container.... And ENJOY!!!
