Ingredients:
2 cups premium grade sushi rice (I used Nishiki)
2 cups water + extra for rinsing
1/3 cup rice vinegar
2 TBSP sugar
1 tsp kosher salt

Directions:
1. Put rice in a bowl or pot, and add some drinking water.  Using a clean hand, scrub rice in a circular motion to polish it.
2. Drain water from rice.
3. Repeat 1-2 four times, or until water is mostly clear.
4. Drain rice over a fine-meshed strainer.  Try to get rid of as much excess water as possible, but do NOT leave rice to dry.  It should be damp.
5. Add all ingredients (rice, 2 cups of water, sugar, salt, and vinegar) to the inner pot.
6. Mix with clean hand.
7. Swish to ensure rice is level.
8. Close the lid with the steam release in “Sealed” position.
9. Run a manual cycle for four minutes on high pressure.
10. When it beeps to indicate done, use the 10-minute natural release (don't touch it for 10 minutes; after 10 minutes, carefully release steam valve).
11. Open the lid, stir, and enjoy!
