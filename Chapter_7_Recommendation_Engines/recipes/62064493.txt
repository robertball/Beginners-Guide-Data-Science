Ingredients:
1 pumpkin, 5-7 pounds
6 eggs
2 C heavy cream
1/2 C Brown Sugar
1 TBS Molasses
1/2 tsp. nutmeg
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 tsp. ginger
2 TBS butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400. Cut top off pumpkin and remove only the seeds and stringy "stuff" insode the pumpkin.  It's recommended that the pumpkin remain abit messy inside.  In a bowl, slightly beat the eggs.  Mix in the remainder of the ingredients, stirring until thoroughly blended.  Pour mixture into the pumpkin. Replace top on pumpkin.  Place pumpkin on a baking sheet and place in center of oven.  Bake for 1 hour.  Check to see if pumpkin is turning black.  Is so, cover with foil.  Remove lid and set back into oven for another 20-30 min or until mixture inside is thickened. Once this happens take out pumpkin and let set for 10-15min to cool and thicken up more.  Serve in bowls with a scrape of the pumpkin insides as well!  Very good and sweet!

Description: 
I'm told this pie baked right in a pumpkin was George Washington's favorite!  While is was called pie back then, it is what we call custard today! This recipe is so simple but provides an impressive presentation!
