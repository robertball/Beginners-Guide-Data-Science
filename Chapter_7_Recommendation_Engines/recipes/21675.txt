Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon wheat germ
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, beaten
1/3 cup milk
1 cup canned cream-style corn
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups.
Place bacon in a skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, wheat germ and salt. In a separate bowl, combine eggs, milk, corn, butter, oil and bacon. Stir egg mixture into dry ingredients, just until combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25, until golden brown.
