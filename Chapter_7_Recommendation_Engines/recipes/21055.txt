Ingredients:
4 cups white sugar
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 cup butter
1 cup crunchy peanut butter
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme

Directions:
Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish and set aside.  Butter a 3 quart saucepan.
Place buttered saucepan over medium heat, and combine sugar, evaporated milk and 1 cup butter within.  Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.
Remove from heat and stir in peanut butter and marshmallow creme.  Beat vigorously until smooth.  Pour quickly into prepared baking dish.  Let cool completely before cutting into squares.
