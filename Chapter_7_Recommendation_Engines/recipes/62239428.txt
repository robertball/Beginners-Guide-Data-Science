Ingredients:
1 ounce sliced almonds
8 1/2 ounces AP flour (can sub in at least 1/2 whole wheat)
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3 whole eggs
3/4 cup plain (or vanilla) yogurt
1/4 cup vegetable oil (or applesauce)
8 ounces sugar
10 ounces grated parsnips

Directions:
Place the almonds in a single layer in a pie pan and place in oven. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the nuts until lightly toasted, approximately 20 minutes while the oven heats.
Grate the parsnips - do not use a food processor as the inner core is very woody and should be discarded, weigh the parsnips after grating.
Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt.
Whisk the eggs, yogurt, vegetable oil, and sugar in a large mixing bowl until combined. Add the flour mixture and parsnips, and fold with a spatula until all of the flour is moistened, there will be some lumps. Divide the mixture evenly among the muffin cups (approx 1/3 c).
Bake 20-25 min.
