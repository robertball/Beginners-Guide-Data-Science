Ingredients:
chicken livers
bacon grease or oil for sauteeing
minced onion
minced garlic
butter

Directions:
Start by rinsing the livers under cold water. Drain well and pat dry with paper towels.
Add enough cooking oil or bacon grease to just cover the bottom of your frying pan. Heat the pan then add the livers. Turn the livers so each side gets a bit browned. Then turn the heat down to medium or medium low, cover the pan with a lid, and let the livers cook until tender (about 15 minutes).
While the livers are pan frying, you can chop an onion if you want, or mince a clove of garlic, and add it to the pan. You can also season with salt and pepper to taste. After the livers have fried for about 10 minutes, add a pat of butter (real butter, not margarine) to the pan and put the lid back on.
Let the livers pan fry for about 15 minutes total, then check one for doneness. The livers should be cooked through but should have just a bit of a lighter color in the center.

Description: 
Chicken livers are very tender and have just a hint of wild flavor. If you want the best tasting chicken livers, you should opt to pan fry them. Pan fried chicken livers are not as gritty as simmered livers and they have a more firm texture.
