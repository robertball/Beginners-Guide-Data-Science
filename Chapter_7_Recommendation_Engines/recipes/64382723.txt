Ingredients:
1 (12 oz) package al frescoÂ® Roasted Pepper & Asiago Chicken Sausage
3 cups tomatoes, fresh, diced
3 cloves garlic, finely minced
1 tbsp cilantro, fresh, finely chopped
1 tbsp parsley, fresh, chopped
2 tbsp basil, fresh, chopped
2 tbsp lemon juice, fresh
1 tsp vinegar, balsamic
5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, divided
1/2 cup red onion, finely chopped
1/4 tsp black pepper
1 tsp sugar
1 loaf French bread (sliced into 32 pieces)
Cooking Spray, olive oil
2 tbsp Asiago cheese, fresh, shreddedfor garnish
1/4 cup oregano, fresh leaves for garnish - wash and pat dry

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, minced garlic, chopped herbs, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, 2 tbs of olive oil, and chopped red onion. Season with salt, sugar and black pepper.
Brush the French bread slices lightly with the remaining 3 tbs of olive oil and lightly toast under the broiler (about 5 - 6" from broiler unit). Toast can burn quickly, so keep a watchful eye on this process.
Meanwhile pan fry or grill (prepared with Pan spray) the al fresco Roasted Pepper & Asiago Chicken Sausages over medium high heat until nicely browned. Slice each link on the diagonal into 8 pieces.
Top each toast with a slice of the chicken sausage, followed with a spoonful of bruschetta, and garnish with fresh oregano and a small shaving of Asiago Cheese.
Serve immediately.
