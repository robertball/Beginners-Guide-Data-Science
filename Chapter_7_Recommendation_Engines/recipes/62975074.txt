Ingredients:
1/2 a 9x13 pan of left over corn bread
1 pound sage pork sausage
2 onions, chopped
2 apples, cored and chopped
2 stalks celery, diced
1 carrot diced
1 sweet potato chopped

Directions:
Bake cornbread according to package directions. Cool and crumble into a large bowl.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook sausage until brown and crumbly, remove from the skillet but keep the oil in the pan. Add veggies; cook stirring occasionally until tender, about 5 minutes.
Toss the cooked mixture and the sausage into the bowl with the crumbled cornbread. Stir in the chicken broth. Season with thyme, rosemary, and pepper. Blend well and press into a 9x13 inch baking dish.
