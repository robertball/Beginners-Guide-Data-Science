Description: 
There aren't many recipes using fresh pears. I heard this recipe on the radio while I was driving the tractor in the field. I kept repeating the ingredients over and over until it was time to go in the house for lunch, then I wrote the recipe down on paper. We've enjoyed it every summer since.
