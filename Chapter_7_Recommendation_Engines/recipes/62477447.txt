2 tblsp Minced garlic
1 lb    Beet greens

Wash beet greens, cutting off any long stems.  Cut or shred greens to bite-size.  Heat olive oil over medium heat; add onion, stirring until beginning to turn clear.  Add garlic and stir for about one minute.  Add beet greens, stirring to mix and coat, until wilted.  Add one heaping teaspoon of capers, and three heaping teaspoons of sun dried tomato topping (I include the oil from both capers and tomatoes for added flavors).  Continue stirring for about a minute.  Turn off heat; add cracked pepper and sea salt to taste.
