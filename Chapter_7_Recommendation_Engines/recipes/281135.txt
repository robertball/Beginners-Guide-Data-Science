Description: 
Just so everybody's clear, we are not making deviled eggs and then turning them into a noodle salad. We are actually making a salad with the same flavors, using egg noodles. Because we use so many ingredients that typically are used for deviled eggs, this salad really did have a similar flavor profile, and tastes amazing. Garnish the salad with freshly chopped chives and green onions.
