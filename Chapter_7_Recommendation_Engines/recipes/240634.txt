Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup frozen bell pepper and onion mix
2 cups chopped cooked chicken
1 bunch kale, chopped
1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 pinch salt to taste
4 bell peppers, tops and seeds removed
1 tablespoon coconut oil (optional)
2 slices Havarti cheese, cut into halves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Heat oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Saute pepper and onion mix in hot oil until the onions are translucent, 7 to 10 minutes.
Mix sauteed pepper and onion mix, chicken, kale, goat cheese, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and salt together in a bowl; spoon into bell peppers to overflowing. Arrange stuffed peppers in a casserole dish. Brush coconut oil on outside of peppers, if desired.
Bake peppers in preheated oven until soft, 30 to 40 minutes. Top each pepper with a half-slice of cheese and continue cooking until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
