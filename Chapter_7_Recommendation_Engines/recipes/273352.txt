Ingredients:
8 frozen breaded fish fillets
1 cup light sour cream
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro
1 lime, juiced
8 flour tortillas
1 cup salsa
8 large Romaine lettuce leaves, shredded

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place fish fillets in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, flipping halfway, until fish fillets are crispy and browned, 22 to 24 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix sour cream, cilantro, and lime juice together in a bowl.
Cut baked fillets in 1/2 lengthwise. Place halves end-to-end on tortillas, 1 whole fillet per tortilla. Spoon 1 rounded tablespoon each of sour cream mixture and salsa onto taco and top evenly with lettuce.
