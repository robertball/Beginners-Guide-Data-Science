Description: 
I got this recipe from an aunt of mine and it's a family favorite! We were always asked to make this for church luncheons back home. (
I used to be able to buy a can of veggie burger that was used like minced hamburger meat. I think the brand name was Loma Linda; but any veggie meat will do.
