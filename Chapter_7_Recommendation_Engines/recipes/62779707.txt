Ingredients:
2 1/2 tablespoons corn flour
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon beef bouillon granules
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper
1 1/2 pounds lean ground chuck
1 cup water

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the corn flour, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and seasoned salt. Stir in the paprika, cumin, garlic salt. Blend in the bouillon and ground red pepper, stirring until all spices are well blended.
Crumble the ground chuck into a large skillet with 1 cup water over medium-high to high heat. Cook, stirring, until browned and water has evaporated. Pour in seasoning. Stir in water. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until most of the liquid has cooked away, about 20 minutes.
