Ingredients:
1 (11 ounce) package milk chocolate chips
1/2 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella速)
8 cups bite-size corn square cereal (such as Corn Chex速)
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Heat chocolate chips and chocolate-hazelnut spread together in a large pot over low heat until melted, about 5 minutes. Add 1/2 of the cereal to the chocolate mixture and stir until coated. Transfer the coated cereal to a large resealable bag and add 1/2 of the confectioners' sugar; seal bag and shake until cereal is coated. Transfer puppy chow to an airtight container. Repeat with remaining chocolate mixture, cereal, and confectioners' sugar.
