Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (14 ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cubed
1 (16 ounce) package frozen broccoli, carrots and cauliflower
¼ cup oyster sauce
6 cloves garlic, crushed or to taste
⅓ cup chicken broth

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add tofu, garlic, and about half of the oyster sauce. Cook for about 5 minutes, until garlic is lightly browned but not burning. Remove from the skillet to a bowl, and set aside.
Add the frozen vegetables to the same skillet and cook vegetables according to package directions, substituting chicken broth for the water, and seasoning with the remaining oyster sauce. When vegetables are cooked, mix the tofu garlic mixture back into the pan, and heat through. Serve plain or over rice.

Description: 
Amazingly fast and tasty recipe, very healthy too. Even the husband (not normally a huge tofu fan) enjoys it. I love it with tons of garlic but you can use less if you must. The oyster sauce I don't measure so it's approximate. It's pretty salty so use it to your taste. You could serve it with cooked white rice, but it's just as good plain.
