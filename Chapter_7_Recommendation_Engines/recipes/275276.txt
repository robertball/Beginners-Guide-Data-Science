Ingredients:
3 cups ricotta cheese
4 green onions, sliced diagonally
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 store-bought thin pizza crust
5 slices cooked bacon, crumbled, or more to taste
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 bunch fresh arugula
1 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix ricotta cheese, green onions, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Spread over pizza crust.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Place pizza crust with ricotta mixture in the skillet; add bacon and Parmesan cheese and cook the bottom of the pizza, 3 to 4 minutes.
Leave pizza in the skillet and place in the preheated oven to bake until top of pizza begins to brown slightly, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove pizza from the oven carefully, top with salt and pepper, arugula, and a drizzle of lemon juice, in that order. Serve warm.
