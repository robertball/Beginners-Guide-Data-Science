Ingredients:
2 1/2 lb russet potatoes, washed and peeled
1 1/2 tsp seasoned salt
1 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp black pepper
3 oz grated cheddar cheese
3 oz grated fontina cheese
1/2 C flour
4 large eggs, whisked
2 C panko breadcrumbs
Vegetable oil for frying
Table salt to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil.  Add whole potatoes to water and allow to boil until just softening and not mushy, about 15-20 minutes.
Use a food processor grater to shred potatoes and allow to cool.  Work seasoned salt, garlic powder, black pepper, cheddar cheese, and fontina cheese into shredded potatoes until well combined.  Shape 2 Tbsp potato mixture into thick disc shapes.
Place flour in one bowl, eggs in a second bowl, and panko in another bowl.  Roll shaped tots in flour, coat with egg, and coat with panko.
Heat 2" oil in heavy-bottomed pan to 350 degrees F.  Fry each tot until crispy and golden, about 4 minutes.  Allow to cool on paper towel-lined tray before serving.

These aren't your average tots!  Loaded with cheese they're yummy on their own or dipped in your favorite sauce.  They freeze well for later use as well!
