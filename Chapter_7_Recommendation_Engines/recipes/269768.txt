Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter, or more to taste
1/3 cup diced onion
1/3 cup diced celery
1/3 cup diced carrot
4 cups chicken broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with Italian herbs
1/3 cup white wine
1/3 cup lemon juice
1 pound tilapia fillets, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a 5- to 6-quart pot over medium heat. Add onion, celery, and carrot; saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, tomatoes, wine, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil. Add tilapia, herbs, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat, cover pot partially, and simmer until tilapia starts to flake, about 10 minutes.
Transfer tilapia to a plate and cover to keep warm. Simmer cooking liquid until slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Return tilapia to the pot and heat through, 1 to 2 minutes.

Description: 
Hearty and delicious soup. You can poach cod, haddock, flounder, and salmon. I love to serve this on a cold winter day. For a stew-like consistency, simmer for longer. You can serve the stew over rice if desired.
