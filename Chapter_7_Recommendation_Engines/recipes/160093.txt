Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1/4 cup ground almonds
1/2 cup softened butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 eggs
1/3 cup flaked coconut, toasted (optional)
2 tablespoons lemon zest
1/4 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place 1 1/3 cups flour, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 tablespoon lemon zest, and the ground almonds in a mixing bowl. Add the softened butter and mix with your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press into the bottom of a 9-inch square baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.
While the crust is baking, stir together the brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, and the baking powder in a bowl. Add the eggs, coconut, lemon zest, and lemon juice; whisk until the sugars have dissolved; pour over the crust.
Return to the oven and bake until the lemon filling has firmed, about 15 minutes. Cool completely in the pan before cutting.
