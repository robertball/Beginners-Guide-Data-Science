Ingredients:
18 shrimp, shelled and deveined
8 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (colaviata or or your choice)
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup butter
1 1/2 cups parmesan cheese
salt & pepper
1/2 lb asparagus spear, fresh stemmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup Tomato, chopped
1/2 cup yellow onion
1 clove of garlic
2 cups arborio rice
fresh parsley, chopped

Directions:
SIMMER: chicken broth on low heat until needed.
HEAT: oil over medium heat.
Add onions and garlic cook for 3 minutes, or until translucent.
Stir in rice and cook for 1 minute, then add white wine.
Add ½ of broth and stir until completely absorbed.
Repeat until 4 cups of broth have been added.
Stir the risotto frequently to prevent sticking.
ADD: asparagus and shrimp to the remaining broth and cook for about 2 minutes, or until shrimp is pink.
Remove asparagus and shrimp from the broth and then add them to the risotto mixture.
Add ½ cup of the broth at a time until desired creaminess is reached (there may be broth left over).
Once the broth is absorbed, add butter, parmesan cheese and salt and pepper to taste.
Garnish with chopped tomatoes and parsley.
