Ingredients:
4 slices toast
2 pounds ground turkey
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed vegetable soup
2 eggs
1 (1 ounce) envelope onion soup mix
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Roll toast with a rolling pin until crumbled; place in a large bowl. Add turkey, condensed soup, eggs, soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Mix with your hands until well combined. Transfer mixture to a loaf pan and top with ketchup.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatloaf is cooked through and no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
This is our favorite meatloaf recipe. I love this recipe because I can always keep the ingredients in my pantry for an emergency meal. I use ground turkey but you can use any ground meat you like. Also, if you don't have onion soup mix, add 1 medium onion instead. If you want you can use store-bought bread crumbs in place of the toast slices.
