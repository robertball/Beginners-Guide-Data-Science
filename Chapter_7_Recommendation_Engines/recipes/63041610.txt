Ingredients:
1 package Yellow Cake Mix
2 eggs
1 can diet lemon lime soda (like 7Up or Sprite Zero)
4 C. cold skim milk
2 small packs of fat free sugar free instant chocolate pudding mix (4-serving size)
1 small tub of fat free cool whip

Directions:
Prepare cake mix as instructed on box, using 2 eggs and can of soda (instead of water, oil, and eggs). Pour into a greased and floured 9 1/2 x 13 inch cake pan.
Bake at 350 for about 20 minutes.
Remove from oven and poke holes down through the cake with the handle of a wooden spoon in 1-inch intervals.
Pour milk into a large bowl. Add pudding mixes and beat with a wire whisk for 2 minutes.
Carefully pour about 1/2 the pudding onto the cake to fill the holes (I used a measuring cup to help fill the holes evenly.)
Let the remaining pudding stand for about 10 minutes until further thickened.
Spread the remaining pudding onto the cake, like frosting.
Refrigerate for about 90 minutes.
Frost with a tub of fat free cool whip and it's ready to serve!
