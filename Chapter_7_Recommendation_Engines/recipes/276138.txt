Ingredients:
2/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/3 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup apple cider
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Frosting:
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
4 tablespoons butter, softened
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Mix together brown sugar, melted butter, and white sugar in a stand mixer until thoroughly combined. Add eggs and mix well. Add flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt; mix until combined. Add apple cider and vanilla extract and beat on high speed for 2 minutes. Divide batter evenly into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.
While cupcakes are cooling, combine cream cheese and softened butter in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat until blended. Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract; beat until frosting is creamy. Top cooled cupcakes with frosting.
