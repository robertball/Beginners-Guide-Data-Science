Ingredients:
4 egg whites
2 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
1 dash all-purpose flour, or as needed
5 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer on low speed until foamy. Add sugar slowly, continuing to beat until meringue is smooth, shiny, and satiny, about 10 minutes. Let stand while coating 2 baking sheets with butter and flour.
Add cocoa powder to egg white mixture slowly, 1/2 tablespoon at a time. Beat on medium power until very smooth and evenly colored.
Drop by spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until each cookie comes off the baking sheet cleanly, 1 to 2 hours.
