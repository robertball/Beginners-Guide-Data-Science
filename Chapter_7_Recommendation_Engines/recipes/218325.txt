Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 cups chopped cooked turkey
1 (15 ounce) can refried beans
1 (29 ounce) can pure pumpkin puree
1/4 cup taco seasoning mix
1 (29 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, or more to taste
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
8 (10 inch) whole wheat tortillas
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Mix the cooked turkey, refried beans, pumpkin puree, and taco seasoning in a bowl. Pour tomato sauce into a blender, and add chipotle pepper and chicken bouillon granules; blend until smooth, about 30 seconds.
Lay a tortilla out onto a work surface, and generously spoon turkey filling in a line down the middle of the tortilla. Fold a top and bottom flap of the tortilla towards the middle, and fold the sides inward to enclose the filling. Lay the enchilada, seam side down, into the baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Pour the sauce over the filled tortillas, and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted and the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.
