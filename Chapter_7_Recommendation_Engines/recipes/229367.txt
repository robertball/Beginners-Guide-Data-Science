Ingredients:
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1 teaspoon dried savory
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon crushed dried rosemary
1 (3 pound) boneless beef chuck eye roast
1 cup sour cream
3 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Mix bread crumbs, olive oil, garlic, ground mustard, savory, black pepper, and rosemary in a bowl; spread mixture over beef chuck roast. Transfer roast to a shallow roasting pan.
Bake in preheated oven until beef begins to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Allow roast to rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
Stir sour cream, horseradish, lemon juice, and salt in another bowl. Serve with sliced beef.
