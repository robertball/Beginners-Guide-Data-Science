Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
4 (1-inch thick) pork chops
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 medium onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup Australian Shiraz wine
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup milk
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage

Directions:
Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown pork chops in the hot butter, sprinkling both sides with salt and pepper, about 5 minutes per side. Remove meat to a plate and set aside.
Cook onion and garlic in the pan drippings over medium-high heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in wine, reduce heat, and let simmer until alcohol smell is completely cooked off, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in soup and milk, blending well. Layer mushrooms on top of soup mixture, add chops on top of mushrooms, and pour meat drippings from the plate over the chops. Sprinkle with thyme and sage.
Cover tightly and let simmer until chops are tender and no longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
