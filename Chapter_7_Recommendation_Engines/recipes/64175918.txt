Ingredients:
1 pound whole-grain fettuccine
2 large shallots, peeled and minced
4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp rosemary
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pound crimini mushrooms, stemmed and cut into large pieces
1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, soaked in 1 cup boiling water for 30 minutes
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 package extra firm lite silken tofu, drained
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
Chopped parsley

Directions:
Get a pot of water on for cooking the pasta and cook the pasta according to the directions.
Place the shallots in a large skillet and saut√© over a medium heat for 8 minutes. Add water 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time to keep them from sticking.
Add the garlic and seasoning, and cook for another minute. If using beans, carrots add here.
Stir in the pepper and crimini mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Remove the the porcini mushrooms from the soaking liquid and chop coarsely. Add the mushrooms and their liquid, and the wine. Stir, and cook over medium-low heat for 10 to 20 minutes.
While the mushrooms are cooking, blend the tofu, lemon juice and red wine vinegar to combine. When the mushrooms are finished cooking, stir in 1 cup of the tofu mixture.
Add the cooked noodles and toss well. Serve garnished with the parsley.
