1 cup canola oil
1 cup all purpose flour
1 tsp onion powder

1 tsp salt
1 tsp pepper

Directions:
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.
In a large plastic storage bag, mix flour, onion and garlic powder, paprika, and salt and pepper.
Put medallions in bag and shake to coat medallions fully.
When oil is hot, place medallions in skillet and cook until 5-7 minutes, or until blood rises to the surface of each medallion, then turn.
