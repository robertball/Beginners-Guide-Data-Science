Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
1 cup warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
2 tablespoons ground mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
6 cups all-purpose flour
TOPPING:
3/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
1/2 cup dried minced onion
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 teaspoons celery seed
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 10 minutes. Add mustard and salt; beat until smooth. Add milk and enough flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down and divide into fourths. Divide each portion into eight balls; place eight balls each in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. For topping, combine water and onion; let stand for 5 minutes. Add cheese and celery seed. Sprinkle half over dough in pans. Top with remaining dough balls and topping. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Brush tops with egg. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool in pans for 10 minutes; remove from pan to wire rack to cool completely.
