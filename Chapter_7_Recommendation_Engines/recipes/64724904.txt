Ingredients:
1 bunch green grapes
4 large kiwis, peeled and sliced
1/2 fresh pineapple, peeled and sliced
1/2 cup pomegranate seeds
4 strawberries, sliced, and tops removed
about 6 dried dates

Directions:
1. On a large cutting board or serving platter, use the grapes to created an outline of a tree shape. Begin at the top point of the tree, and fan the grapes out into a triangular pattern. Create three triangular sections, each slightly larger than the last, using the grapes. Fill in each section with the kiwi slices.
2. Arrange sliced strawberries across the tree to create a garland effect. Add pomegranate seeds randomly all over the kiwis, grapes, and strawberries to look like ornaments.
3. On a small cutting board, place pineapple slices. Use small cookie cutters to cut out a star, and some several small "ornaments." Place star at the top of the tree and decorate the rest of the tree with the pineapple ornaments.
4. Arrange the dates at the bottom of the tree to act as the trunk. Serve immediately, or keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
Note: Do not prepare too far in advance of your party or the fruit will dry out. You can mix up any leftover or scrap fruit to make a beautiful salad to serve alongside this Christmas Tree Fruit Platter.
