Ingredients:
cooking spray (such as PamÂ®)
1/3 head cauliflower
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 cup coarsely chopped red onion
1 green bell pepper, coarsely chopped
3 mushrooms, diced
2 tablespoons butter
6 slices cooked bacon, finely chopped, divided (optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 eggs
1/2 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups grated Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch glass pie pan with cooking spray.
Grate cauliflower coarsely with a box grater. Measure out 1 1/2 cup of cauliflower "rice"; press into the bottom and sides of the pan to make a crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust looks dry, about 15 minutes.
Melt coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper; cook and stir until softened, about 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and butter; cook and stir until mushrooms are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in 3 slices bacon. Season with salt and pepper.
Whisk eggs in a bowl until blended. Whisk in sour cream until smooth. Stir in onion mixture and 1 cup Cheddar cheese.
Sprinkle 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese over the cauliflower crust. Spread egg mixture evenly over the cheese. Top with remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese. Sprinkle remaining 3 slices bacon on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand until set, 5 to 10 minutes.
