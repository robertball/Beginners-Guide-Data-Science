Description: 
I love these cookies but I really wanted to try to make them a little lighter. I actually used sweet potato puree for some of the butter and juice squeezed from an orange for some of the sugar and they still taste great. It sounds a little odd but try it!!Modified from: Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
