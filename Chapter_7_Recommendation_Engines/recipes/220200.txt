Ingredients:
1 egg
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons dried herbes de Provence
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper
1 pound skinless, boneless halibut fillets
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Whisk egg in a small bowl.
Combine flour, herbes de Provence, seafood seasoning, salt, and black pepper in a separate small bowl.
Cut halibut into 4 equal pieces.
Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-low heat.
Dip each piece of halibut in whisked egg.
Dredge all sides of each piece in flour mixture to evenly coat; tap off excess flour.
Place coated pieces immediately in the hot olive oil.
Cook the halibut until lightly browned, about 5 minutes; turn and cook until fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, another 2 minutes.
