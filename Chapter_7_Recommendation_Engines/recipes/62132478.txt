Ingredients:
1/2 cup of water
l head of green cabbage
1 cup 5 min rice
1 lb of ground beef
2 tbsp of milk
1 tsp garlic powder
1 large can of tomatoe juice

Directions:
Put the water in the bottom of the pressure cooker, line the bottom of the pressure cooker with loose leaves of cabbage to prevent your rolls from sticking to the bottom.
Peel leaves off the head of cabbage, par-boiling the whole head in wather for 5 mins helps with step.
Put the ground beef in a large bowl with the milk and garlic powder and work through with your hands.
On a plate place the cup of uncooked rice.
Form balls with the meat mixture and roll in the uncooked rice. Once all the balls are formed place 2 or 3 in a cabbage leaf and roll up and secure with tooth picks.
Arrange them in your pressure cooker pot. Once full put on stove high heat until the pressure release is making noise and time for 12 mins and turn heat down to medium heat.
Release the pressure how ever your pressure cooker instructions require you do so, mine I put under cold water in the sink then open. Add the can of tomatoe juice and put on medium heat for 5 mins until begins to boil. And they're ready to serve.
