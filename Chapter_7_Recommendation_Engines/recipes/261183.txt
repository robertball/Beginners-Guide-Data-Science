Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups almond butter
2 eggs
1/2 cup low-calorie natural sweetener (such as SwerveÂ®)
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted
1 teaspoon sugar-free vanilla extract
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine almond butter, eggs, sweetener, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, and salt in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until a dough forms.
Roll dough into 1-inch balls. Place on the prepared baking sheet and press down twice with a fork in a criss-cross pattern.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm, about 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
