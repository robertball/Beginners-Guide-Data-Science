Description: 
Don't be afraid of curry! This isn't a spicy dish. This is a super yummy dish that anyone will love, whether they are gluten-free or not! Lovely served over jasmine rice. Garnish with lime, cilantro, basil, chives/scallions, and toasted cashews or peanuts. Absolutely do not skip the garnish; it makes the meal! You can make this spicy or mild, depending on your taste.
