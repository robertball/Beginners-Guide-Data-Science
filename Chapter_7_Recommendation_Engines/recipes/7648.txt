Description: 
This cake is delicious, my grandmother gave me this recipe two years ago. She brought it to my house to give to my family when my baby sister was born. I remember that I had six pieces of it while my mother and grandmother were talking! It was gone by the next day, and guess who ate the last few pieces... that is right , yours truly!  It is a lot like a sweet brownie.
