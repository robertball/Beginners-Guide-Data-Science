Ingredients:
3 large eggs

Directions:
Place eggs in medium saucepan, cover with 1 inch of water, and bring to a boil over heat.  Remove pan from heat, cover, and let sit for 10 minutes (and no more than 13 minutes).  Meanwhile, fill medium bowl with 1 quart of water and 2 cups ice cubes.
Transfer eggs to ice bath with slotted spoon and let sit 5 minutes.  Tap each egg all over against countertop to crack shell, then roll egg gently back and forth several times.  Begin peeling from wider end.  The shell should come off in spiral strips attached to thin membrane. (You can also peel them under cool running water.)
Hard-boiled eggs can be refrigerated for several days.
