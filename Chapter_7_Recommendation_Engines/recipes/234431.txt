Ingredients:
8 cups peanut oil for frying
1 (16 ounce) can artichoke hearts in water, drained
1 (16 ounce) package bacon slices, cut into thirds crosswise
20 toothpicks

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Wrap each artichoke heart with a piece of bacon. Secure by threading a toothpick through the end of the bacon.
Fry bacon-wrapped artichoke hearts in the hot oil until bacon is browned and crispy, 7 to 9 minutes; drain on a paper towel-lined plate for about 5 minutes before serving.
