Ingredients:
2 28 oz cans imported plum tomatoes with basil (preferably those labeled "San Marzano")
1/4 cup fine quality olive oil
2 oz fatback or salt pork (optional)
3 tablespoons minced onion
2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
salt to taste
6 leaves fresh basil, torn
pinch dried oregano
pepper to taste

Directions:
Remove tomatoes from can, reserving the juice in which they are packed.  Using your hands, crush the tomatoes, gently remove and discard the hard core from the stem end, and remove and discard any skin and tough membrane.  Set aside.
Put oil in large, nonreactive saucepan over medium-low heat.  If using fatback, cut it into small pieces and add to the pan.  Saute for about 5 minutes or until all fat has been rendered.  Remove and discard fatback.
Then add onion. Saute for 3 minutes or until translucent and just begining to brown.  Stir in garlic and saute for 30 seconds or until just softened.  Stir in tomatoes, reserved juice, and salt.  Raise heat, and bring to a boil.  Immediately reduce heat to a low simmer and cook for about 1 hour or until flavors have combined and sauce is slightly thickened.  If you prefer a thick sauce, cook 15 minutes more.
Stir in basil, oregano, pepper and cook for an additional minute.  Remove from heat and serve.
