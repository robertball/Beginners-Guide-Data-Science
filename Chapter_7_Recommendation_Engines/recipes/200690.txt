Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 dash salt
1 dash ground cinnamon
1 dash curry powder
1 dash onion powder
1 dash garlic powder
1 dash ground black pepper
1/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 matzo sheets

Directions:
Beat eggs in a bowl with a wire whisk. Add salt, cinnamon, curry powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper. Mix in milk and oil.
Rinse matzo under running water until softened, breaking into pieces less than 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Drain and add to the egg mixture; stir carefully to coat.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the matzo-egg mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until eggs are firm and slightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
Matzo scrambled into eggs, also known as fried matzo. Delicious when made with the right seasonings, and 100% kosher for Passover! This is the first recipe I learned to cook on my own. Enjoy!
