1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
4 teaspoons ground cinnamon

1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
3/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Whisk pumpkin, evaporated milk, sugar, eggs, and cinnamon together in a bowl until smooth; pour into prepared baking pan. Sprinkle cake mix and pecans over pumpkin mixture; top with melted butter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the dessert comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool for 30 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
I came across this recipe in a grocery store flyer just before Canadian Thanksgiving. I am not a pumpkin pie fan although the rest of the family is. I should say they were. The dessert is all gone but half of a pumpkin pie remains.  This will be a new tradition at our Thanksgiving table. Serve with whipped cream.
