Description: 
To come up with this dish, I used a number of different recipes plus some ideas of my own. It's great for potluck because it's made the night before and contains no mayo. Another great thing is the longer it sits, the flavor keeps getting better. Whenever I serve it, I'm inundated with recipe requests.
