In a medium bowl, mix the butter, molasses and egg substitute with an electric mixer until smooth. In a separate bowl, stir together the Kamut flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon and cloves. Stir the dry ingredients into the molasses mixture alternating with the water, beginning and ending with the flour, stir just until blended.
Preheat the waffle iron, and coat with cooking spray. Spoon the desired amount  of batter onto the hot iron, and cook until steam stops coming out, and waffles don't stick to the iron. Continue with remaining batter.
