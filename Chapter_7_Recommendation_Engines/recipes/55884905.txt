Description: 
It's a tradition in our family to have Manhattan clam chowder on 4th of July and New England clam chowder on Christmas Eve. My mom would always make it from scratch, but I never have time to chop veggies and fry bacon, so I make this cheater version. I used to always use frozen veggies, but now most stores have pre-chopped veggies in the produce section.
