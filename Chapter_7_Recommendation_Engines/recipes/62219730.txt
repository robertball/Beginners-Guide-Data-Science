Ingredients:
1 15oz pkg Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts (2 crusts)
1 8oz can almond paste (Solo)
3 t. cinnamon
1/4 c. sugar
1/2 c. English toffee bits (such as Skor)
1 egg, slightly beaten with 1 T. water

Directions:
Remove pie crusts sleeves from box and let sit on counter for 10-15 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Have 2 cookie sheets ready, lined with parchment paper.
In a small bowl, combine the cinnamon & sugar; set aside.
Spoon the almond paste into a microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave on high for about 10-15 seconds.  Stir; add 1-2 T. of water and stir again.  If paste is still too thick, microwave again for 10 seconds.  Stir well and make sure the paste is spreadable.  The mixture should resemble thick mashed potatoes.
On a lightly floured board, unroll one of the pie crusts and roll lightly to even out the dough.
Spread about half of the almond paste to within 1/2 inch of the edge; sprinkle with cinnamom sugar, then half of the toffee bits.
Cut the dough into 16 wedges with a pizza cutter.
Roll up each wedge, starting at the wide end.  Place cookie, point underneath, on parchment lined cookie sheet.  Brush each cookie with egg wash and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar mixture.  Repeat above steps with the other roll of pie crust dough
Bake at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Remove cookies onto a cooling rack to cook completely.
