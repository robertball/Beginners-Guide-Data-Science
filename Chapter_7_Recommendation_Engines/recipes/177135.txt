Ingredients:
1/4 cup condensed bean with bacon soup
1 (8 inch) flour tortilla
1 turkey hot dog
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Pour soup into a small microwave safe bowl.  Wrap tortilla and hot dog with a clean, lightly moist cloth. Place soup, tortilla, and hot dog in microwave and cook on high approximately 30 seconds, or until tortilla is hot and pliable and the soup is hot.
Place hot dog and soup in center of tortilla; sprinkle with cheese and roll.  Microwave for an additional 10 seconds to fully melt the cheese.

Description: 
This treat was born out of ready-to-be-used leftovers and my desire to create something new and fun for our 6-year-old to have for lunch.  This is now one of his favorites (Grampa's too!).
