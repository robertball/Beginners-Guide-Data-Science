Ingredients:
1 10-inch loaf sourdough bread, unsliced
Butter, softened
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup shredded fresh parmesan cheese
2-3 tblsp. finely chopped onion
1-2 tblsp. finely chopped garlic
1 tblsp. dried basil
1 tsp. dried oregano
1 tblsp. dried parsley flakes
1 tsp. Cajun seasoning

Directions:
Slice loaf in half horizontally. Butter cut sides of both halves, and toast under broiler until lightly browned.
Mix the remaining ingredients and spread over both halves, using the entire mixture. Bake at 400 for 15-20 minutes or until top is browned and puffed. Cut into wedges and serve hot.
NOTE: If using fresh herbs, triple the amount. Also, if using canned parmesan cheese, you may want to use less, as it will make this very salty.

Description: 
This is a very flavorful, very easy appetizer bread to make! Amounts and types of herbs can be adjusted to suit your taste. Also, I have made this using a variety of breads, depending on what I can find at the grocery store or bakery.
