Ingredients:
1 package raisins (15 ounces)
8 ounces dried cherries
8 ounces dried cranberries
1/2 cup molasses (Grandmas yellow label)
1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon vanilla
2/3 cup sugar
3 eggs
1 cup all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 cup milk
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In saucepan, combine molasses, water and vanilla; add raisins and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in fruit. Allow fruit to cool.
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir together dry ingredients, add to creamed mixture alternately with milk. Stir in fruit mixture; mix well.  Fold in nuts. Spoon into paper-lined (spray the liners lightly with butter-flavored cooking spray) miniature muffin tins filling almost to the top.  Bake at 325 degrees for 22-24 minutes or until cakes test done. Cool on wire racks. Store in airtight containers for at least several hours before serving.
