Ingredients:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup canola oil
3/4 cup applesauce
1/2 ripe banana, mashed
1 Golden Delicious apple, diced
1 cup grated zucchini
1 cup grated carrots

1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup ground flax seeds
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup chopped walnuts, or to taste

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
Mix brown sugar and oil together in a bowl. Stir in applesauce and mashed banana. Mix in apple, zucchini, and carrots.
Combine whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, flax seeds, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in another bowl. Fold flour mixture into the sugar mixture. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups; sprinkle chopped walnuts on top.
