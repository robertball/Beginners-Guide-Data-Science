Ingredients:
2 Doz Hard Boiled Eggs
2 bunches Cilantro
Cinnamon
onion juice

Directions:
Stuffed Eggs. Cook eggs, remove the shells and cut them in half. Remove the yolks, put together in a platter and throw on them cilantro, onion juice, spices and cinnamon; and it will become a paste with which you will stuff the eggs. Tie them with thread and hold them with a small stick. Dissolve some egg white and grease them with it along with a little saffron, and dust with fine flour and fry with fresh oil on an even fire, and when finished, sprinkle with chopped rue (celery leaves substitute) and serve. Make a sauce with the filling and sprinkle with spikenard and cinnamon, God willing.
