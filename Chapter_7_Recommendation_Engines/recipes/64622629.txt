Ingredients:
1.5 lbs. Hormel Pork Tenderloin, unseasoned
1 Tbsp. cooking oil
3 Tbsp. Balsamic Vinegar
1.5 Tbsp Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard
1 tsp. Christopher Ranch Chopped Garlic
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. coarse ground pepper
1/2 tsp. ground thyme
For saute pan:
1 Tbsp cooking oil

Directions:
Open Pork Tenderloin, rinse and pat dry.  Place in 1 gallon zip-loc bag.
Mix all marinade ingredients in small cup or bowl.  Add to bag.  Shake or squeeze well to get the tenderloin completely coated with the marinade.  Return to refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, preferably 2 hours (can even be done overnight).
Preheat oven to 350F.
While oven is heating, place remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in an oven proof deep skillet.  Heat skillet to medium-high.  Transfer tenderloin to hot skillet, reserving the marinade. Sear the tenderloin well on all sides.  Leave in skillet (or transfer to foil lined baking sheet) and bake 30-40 minutes.  Check at 30 minutes, and for best results don't overcook.  Use an instant read thermometer, and remove roast from oven when it reaches 145F.  (It is no longer necessary to cook pork until well done.  Today's pork is safe from parasites, and can be cooked to medium, so a little pink in the middle is not only okay, but it helps keep your tenderloin from drying out by cooking it too long.)
Move roast to cutting board, and allow to rest at least 5 minutes (10 is better) before slicing to serve.  This helps retain the juices so they don't all run out while the roast is fresh from the oven.
While roast is resting, pour the remaining marinade into the skillet you used to sear the tenderloin.  Bring to boil and stir constantly until the marinade reduces and thickens.  Drizzle marinade over sliced tenderloin and serve.
