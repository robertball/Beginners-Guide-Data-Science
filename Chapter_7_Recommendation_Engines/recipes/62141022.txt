Ingredients:
4 large Russet Potatoes
1 clove of garlic minced
2 tablespoons of ranch dressing powder
2 tablespoons butter- room temperature
half and half
1 pinch sea salt(optional)

Directions:
1. Peel and cube the potatoes.
2. Place in a medium pot and cover with water add sea salt  if desired.
3. Place on medium heat and bring to a boil. Potatoes are done when a fork inserted into the largest chunk is easily penetrated.
4. In a medium mixing bowl place butter and minced garlic.
5. Drain potatoes.
6. Add potatoes to butter and garlic and mix on low speed.
7. While mixing add Ranch Dressing powder.
8. Stop mixer and and 1/4 cup Half and Half.  Mix on highest setting.  Continue to add Half and Half until desired consistancy is attained.
(You should plan to serve the Ranch Garlic Mashed Potatoes immediately after mixing.  Leaving the potatoes on the stove in the hot water until you are ready to whip will not alter the potatoes' taste.)
