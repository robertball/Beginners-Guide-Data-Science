Ingredients:
2 bunches kale
1 Tbsp wasabi paste
3 tsp mayonnaise
4 quail eggs
1/4 cup breadcrumbs
1/8 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp turmeric
2 tsp dinosaur magic
3 tsp olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a pot of water to boil and soft-boil the quail eggs (takes about 5 minutes). Remove from water with slotted spoon and toss in a bowl with the breadcrumbs, salt and pepper.
In a separate bowl, shred the kale into small pieces. Then shred these shreds into even smaller pieces. Once you have a bowl full of loose kale molecules, stir in the wasabi paste, mayonnaise, turmeric and sugar. Summon Dinomite to your kitchen (if you are worthy you will know how) and make the necessary sacrifice to earn 2 teaspoons of its dinosaur magic. Sprinkle the magic carefully into your kale mixture while slowly chanting "All hail Misha" and hopping on one foot.
Fry the egg balls in a saucepan of olive oil on low heat until crispy and brown (about 5 minutes). Serve with a spoonful of kale sauce evenly spread across the balls. Bask in the majesty of your creation.
