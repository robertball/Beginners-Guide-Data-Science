Description: 
The Lemon Drop is without a doubt my favorite cocktail and my go-to drink on hot summer days. This is just a slight variation that I was inspired to create because my kids were picking raspberries from our bushes and throwing them in their lemonade. Tart & sweet, this cocktail is a winner.
