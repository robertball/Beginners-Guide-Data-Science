Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil or butter
1 large clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup chicken broth or stock

1/3 cup thickly sliced Lindsay速 Manzanilla Stuffed Olives or Lindsay速 Black Ripe Pitted Olives (or a combination)
2 tablespoons chopped Italian or curly parsley

Directions:
Cut pork crosswise into 1-inch thick slices. Place slices between sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap; pound (or use the heel of your hand) to flatten into 1/2-inch thick medallions. Sprinkle thyme, salt and pepper over medallions.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add medallions; cook 4 minutes per side or until no longer pink in center. Transfer to a serving plate; keep warm. Add garlic to drippings in skillet; cook and stir 30 seconds. Add broth and lemon juice; boil gently over medium-high heat 3 minutes or until reduced by half. Stir in olives; heat through. Spoon sauce over medallions; top with parsley.
