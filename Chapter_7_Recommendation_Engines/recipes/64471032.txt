3 cups broccoli florets
1/2 rasher of bacon (saving the cooking fat for the croutons)
1/2 cup goji berries
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
1/4 cup grated cheddar
dressing:
1/2 cup Greek yogurt
1/4 cup Hellman's mayonnaise
2 tablespoons palm sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a salad bowl, stir all ingredients. Then toss with dressing, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 hours to overnight.
dressing: In a measuring cup, mix together yogurt, mayonnaise, palm sugar, and lemon juice.
Cut or tear old bread into bitsized pieces, coat/toss in the warm bacon grease (add olive oil or melted butter if too little grease). Bake in 200 centigrade (400F) oven until crisp - save for tossing with Salad at last moment before serving.

Description: 
I am trying to remember how my mom used to make this bacon broccoli salad.  the bacon grease was used in the dressing but I cant remember how that worked with the refrigeration period.  My mom's recipe had Kraft parmesan cheese as the only cheese ..... I am going to try it this way and probably still keep looking for my mom's version.Modified from: Broccoli Buffet Salad
