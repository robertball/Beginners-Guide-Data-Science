Ingredients:
1 (5 ounce) can albacore tuna in water, drained and flaked
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon basil pesto sauce
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 (10 inch) flour tortilla
4 leaves lettuce
1 slice provolone cheese
5 pitted kalamata olives, cut in half

Directions:
Lightly stir together the tuna, mayonnaise, pesto, lemon juice, and pepper in a bowl until well combined.
Microwave the tortilla on High until warmed and pliable, 5 to 10 seconds.
Spread the tuna mixture on the tortilla, and top with the lettuce leaves, provolone cheese, and kalamata olives. Fold the bottom of the tortilla up about 2 inches to enclose the filling, and roll the tortilla tightly into a compact wrap.
