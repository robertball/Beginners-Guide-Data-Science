Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups water
2 cups white sugar
5 tablespoons cornstarch
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-O速)
2 pints strawberries, sliced
1 1/2 (8 ounce) containers fat-free whipped topping (such as Cool Whip速), or more to taste
1 (16 ounce) prepared pound cake (such as Sara Lee速), cut into cubes

Directions:
Combine water, sugar, and cornstarch together in a saucepan; cook, stirring constantly, over medium-high heat until mixture is boiling and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from stove and stir gelatin mix into sugar mixture until dissolved. Set strawberry glaze aside to cool.
Layer half the strawberries in the bottom of a trifle or glass bowl. Drizzle half the strawberry glaze over strawberry layer until evenly coated. Spread half the whipped topping over strawberry layer; top with pound cake. Layer the remaining strawberries, strawberry glaze, and whipped topping, respectively, over pound cake.
