Description: 
Marrying mango and basil was the goal of this dish.  I think you'll enjoy how every ingredient keeps its own distinct flavor, and yet this is a nice blend of the flavors together.  Enjoy this dish on top of a bed of rice or pasta, or mix your your pasta and rice into the skillet at the very end to blend it all together.
