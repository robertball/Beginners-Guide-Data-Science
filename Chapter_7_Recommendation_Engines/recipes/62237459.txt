Ingredients:
1 head fresh broccoli
1 head fresh cauliflower
1 medium to large vidalia onion
1 room softened package cream cheese
2 medium sized packages of mild cheddar cheese
1 can cheddar cheese soup
2 eggs
1 half cup milk
1 large handful parmesean bread crumbs
1 large handful french fried onions
13 x 9 glass baking dish
olive oil
aluminum foil

Directions:
Chop onion, brown in skillet with olive oil, then set aside.
While onion is browning, prepare, hand chop, (we prefer ours a bit chunky) and lightly steam broccoli and cauliflower together for only a few minutes.  (The key is not to steam vegetables too much because they will become mushy).  Drain well.
In a large bowl, lightly combine vegetables with the onion, softened cream cheese, and one package mild cheddar cheese.  Set aside to continue cooling.
In a smaller bowl beat 2 eggs, add milk, add soup, add breadcrumbs, and add french fried onions.  Mix well.  Add this mixture to large bowl of vegetables.  Continue folding in with large wooden spoon until all is mixed well.
Pour mixture into a glass 13 x 9 baking dish.  Sprinkle top with last package of mild cheddar cheese.  Loosely cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for approx. one hour (give or take 10 minutes depending on your oven).  Remove foil and crisp up cheesy top until browned.
Let cool for a bit before cutting.  Enjoy!!!!
