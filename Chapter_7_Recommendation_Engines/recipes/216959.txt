Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
3/4 cup canned peas and carrots, drained
1 cup Kikkoman Thai Red Curry Sauce
Flour for baking sheet
12 large wonton wrappers

Directions:
In large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Add potatoes and onion; cook, stirring constantly, about 15 minutes or until soft. Add peas and carrots and curry sauce and cook 4-5 minutes. Cool.
Lightly flour baking sheet. Cut each wonton wrapper in half on the diagonal to make 2 triangles. Spoon 1-2 tablespoons filling in center of each triangle. Brush edges of wrappers with water; fold in half to form a triangle and press edges together to seal. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.
In deep-fryer or deep, heavy pot, heat oil to 350 degrees F. Fry samosas a few at a time, turning occasionally, 2-3 minutes or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve with chutney.
