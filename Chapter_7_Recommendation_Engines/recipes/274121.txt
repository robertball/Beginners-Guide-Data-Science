Ingredients:
3 cups grated carrots
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts
1 1/4 cups oil
4 eggs
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 6-cavity mini loaf tray.
Mix carrots, flour, sugar, walnuts, oil, eggs, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl until combined. Pour batter into the prepared tray, filling each loaf cavity 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes, then transfer loaves to a wire rack to finish cooling.

My favorite carrot cake recipe! It is so good, and the mini loaf pans are perfect for holidays and gifts. Best if frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II by Janni, from this site.
