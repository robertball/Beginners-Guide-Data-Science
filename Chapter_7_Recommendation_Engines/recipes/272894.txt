Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh asparagus, cut in half
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
4 cups chopped kale
salt to taste
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1 (3 ounce) package feta cheese
1 avocado, peeled and chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Coat asparagus with olive oil in a large bowl. Toss with garlic. Arrange asparagus in one layer on the prepared baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until tender and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, massage kale with salt in the same bowl used for coating asparagus. The excess olive oil will get on the kale, so don't over massage, or the leaves will get soggy.
Add tomatoes, feta cheese, and avocado; mix to combine. Cut roasted asparagus in half and mix into salad.

Description: 
A meatless kale salad that can be a meal by itself. You may want to chop off the bottom of each asparagus stalk. The purplish-white part will not roast well and can taste bitter.
