Ingredients:
35 buttery round crackers, crushed
1 (12 ounce) can oysters, drained
2 cups half-and-half cream
1 tablespoon butter
1 pinch paprika

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Grease a 1 quart casserole dish.
Place a layer of crushed crackers in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Cover with a layer of oysters. Repeat layers ending with a layer of cracker crumbs on the top. Drizzle the half-and-half over all, and dot with pieces of butter. Sprinkle paprika over the top. Cover, and let stand for one hour to firm up.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until the top is golden, and the center is firm.

Description: 
This is an excellent side dish served with a turkey dinner. It can also be served with a roast beef dinner. It is a big hit with my family and so easy to make.
