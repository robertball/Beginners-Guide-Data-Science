Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
In a medium bowl stir together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, pie spice, salt, and baking soda.
Add pumpkin, eggs, milk, and butter and beat on low speed until combined.
Spoon or pipe batter into donut pan and bake for 8 - 10 minutes until donuts spring back when touched.
To make the glaze, combine remaining ingredients in a small bowl and mix well until smooth.
