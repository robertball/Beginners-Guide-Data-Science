Ingredients:
1 lb. chuck steak, cut across the grain (to ensure tenderness) into thin 1½ to 2-inch strips
1 c. flour
salt and pepper to taste
5 Tbsp. olive oil
2 oz. butter
8 oz. button mushrooms
½ cup dry red cooking wine
½ cup beef broth
15-oz. jar of Holland-style pearl onions, drained
12-oz. sour cream
1 package egg noodles, any variety

Directions:
Cover the bottom of a skillet with olive oil and butter. Heat on low until butter melts and combines nicely with the olive oil.
Meanwhile, mix flour, salt and pepper thoroughly. Coat beef strips with flour mixture and set aside.
Increase skillet heat to medium then add meat. Brown on all sides, then add mushrooms. Add more oil if the pan becomes too dry.
Pour wine over beef and mushroom mixture. Loosen any pan drippings and continue cooking until liquid is reduced by half. Add beef broth and return to a boil, then cover and cook until meat is tender (about 20-25 minutes).
Meanwhile, cook egg noodles according to package directions. Drain and rinse with cool water and set aside.
Add drained pearl onions to the meat and mushroom mixture, stirring gently and cooking until onions are heat through (about 3-5 minutes).
Remove from heat and fold in the sour cream.
Serve over hot egg noodles. Enjoy!
