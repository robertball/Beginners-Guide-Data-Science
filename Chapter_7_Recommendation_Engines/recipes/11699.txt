Ingredients:
4 quarts fresh mussels
1 (16 ounce) package linguini pasta
3 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
2 cups white wine

Directions:
Scrub mussels and pull off beards, cutting them at the base with a paring knife.  Discard those that do not close when you handle them and any with broken shells.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and reserve.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet place 2 tablespoons butter or margarine, onion, garlic, parsley, bay leaf, thyme and wine.  Bring to a boil and lower heat; cook for 2 minutes.  Add mussels; cover and cook just until they open, 3 to 4 minutes.  Do not overcook.
Divide pasta into 4 bowls and spoon mussels over noodles.
Strain mussel liquid, and return to pot.  Add remaining butter or margarine and heat until it melts.  Pour over mussels and serve.
