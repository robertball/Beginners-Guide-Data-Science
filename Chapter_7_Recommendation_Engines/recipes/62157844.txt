Ingredients:
1 large can (or one bag) sauerkraut, drained.
1 cup diced celery
1 medium onion, diced
1 medium green pepper, diced
1 small jar diced pimento, drained (optional)
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup white, or apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Rinse and drain the sauerkraut, and squeeze to get all the juice out.
Mix the sugar and vinegar in a saucepan, and bring to a boil.
Pour the sugar and water mixture over the remaining ingredients, and let them stand, overnight, in the refrigerator.

Description: 
This was my grandmother's (Dollie Cowan) recipe for sauerkraut salad.  This is often requested at family get-togethers.  It will keep for several days in the refrigerator.  I personally prefer using the bagged, fresh sauerkraut to make this, but the original recipe called for canned.  Either will work fine.  If you're out of celery, you can substitute some celery seed, but the fresh celery is really better.
