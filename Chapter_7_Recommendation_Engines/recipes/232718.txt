Ingredients:
12 graham crackers, broken into quarters
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup chopped walnuts, or to taste
1 (12 ounce) package milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Line a 10x15-inch baking sheet with graham cracker quarters.
Bring butter, margarine, and sugar to a boil in a saucepan, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Pour butter mixture over graham crackers and sprinkle with walnuts.
Bake in the preheated oven until butter is browned and nuts are toasted, about 10 minutes. Immediately transfer toffee bars from the baking sheet to a platter lined with aluminum foil or wax paper.
Melt chocolate chips in 2 batches in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Drop spoonfuls of melted chocolate over each toffee bar.
