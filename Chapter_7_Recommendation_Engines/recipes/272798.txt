Ingredients:
3 very ripe bananas
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups whole-wheat pastry flour
1/2 cup wheat germ
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
Mash bananas in a large bowl. Add oil, sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.
Mix pastry flour, wheat germ, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in a bowl. Add flour mixture to the bowl with the banana mixture and stir until just combined; do not over mix. Fold in nuts. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.

Description: 
This is a sweet and delicious version of regular nut bread, but for the vegan-lovin' hippies - or heart happy. I always have brown bananas! I love this recipe because I don't have to use milk or eggs. It's really moist and easy. I make it for all my neighbors, and they have no idea it's vegan. 
Once you get this down, you can mix and have in the oven in less than 10 minutes.
