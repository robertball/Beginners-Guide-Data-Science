Ingredients:
1 cup walnuts
1 cup almonds
1 cup shredded coconut
1/2 cup cacao beans
1/4 cup hemp seed hearts
1/4 cup goji berries
2 tablespoons coconut flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
1 cup Greek-style yogurt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 310 degrees F (154 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.
Pulse walnuts, almonds, coconut, cacao beans, hemp seed hearts, goji berries, coconut flour, cinnamon, ginger, and vanilla bean paste together in a food processor until combined.
Stir honey and coconut oil together in a small bowl; pour over nut mixture and pulse to combine. With food processor running, add yogurt slowly until a moist dough forms. Transfer dough to the greased pan and spread evenly to 1/2-inch thickness.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to come away from the sides of the pan, 30 to 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C) and bake until top is toasted and golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Cut into 1x3-inch bars while still warm.
