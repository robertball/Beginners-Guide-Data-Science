2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium-size bowl. Add coconut milk and oil, mixing until combined. Carefully fold in blueberries.
Spray a small frying pan with oil and preheat over medium-low heat. Pour approximately Â¼ cup batter into the pan and spread into a 5? circle. Cook for approximately 1-2 minutes or until the bottom is lightly browned. Flip over and cook an additional 1 minute or so on the other side. Once the pancake is golden brown, remove from pan and place on a plate. Repeat with remainder of batter until all has been used.
