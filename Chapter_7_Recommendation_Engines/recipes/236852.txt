Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups brown rice flour
2/3 cup sorghum flour
1/4 cup dark cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 cups shredded zucchini
1 cup soy milk
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer instructions.
Stir brown rice flour, sorghum flour, dark cocoa powder, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a bowl.
Whisk zucchini, soy milk, eggs, water, oil, and honey together in a separate bowl; add flour mixture and whisk together until evenly moistened.
Prepare the surfaces of the waffle iron with cooking spray. Ladle 1 cup of the batter into the waffle iron, close lid, and cook until you have a crispy brown waffle, about 5 minutes. Repeat, applying more cooking spray between waffles, until all batter is used.
