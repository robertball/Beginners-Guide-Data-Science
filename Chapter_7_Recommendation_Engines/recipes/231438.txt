Description: 
Hot sauce recipe inspired by many others, but unique. Very simple ingredients and easy to make. Has great heat with legs (the heat lasts), good pepper flavor, and the sweet balances the heat. I used salt substitute (66% KCl, 33% NaCl) for low-sodium diet. Servings below are in tablespoons.
