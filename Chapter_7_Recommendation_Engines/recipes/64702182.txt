Ingredients:
6 Tbsp     Butter, Softened
¾ Cups     Sugar
1 Large     Egg
2     Bananas, ripe and mashed (medium sized)
1/2  teaspoon     Vanilla
1 cups     Flour
1/2 teaspoon     Baking Soda
1/2 teaspoon     Salt
1/4 cup     Whole Milk
½ cup     Pecans, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray (I like Wilton Cake Release).
With a mixer, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy (About 3-5 minutes).
Add the egg, and beat until incorporated.
Mix in the bananas and vanilla.
Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt together.
Alternate adding the dry ingredient blend and milk to the mixing bowl with the banana mixture. Add the flour and buttermilk to the banana mixture just until everything is mixed together. Don’t overmix.
Fold in the pecans.
Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake for 50 minutes.
Cool for 20 minutes in the pan before turning the loaf out onto a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
