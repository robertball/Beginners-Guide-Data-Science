Ingredients:
Meatballs:
1 slice day-old whole-grain bread, torn into 2-inch pieces
1/4 cup 1% low-fat milk
1 onion, quartered
1 red bell pepper, seeded and quartered
2 cloves garlic
1 pound 93% lean ground turkey
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley
1 tablespoon grainy Dijon mustard
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
cooking spray
Dip:
1/3 cup non-fat Greek yogurt
1/4 cup light mayonnaise
4 teaspoons grainy Dijon mustard

Directions:
Place torn bread in a food processor and pulse until fine crumbs form. Transfer bread crumbs to a large bowl and add milk; set aside until bread is completely soaked.
Place onion, red bell pepper, and garlic in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped; stir into bread mixture. Add turkey, egg, parsley, 1 tablespoon mustard, salt, and pepper to bread crumb mixture and mix well. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray.
Shape turkey mixture into 1-inch balls; arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until firm and cooked through, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let meatballs stand for 5 minutes.
Mix yogurt, mayonnaise, and 4 teaspoons mustard together in a bowl; serve alongside meatballs.

Description: 
For a break from beef, try these tender turkey meatballs. Don't use extra-lean turkey breast; it dries out too easily.
