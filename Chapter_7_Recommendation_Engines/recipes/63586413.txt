Ingredients:
1 pound ground Italian sausage (or regular pork or whatever appeals to you)
8 oz cream cheese, softened
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (original recipe used parmesan)
1 pound jalapenos, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 green onion, finely chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place sausage in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain grease. In a bowl, mix the sausage, cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and green onion. Spoon about 1 tablespoon sausage mixture into each jalapeno half. Arrange stuffed halves in a baking dish. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned.
