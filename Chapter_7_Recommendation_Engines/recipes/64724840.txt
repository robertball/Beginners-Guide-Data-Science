Ingredients:
10 Large flour tortillas
3 Cups of chopped cooked chicken breast
1 1/2 Cup sour cream
2 cans chopped green chilis
1 can of pinto beans
2 cups of  shredded cheese of your choice - I use a Mexican blend (not with the seasoning though...blech)

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine chicken, sour cream, chilis, beans and cheese.
Spread mixture onto tortillas.
Roll up and place in a greased dish.
Cover with remaining cheese and bake for 20 minutes at 400*.

Description: 
I have no idea if these are really quesadillas or not but it’s what we call them and everyone enjoys them. Maybe they’re enchiladas?
