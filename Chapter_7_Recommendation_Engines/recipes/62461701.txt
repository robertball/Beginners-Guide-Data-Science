Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon table salt
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/3 cup butterscotch chips
1/3 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup unsweetened shredded dried coconut

Directions:
Position an oven rack on the middle rung.  Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a 9-inch glass pie plate.
In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt, butterscotch chips, walnuts, and coconut.  Whisk until well blended.  In a large bowl, combine the butter and brown sugar.  Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended.  Add the egg and vanilla and beat just until blended.  Pour in the flour mixture, and stir with a wooden spoon just until incorporated.  Dough will be quite thick.
Spread the dough evenly into the greased pie plate.  Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out almost clean, about 27 minutes.  Your own oven may vary, so watch closely towards the end to prevent over-baking.
Transfer the pie plate to a rack to cool.  Once cool, cut it into 12 equal wedges.  Serve plain or with ice cream.
