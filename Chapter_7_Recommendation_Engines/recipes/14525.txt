Ingredients:
4 (1/2 pound) rib-eye steaks, or steak of choice
2 tablespoons sea salt
2 tablespoons lemon pepper
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles beer of choice

Directions:
Place the steaks in a large, shallow container with a lid. Season each side of the steaks with the salt and lemon pepper. Gently pour the beer over the steaks (making sure the seasoning doesn't wash off). Cover, and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.
Preheat grill for high heat.
Lightly oil grill grate. Place steaks on grill, and discard beer marinade. Cook for 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.
