Ingredients:
1 cup great northern beans (or white kidney)
1 onion, thinly sliced
2 small carrots, sliced
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 cup olive oil
3 cups water
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Rinse and strain soaked beans. Place in a large saucepan, and cover with water.  Boil for 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain, discarding the water.
If using a pressure cooker, soak beans overnight. Cook beans first in 2 c. water (7 minutes plus cool down), then cook all ingredients except parsley for 3 to 4 minutes under 15 pounds pressure.  Stir in parsley.
