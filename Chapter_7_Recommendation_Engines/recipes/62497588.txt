Cold pasta salad without mayonnaise! 

This is one of my favorite summer pasta salads.  I got the recipe from my Land O Lake's recipe book  - which I thought I had lost.   This recipe is NOT available ANYWHERE else online(Not even at Land O Lakes).  I looked. 
 
So it is now posted - Never to be lost again!  Enjoy!
