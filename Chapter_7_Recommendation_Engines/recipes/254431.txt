Description: 
This is a great set-it-and-forget-it recipe using Knorr® Spanish rice. Just prepare the rice (or use some leftover rice from the night before), mix it with a few freezer staples, beans, salsa, and spices, and blam! The best chili ever after a few hours in the slow cooker. Garnish with cheese, sour cream, and/or diced onions. This would also go great on top of a big pile of fries on game day.
