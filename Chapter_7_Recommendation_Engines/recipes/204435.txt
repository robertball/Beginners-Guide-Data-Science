Ingredients:
1/2 cup sliced almonds
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
hot sauce
2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground black pepper
1 (12 ounce) bag spring mix lettuce
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
1 cup sliced fresh strawberries
1 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped red onion
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Stir the almonds and 3 tablespoons sugar together in the skillet; cook until the sugar has melted and coats the almonds; 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside.
Whisk the vegetable oil, vinegar, hot sauce, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Toss the spring mix, oranges, strawberries, celery, onion, and parsley together in a large mixing bowl; drizzle the vegetable oil mixture over the lettuce mixture and stir gently to coat. Sprinkle the toasted almonds over the salad to serve.
