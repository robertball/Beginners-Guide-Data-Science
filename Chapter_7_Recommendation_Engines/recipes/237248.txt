Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup chopped whole kernel corn
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Beat milk, sour cream, butter, and egg together in a large mixing bowl until smooth; add flour, cornmeal, chopped corn, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk mixture until dry ingredients are just moistened; fold Cheddar cheese into the batter. Divide batter between 12 muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
