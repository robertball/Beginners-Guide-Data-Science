Ingredients:
4 medium potatoes
4 tablespoons butter, softened
4 tablespoons coarse salt
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon pepper
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat.
Prepare four foil squares large enough to fold over one potato each.   Spread butter onto foil in a large enough area that the potato will be completely covered when rolled up.  Sprinkle salt, garlic, pepper, and Italian seasoning evenly over foil.  Roll each potato in the foil; puncture the package (including the potato) with a fork or knife a few times.
Grill for 1 hour, or until soft, turning the potatoes often.  Serve with your favorite toppings.

Description: 
These fantastic grilled potatoes will have everyone eating the skin! But be careful, no other baked potato will do after this. So be prepared to make it again.
