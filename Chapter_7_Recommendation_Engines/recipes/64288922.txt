Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour?
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract?
1/2 cup unsalted butter?
1/2 cup granulated sugar

Directions:
In a small saucepan, heat the flour and milk over medium heat, stirring constantly. When the mixture becomes a paste (about 5 minutes), remove from heat and allow to cool for 1 minute. Stir in the vanilla extract. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and set aside to cool completely.
With an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cooled milk mixture and beat for about 5 minutes, until smooth and creamy.
