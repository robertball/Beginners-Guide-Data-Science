Sauce:

Directions:
Combine all ingredients for bread pudding.  Mixture should be very moist but not soupy.  Pour into a buttered 9x13 inch baking dish.  Place on middle rack of cold oven.  Heat oven to 350 degrees and bake for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes until top is golden brown.
While bread pudding is in oven, melt butter in saucepan and add brown sugar to form a creamy paste.  Stir in liquors until smooth sauce is formed.  Simmer for 2 minutes.  Serve warm over warm bread pudding with fresh strawberries.
