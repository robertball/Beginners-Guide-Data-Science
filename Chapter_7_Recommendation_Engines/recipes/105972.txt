Ingredients:
4 large bananas
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Leaving the peel on the bananas, slice each in half lengthwise.  Smear the inside with peanut butter, and sprinkle with chocolate chips.  Place the two halves back together and wrap each banana individually in aluminum foil.
Cook in the hot coals of a campfire until the banana is hot, and the chocolate has melted, about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the heat of the coals.
