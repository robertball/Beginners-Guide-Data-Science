Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
5 green onion bulbs, thickly sliced
2 tablespoons granulated garlic
1 pinch salt
1 (5 ounce) package grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 cups sour cream
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon dried basil
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 (4 ounce) packet crushed saltine crackers

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Butter the inside of spaghetti squash halves and place cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until skin is easily pierced with a fork, about 40 minutes.
Remove squash from oven and leave oven on. Set squash aside and allow to cool until safe to handle; scrape into a large bowl.
While squash is baking, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, bell pepper, green onions, granulated garlic, and salt. Cook until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Add Parmesan cheese to the bowl with the cooked spaghetti squash. Mix in sour cream, minced garlic, basil, 2 teaspoons salt, oregano, red pepper flakes, and black pepper. Add sauteed vegetables.
Pour squash mixture into the prepared pan and sprinkle with crushed saltines.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes.
