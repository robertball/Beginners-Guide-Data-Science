Ingredients:
1 cup Ghirardelli® 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips
3/4 cup unsalted butter
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup Ghirardelli® Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3 large eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup soft brown sugar
1 cup roughly chopped pecans, divided
Pumpkin Mixture:
3/4 cup pumpkin puree
1 egg
1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
In a medium-sized pan, heat the butter and sugar until just hot. Remove from heat then add 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips and stir until it has all melted.
Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then beat eggs into the mixture in the pan one at a time. Add the flour and cocoa and beat well together.
Stir in the rest of the chocolate chips and 1/2 of the pecans. Pour the brownie mix into prepared baking sheet.
Pumpkin Mixture: Beat all the mixture ingredients together well in a bowl using a hand whisk or wooden spoon, then pour over the top of the brownies.  Roughly swirl/fold the pumpkin mixture into the brownie mix.
Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup pecans on top.
Bake 40 minutes, or until a crust has formed on the top.
Allow to cool, then transfer to a wire rack. Cut into cubes and enjoy.
