Ingredients:
Dressing:
3Tsp. Honey
2tsp salt
Juice of 1 Lime
1 jalapeno seeded and chopped
2 cloves of garlic-minced
a couple of dashes of Tabasco sauce.
Salad:
8 Ears of fresh corn on the cob
6-8 quarts of water
2 Table spoons sugar
2 Table spoons salt
1 Green pepper diced 1/4"
1 Red pepper diced 1/4"
4-5 Green onions chopped 1/4"
1 Bunch of Cilantro chopped
Optional add-ins:
1 can of black beans drained and rinsed
1 firm Avocado cut to 1/2" pcs.

Directions:
Cook the corn in 6-8 quarts of boiling water w/ 2 Table spoons ea. of salt and sugar
In a large salad bowl combine all the ingredients for the dressing.
Take a small mixing bowl and place it up-side-down in the salad bowl, now you can use this as a base to cut the corn off the cob. After cutting the corn off the cob I use the back of the knife to scrape off all the tasty bits and juices. Once this process is done remove the small mixing bowl.
Add in the remaining ingredients and gently mix together
Add salt and pepper to taste.
