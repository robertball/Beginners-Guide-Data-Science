Ingredients:
1 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup couscous
1 (2 ounce) jar sliced pimento peppers, drained
2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Stir chicken broth, lemon juice, lemon zest, butter, and salt together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Add couscous to the liquid and stir to coat completely. Place a cover on the saucepan, remove from heat, and let couscous soak in hot liquid until the moisture is mostly absorbed, about 5 minutes.
Fluff couscous with a fork. Stir pimento peppers, pine nuts, and parsley into the couscous.
