Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1 egg
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon butter
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
1/4 cup cinnamon sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Place the milk, egg, salt, sugar, butter, flour, and yeast into a bread machine in that order. Start the machine's Dough cycle.
Once the dough cycle has completed, remove the dough from the bread machine to a lightly floured surface. Cover with a large mixing bowl, and let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 10 balls, then flatten, and gently stretch into 8x6-inch ovals (a beaver tail shape.)
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook the dough one or two at a time in the hot oil until lightly browned on each side, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar to serve.

Description: 
This recipe is passed down from my Nana who was famous for her doughnuts. This is one she would make us on a cold winters day after skating all day on the outdoor rink. It is a popular treat when skating on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa, Canada.
