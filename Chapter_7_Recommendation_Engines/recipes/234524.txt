Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed and drained
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch ground cloves (optional)

Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.

Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, ground ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl.
Stir squash, yogurt, brown sugar, raisins, walnuts, eggs, and vanilla together in a large bowl. Add flour mixture to squash mixture; stir. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
