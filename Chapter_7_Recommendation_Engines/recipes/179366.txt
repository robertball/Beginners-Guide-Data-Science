Ingredients:
Rolls:
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 1/2 cups Original Bisquick® mix
2/3 cup milk
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
1/4 cup raisins
Glaze:
1 1/3 cups powdered sugar
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease bottom and sides of 13x9-inch pan. In small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons sugar and the cinnamon; set aside.
In medium bowl, stir Bisquick mix, 2/3 cup milk and 2 tablespoons sugar until dough forms. If dough is too sticky, gradually mix in enough Bisquick mix (up to 1/4 cup) to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough onto surface well dusted with Bisquick mix; gently roll dough in Bisquick mix to coat. Shape into ball; knead 10 times.
Roll dough into 15x9-inch rectangle; spread with butter. Sprinkle evenly with sugar mixture and raisins. Roll up tightly, beginning at 15-inch side. Seal well by pinching edge of dough into roll. Cut into 1 1/4-inch slices; place cut sides down in pan.
Bake 23 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 5 minutes. Remove from pan.
In medium bowl, mix powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons milk until smooth. Spread glaze over warm rolls.
