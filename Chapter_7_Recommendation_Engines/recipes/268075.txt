Ingredients:
Ground Turkey Kheema:
3 teaspoons butter
1 large onion, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pound ground turkey
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground chile pepper
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 russet potato, diced
1 cup frozen peas
1/2 cup tomato sauce
1/2 cup water
1 bay leaf
1 red bell pepper, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
Forbidden Rice:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup black (forbidden) rice
4 cups water
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 dash ground cloves
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; cook for 2 minutes more. Add turkey; cook and stir until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, coriander, cumin, ground chile, turmeric, masala, and cinnamon. Stir well.
Add potato, peas, tomato sauce, water, and bay leaf. Reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer until potato is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Add bell pepper and cilantro; simmer until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes more.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a separate pan over medium-high heat. Saute rice in the hot oil for 2 to 3 minutes. Add water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender, 20 to 40 minutes. Drain off excess water. Add cinnamon, cloves, salt, and pepper.
