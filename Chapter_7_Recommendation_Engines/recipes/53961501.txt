Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) butternut squash, halved and seeded
1/2 tablespoon Olive Oil
Kosher salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Use a sharp knife to carefully cut away the peel from the squash. Cut the squash into sticks like French fries. Arrange squash pieces on a baking sheet and season with salt.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, turning the fries over halfway through baking. Fries are done when they are starting to brown on the edges and become crispy.
