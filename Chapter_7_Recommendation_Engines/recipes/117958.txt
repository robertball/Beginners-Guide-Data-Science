1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup finely chopped pecans

2 pints fresh raspberries
1/2 cup pecan halves

Directions:
Prepare and bake the cake according to package directions, using two 9-in. round baking pans. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth; stir in chopped pecans. Fold in whipped cream. Split each cake into two horizontal layers. Place one bottom layer on a serving plate; top with a fourth of the cream cheese mixture.
Arrange 1 cup raspberries over filling; repeat layers three times. Garnish with pecan halves. Refrigerate until serving.
