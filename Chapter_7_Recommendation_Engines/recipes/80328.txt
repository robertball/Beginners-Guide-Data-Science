Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 onion, diced
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
salt and pepper to taste
1 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 20 minutes

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion, egg yolk, oregano, salt and pepper.
Pick up medium sized handfuls and press them onto skewers. Roll on a lightly oiled clean surface until the mixture looks like a large ground beef hot dog with about 1 1/2 inches at each end of the skewer. Place your fingers in the middle of the skewer and separate the meat log into two sausages with about 1 inch of skewer sticking out at each end.
Prepare a grill for high heat, or if you only have a grill pan, like myself, heat it over medium-high heat.
Place the sausages on the grilling surface, and cook for about 10 minutes, turning once or twice for even cooking. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Kofta is a popular dish made from grilled ground beef that is served throughout the Middle-East. This is a wonderful and simple version I picked up in Egypt. A great accompaniment is saffron rice.
