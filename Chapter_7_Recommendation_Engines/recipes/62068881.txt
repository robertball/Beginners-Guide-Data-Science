Ingredients:
3 strips of bacon
3 slices of tofu - striped and cubed
1 can of chopped baby corn
1 can of artichoke hearts
1 clove of garlic
1 ts oregano
1/2 ts sage
1/4 c parmesean
4 TB butter

Directions:
take your 3 slices of bacon and put them in a frying pan on medium high. Take your baby corn, in a separate larger frying pan, and the 4 TB of butter and put in a large frying pan after draining. Drain and chop up your artichoke hearts & put them in the large frying pan with the corn. Dice your clove of garlic and place that in the pan with the vegetables. When the bacon is almost cooked, chop it up and return to the pan with your cubed tofu. Your vegetables should start to brown, and add your spices. When your bacon & tofu are browned and cooked (but not real crisp) take out of the frying pan and place on a paper towel to drain the excess grease off. Place another paper towel on top and pat it down. Then pour the bacon and tofu in the pan with the vegetables. Mix well and you have a nice side dish or a nice warm salad to eat or a nice stuffing for a wrap. I like to eat it straight. When you serve it cover the top with some parmesean.
