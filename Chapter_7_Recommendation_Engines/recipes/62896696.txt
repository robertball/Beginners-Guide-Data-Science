Ingredients:
3 tablespoons chili powder
3 tablespoons flour
1 teaspoon cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon oregano
3 cups water
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce

Directions:
Combine all dry ingredients in a small bowl.
Stirring constantly, slowly add enough of the water to make a thin paste.
Pour into pan and add rest of water.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens.
Stir in tomato sauce.
Use in your favorite enchilada recipe. The amounts on the ingredients are very flexible. For instance, if I am feeding my kids who do not like"spicy", I will halve the chili powder and double the tomato sauce.
