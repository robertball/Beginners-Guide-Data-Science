Description: 
A fabulously easy chicken and rice dish made quickly in one pan, stove top. As one of my husband's favorites, I adapted it from Mary Nelm's recipe until it eventually became my own. The lemon really brightens the flavors at the end. You can half this recipe easily but keep in mind, the leftovers are wonderful!!
