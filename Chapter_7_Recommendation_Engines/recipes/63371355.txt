Description: 
Opa y'all!  The Greek festival was held recently in my Texas city and inspired me to look up some greek recipes.  I found a greek shrimp recipe that looked delicious and reminded me of some Cajun barbecue shrimp recipes.  So I took the best of both the Greek and Cajun shrimp recipes and created my own Greek-Cajun-Tex Shrimp recipe with butter, worcestershire, tomatoes, greek seasoning, feta cheese, cayenne pepper and other herbs and spices.  It tastes great served over crusty bread or pasta.  It is so good it will make y'all want to shout Opa too!
