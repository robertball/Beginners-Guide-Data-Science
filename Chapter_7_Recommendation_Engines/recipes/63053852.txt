Ingredients:
4 (6.5 ounce) cans minced clams, reserve juice
1 bottle clam juice
4 strips bacon
1 cup minced onion
1 cup diced celery
2 cups cubed potatoes
1 cup diced carrots
3/4 cup butter
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 quart half-and-half cream
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp white pepper

Directions:
In large skillet sautee bacon til crispy.  Remove cooked bacon and set aside. In hot bacon grease saute onion and celery til soft.  Add all of the clam juices, potatoes, carrots and crumbled bacon, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer til vegetables are tender; approximately 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large, heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Combine flour, Old Bay, onion and garlic powders.  Whisk flour mixture into melted butter and stir until smooth. Gently whisk in cream and stir constantly until thick and smooth. Stir in vegetables and clam juice. Heat through, but do not boil.
Stir in clams just before serving. If they cook too much they get tough. When clams are heated through, stir in vinegar, and season with salt and pepper.
