Ingredients:
4 cups tart apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup honey, divided
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 egg
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup evaporated milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart casserole dish.
Place the apples in the casserole dish in an even layer. Reserve a tablespoon of walnuts for garnish, and mix the rest with the cinnamon; sprinkle them over the apples. Drizzle half of the honey over the apples.
In a medium bowl, mix the butter, remaining honey and egg until smooth. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the batter, alternating with evaporated milk until just blended. Pour this mixture over the apples. Sprinkle the reserved walnuts over the top.
Bake for 60 to 70 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted into the top comes out clean and apples are tender. To serve, scoop portions into dessert bowls and top with ice cream while still warm.
