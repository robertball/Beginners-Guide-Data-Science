Description: 
A fresh, peachy sweet tea that's perfect for hot summer days. I am definitely NOT a fan of sweet or flavored tea, but I came up with this concoction on accident, and LOVE it. Remember, the amount of alcohol you want to use is up to personal taste. I personally use a little more vodka than peach schnapps. I just like a touch of the peach flavoring.
