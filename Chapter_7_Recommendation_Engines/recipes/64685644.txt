Ingredients:
3 cups uncooked spiral noodles
2 1/2 cups fresh green beans, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 medium onion, chopped
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp thyme
1/8 tsp black pepper
1 cup skim milk
1 cup chicken broth
1 1/2 cups cubed cooked ham
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley
1/3 cup french-fried onions
2 tbs shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Cook noodles according to package directions. Meanwhile, steam green beans for 3-5 minutes or until crisp-tender.
In a large skillet, saute the chopped onion in butter until tender. Combine the flour, thyme and pepper; gradually whisk in milk and broth until smooth. Add milk mixture to the skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened.
Drain noodles; add the ham, parsley, sauce and asparagus. Transfer to a 13-in. x 9-in. baking dish coated with cooking spray. Top with fried onions and cheese.
Cover and bake at 350Â° for 20 minutes or until bubbly. Uncover and bake 5-10 minutes longer or until golden brown.
