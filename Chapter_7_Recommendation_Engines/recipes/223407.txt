Ingredients:
3 cups coarsely shredded zucchini
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
1 large egg
2 green onions, thinly sliced
1/4 cup diced red bell pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons seafood seasoning
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon butter

Directions:
Place grated zucchini in a colander; sprinkle with salt and let stand 30 minutes. Press with paper towels to remove as much liquid as possible; zucchini should be fairly dry and reduced to about 2 cups.
Mix egg, zucchini, bread crumbs, green onions, bell pepper, seafood seasoning, mustard, mayonnaise, and red pepper flakes in a large bowl. Form into 8 patties, 3 to 4 inches across.
Heat oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry patties until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
