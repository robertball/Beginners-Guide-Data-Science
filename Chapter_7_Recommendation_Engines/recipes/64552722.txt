Ingredients:
4 chicken breasts or equivalent in large thighs (boneless)
1c shredded unsweetened coconut
1/2c flour
juice from 3 large limes
olive or coconut oil as needed
honey (approx 1/2-1/3c) divided in half

Directions:
Butterfly the chicken to make it thinner and cut into strips
Mix together flour and coconut
Marinate the chicken pieces in lime juice for an hour minimum, but no longer than 2 hours because the acid in the lime will "cook" the chicken and make it a funny texture (thank you for this tip, Vera!)
Dip marinated pieces into honey and then into coconut mixture to fully coat
Panfry in olive or coconut oil until cooked through and coating is brown and crispy
Top with lime zest to make it pretty :)
Use remaining honey for dipping

Description: 
This was a throw-it-together recipe when I didn't know what to make one night, that turned out great. Aaand, it was improved with the help of my some of my brilliant fellow Allrecipes Canadian Allstar sisters: Jan, Lindsay, Michele, Debbie, Vera (read their reviews for suggestions). Thank you, ladies :)
