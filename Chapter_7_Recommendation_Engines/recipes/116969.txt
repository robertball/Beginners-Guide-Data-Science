Ingredients:
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
2 teaspoons onion salt
2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 egg, beaten
1 pound ground beef
1 1/4 cups barbecue sauce
SAUCE:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup barbecue sauce
1 teaspoon brown sugar
ONION TOPPING:
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup honey
2 large sweet onions, thinly sliced
4 slices smoked Cheddar cheese
4 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the bread crumbs, onion salt and brown sugar. Add egg. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into four patties. Place in a shallow dish; pour barbecue sauce over patties. Cover and refrigerate for 2-4 hours.
In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients; cover and refrigerate until serving. For topping, melt butter in a large skillet. Stir in honey until blended. Add onions; saute for 15-20 minutes or until tender and lightly browned. Keep warm.
Drain and discard barbecue sauce. Grill patties, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 5-7 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. Top each with a cheese slice; grill 1 minute longer or until cheese is melted. Serve on buns with sauce and onion topping.

Description: 
Sometimes we dont even bother with a bun for these moist, flavorful burgers. Smoked cheese, grilled onions and a special sauce make them out of the ordinary! --Christie Gardiner, Eagle Mountain, Utah
