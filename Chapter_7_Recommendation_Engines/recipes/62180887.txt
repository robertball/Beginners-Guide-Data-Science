Ingredients:
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
7 ounces seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 t. garlic powder
1/2 t. onion powder
salt and pepper
1/4 cup flour
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
12 ounces pasta sauce
6 slices Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Pour beaten eggs into a shallow dish or bowl. In another shallow dish or bowl, mix together the grated Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, garlic powder, and onion powder.  In another bowl, mix salt, pepper, garlic powder, and flour. Pound chicken breasts until 1/2 inch thickness. Dip chicken breasts into flour mixture, shake of excess.  Then dip chicken into beaten egg seasoned with pepper, then into bread crumb mixture to coat.  Refridgerate for 30 minutes.
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Add coated chicken and saute for about 8 to 10 minutes each side, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
Pour tomato sauce into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Add chicken and bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Place a slice of Monterey Jack cheese over each breast and bake for another 5 minutes or until cheese is completely melted.
