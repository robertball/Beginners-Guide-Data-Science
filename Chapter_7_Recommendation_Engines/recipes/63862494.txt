Ingredients:
1 pound giblets, neck, and clipped wing tips from turkey
2 carrots, roughly chopped
1 stalk celery, roughly chopped
6 cups water
2 large or 4 small chicken boullion cubes

1/4 cup butter
2 tablespoons tomato paste (optional)
2 tablespoons red currant jelly (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
While the turkey is roasting, place the giblets, turkey neck, and clipped turkey wing tips into a large saucepan with the carrots, celery, water, and chicken bullion cubes. Bring to a boil over medium heat, skim off any foam that forms on the top, reduce heat to low, and simmer the stock for 3 hours.
Strain the stock, skim off the fat, and set aside. There should be about 4 cups of stock.
When turkey is done, collect 2 cups of drippings from bottom of pan.  Skim off the fat and set aside.
Place butter into a large sauce pan and melt over a low heat.
Whisk in the flour, then cook and stir the flour mixture until it becomes pale golden brown, about 5 minutes.
Whisk in the stock + 2 cups of turkey pan drippings, and tomato paste; bring to a boil, simmer for 5 minutes.
Whisk in the red currant jelly and simmer for 10 more minutes.
Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
