Title:
Easy Cream Cheese Wonton Dip Recipe

Ingredients:
6 oz of wonton wrappers (packages generally come in 12 oz)
8 oz whipped cream cheese
1 container of sweet and sour sauce (I prefer homemade or restaurant bought but store bought will suffice).  The thicker the sauce, the better!  Also, for this recipe I prefer sweet and sour sauce that doesn't have soy sauce in it.
Vegetable oil (for frying)

Directions:
For the wonton crisps:  Heat a couple inches worth of vegetable oil in a frying pan.
Cut the wonton wrappers diagonally once to create triangles.
Dip a corner of the wonton into the oil, and if it sizzles immediately, the oil is ready.
Drop 3-4 wrappers in at a time (depending on your pan size).  When edges start to turn brown (about 7-10 seconds) flip with tongs and let them fry for another 7-10 seconds.
Take wrappers out immediately and lay on a paper towel on top of a paper bag.  This will absorb the extra oil.  Wontons tend to brown slightly after being taken out of the oil.
Let cool and serve (or store for later)
For the dip:  Take the whipped cream cheese out of the container and form into a semicircle on the center of a plate.  Then, right before serving, spoon the sweet and sour sauce on top.
Surround the dip with the wonton crisps for cute presentation.  Serve with a cheese spread knife.

Description: 
I wanted to take homemade cream cheese wontons to a party, but I knew I wouldn't have access to an oven to reheat them, SO I came up with this easy recipe.  I've served it twice and it has been the first appetizer to disappear both times.
