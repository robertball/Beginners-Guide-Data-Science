https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 pound okra, chopped into bite size pieces
1 tablespoon chopped garlic (or more if you like)
2 tablespoons olive oil (I like extra virgin)
3 tablespoons yellow cornmeal
Parmesean, Romano or Feta Cheese, grated for topping

Directions:
Heat oil in saute pan over medium heat.
Put in garlic and saute 1-2 minutes.
Add okra and cook until fork tender, approx. 7 min
Once okra is tender in the last minutes of cooking time, add the cornmeal and let it absorb the excess moisture (slimyness) of the okra for approx 2 minutes.
Top with parmesean cheese.
Enjoy!
