Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (2 pound) green cabbage
2 large garlic cloves, or more to taste, smashed
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound bacon
2 tablespoons brown sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.
Pull outer leaf off cabbage. Cut cabbage into 1-inch thick steaks and place on the baking sheet. Rub both sides of cabbage steaks with smashed garlic. Use a pastry brush to evenly spread olive oil on both sides. Sprinkle salt and pepper over each side.
Roast in the middle of the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Carefully flip the cabbage steaks and place 1 to 2 bacon slices on each steak. Sprinkle brown sugar on top. Roast until cabbage is tender and bacon is crisp, about 30 minutes more.

My expertise is in taking healthy recipes... and adding bacon! If you love cabbage, you will love this! And if you want the healthier version, just ditch the bacon and brown sugar.
