Ingredients:
1 bunch asparagus, trimmed
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1/4 tablespoon sea salt (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Cook asparagus in hot oil, turning regularly, until slightly tender, about 5 minutes; add bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder. Turn asparagus with a spatula to coat evenly with the mixture. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking until the asparagus is completely tender, about 8 minutes. Season with sea salt.

Description: 
A quick and delicious side! My husband's favorite asparagus recipe, and he loves asparagus! All seasonings are adjustable 'to taste.' The cook time keeps the asparagus still slightly firm, which helps it hold its nutrients longer. If desired, cook the asparagus longer on a lower heat.
