Ingredients:
1/4 cup cinnamon imperials
1 1/2 cup white melting wafers
caramel apple candy corn

Directions:
Using a double boiler, melt the white wafers.  While the wafers are melting crush the cinnamon imperials (I used a meat tenderizer, but I am sure a blender or food processor is easier). Mix the cinnamon into the melted wafers.  Remove from heat and spread flat on wax paper, about 1/4 inch thick.  Place candy corn pieces on top as a garnish.
