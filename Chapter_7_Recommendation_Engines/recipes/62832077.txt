Ingredients:
1 1/2# ground beef
1/4 onion, diced
4 T tomato paste, divided
1/4 to 1/3 cup Italian style breadcrumbs
1 egg
1/4 cup mozerella cheese, shredded
1/4 cup parmeseano cheese, grated

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Saute onions in a small bit of olive oil until transluscent.  Set aside in bowl to cool.
Add 2T of tomato paste and all other ingredients (except remaining 2T of paste), and gently incorporate with hands until desired texture is reached.  May neeed to add more or less breadcrumbs as I'm guessing on amount.
Shape into a loaf and place on sheet pan.  Brush top with remaining 2T of tomato paste.
Bake roughly an hour or until internal temp reaches 165 degrees.
Wrap in foil and let rest a good 10 minutes before serving.
