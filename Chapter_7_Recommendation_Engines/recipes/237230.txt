Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
1/4 cup butter, divided
1 (16 ounce) package frozen peeled-and-deveined shrimp
1/2 cup diced onion
2 teaspoons minced garlic
3/4 cup diced tomatoes
1 bunch fresh asparagus spears, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
salt to taste
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
4 wedges lemon (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the water.
Melt 1 tablespoon in a large skillet over high heat. Saute shrimp in hot butter until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon to a bowl, retaining liquid in the skillet.
Reduce heat to medium-high. Cook onion and garlic in the retained liquid in the skillet until the onions are translucent 5 to 7 minutes. Stir tomatoes into the onion mixture; cook and stir until the tomatoes soften, about 5 minutes.
Stir asparagus into the tomato mixture and add the reserved water from cooking the pasta; bring liquid to a simmer and cook until the asparagus is tender, about 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and angel hair pasta; stir. Cook until the shrimp is completely opaque in the middle, 2 to 3 minutes more. Season with salt and garnish with Parmesan cheese and lemon wedges.

Description: 
This was inspired by one of my favorite restaurant pasta dishes. I keep the lemon separate until the end due to a picky family member, but you could add it earlier if everyone likes lemon. Do not use pre-cooked shrimp and don't overcook the shrimp.
