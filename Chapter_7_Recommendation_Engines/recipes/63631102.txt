Ingredients:
1 can Pillsbury Refrigerator Biscuits
1 1/4 cup (10 3/4 oz can) condensed cheddar cheese soup
1-2 cups (1-2 61/2 oz cans/pouches) drained tuna {I have also used chicken}
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons instant minced onion or 1/2 cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon chopped parsley flakes (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 Fahrenheit.
Arrange biscuits in an ungreased 9-inch square or 12x8 inch baking dish. In a medium mixing bowl, combine remaining ingredients; pour over biscuits.
Bake for 25-30 minutes until the biscuits have risen to the top and are well-browned. Serve with cheesy sauce spooned over biscuits.
If you want a little kick to it, you can add cayenne pepper to it.

This is my grandmother's recipe. She gave it to my aunt before she died. Then my aunt gave it to me. I really like it.
