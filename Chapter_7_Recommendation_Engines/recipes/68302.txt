Ingredients:
1 (14.5 ounce) can green beans, with liquid
1/4 cup white wine
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon minced garlic

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, place the green beans with liquid and wine. Cook until heated through; drain.
Place the cheese in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave on low or medium power in 1 minute intervals, until melted.
Scoop the melted cheese over the heated green beans, and season with minced garlic to serve.

Description: 
Extremely tasty side dish and a great way to get people to eat their beans! This recipe is so flexible. I've seen others add garlic powder, and some add the cooking wine to the cheese while microwaving, using less white wine.
