Ingredients:
oil for deep frying
1/4 cup brown sugar, or as needed
6 large bananas, halved crosswise and then lengthwise
24 lumpia wrappers, defrosted
1 tablespoon water, or as needed

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place brown sugar in a shallow bowl. Roll each banana quarter in the brown sugar until coated. Wrap a lumpia wrapper around each coated banana, sealing the last edge to the roll using a spoon or your finger dipped in water. Repeat with the remaining bananas and wrappers.
Working in batches, fry lumpia in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer cooked lumpia to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Some sugar may leak out the sides of the lumpia while cooling.

Description: 
Simple, deep-fried banana dessert. I'm unsure of cooking time because I've never timed myself. 

I use frozen lumpia wrappers I find at my local Asian store. P.S. This is great with ice cream.
