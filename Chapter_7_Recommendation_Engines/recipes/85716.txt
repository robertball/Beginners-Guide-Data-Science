Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) packages orange flavored Jell-OÂ® mix
4 cups boiling water
1 (16 ounce) package graham crackers
2 (8 ounce) cans crushed pineapple
1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Pour the gelatin mix into a large bowl, and stir in the boiling water until the gelatin has dissolved. Refrigerate until set, about 3 hours.
Make a layer of graham crackers in the bottom of a glass 9x13 inch baking dish. Spoon a layer of gelatin over the graham crackers, and top with a layer of crushed pineapple. Cover with a layer of whipped topping. Repeat the layers all the way to the top of the pan, ending with whipped topping on top. Refrigerate for a few hours before serving to let the graham crackers absorb the flavors of orange and pineapple.
