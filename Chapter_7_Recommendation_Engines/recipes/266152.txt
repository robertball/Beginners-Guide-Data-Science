Ingredients:
extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
2 pounds eggplants, sliced
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
salt to taste
7 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1/3 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and brush with olive oil.
Brush eggplant slices on both sides with olive oil and place on the baking tray in a single layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until soft and browned, about 20 minutes, turning slices over once after 10 minutes. Transfer slices to a large serving place, brush with vinegar, and sprinkle with salt. Let cool.
Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat and cook garlic until softened and fragrant without browning, about 3 minutes.
Mix parsley and walnuts in a bowl. Add sauteed garlic and a little bit of olive oil to make a paste. Mix well, season with salt, and spread the paste onto the cooled eggplant slices.

Description: 
This Turkish meze is perfect for making ahead of time when you expect guests. The eggplant may also be pan fried,  but it requires less oil and tastes better when roasted in the oven.
