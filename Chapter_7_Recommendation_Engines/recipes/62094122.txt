Description: 
This is an authentic English recipe which is great for using leftovers from roast dinners. Its traditionally eaten the day after christmas day with cold meats such as ham, turkey and beef, with chutneys and pickles. However, it goes as a side dish with lots of things! The ingredients are approximate, and you can change the green vegetable mix according to what you have left over. 

This recipe uses metric measurements.
