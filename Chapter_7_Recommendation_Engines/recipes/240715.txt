3 cups cubed, cooked chicken breast
3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir the soup with the yogurt, mayonnaise and curry powder (if using) in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in the noodles, broccoli and chicken until well coated.
Transfer the noodle mixture to a greased 9 x 13-inch (3.5 L) casserole dish. Toss the breadcrumbs with the cheese and oil. Sprinkle evenly over the noodle mixture.
Bake, covered, for 40 minutes or until hot and bubbly. Uncover and broil the top to brown the crumbs (if desired).
