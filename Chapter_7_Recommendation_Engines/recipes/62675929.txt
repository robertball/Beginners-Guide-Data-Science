Ingredients:
1 cup butter - softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla
2 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 pkgs. (3-1/2 oz each)Cook & Serve butterscotch pudding mix
2 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp baking powder

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream the butter and the brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in vanilla and eggs. In another bowl combine the flour, pudding mixes, ginger, cinnamon and baking powder; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or until easy to handle.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4 inch thick. Cut with floured cookie cutters. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.
Bake at 350 for 6 -8 minutes or until firm (color of dough doesn't change much so be careful not to over-cook). Remove to wire racks to cool.  Decorate as desired - a royal icing works well with these cookies.

Soft butterscotch cookie with a hint of ginger & cinnamon. Great cookies for kids, as it isn't overly sweet, and they can help make them.
