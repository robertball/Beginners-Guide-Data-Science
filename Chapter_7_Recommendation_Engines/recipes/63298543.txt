Ingredients:
8 oz cream cheese, softened
2 (3.5 oz) packages instant pudding mix
3/4 cup milk
12 oz Cool Whip, thawed

Directions:
Mix together cream cheese and dry pudding mix on medium speed.
Add the milk and beat on medium a minute or two, or until lumps have smoothed out.Fold in (or mix on low) the Cool Whip
Chill a couple of hours before using.
If you are filling a cake with this, be sure to pipe a perimeter of buttercream icing to act as a dam for the filling not to ooze out.

Description: 
A quick, fail proof way to a DELICIOUS Bavarian Cream filling for cakes, cream puffs, or eclairs. Use any flavor pudding you’d like (I’ve only used vanilla). This should be enough to fill one 2-layer cake or about 24 cream puffs.
