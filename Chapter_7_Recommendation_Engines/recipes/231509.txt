Description: 
When I make this soup, I always get rave reviews. The tarragon gives it a special taste. Tastes great the next day for leftovers! To be honest I don't measure the ingredients when I make this recipe, so this is my best guess at how much of each I use. This makes a very thick soup, with a bite of something in every spoonful. If too thick, add more water or chicken broth.
