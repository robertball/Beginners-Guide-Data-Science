Ingredients:
4 large red onions, unpeeled
1 cup mascarpone cheese
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 shallot, diced
1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Cut both ends off onions and place onto a baking sheet. Roast in preheated oven until centers are soft, about 15 minutes. Remove, and let onions cool.
Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Peel onions and remove center core leaving 1/2 inch outer shell intact. Mince the center flesh and place in a bowl. Combine with mascarpone cheese, garlic, shallot, and thyme. Fill onion shells with cheese mixture and replace onto baking sheet.
Bake until the surface of the cheese bubbles, about 10 minutes. Serve hot.
