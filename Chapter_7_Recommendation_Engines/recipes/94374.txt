Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 cups Arborio rice
4 cups boiling vegetable broth
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 medium leek, chopped
1 fresh red chile pepper, chopped
1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 pound small scallops
1 (14 ounce) bag fresh spinach leaves
1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large, heavy bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat.  Pour in the rice, and stir until the rice is coated in oil and has started to toast, 2 to 3 minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium and stir in one-third of the boiling vegetable broth; continue stirring until incorporated.  Repeat this process twice more, stirring constantly.  Incorporating the broth should take 15 to 20 minutes in all.
While you are cooking the rice, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a pan.  Stir in the garlic, leeks, red chili, shrimp, and scallops.  Cook until the seafood is just beginning to turn color.  Add the red bell pepper and spinach; cook until the seafood is opaque.  Combine with the rice, and season to taste with pepper.
