Ingredients:
6 ounces ground beef
4 drops Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
3 pinches garlic powder
freshly ground black pepper to taste
kosher salt to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 slice Cheddar cheese
1 hamburger bun, split
1 slice tomato
1 leaf lettuce

Directions:
Divide beef into two 3-ounce balls. Lightly moisten fingertips with water and press beef into patties about 1/4-inch thick. Drop Worcestershire sauce over patties; rub in lightly. Sprinkle garlic powder, black pepper, salt, and cayenne on top and rub in.
Cut a circle of cheese using a pastry cutter or the rim of a glass. Place cheese onto 1 patty; cover with the other patty. Press edges together carefully. Flip and continue pressing until fully sealed. Season both sides with a little salt.
Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patty for 5 minutes per side for medium doneness. Place patty on one half of a bun. Top with tomato, lettuce, and the other half of the bun.

Description: 
This isn't just any old cheeseburger. Depending on whom you talk to, this cheese-stuffed burger is either called a Juicy Lucy, or a Jucy Lucy. That's because two restaurants in Minneapolis claim to have invented it, and they spell it differently. Make sure you thoroughly and thoughtfully press the edges of the two patties together to seal in the cheese stuffing, which keeps the meat juicier. Spread your favorite burger sauce over the bun.
