Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons almond extract
3/4 cup whole milk
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
5 maraschino cherries
1/2 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 cupcake cups with paper liners. In a bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder.
In a mixing bowl, thoroughly cream together the sugar and 1/2 cup of butter until very well blended. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until thoroughly combined, and stir in the mayonnaise, vanilla and almond extracts. Gradually beat in the flour mixture, alternating with the milk, in several additions. Spoon the batter into the prepared cupcake cups, filling them about 2/3 full.
Bake the cupcakes in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
To make icing, cream butter and sugar, add a little juice from cherries to add color and flavor, along with vanilla extract. Chop cherries into little pieces and blend into icing. Cool cupcakes completely before icing.
