Ingredients:
2lbs lean ground beef
1/2 cup (heaping) Italian style bread crumbs
1/4 cup finely chopped onion or 1/4cup minced onion
1/4 cup Ketchup
1 egg slightly beaten
1/2 tsp oregano
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
2 lg cloves of garlic minced
1 cup of pasta sauce
1-1/2 to 2 cups of mozzarella cheese (depending on desired taste)

Directions:
1. In a large bowel, mix all ingredients together except for cheese. Mix with hands to blend all ingredients and do not over mix.
2. Divide meat in half. Place 1/2 of the meat mixture in the bottom of a loaf pan. Lay the cheese on top of meat. Put the remaining meat on top of cheese. Seal the edges on all sides so the cheese does not seep out.
3. Bake at 350 for 1 hour or until meat reaches 160 degrees

Description: 
A personal favorite of mine. I never liked a meatloaf much so I decided to come up with my own recipe. I hope your family enjoys it as much as mine does.
