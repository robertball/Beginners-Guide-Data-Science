Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat elbow macaroni
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
2 green bell peppers, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste
2 teaspoons chili powder, or more to taste
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (15 ounce) can white kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (12 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
3/4 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons chopped green onion, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green bell peppers, and garlic in the hot oil until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Mix tomatoes and their juices, tomato sauce, hot pepper sauce, chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, and black pepper into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Add kidney beans, black beans, and corn; reduce heat to low, cover skillet, and simmer chili for 30 minutes.
Stir macaroni into chili, cover skillet, and simmer until macaroni is heated, 5 minutes; top with Cheddar cheese and green onions to serve.
