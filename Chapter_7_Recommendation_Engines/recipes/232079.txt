Ingredients:
2 egg whites
1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups panko bread crumbs
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
1/8 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 pound fresh asparagus spears, trimmed
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more if needed
1/2 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Set a cooking rack over a baking sheet.
Whisk egg whites, mayonnaise, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Mix panko crumbs, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and lemon peel together in a shallow bowl or on a piece of waxed paper.
Dip each asparagus spear into egg white mixture, then press into crumb mixture to coat. Place coated spears on prepared rack; drizzle with olive oil.
Bake asparagus in the preheated oven until coating is browned and crisp, 15 to 17 minutes. Squeeze lemon juice over asparagus and serve immediately.
