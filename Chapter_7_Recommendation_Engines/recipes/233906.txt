Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic cloves, minced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into 2-inch cubes
12 ounces sliced white mushrooms
1 cup Marsala wine
2 tablespoons water (optional)
1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley for garnish

Directions:
Stir olive oil and garlic into the bowl of a slow cooker.
Mix flour, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Pour flour mixture into a large resealable plastic bag; add chicken to bag, seal, and shake to coat chicken with flour mixture. Pour coated chicken and sliced mushrooms into slow cooker.
Heat Marsala wine in a small frying pan over medium-high heat until reduced, 2 to 3 minutes; pour into slow cooker and cover.
Cook in slow cooker set to Low until sauce thickens and chicken is cooked through, 4 to 5 hours. If sauce is too thin, mix water and cornstarch together in a small bowl and pour slowly into chicken mixture. Cook in slow cooker set to High until thickened, 15 minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste, garnish with parsley, and serve.

Description: 
I use boneless chicken breast for this healthy, flavorful dish. Serve over rice or potatoes to soak up all the delicious sauce! I like to serve this with rice and sauteed spinach. If you're cooking for two, you might be tempted to halve the recipe, but don't; you'll be happy to have leftovers!
