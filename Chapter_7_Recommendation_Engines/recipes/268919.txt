Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, softened
2 acorn squash, halved and seeded
2 cups cubed cooked turkey
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
1 (2.5 ounce) can sliced ripe olives, drained
1 teaspoon garlic salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.
Slice a small disc off the bottom of each squash half; this will give you a flat surface for serving. Brush butter over the flesh. Place squash cut-sides down on the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender when pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes.
While squash is baking, mix turkey, Cheddar cheese, sour cream, green onions, green chiles, olives, garlic salt, cumin, pepper, and paprika in a bowl. Set aside.
Stuff cooked squash halves with equal amounts of the turkey filling.
Return to the oven and bake until filling is heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.
