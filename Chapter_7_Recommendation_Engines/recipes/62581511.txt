Ingredients:
DOUGH:
2 cups Water (lukewarm)
1 pkg Yeast
1/2 cup Sugar
1.5 tsp Salt
1/4 cup Shortening
1 Egg
6 cups Flour (sifted)
CINNAMON FILLING:
1/2 cup Butter, melted or softened
1/2 cup Firmly-packed brown sugar
1/2 cup White sugar
4 tablespoons Ground cinnamon
Pinch of ground cloves

Directions:
Night Before:
Dissolve yeast in water for 5 minutes.
Mix yeast mixture, sugar, salt & shortening.
Stir in egg.
Mix in 3 cups flour.
Add remaining flour.
Put in well greased bowl and cover.
Put in refrigerator to rise over night.
Morning:
Roll out on floured board.
Spread the softened butter over the surface of the dough, leaving a 1-inch strip along the long edge of the rectangle furthest away from you completely dry.
Generously sprinkle cinnamon-sugar over the butter, spreading the mixture evenly across the whole sheet of dough. Leave the 1-inch border free of sugar.
Roll up and cut 1" thick and put in greased pan.
Let rise until double.
Bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes.
Drizzle with a cream cheese frosting while rolls are still hot.
