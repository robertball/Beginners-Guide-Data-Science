Ingredients:
8 eggs
2/3 cup milk
1/2 cup Pina Colada drink mix
12 - 1/2 inch slices of French Bread
Butter (or margarine)
2 bananas, sliced

Directions:
Preheat frying pan over medium heat.
Whisk together the first 3 ingredients.
Melt a generous pat of butter to the pan.
Soak the sliced bread 2 slices at a time turning over a couple of times.
Gently place the saturated bread slices into the frying pan.
Cook for 2 to 3 minutes each side, watching carefully as the sugar in the drink mix can burn quickly.
When golden brown remove the cooked French Toasts to a warmed platter; repeat with the remaining Bread slices.
Top with sliced bananas and serve with maple syrup.

Description: 
With just a few ingredients and little effort this recipe makes a great summer breakfast. I created it while on holidays in Maui while making French Toast for breakfast. I noticed the drink mix sitting on the counter from the night before and inspiration struck.
