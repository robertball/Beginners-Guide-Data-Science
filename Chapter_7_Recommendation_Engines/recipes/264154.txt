Ingredients:
1 avocado, mashed
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 tablespoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups quick-cooking oats
1 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Beat avocado and sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and mostly smooth. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Stir in vanilla extract.
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Stir into the avocado mixture until well blended. Mix in oats until combined. Fold in chocolate chips and raisins. Spoon cookie-sized portions of dough onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 12 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
