Ingredients:
1/4 cup avocado oil
1/2 cup butter
3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
2 zucchini
1 large head broccoli, broken into florets
10 mushrooms, stemmed and sliced, or more to taste
6 mini bell peppers, sliced
15 leaves basil, or to taste, divided
1 large tomato, diced
1/4 cup tomato sauce
1/2 teaspoon oregano, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
10 slices fresh mozzarella cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with avocado oil.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat, about 2 minutes. Stir in garlic.
Cut zucchini into noodle shapes with a spiralizer.
Combine zucchini noodles, broccoli, mushrooms, bell peppers, and half of the basil leaves in a large bowl. Stir in butter mixture until well combined.
Pour vegetable mixture into the prepared baking pan; layer on tomatoes. Top with tomato sauce, oregano, salt, and pepper. Arrange remaining basil leaves in the pan; layer on mozzarella cheese. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is just melted, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil with an oven mitt or heatproof gloves. Continue baking until vegetables are tender and cheese is bubbly, 15 to 30 minutes more.

Description: 
Zoodles and broccoli mixed with mushrooms, peppers, and other yummy vegetables topped with fresh mozzarella cheese and then baked altogether create a wonderful veggie casserole that is just busting with flavor. This dish was a little soupy; I just served it using a slotted spoon and it worked perfectly.
