Ingredients:
2 cups biscuit mix
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2/3 cup milk
1 egg
1/3 cup melted butter
8 oz. cream cheese
2/3 cup powdered sugar
1/4 cup strawberry preserves
1/2 cup biscuit mix
2 tbsp. granulated sugar
2 tbsp. butter
1/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Cream the cream cheese and powdered sugar and put into log shape on plastic wrap and place in freezer.  Place strawberry preserves in a custard cup and put in freezer as well (this keeps the fillings from melting as much when muffins are being baked.
In a small bowl put 1/2 cup biscuit mix, 2 tbsp. sugar and butter.  Cut with two knives until butter is size of little peas.  Set aside in fridge.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Mix the first five ingredients with wire whisk.  Line 6 texas size muffin tin with muffin papers.  Using an ice cream scoop place muffin batter in each until half full.  Evenly place spoonfuls of preserves in each muffin.  Cut off chunks of cream cheese and place on preserves.  Cover each muffin with remaining batter.  Sprinkle tops of each batter with chopped pecans and crumb mixture.
