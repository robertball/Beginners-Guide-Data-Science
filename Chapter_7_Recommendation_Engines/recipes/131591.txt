Ingredients:
1 cup whole cranberries
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
1 tablespoon orange zest
2 tablespoons white sugar
3/4 cup cashew halves
6 cups chopped cooked turkey
2 celery ribs, diced
3/4 cup mayonnaise, or to taste
2 tablespoons applesauce
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground dried sage
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil.
Place the cranberries, orange juice, orange zest, and sugar into a pan. Bring to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost all the liquid has cooked away, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, and cool.
Place cashews on prepared baking pan. Roast in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove, and cool.
Mix the turkey together in a large bowl with the celery, mayonnaise, applesauce, salt, sage, thyme, and pepper until evenly blended. Fold in the cranberry mixture. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.

Description: 
I created this recipe to use leftover holiday turkey. It's a classic bound salad using mayonnaise and celery, but it also includes fresh cranberries, orange juice and cashews. Although new to our menu, it has become a holiday favorite. My family requests I make my own turkey before Thanksgiving so I can serve this salad as an appetizer at our holiday feast. I hope you will find it as enjoyable as we do. Enjoy it on rolls, in wraps, or as a spread with crackers.
