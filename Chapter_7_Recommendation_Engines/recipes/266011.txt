Ingredients:
3 tablespoons ground New Mexico chile
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon dried Mexican oregano
1 tablespoon water
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 3/4 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon cumin seeds, crushed
3/4 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound ground pork, well chilled

Directions:
Combine chile powder, vinegar, oregano, water, garlic, salt, red pepper flakes, cumin seeds, sugar, and pepper in a small bowl. Mix until the salt and sugar are dissolved in the liquids.
Break up pork in a bowl. Pour in spice mixture and knead thoroughly. Use immediately or refrigerate to let flavors meld, 8 hours to overnight.
Cook and stir in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
I love the flavor of chorizo but cannot stomach the thought of the variety meats traditionally used to make it.

 This is an authentic chorizo from the Mexican state of Sonora. I obtained the recipe from a gentleman named Bruce Moffitt and have since modified it slightly.
