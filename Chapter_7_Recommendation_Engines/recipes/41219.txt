3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup beer
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

In a large bowl, beat together the eggs and beer. Sift together the flour and salt, and mix in. Beat in oil. Allow to stand for 1 hour. If batter is too thick, stir in a little milk.
Heat a crepe pan over medium heat, and lightly coat with cooking spray. Pour on 2 tablespoons batter, and quickly spread to the edges of pan. Cook until top appears dry, then turn, and cook for 15 seconds. Set aside on paper towels and repeat cooking method until all batter is used.
