3 green onions
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 carrot, diced
½ cup diced sweet red pepper
4 cups cold cooked rice
¼ cup water
1 pkg. frozen small cooked shrimp, thawed
1 cup frozen peas, thawed

In wok or large non-stick skillet, toast sesame seeds over medium heat, stirring until golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer to small bowl; set aside.
In separate bowl, whisk eggs, sesame oil and ¼ tsp. of the salt. In wok, heat 1 Tbsp. of the vegetable oil over medium heat, swirling to coat. Pour in egg mixture; cook until beginning to set.
