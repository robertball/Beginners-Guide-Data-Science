Ingredients:
1 can chunk chicken breast, drained or cooked chicken
red grapes, halved
onions, chopped OR green onions, sliced
celery, sliced
slivered almonds, toasted

Directions:
I like equal amounts of grapes and chicken with half as much onions, celery and almonds. Stir in mayo until moistened. season with celery salt.
I like mine on crackers but others like it on croissants or bread.
