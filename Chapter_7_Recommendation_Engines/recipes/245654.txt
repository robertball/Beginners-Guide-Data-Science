Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking soda
2 eggs
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup apple cider
Topping:
2 cups whipped cream
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups.
Combine flour and baking soda together in a large bowl. Whisk eggs, butter, and apple cider together in a small bowl. Pour egg mixture over flour mixture and mix until smooth batter forms.
Scoop batter into muffin cups, filling each 2/3 of the way full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes.
Frost muffins with whipped cream. Sprinkle cinnamon on top.
