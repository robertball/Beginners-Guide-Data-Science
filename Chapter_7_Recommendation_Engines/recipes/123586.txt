Description: 
THIS RECIPE has been in our family for 40 years! My four kids loved this dish growing up, and it's still their number one request when they come to dinner.    My husband's pet name for this is 'great wads of dough'...but he eats every bit on his plate. -Kathryn Burris, Mariposa, California
