Ingredients:
2 cups dry green lentils
3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
3 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
1/2 tsp maple syrup
1/2 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp ground sea salt
1 tsp ground pepper
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp ground cardamom
1/4 tsp ground coriander
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
1/8 tsp ground cinnamon
1/8 tsp ground cloves
1/8 tsp ground nutmeg
1/8 tsp ground allspice
1 small red onion
1/2 cup dried cranberries
3 Tbsp capers
4 medium carrots

Directions:
In a colander, rinse the lentils thoroughly and drain them. Place the lentils in a pan, cover them with approximately 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and allow the lentils to cook for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Ensure the lentils are not overcooked or soggy.
While the lentils are cooking, finely dice the onion, cranberries and carrots to roughly the same size. Set the diced ingredients aside in a large bowl along with the capers.
Prepare the dressing in a separate bowl by whisking together the oil, vinegar, syrup, mustard, salt, pepper and spices.
Once the lentils are cooked but still retain a slight bite, remove the pan from the hob, drain the lentils and rinse them under cold water to prevent further cooking. Drain them again and allow the lentils to cool for an additional 5 minutes.
Pour the cooled lentils into the bowl containing the diced onion, cranberries, carrots and capers. Pour the dressing over the vegetable mixture and stir to ensure all the ingredients are coated.
