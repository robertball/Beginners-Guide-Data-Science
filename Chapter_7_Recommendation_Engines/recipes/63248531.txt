Ingredients:
2 tsp olive oil
Approximately 3.5 lbs Round Beef Roast (can use bottom or top round)
2 medium onions, sliced into thin strips
1lbs carrots, peeled and cut into 1inch sections
3 stalks celery, cut into 2inch pieces
1 8oz. can tomato sauce
1 cup water (can just use empty tomato sauce can to measure)
1/2 tsp salt
1/8 tsp pepper
Flour (for gravy)
1 package egg noodles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Farenheit.
In dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium and brown meat on all sides.  Remove meat from pan and set aside.
Cook onions in oil and beef juice until golden brown and clear.  Remove from heat.
Season each side of the beef with the salt and pepper.
Push onions to one side and place meat in pan directly on bottom of pot.  The side with the fat on it should be on top.  Spoon onions over meat and push up around the meat.  Place carrots and celery in bottom of pot around the beef.  Pour tomato sauce over top of meat.  Pour water gently into side of pot (not on top of beef).
Cover pot with lid or foil and bake at 350 degrees Farenheit for at least 2.5 hours.  It is better to cook at least 3 hours, but check after 2.5 hours to make sure there is still moisture in bottom of pot and beef is not burning.
When meat is done, remove from pot and set on serving platter.  Remove vegetables, leaving the liquid in the pot, and set aside vegetables.
Boil water and cook egg noodles as directed.
While egg noodles are cooking, add flour to drippings to thicken and cook roux.  Then add water to desired consistency.
Serve meat and vegetables with egg noodles and gravy.
