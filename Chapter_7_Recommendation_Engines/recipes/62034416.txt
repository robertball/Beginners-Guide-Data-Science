Ingredients:
4-6 lbs roast [may use to to get 6 lbs]
[I like lean cuts such as Pikes peak
or Rump roast but you can use any
kind].
3  10 oz. cans mushroom soup
1  10 oz. can Campbells golden mush-
room soup
1  box 4.5 ounces dry onion soup
1  can Ro-tel tomatoes [slightly green
tomatoes with green chilies]
1  cup chopped green onions
2  tbsp worstershire sauce
1  tbsp garlic powder
1  tsp liquid smoke
1  tsp black pepper

Directions:
In a sixteen quart roaster, mix all the ingredients except the roast.  Dilute with water to the consistancy you prefer
your gravy. DO NOT ADD ANY SALT--the soups have a sufficient amount. Place the roast in the gravy mix and spoon some of it over the top of the roast.
Cover, and place in a 350 degree oven
for 1 1/2 hours.  Remove and turn roast.
Place back in oven for 1 hour.  Remove
the roast from the gravy to a carving
board and slice across the grain in 1/4
to 3/8 inch slices.  Place back in the
gravy, cover and cook 45 minutes to one
hour depending on how much roast you have.  Let cool down, and bag roast
and gravy together, removing as much
air as you can.  Will keep 6 months or
longer in the freezer.  Very good with
a baked potato and the gravy  goes good
with breads.

Description: 
This recipe is to feed a large group and
some of it can be frozen to use later.  It makes gravy from soups, so the end 
product is always the same.
