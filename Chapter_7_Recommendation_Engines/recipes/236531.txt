Ingredients:
4 slices marbled rye bread, divided
4 teaspoons softened salted butter, or as needed, divided
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, or to taste
4 slices shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
4 slices Swiss cheese (such as Lorraine(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1  tomato, thinly sliced
1  avocado - peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced

Directions:
Heat a cast-iron skillet or non-stick pan over high heat until skillet is warm; reduce heat to medium.
Arrange 2 bread slices in the hot skillet. Add 1 teaspoon butter under each slice in the skillet; flip bread so butter-side is face-up. Spread about 1 teaspoon mustard onto each bread slice; top with 1 slice Cheddar cheese, 1 slice Swiss cheese, tomato slices, and avocado slices. Top each avocado layer with 1 slice Cheddar cheese, 1 slice Swiss cheese, and 1 slice bread. Spread butter onto top piece of bread; flip sandwich and cook until cheeses are slightly melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Transfer sandwiches to a microwave-safe plate and heat in microwave until cheeses are fully melted, no longer than 30 seconds.

A grown-up gourmet grilled cheese! For meat-eaters, add crispy applewood bacon! My husband loves it! You can also use American cheese in place of sharp Cheddar cheese if desired. Enjoy!
