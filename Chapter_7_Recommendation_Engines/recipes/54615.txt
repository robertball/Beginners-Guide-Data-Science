Ingredients:
2 tablespoons margarine, softened
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1 (16 ounce) package shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend
1/2 cup pizza sauce
4 ounces sliced pepperoni

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Spread margarine over one side of a tortilla, and place it margarine-side down in the skillet. Spoon a tablespoon of pizza sauce onto half of the tortilla. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of shredded cheese over the sauce, and top with a few slices of pepperoni. Fold the clean half of the tortilla over the filling, and cook until golden on each side. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
