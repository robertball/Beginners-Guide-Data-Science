Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
3 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 cups finely chopped dates
1 cup finely chopped raisins
1 cup finely chopped walnuts
GLAZE:
2 cups confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, cloves and nutmeg; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in the dates, raisins and walnuts. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hour or until easy to handle.
On a  floured surface, roll out to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. round cookie cutter dipped in flour. Place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes.  Remove to wire racks.
Meanwhile, combine glaze ingredients; brush over warm cookies.
