Ingredients:
2 lemons, ends trimmed and sliced thickly
4 (6 ounce) fillets salmon
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
4 teaspoons butter
3 lemon slices, cut into quarters
1 tablespoon snipped fresh dill
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon dried chervil
1 dash cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Grill salmon and thick lemon slices on hot grill until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
Stir water, lemon juice, and cornstarch together in a small saucepan to dissolve the cornstarch; add butter and place over medium heat. Cook and stir the mixture until boiling and thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir quartered lemon slices, dill, salt, chervil, and cayenne pepper into the sauce. Serve with the grilled salmon and grilled lemon slices.
