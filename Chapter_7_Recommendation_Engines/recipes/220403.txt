Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package bow-tie pasta (farfalle)
8 ounces diced ham
1/2 cup thinly sliced celery
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil until cooked through yet tender, about 12 minutes; drain.
Rinse the pasta in cold water until completely chilled; drain. Transfer cool pasta to a large mixing bowl.
Toss the ham, celery, dried cranberries, and sliced almonds with the bow-tie pasta to mix evenly.
Stir the mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, and sugar together in a bowl.
Pour the mayonnaise dressing over the pasta mixture; toss to coat evenly.
