Description: 
This is not your traditional horchata recipe by any means. Our family was craving horchata so I searched this site for recipes but they were all so labor intensive. I was inspired to create an easy version and I think I succeeded. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do! It's like heaven in a glass - so sweet and creamy that it could even be served as a dessert! This is more of a Spanish version with the almond flavoring. K
