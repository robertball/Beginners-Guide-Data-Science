Ingredients:
1 tsp. toasted sesame oil
3 slices thick-cut bacon, thinly sliced
1/2 tsp. sugar
1 TBS. low-sodium soy sauce
6 large eggs
Kosher salt
1/2 pint grape tomatoes, halved
1 Tbs. minced peeled ginger
6 Oz. snow peas, trimmed and halved
1 orange,yellow, or red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced
4 C. cooked brown or white rice

Directions:
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the sesame oil and bacon; cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon is almost crisp,4 minutes. Add the sugar and 1 teaspoon soy sauce; stir-fry until the bacon is glazed, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl using a slotted spoon; reserve the drippings in a separate bowl. Wipe the skillet.
Heat 2 tsp. of the drippings in the skillet over medium heat. Whisk the eggs and 1/2 tsp. salt in a medium bowl; add to the skillet, and cook, undisturbed, until just set, 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and break up eggs into large pieces.
Heat the remaining drippings in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tomatoes and ginger; stir-fry until the tomatoes are softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the snow peas, bell pepper, and scallions; stir-fry until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and the remaining 2 tsp. soy sauce; stir-fry until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Stir in eggs and cook 1 minute. Top with the bacon,
