Description: 
An oldie but A goodies, when I was in the army stationed in Korea there were Koreans that followed us around the country, and they cooked Korean dishes in the field for us. One of these dishes was Ramen, And hot dogs with cheese. This will not be served at your favorite restaurant but it is quick and easy, And it tastes good. If you don't like Ramen noodles you can use a higher grade noodle and your own broth\stock.
