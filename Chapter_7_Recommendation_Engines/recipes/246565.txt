Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 red onion, coarsely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups vegetable broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes
1 1/4 cups red lentils, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup uncooked brown rice
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 tablespoon dried celery flakes
1 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in broth, diced tomatoes, red lentils, brown rice, Italian seasoning, celery flakes, white pepper, and marjoram. Bring soup to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until lentils break down and rice is tender, about 55 minutes.
Stir balsamic vinegar into the soup just before serving.

Description: 
Red lentils and brown rice make for a thick vegetarian soup that's full of fiber, filling you up quickly. I came up with this when I only had a few ingredients to work with while in the mood for lentil soup. Top with Parmesan cheese, if desired. Enjoy.
