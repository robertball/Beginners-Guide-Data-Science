Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds fresh thin asparagus, trimmed
1/4 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 pinch sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup ricotta cheese
2 1/2 tablespoons lemon zest
1 pinch sea salt

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Blanch asparagus until tender, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove asparagus immediately and place in a bowl of ice water so it remains a bright green color. Drain in a colander and place in a large bowl with olive oil and lemon juice. Season with sea salt and pepper; toss until well combined.
Combine ricotta, 2 tablespoons lemon zest, and remaining pinch of sea salt in a bowl; mix until well combined.
Arrange asparagus on one side of a serving platter and smear ricotta on the other side. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 tablespoon lemon zest.

Description: 
This asparagus has very delicate flavors, the earthy but slightly grassy taste of the asparagus complements the creamy, lemony taste of the ricotta beautifully.
