Ingredients:
1 egg, beaten
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 quart vegetable oil
12 ounces pasta sauce
4 slices mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Pour beaten egg and buttermilk into plastic zipper bag with chicken and marinate for at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In another plastic zipper bag, mix together the dry ingredients.
Place two chicken breasts into dry mix and shake to coat, remove and repeat with next two breasts.
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Add coated chicken and saute for about 8 to 10 minutes each side, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
Place chicken into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.
Add chicken and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.
Place a spoonful of sauce and a slice of mozzarella over each piece of chicken and return to bake for another 5 minutes or until cheese is melted.
Serve over pasta and sauce.
