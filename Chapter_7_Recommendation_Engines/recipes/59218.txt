Ingredients:
1 cup dry jasmine rice
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 cups broccoli florets
1 cup cauliflower florets
5 green onions, chopped
1 (10 ounce) package shredded carrots
3 cups shredded cabbage
1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained
1/4 cup soy sauce, or to taste
1/4 cup water as needed
chili sauce (optional)

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Stir in rice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook garlic and rice in oil for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently to avoid burning the garlic. Add broccoli and cauliflower florets and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes. Toss green onions, carrots, cabbage, and water chestnuts into the pan, and cook another 5 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. Add additional water as needed to keep vegetables moist. Drizzle with soy sauce, and toss to coat.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe when I was craving fried rice and needed something lower in fat.  The cabbage blends in with the rice so that even your kids won't know they are eating a vegetable. My husband likes to eat this for a late dinner because it's so light. Be creative or use whatever is in your fridge. Like it Spicy? Add some chili sauce. This dish goes great with baked spring rolls!
