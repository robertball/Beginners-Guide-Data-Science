Ingredients:
1 cup orzo pasta
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed
4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon Greek seasoning, or to taste
2 cups fresh spinach
1 cucumber, cubed
1 tomato, cubed
1 (15 ounce) can large black olives, drained
2 tablespoons sun-dried tomato vinaigrette
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken, garlic, and Greek seasoning until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 10 minutes. Add spinach, cucumber, tomato, olives, and vinaigrette; lower heat and simmer until spinach begins to wilt, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve over orzo; top with feta cheese.
