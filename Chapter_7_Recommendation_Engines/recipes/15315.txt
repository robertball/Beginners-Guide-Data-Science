Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup rolled oats
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/8 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until smooth. Stir in the egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, rolled oats, baking soda and salt, stir into the creamed mixture. Then stir in the chocolate chips. Fold the cocoa powder in slightly, to create a marbled effect.
Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheet before removing to cool on wire racks. Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
I invented this recipe one day after getting bored of plain chocolate chip. You can leave out the chocolate chips to have just a marble cookie, or add 1/2 cup of peanut butter for an interesting flavor.
