Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon butter
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups peeled and cubed yellow squash
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/3 cup finely chopped raw almonds
1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, divided
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
2 eggs
1/3 cup coarsely chopped roasted, salted almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil-butter mixture until softened, about 3 minutes. Add squash, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Cover skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until squash is softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer squash mixture to a large bowl.
Mix raw almonds and 1/2 cup Colby-Monterey Jack cheese together in a bowl; stir into squash mixture. Whisk cream and eggs together in a measuring cup or small bowl; stir into squash mixture. Pour squash mixture into a 9x13-inch casserole dish; top with remaining Colby-Monterey Jack cheese and roasted almonds.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is golden brown and bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe was created to use up a large amount of squash we were given. We modified an existing recipe, swapping almonds for crackers and whole cream for milk. It satisfies my husband's diet and tastes great!
