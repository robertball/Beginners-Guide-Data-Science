Ingredients:
1/2 cup coarsely ground coffee beans
4 cups water, divided
1 cup white sugar
ice cubes

Directions:
Place coffee beans in a French press or large measuring cup; pour in 2 cups water. Let coffee steep, 8 hours to overnight.
Combine remaining 2 cups water and sugar in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Simmer until sugar dissolves, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour syrup into a container and transfer to the refrigerator.
Strain coffee using the French press plunger or through a coffee filter in a fine-mesh strainer. Pour 1/2 cup coffee into a glass of ice; sweeten with simple syrup.

Description: 
I'm relatively new to coffee drinking, but have graduated from instant to actual brewed liquid energy. I was intrigued when I read about cold brewing and how it can make a smoother beverage with more kick. So I gave it a try and I am a convert. Any leftovers can be stored in the fridge, or made into ice cubes.
