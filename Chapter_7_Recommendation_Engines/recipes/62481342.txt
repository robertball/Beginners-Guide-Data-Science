Ingredients:
1 pkg strawberry cake mix
2 cups sour cream
3 eggs
1/4 cup water
1/3 cup strawberry preserves
Frosting of your choice
Red food coloring (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Combine cake mix, sour cream, eggs, and water. Stir until well blended.
Use a small spoon (or ice cream scoop) to fill cups half-way with batter.
Make a slight indentation in center of each cup (a tsp works perfectly) and add about 1/2 to 1 tsp of strawberry preserves.
Spoon remaining batter evenly over each cup, covering preserves, until 3/4 full.
Cake in oven 25-30 minutes.
Let cool completely, then frost (I used cream cheese frosting), adding 1-2 drops food coloring to white icing for a powder pink tint.
