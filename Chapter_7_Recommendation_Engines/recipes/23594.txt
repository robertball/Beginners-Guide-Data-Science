Ingredients:
2 cups mixed nuts
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 pinch ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Place the nuts on a large baking pan and bake in the preheated oven 10 to 12 minutes, taking care they do not burn. Remove from heat and let cool approximately 5 minutes.
In a small bowl, mix the white sugar, brown sugar, salt, pepper, cumin, curry powder, cloves and cinnamon.
In a large saucepan over medium heat, place the nuts and approximately 1/2 the sugar mixture. When the mixture begins to melt, mix in the remaining mixture. Shake the pan until all the nuts are coated, about 5 minutes. Use a spoon to separate nuts that stick together. Remove from heat and cool on a lightly greased baking sheet or wax paper. Separate the nuts to prevent sticking.

Description: 
The first time I made this I had a small tub of raw nuts in my cabinet and didn't know what to do with them.  My mom gave me the recipe, and after I made it I couldn't stop eating them.  I am not a nut person, but I am totally addicted to these coated nuts. They're perfect for parties and festive occasions!
