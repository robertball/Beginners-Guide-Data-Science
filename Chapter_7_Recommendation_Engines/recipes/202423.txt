Ingredients:
4 poblano peppers
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (12 ounce) package vegetarian burger crumbles
1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix
1/2 cup shredded pepperjack cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Slice the poblanos in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and stems. Place cleaned peppers in boiling water; cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Drain.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Stir in vegetarian crumbles and chili seasoning mix. Cook, stirring, until crumbles are hot, about 5 minutes. Fill the cooked peppers with the seasoned crumbles; top with pepperjack cheese. Arrange stuffed peppers on a baking sheet.
Place peppers in preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
