Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil
2 white onions, diced
8 cloves garlic, minced
1 (28 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup dry white wine
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3 bay leaves
1 cup freshly grated Pecorino-Romano cheese, divided
3/4 cup chopped fresh basil
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat; cook and stir onions for 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes more.
Mix petite diced tomatoes, diced tomatoes, white wine, tomato paste, oregano, salt, sugar, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and bay leaves into onion mixture; reduce heat to low, cover Dutch oven, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, about 1 hour.
Remove Dutch oven from heat. Add 1/2 cup Pecorino-Romano cheese, basil, and parsley into into sauce; stir until cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Sprinkle remaining cheese over sauce when serving.

Description: 
I've been perfecting this recipe for over 10 years. Melting just a little cheese in the sauce adds great richness without overwhelming the tomatoes. And it's easy to keep these ingredients stocked in the house! Makes for amazing leftovers!
