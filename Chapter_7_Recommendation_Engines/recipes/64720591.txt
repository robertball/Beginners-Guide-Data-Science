Ingredients:
2 tsp quick rising yeast
1 ½ tsp sugar
½ cup buttermilk
1 cup milk, divided
1¾ cups flour
½ tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda

Directions:
In a microwave safe bowl, heat buttermilk and 1/2 cup milk until around  100°. Sprinkle yeast and sugar over milk mixture, stir once and then leave in a warm place for 10 minutes until frothy.
Place flour and salt in a large bowl. Add yeast mixture and stir to combine to form a soft dough. Cover and place in a warm place for 40 minutes or until doubled in size.
Combine remaining 1/2 cup milk and baking soda. Stir mixture into dough until incorporated. Cover and leave for 30 minutes in a warm place.
Heat a cast iron pan or griddle over low heat. Spray crumpet rings and place into middle of frying pan. Fill each ring with ½ cup of crumpet mixture. Cook for 4 or 5 minutes until bubbles appear and the edges are starting to set. Remove from ring and cook top for 2 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack.
Serve with your choice of toppings, fruit spread and butter, double Devonshire cream, clotted cream, etc.,

Description: 
This is an American rendition of a British classic. Serve with your choice of savory or sweet toppings. I love using crumpets for a base for eggs Benedict.
If you have an instant pot you can use the yogurt setting and proof the dough much faster!
