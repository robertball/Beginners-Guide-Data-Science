Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 (4 pound) beef pot roast
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 onions, sliced
1 cup beer
1 cup beef stock
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat; brown the pot roast on all sides in the hot Dutch oven, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Mix the Dijon mustard, brown sugar, garlic, and nutmeg together in a small bowl; spread evenly over the browned pot roast. Layer the onion slices atop the pot roast. Pour the beer and beef stock over the pot roast; season with salt and black pepper. Cover the Dutch oven.
Roast in the preheated oven until completely tender, about 3 1/2 hours. Remove the cover from the Dutch oven during the final 20 minutes of cooking time. Transfer the roast to a platter, and cover with aluminum foil; allow to rest for 10 minutes.
While the meat rests, whisk the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl; stir the cornstarch slurry into the juices left in the Dutch oven. Place the Dutch oven over medium heat; bring the gravy to a low boil, and cook and stir until thickened. Serve on the side as gravy, or slice the beef and pour over the slices on a platter.
