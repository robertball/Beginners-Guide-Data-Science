Ingredients:
1 devil's food chocolate cake mix (such as Betty Crocker® Super Moist®)
1 1/4 cups water
3 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling
1 (4 ounce) bar dark chocolate

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans.
Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and continue to beat, scraping bowl occasionally, until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes. Divide batter between prepared pans.
Bake cakes in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans, about 5 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and cool completely, about 1 hour. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Beat heavy cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.
Cut each cake in half horizontally with a bread knife, to make 4 layers. Place one layer on a serving plate. Spread 1/4 of the whipped cream on top. Top with 1/3 of the cherry pie filling; spread evenly. Place second cake layer on top. Repeat layering whipped cream, cherry pie filling, and cake layers, ending with whipped cream on top.
Grate chocolate bar or shave into curls with a peeler; scatter on top of whipped cream.
Refrigerate cake until flavors combine, about 2 hours.

Description: 
After traveling to Germany and loving their Black Forest Cake, I came home wanting to recreate it with what I had at the time. I was 17 and could only purchase, not yet create, so here is what I did. To this day my son requests it for his birthday every year. Pie filling should ooze out - this is the art of the cake!
