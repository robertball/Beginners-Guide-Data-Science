Description: 
I wanted a very simple, basic basil or spinach pesto without all the 'extras,' so I created my own version. This is great as a spread or anywhere a pesto is called for. The basil and spinach are interchangeable for 2 kinds of pesto or they can be combined (half-and-half) for a great spinach-basil pesto!
