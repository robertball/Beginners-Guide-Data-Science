Description: 
This recipe, given to me years ago by a dear friend, is my husband's absolute favorite dip in the whole world. I've seen variations, but so far none with quite the same combination of ingredients. Over time, I've made a change or two to our taste as well. I like to serve this tangy dip with salty corn chip scoops.
