Description: 
Honey cake is a traditional recipe for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. This recipe was found by my husband's aunt on a hand-written note - we think it belonged to his great-grandmother. I think the old recipes are the best!  Some measurements have been converted from pounds for more modern conventions.
