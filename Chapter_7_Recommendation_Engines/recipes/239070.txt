Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package conchiglie(seashell) pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 large fennel bulb, cut into thin strips
1 zucchini, halved lengthwise and sliced
1 stalk celery with leaves, sliced
4 shallots, cut into thin strips
3 cloves garlic, sliced thin
1 red chile pepper, sliced thin
15 prawns, or more to taste, peeled and deveined
1 (14 ounce) can tomato puree
1 teaspoon fennel seed
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 minutes; drain, reserving 3 tablespoons of the water.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Saute fennel, zucchini, celery, shallots, garlic, and red pepper in hot oil until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes; add prawns and continue to cook until prawns have changed color, about 1 minute per side.
Pour tomato puree over the vegetables; add fennel seed and stir. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are slightly tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir reserved water from boiling the pasta into the sauce mixture. Season sauce with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour sauce and vegetable mixture over the drained pasta, add 1 tablespoon olive oil, and stir to coat.
