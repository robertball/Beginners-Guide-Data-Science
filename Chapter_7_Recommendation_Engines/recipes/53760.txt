1 pound fresh or frozen raspberries
6 tablespoons white sugar

4 egg yolks
6 tablespoons white sugar
1 pound mascarpone cheese
4 egg whites
6 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
12 ounces ladyfingers
4 ounces grated semisweet chocolate
3 tablespoons sliced almonds, toasted

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine raspberries with 6 tablespoons sugar. Crush a few of the berries; set aside. In a small bowl, dissolve 1 cup sugar in 1/3 cup hot water. When dissolved, stir in Grand Marnier and cold water; set aside.
Beat egg yolks with 6 tablespoons sugar until ribbons form, about 5 minutes. mix in mascarpone until smooth. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, with clean beaters, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add 6 tablespoons sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the mascarpone mixture, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain.
Brush ladyfingers on both sides with Grand Marnier syrup. Place on bottom and sides of a 9x13 inch glass baking dish. Spoon raspberries evenly over ladyfingers. Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the raspberries. Sprinkle chocolate shavings over cream, then cover with the remaining cream mixture. Top with toasted almonds. Cover with plastic, and refrigerate overnight.
