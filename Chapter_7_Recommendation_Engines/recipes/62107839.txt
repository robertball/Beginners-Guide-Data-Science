3 1/4 cups vegetable broth
1 medium zucchini

2 cups elbow macaroni
Crushed red pepper, to taste

Chop zucchini and squash into bite-sized chunks. Place onto a large piece of foil and wrap edges to make a pocket.
Add 1/4 cup vegetable broth to foil pocket.  Season veggies with crushed red pepper.  Warning: the broth and heat makes these veggies SPICY.  Use sparingly if you don't like hot food.
Close top of foil pocket and place veggies over the fire.
Heat the vegetable broth for about 5 minutes over the campfire, until hot.
Add pasta, let cook until ready, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
I make this soup while camping - it's simple and quick, and all it takes to make is a pot, foil, and a chopping knife.  Cook it right over the campfire!  You can substitute any veggies or spices you like, but these are my favorites.
