Ingredients:
3 lbs boneless pork shoulder or loin, cut into 1-inch cubes
1/2 cup flour, seasoned to taste with salt, pepper and garlic powder
Cooking oil
8 garlic cloves, minced
2 14 oz cans chicken broth
4 jalapeno peppers, chopped small
1 1/2 lbs tomatillos, husked, rinsed and coarsely chopped
1 sweet red bell pepper, chopped
2 large bunches scallions, chopped
2 14 oz cans pinto beans, drained and rinsed.
1 bunch cilantro chopped
2 Tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
1 tsp salt (or to taste)
ground black pepper to taste
For serving:  flour tortillas, grated cheddar cheese, sour cream

Directions:
Dredge the pork cubes in the flour.  In a Dutch oven, working in batches, brown the meat in the oil over high heat.  Do not let the fond burn. As each batch is finished, set it aside.  Lower the heat to medium.  Return all the meat to the pot, add half of the garlic, and cook, stirring for 1 minute, without browning.  Stir in the broth.  Bring to a boil.  Lower the heat, partially cover and simmer, stirring occasionally for 1 hour.  (check meat for tenderness, if it is still tough, simmer a bit longer)
Stir in the jalapenos, tomatillos, bell peppers, beans and scallions.  Simmer for 45 minutes, or until the tomatillos lose their texture.  Stir in the rest of the garlic and the cilantro.  Simmer for 5 minutes.  Season with lime juice, salt and pepper.
Serve with flour tortillas, sour cream and grated cheese.
