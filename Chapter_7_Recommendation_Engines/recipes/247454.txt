Ingredients:
2 whole graham crackers, broken into two square halves
1 (1.5 ounce) bar chocolate bar, halved
2 scoops ice cream (flavor of your choice)
Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil for the Grill

Directions:
Preheat the grill to medium heat.
Fold a sheet of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil for the Grill in half, making a rectangle about 8x11-inches, and place it onto the grill in the center.
Place 2 graham cracker squares onto the foil and place the chocolate squares on top.
Close the grill and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes until the chocolate has melted. Using a spatula, transfer the crackers to a plate.
Scoop some ice cream onto the crackers with chocolate, and then top with the other cracker squares. You can also serve these open faced by just using one graham cracker and melted chocolate with one scoop of ice cream. Serve immediately.
