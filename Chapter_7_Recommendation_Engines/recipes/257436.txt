Ingredients:
1 cup very warm water
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
2 teaspoons yeast
2 cups gluten-free flour blend
1/2 cup rice flour
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
3 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Whisk water and sugar together in a bowl. Whisk in yeast. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine gluten-free flour, rice flour, Italian seasoning, xanthan gum, gelatin, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Whisk vinegar and olive oil into the yeast mixture; pour over flour mixture. Mix on high speed until a wet, sticky dough forms, about 6 minutes.
Transfer dough to the prepared baking sheet. Lay another sheet of parchment paper on top; smooth out dough to fill the baking sheet. Let dough rest, about 10 minutes.
Bake in the preheated oven until dough puffs up, 5 to 10 minutes. Peel parchment paper off the top. Continue baking until dough is golden brown and edges are cooked through, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is for a crust that can be used for pizza or flatbreads. After 2 years of being GF, this is the best pizza crust/flatbread recipe I have. It is based on trial and error in an effort to improve other recipes. My kids say this is better than our homemade wheat flour crusts.
