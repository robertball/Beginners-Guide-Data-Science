Ingredients:
3 (6 ounce) containers plain yogurt
2 tablespoons active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water
4 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed, divided
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons salt
cold water as needed

Directions:
Heat yogurt in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave or on the stovetop until lukewarm.
Dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in yogurt, 2 cups flour, sugar, oil, and salt. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.
Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Place in a greased bowl and let rise in until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Shape dough into 8 loaves; brush each lightly with cold water. Cut 3 diagonal slashes across the top of each loaf with a sharp knife. Let rise until doubled in size, about 25 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Brush loaves with cold water.
Bake in the preheated oven until they sound hollow when tapped, 30 to 35 minutes, brushing with water twice during baking time.
