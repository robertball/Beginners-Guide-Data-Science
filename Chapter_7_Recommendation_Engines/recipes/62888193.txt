Ingredients:
12 Large Eggs
3/4 - 1 cup Miracle Whip
1 TBSP prepared Mustard
1/4 tsp Cumin
1/8 tsp paprika (I like using smoked sweet or smoked spicy)
Sweet Paprika to top

Directions:
Boil eggs in salted water.**SEE NOTES**
Cut eggs in half and place egg yolks in bowl and whites on a serving dish.
Place egg yolks into a food processor, processing them until yolks are finely cut.
Add Miracle Whip, mustard cumin and paprika, process until all ingredients are well blended.
Taste mixture and feel if the mixture is creamy on the tongue, if not add more Miracle Whip in tablespoonfuls until mixture is creamy.
Fill whites with mixture by teaspoonfuls.
Sprinkle completed eggs with paprika and refrigerate until ready to serve.
