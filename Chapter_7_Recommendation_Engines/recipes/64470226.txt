Ingredients:
16 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 stick of butter
454 g. regular sized marshmallows
3 splashes of heavy cream (roughly 6 Tbsp)
1 box of graham cracker crumbs
5 inches of sprinkles

Directions:
1. Melt the chocolate chips and butter together in the microwave on high for 60 seconds.
2. Stir until the chocolate chips are all melted. If you have to microwave it some more, go for it, but for 20 second intervals.
3. Stir the cream into the chocolate about 2 Tbsp at a time. You want your chocolate mixture to be liquid enough to easily cover the marshmallows, but not so runny that it drips right off.
4. Fill a shallow dish with graham crumbs. Fill another with sprinkles.
5. Dip the marshmallows in the chocolate mixture. When they're covered, remove them one at a time and roll them in either the graham cracker crumbs or the sprinkles. Congratulations, you have a mostly complete Dinomite Fluffy Bite!
6. Place Dinomite Fluffy Bites on a cookie sheet lined with parchment.
7. When you've coated all the marshmallows, put the entire tray (or trays) in the fridge to chill for one hour. Then enjoy!

This recipe was handed down to me by my beloved Glaswegian grandmother who, before she left the UK, cared for the Queen of England's private menagerie of Strange and Exotic hybrid creatures. This recipe was a favourite of the mysterious Dinomite for whom it is named.
