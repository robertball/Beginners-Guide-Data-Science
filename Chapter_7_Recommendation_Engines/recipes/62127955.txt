Ingredients:
5  med. apples   Granny Smith or Gala  peeled, core & sliced
1 1/4   cups sugar (if using Gala apples reduce the sugar to scant cup)
3   tsps. cinnamon
dash of cardamom (optional but I always use it)
3/4   cups butter or margarine
1   cup flour
1   egg slightly beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a pie pan or glass pie plate.
Peel, core and slice apples and fill pie plate 3/4 full with slices.
Mix only 1/4 cup of the sugar and the cinnamon and cardamom if used,  mix well and sprinkle over the apple slices.
In a small saucepan melt butter and remove from heat.  Add balance of sugar, flour and egg.  Stir to mix well.  Pour over apples .  Bake for 45 mins.
Note*
The crust forms and goes through the pie, it's really a unique pastry.  Serve hot ice cream  if you desire, it's delicious cold too.
I use a 9 inch pie plate or quiche dish.

Description: 
You won't believe how easy this is and the topping goes through the pie and makes it's own crust on the bottom as well as the top.  It won first place in a 9th grade cookoff, I gave the recipe to my friends daughter to try in her home ec class
