Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2) pound broiler-fryer chicken, cut up
2 cups buttermilk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 box saltine crackers
oil for frying
GRAVY:
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 1/2 cups water
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place chicken in a large shallow dish. Pour buttermilk over; cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Combine the flour, salt and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Drain chicken pieces; add to flour and cracker crumb mixture, one at a time, and shake to coat. Shake off excess; let stand on waxed paper for 15 minutes before frying.
Heat 1/8 to 1/4 in. of oil in a large skillet; fry chicken until browned on all sides. Cover and simmer, turning occasionally, for 40-45 minutes, or until juices run clear and chicken is tender. Uncover and cook 5 minutes longer. Remove chicken; drain on paper towels and keep warm.
Drain all but 1/4 cup drippings from skillet; stir in flour until blended. Gradually add milk, then 1-1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add remaining water if needed. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with chicken.
