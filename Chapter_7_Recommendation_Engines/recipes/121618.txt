Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
1 tablespoon chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 (12 ounce) package refrigerated buttermilk biscuits
5 slices processed American cheese

Directions:
In a skillet, cook beef, onion, salt and pepper over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain and cool. Place two biscuits over-lapping on a floured surface; roll out into a 5-in. oval. Place 3 tablespoons meat mixture on one side. Fold a cheese slice to fit over meat mixture. Fold dough over filling; press edges with a fork to seal. Repeat with remaining biscuits, meat mixture and cheese. Place on a greased baking sheet. Prick tops with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
Ground beef is my favorite meat to cook with because it's so versatile, flavorful and economical. Refrigerated biscuits save you the trouble of making dough from scratch.--Pat Chambless, Crowder, Oklahoma
