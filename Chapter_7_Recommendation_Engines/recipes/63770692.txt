Ingredients:
1- 21oz can of apple (or fruit of your choice) pie filling
1 box of angel food cake mix.....that's it! NOTE: you MUST use the ONE-STEP (the kind that only requires water) cake mix for this to work....but DO NOT add the water!

Directions:
Mix the 2 ingredients together (the dry packet of cake mix and the undrained can of fruit/filling) pour in a greased 9x13 pan or dish and bake for about 20 minutes at 350 (or according to baking directions on the box).
