Description: 
This recipe is a hot one, but delicious!   If you are weak of tongue, then divide the amounts of peppers in half.  Better to add more than spoil your creation!  Bay scallops are preferred, but the larger sea scallops can be used if they are cut in half.  This dish can also be placed in a casserole dish and placed under the broiler until top turns golden brown!
