Ingredients:
3 c. sugar
1/2 c. light corn syrup
1/2 c. cold water
2 egg whites
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Place sugar, syrup & water in a pan over slow fire. Stir only until sugar is dissolved, then cook until a little tried in cold water forms a soft ball.
Beat egg whites until stiff. Slowly add 1/2 the syrup.
Cook the rest of the syrup to hard crack stage, add to whites. Stir by spoon, adding nuts & vanilla, until thick enough to drop onto wax paper.
