Ingredients:
vegetable oil for frying
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil should be at least one-inch deep.
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Add water a little at a time until dough comes together into a ball and doesn't stick to your hands, about 5 minutes.
Tear off plum-sized pieces of dough and flatten into 1/2-inch disks.
Fry pieces of dough in the hot oil until brown on both sides, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels or napkins before serving.
