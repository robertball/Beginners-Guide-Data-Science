Ingredients:
1 small red onion, very thinly sliced
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
freshly ground black pepper
2 cups small cantaloupe balls
2 cups 1/2-inch diced seedless watermelon
1 ripe mango, cut into 1/4-inch dice
1 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves
2 ripe Hass avocados
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
6 thin lime slices

Directions:
To make pickled onions, combine the thinly sliced red onion and the red wine vinegar in a small bowl. Cover; chill for at least one hour.
Pour the orange juice into a large salad bowl. Whisk in the olive oil and orange zest; season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of black pepper. Toss the cantaloupe, watermelon, and mango in the dressing. Just before serving, stir in the pickled onions and cilantro leaves.
Cut the avocados into 1/2 inch dice; place in a small bowl. Sprinkle with the lime juice, and season with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Stir lightly to combine. Spoon an even amount of avocado into the bottom of 6 large martini or wine glasses. Top avocado with melon salad; garnish each salad with a lime slice.
