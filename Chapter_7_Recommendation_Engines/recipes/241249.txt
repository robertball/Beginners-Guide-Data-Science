Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add cloves and boil for 1 minute. Add cinnamon sticks, ginger, cardamom pods, peppercorns, and tea. Allow tea to steep for 6 minutes; strain into a container. Stir brown sugar and vanilla extract into tea and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
Convenient (and relatively inexpensive) way to have chai 'lattes' at home. The cardamom can be a bit expensive; try looking in the bulk section of a health food store. If you need to buy a jar of it, don't worry - it will make several batches!
