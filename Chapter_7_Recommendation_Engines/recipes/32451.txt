Ingredients:
10 lemons
1 liter vodka

After one week, combine sugar and water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil. Do not stir. Boil for 15 minutes. Allow syrup to cool to room temperature.
Stir vodka mixture into syrup. Strain into glass bottles, and seal each bottle with a cork. Let mixture age for 2 weeks at room temperature.
Place bottled liqueur into the freezer. When icy cold, serve in chilled vodka glasses or shot glasses.
