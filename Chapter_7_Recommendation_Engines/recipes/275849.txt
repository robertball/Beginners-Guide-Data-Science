Baked Gnocchi Mac and Cheese Recipe

Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package potato gnocchi
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups milk
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 1 1/2- to 2-quart casserole dish.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour until incorporated and foamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add milk, cream, salt, and pepper; stir constantly until thickened and gently bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of Cheddar cheese and mozzarella.
Drop gnocchi into the prepared casserole dish and cover with cheese mixture. Mix together bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon melted butter in a small bowl; sprinkle over the casserole. Top with remaining Cheddar and Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned and cheese is bubbling, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I whipped up this baked gnocchi tonight on a whim and it's so deliciously creamy and buttery--I think the only way mac and cheese could be better is to add potatoes. This recipe covers all the comfort food bases for me.
