Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1 small sweet onion, diced
2 zucchini, quartered lengthwise and then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/3 cup half and half
1 cup corn kernels
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, bell pepper, onion, and zucchini, and cook until the zucchini begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the salt, pepper, half and half, and corn. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 5 minutes. Remove from heat and sprinkle Monterey Jack cheese over top. Replace the cover on the skillet and allow to sit until the cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes.
