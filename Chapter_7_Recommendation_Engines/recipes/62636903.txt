Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 small red bell pepper, chopped
2 jalapenos, diced (optional)
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons cumin
Â½ teaspoon thyme
2 tablespoon chile powder
2 cups beef broth
1 15oz can pinto beans
1 15oz can red beans
1 15oz can diced tomatoes (not drained)
1 15oz can tomato sauce
1 6oz can tomato paste

Directions:
Add olive oil to large pot over medium-high heat. Brown the ground turkey, breaking up large pieces with spatula. Drain off any fat (especially if you are using beef instead of turkey). Return the ground turkey to the pot.
Add onions, green bell pepper, red bell pepper and jalapenos to the ground beef and cook over medium heat, stir occasionally until the onions are soft and translucent.
Add the garlic, sugar, black pepper, salt, cumin, thyme, and chile powder. Heat over medium heat for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Pour in the beef broth, pinto beans, red beans, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. Stir. Bring to boil then, leaving pot uncovered, reduce heat to low and simmer for at least 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. For a thinner chili cover pot with lid.
