Ingredients:
1/2 lb beef
4 pieces of bacon
2 mid size tortillas
4 slices pepperjack
shredded cheddar or mexican cheese blend to taste
shredded lettuce
Guacamole / Pico de gallo
2 roma tomatoes
1 jalapeno
kosher salt
lime juice
1/2 red onion
2 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons lime juice
1/2 c cilantro finely chopped
1 avocado

Directions:
Cook bacon and crumble/cut into tiny bite sized pieces (reserve all bacon drippings). Blend bacon bits into ground beef, form large patty (slightly larger then tortilla) and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Dice up all veggies and combine with mashed avocado, add lime juice and salt to taste.
Get tortillas, cover each with 1/2 the cheese. 2 slices of pepper jack and 1/2 the shredded cheese on each. Add a little reserved bacon grease to pan (cast iron if you have it) and cook until pan side of tortilla is lightly golden brown and cheese is melty. Repeat with other tortilla. Place in oven at low temp to keep warm.
Put remainder of bacon grease in cast iron pan and cook burger to desired doneness. Build burger on warmed quesadillas. Slather with guacamole, pico de gallo, and shredded lettuce top with other quesadilla and slice burger in halves or quarters.

If you've ever had the Applebee's Quesadilla Burger and loved it then you  will enjoy this just as much, if not more because this one has bacon ;)
Make it easier by buying pre-made guacamole and picco de gallo!  Winning!!
