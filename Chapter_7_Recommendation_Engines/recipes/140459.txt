Ingredients:
1 pound yuca root, peeled and sliced into French fries
1/3 cup canola oil
salt to taste
1 lime, cut into wedges (optional)

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Place the yuca fries in the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Turn occasionally to brown them evenly. Remove from the skillet with a slotted spoon or spatula and season with salt. Squeeze lime juice over them if you like and serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a tasty Latin side dish, that I always enjoy making. It's a great alternative to french fries or potatoes. This is also great if your looking for a real, ethnic appetizer or tapa!
