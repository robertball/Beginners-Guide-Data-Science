Title:
Pennsylvania Dutch Cheese Custard Pie Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 Quart small curd cottage cheese
2 Cups sugar
4 eggs (or egg whites)
6 Tablespoons flour
4 Cups milk
Dash salt
Cinnamon
Enough pastry for 3-4 single crust pies

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
The original directions simply say to mix all ingredients well and pour into unbaked pie shells.  Using those directions will result in a slightly lumpy textured pie.
For a smoother pie texture, cream the cottage cheese in a blender or food processor with a cup of the milk, then add the rest of the ingredients and mix well.
Sprinkle with cinnamon!!
Bake 25 to 30 minutes.
***NOTE***  Pies will appear a bit loose when taken from oven but will set up as they cool.  Serve well chilled.
