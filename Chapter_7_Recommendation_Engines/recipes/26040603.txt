Ingredients:
1 1/2 c. milk
4 1/2 Tbsp. flour
3/4 lb. butter, softened
1 1/2 c. granulated sugar
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
In a small saucepan, whisk together the milk and flour. Cook on low heat until the mixture has thickened. Set this aside and let it cool completely.
In a mixing bowl, combine the butter and sugar and cream until VERY light and fluffy. Add the cooled milk/flour mixture and vanilla and continue to beat until lighter and fluffier still.
Ice the layers, assemble and ice the top and sides of the cake.

Description: 
This really is the one and only, original icing recipe for this cake. Some people like a cream cheese icing...but, we think that's just wrong!
