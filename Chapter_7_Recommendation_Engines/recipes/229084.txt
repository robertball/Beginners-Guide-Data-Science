Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package fat-free cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts
2 (8 ounce) packages whole pitted dates

Mix cream cheese and walnuts together in a small bowl.
Slice one side of each date lengthwise using a small sharp knife, creating an opening. Carefully spoon cream cheese mixture into the middle of each date; pinch the dates closed. Stack them on a plate with cut sides down.

Description: 
These look really gross, but the kids love them! These are time-consuming, so kick back in a recliner and feel free to watch a movie as you are stuffing them.
