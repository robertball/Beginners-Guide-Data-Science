Ingredients:
1-cup warm milk,70-80 degrees
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tbs. butter, softened
¼ cup sugar
1 tsp. salt
2-½ cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole white wheat flour

Egg wash:
1 egg, beaten
1 tbs. water
1 tsp. each of dried parsley, basil, and oregano

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the bread dough ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed).
When the cycle is completed, turn dough onto a floured surface. Divide dough into thirds; roll each piece into a 14” rope. Place dough strips on a lightly greased baking sheet. Braid, turning ends under smoothly. Let rise in a 150-degree oven for 25-35 minutes, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, beat egg with water. Brush over braid, sprinkle with herbs. Bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown.

Description: 
This tender, slightly sweet bread has a mouth watering herb flavor! It looks just as beautiful as it tastes, so it is no wonder that it won a blue ribbon at the state fair!
