Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package linguine pasta
1 pound bulk sweet Italian sausage (or links with casings removed)
1 onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
2 tablespoons cream
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain well.
Combine the sausage, onion, and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat; cook until sausage is completely browned and onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir together the pumpkin puree, cream, ginger, salt, and pepper in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add the sausage mixture and stir. Simmer until heated through, about 3 minutes. Toss with drained pasta to serve.
