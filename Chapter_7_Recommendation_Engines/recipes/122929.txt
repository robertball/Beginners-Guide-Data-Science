Ingredients:
1 cup cornmeal
2 teaspoons salt
2 cups water
3/4 cup chopped whole kernel corn
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 teaspoon finely chopped onion
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 egg, beaten
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 quarts chicken broth

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine cornmeal, salt and water; bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until very thick. Reduce heat; cook and stir for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in corn, butter, onion and pepper; let stand for 3 minutes. Add egg; mix well. In a bowl, combine 3/4 cup flour and baking powder. Add to cornmeal mixture; beat well. Shape into 1-1/2-in. balls; roll in remaining flour to lightly coat. In a Dutch oven or kettle, bring broth to a boil. Add dumplings. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in a dumpling comes out clean (do not lift the cover while simmering).

Description: 
Cornmeal and kernel corn give a double dose of harvest flavor to the soft dumplings. I serve them with chicken and gravy.
