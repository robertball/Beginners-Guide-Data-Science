Ingredients:
8 cubes chicken bouillon
12 cups water
2 acorn squash - peeled, seeded, and diced
4 large carrots, sliced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, diced
2 teaspoons crushed dried rosemary
1/2 pound bacon, diced
2 (15 ounce) cans great Northern beans, rinsed and drained
3/4 cup crumbled blue cheese

Directions:
Crumble bouillon cubes into water in a large pot; bring to a boil. Add squash to the boiling liquid; cook until squash is beginning to soften, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir carrots into the liquid; continue cooking until carrots are just tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion with rosemary in the hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir bacon into the onion; cook and stir until the bacon is crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Scoop bacon and onion mixture directly into the pot with the squash. Stir beans through the mixture. Garnish with blue cheese to serve.

Description: 
This soup tastes like autumn! This recipe is rather strange and surprisingly good! When someone requested this, I thought it would be kind of hard to get the flavors to work, but they do! The bleu cheese lends itself well to the bacon, rosemary, and squash. The carrots add crunch and the onions also go well with the bacon. I would definitely add mushrooms to this! It could be made into a cream soup quite easily, if that's the way you'd rather have it.
