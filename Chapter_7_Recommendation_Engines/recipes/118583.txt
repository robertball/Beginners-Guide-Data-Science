Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
3 cups sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
6 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup sour cream
3 cups fresh or frozen blueberries*
confectioners' sugar
BLUEBERRY SAUCE:
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup frozen cranberry juice cocktail, thawed
6 cups fresh or frozen blueberries

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in extracts. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour and baking soda; add to creamed mixture alternately with sour cream. Fold in blueberries.
Spoon into two greased and waxed paper-lined 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
In a saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch and cranberry juice concentrate until smooth. Add blueberries. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve warm or cold with the pound cake.

Description: 
My husband and I have blueberry bushes in our backyard, so I developed this dessert using a basic pound cake recipe from my great-aunt. I pick and freeze the berries in 3-cup portions so I can make this yummy cake all year long. -Nancy Zimmerman, Cape May Court House, New Jersey
