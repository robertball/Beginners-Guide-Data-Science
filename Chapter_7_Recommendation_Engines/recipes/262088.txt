Salted Caramel:
1 cup dates, pitted and chopped
1/4 cup almond milk
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
Cookies:
2 cups gluten-free oats
1/3 cup chopped pecans
2 bananas, mashed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place dates and almond milk in a blender; blend until a creamy paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add sea salt.
Place oats and pecans in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until it resembles coarse flour. Mix in mashed bananas and swirl salted caramel into the dough. Drop large spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes.
