Ingredients:
1 pack of hot dogs
toothpicks
6-inch tortillas
Ketchup or mustard

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut a wedge into the end of each cocktail wiener to make a toenail. Cut the tortillas into strips about 4 inches long. Moisten the strips in the microwave between damp paper towels for 20 seconds. Roll each hot dog in a tortilla strip and secure with a toothpick. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes. Remove them from the oven, then fill the toenail with ketchup or mustard. Remove the toothpicks before serving.
