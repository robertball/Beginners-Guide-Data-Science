Ingredients:
1 pound Gr. beef or lamb
3/4 cup chopped onion
2 tspns minced garlic
1/4 cup red wine
1 8oz can tomato sauce
2-3 tblspns chopped parsley
1/4 tspn fresh oregano
approx 1/4 tspn ground cinnamon
4 eggs, beaten seperately
3 tblspns margarine
3 tablspns flour
1 3/4 cups milk
1 cup cups parmesan cheese
1 1/2 cup elbow macaroni (cooked/drained)
salt & pepper, I don't measure-I just shake each in a couple times

Directions:
Cook meat, onion & garlic in a skillet, until meat is brown, onions tender. Drain fat, mix in tomato sauce, parsley, oregano, salt, cinnamon & wine. Bring to a boil, turn down to simmer for about 10 min's. Stir meat in one of the beaten eggs.
Sauce: melt margarine in a saucepan. Mix in four & pepper. Mix in 1 1/2 cups of milk, cook & stir until thickens. Slowly mix sauce into 2 of the beaten eggs & mix in 1/2 of the parmesan cheese.  Toss the macaroni into the last egg & the rest of the cheese.
In a casserole dish (I use my 8x8 baking dish) layer half of the macaroni, all of the mixed meat, the rest of the macaroni and pour the sauce on top.  Sprinkle w/extra cheese and a bit of cinnamon.
Cook for 30-40 min's @ 350.  Let sit for a few minutes before cutting into.

Description: 
This is a flavorful Greek meat casserole.  My grandma used to make one of these years ago, all the time. (I 've had to 'wing it' on all the measurements, but have gotten it to taste close to hers)
