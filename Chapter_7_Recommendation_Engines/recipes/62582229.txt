1 c. onion, chopped
½ c. celery, chopped
½ c. green pepper, chopped
1 Tbsp chopped garlic
1 lb black-eyed peas, soaked overnight and rinsed

Bay leaf
1 tsp dry thyme leaves
Salt, black pepper, and cayenne

Heat oil in a large soup pot, add the ham hock and sear on all sides for 4 minutes. Add the onion, celery, green pepper, and garlic, cook for 4 minutes. Add the black-eyed peas, stock, bay leaves, thyme, and seasonings. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 40 minutes, or until the peas are creamy and tender, stir occasionally.
