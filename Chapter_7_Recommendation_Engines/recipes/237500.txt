1 1/4 cups milk
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup whole wheat flour

1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch salt
1 pint fresh blackberries
1 fresh peach, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a casserole dish.
Whisk milk, sugar, and flour together in a large bowl. Add eggs, vanilla extract, thyme leaves, black pepper, and salt; whisk until batter is smooth.
Spread blackberries and peach slices out in the prepared casserole dish. Pour batter over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until fruit is hot and batter is set, about 45 minutes. Cool completely.

Description: 
I was looking around for a name for this unusual clafoutis-like combination of peaches, blackberries, thyme, and black pepper. I saw an article that said in France a clafoutis that uses fruit other than cherries is called a flognarde. I enjoy saying flognarde so much that I think even if this recipe hadn't come out as well as it did I would still make it regularly, just to say 'flognarde'.
