Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
Salt and pepper
5 tablespoons olive oil
4 tablespoons butter
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons capers, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 cup chicken broth
4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
Cooked pasta

Directions:
Using a mallet, pound the chicken breasts until slightly flatten. Season with salt and pepper, and dredge both sides of chicken in flour. Shake off the excess flour.
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter and oil in a large skillet. Fry chicken breasts in hot oil, about 5 minutes each side, until cooked through and golden brown in color. Transfer chicken breasts to a plate.
Add the remaining butter to the skillet, add garlic and capers. Add lemon juice, wine, and chicken stock, bring to boil, scraping off the brown bits from the skillet.  Season with salt and pepper.
Return chicken breasts to the skillet. Cook for another 5 minutes until the sauce is slightly reduced. Transfer chicken to a large plate, pour the sauce over the chicken and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve with cooked pasta.
