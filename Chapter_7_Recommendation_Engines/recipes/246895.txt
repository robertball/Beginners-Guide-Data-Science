Ingredients:
Sauce:
1/2 cup hoisin sauce
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
4 cups water
2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles (without flavor packet)
Stir-Fry:
2 teaspoons peanut oil
1 bunch asparagus, cut diagonally into 1-inch pieces
2 carrots, peeled and sliced diagonally
1/2 onion, sliced
3 cloves garlic, pressed
1 cup thinly sliced cooked chicken
2 cups sliced napa cabbage
1 cup sliced mushrooms

Directions:
Whisk hoisin sauce, water, cornstarch, sugar, ginger, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl to make sauce.
Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Add ramen noodles. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain.
Heat peanut oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add asparagus, carrots, onion, and garlic; saute until slightly tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chicken; toss until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Add cabbage and mushrooms. Pour in sauce; toss until coated. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until flavors combine, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Serve sauteed asparagus mixture over noodles.
