64 ounces canned crushed tomatoes
2 cups minced onion
6 jalapeno peppers, chopped
2 teaspoons ground cumin

1/2 cup white vinegar
1 teaspoon minced garlic

1/2 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/2 cup ketchup
1 cup water

Directions:
In a large soup or stock pot, combine tomatoes, onion, jalapenos, cumin, salt, sugar, vinegar, garlic, tomato sauce, tomato paste, ketchup, and water (add enough water to bring the mixture to your desired consistency). Bring mixture to a slow boil, reduce heat and let simmer for at least 2 hours.
Let the mixture cool completely, then pour into individual jars. Store in refrigerator. Will keep for several weeks.

Description: 
Texans love Mexican food, especially the hot sauce. We judge a Mexican restaurant by the hot sauce served before the meal. This is my version. Spices can be adjusted to taste.
