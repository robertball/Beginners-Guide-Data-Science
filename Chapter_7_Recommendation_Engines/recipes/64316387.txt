Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup water
2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups small pasta
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Brown ground beef in a large skillet until it's completely cooked. Drain and return to pan.
Put in hot water, milk, pasta, cornstarch, paprika, onion powder, garlic, salt, and sugar; stir to combine.
Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes or until pasta is almost tender. Stir in the cheese, recover, and simmer another 2 minutes.
Remove from heat and let stand about 5 minutes before serving. The sauce will thicken as it stands.
