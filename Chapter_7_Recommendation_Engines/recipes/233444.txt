Ingredients:
¼ cup vegetable oil
1  onion, chopped
1  tomato, chopped
1  garlic clove, chopped
2 tablespoons Jamaican-style curry powder
2 slices habanero pepper (optional)
¼ teaspoon ground thyme
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
1 cup water
½ teaspoon salt, or to taste

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion, tomato, garlic, curry powder, habanero pepper, and thyme until onion is golden, about 7 minutes. Stir in chicken and cook until chicken is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Pour water into the skillet, reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 30 minutes. Season with salt.

Description: 
This is a recipe that I have put together over some various websites, verbal consultations and just experimenting on my own and with my family. Rich and hearty with a great flavor when you can't get the real thing in the islands. Try a variety of hot peppers to change the flavor - even sweet bell peppers give a different taste. Use fresh thyme to really bring out the fresh taste.
