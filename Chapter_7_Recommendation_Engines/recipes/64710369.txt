Ingredients:
Chicken:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1/2 tsp ground dried rosemary
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/8 tsp cardamom
1/4 tsp coriander
2 tbsps vegetable oil
1/2 lemon, juiced
Couscous:
1 cup dry couscous
Tzatziki Sauce:
1/2 cucumber, peeled and shredded
1 garlic clove, finely minced
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup Greek yogurt
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp chopped fresh mint
1 tsp chopped fresh dill
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/2 lemon, juiced
Toppings:
Kalamata olives, chopped
1 broccoli crown, cut into florets
1 medium red onion, diced
1/2 cucumber, peeled and diced
2 Roma tomatoes, diced
1 carrot, peeled and julienned
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
Crumbled Feta cheese

Directions:
1. To prepare chicken: Mix dried rosemary, black pepper, salt, dried oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, cardamom, and coriander together in small bowl. Season chicken with spice mixture. In a saucepan over medium heat, add 2 Tbsps vegetable oil and heat until oil begins to shimmer, about 2-3 minutes. Add seasoned chicken to the pan and cook about 4-5 minutes, covered. Flip chicken breasts over and continue to cook uncovered for an additional 5-6 minutes, or until chicken is browned on the outside and no longer pink on the inside (or  it reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F). Squeeze lemon juice over chicken, and allow it to cool 5 minutes before slicing into strips.
2. While chicken is cooking, prepare 1 cup couscous according to package directions.
3. Prepare tzatziki sauce: In a medium bowl mix together shredded cucumber, garlic, sour cream, Greek yogurt, olive oil, mint, dill, salt, pepper, and lemon juice until combined.
4. To make bowls: Divide couscous among 4 bowls. Top with the cooked chicken, tzatziki sauce, and toppings. Serve immediately or store the couscous bowls in airtight containers to reheat later.
