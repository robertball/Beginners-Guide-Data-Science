Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon
1 pound mild pork sausage
1 onion, finely diced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
6 cups chicken broth
6 large red potatoes, sliced
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
4 cups chopped fresh kale
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for garnishing

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork sausage, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Crumble bacon into a large soup pot; add sausage mixture, chicken broth, potatoes, and red pepper flakes. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the potatoes are soft, 15 to 20 minutes.
Stir kale, sour cream, and Parmesan cheese into the soup; cook until the kale wilts, about 5 minutes. Garnish with extra Parmesan cheese if desired.

Description: 
After many attempts and revisions I think my version of this hearty soup is much better and lower in fat than the restaurant dish that inspired it. Enjoy! For a healthier option, use turkey sausage and low-fat sour cream.
