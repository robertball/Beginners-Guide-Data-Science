Ingredients:
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup butter, cubed
2 packages (8-1/2 ounces each) corn bread/muffin mix
2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese
6 eggs
1-1/2 cups (12 ounces) 4% cottage cheese
1 package (9 ounces) frozen broccoli cuts, thawed and drained
1 cup fresh or frozen corn, thawed
2 tablespoons canned jalapeno slices, chopped

Directions:
I do  not use the jalapenos!!!
In a large skillet, saute onion in butter until tender; set aside. In a large bowl, combine corn bread mix and shredded cheese. In another bowl, beat the eggs, cottage cheese and onion mixture. Stir into corn bread mixture just until moistened. Fold in the broccoli, corn and jalapeno.
Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking pan. Bake at 400Â° for 35-40 minutes or until lightly browned and edges pull away from sides of pan. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers. Yield: 12-15 servings.
Editor's Note: When cutting hot peppers, disposable gloves are recommended. Avoid touching your face.
