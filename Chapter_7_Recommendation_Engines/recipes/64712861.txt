Ingredients:
1 large potato, peeled and diced
2 C boiling salted water
1 bay leaf
1/4 t dried sage
1/2 t cumin seeds
3 T butter
1 onion, finely chopped
3 T flour
1 1/4 C heavy cream
kernels from 2 ears of corn
1/4 t nutmeg
1 1/2 C sharp Cheddar cheese, grated
4-5 T dry white wine

Directions:
Peel and dice the potato and boil it in the salted water with the bay leaf, sage, and cumin seeds, until just barely tender - about 15 to 20 minutes.
Melt the butter in a saucepan and saute the chopped onion in it for a while, then add the flour.
Mix well and add the cream, stirring with a whisk.
Pour this sauce into the potatoes and their water, adding also the fresh corn kernels.
Add the chopped herbs and the rest of the seasonings and let the soup simmer gently for about 10 minutes.
Then stir in the grated cheese and the wine and mix well.
Heat until the cheese is completely melted, correct the seasoning, and serve.
