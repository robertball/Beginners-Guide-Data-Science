Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen cauliflower
1/3 cup water
1/2 cup chipotle cooking sauce (such as HerdezÂ®)
2 tablespoons recaito
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon garlic powder

Directions:
Pulse cauliflower in a blender until it is broken up and looks like rice.
Combine cauliflower 'rice' and water in a nonstick pan or cast iron skillet; saute over medium heat until slightly browned and softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in chipotle sauce, recaito, tomato paste, and garlic powder. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid reduces and mixture thickens, about 20 minutes.
