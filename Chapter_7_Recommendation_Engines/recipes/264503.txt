Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or to taste
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
1 small tomato, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup salsa verde (green salsa)
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 cups tortilla chips
5 eggs
1/2 cup crumbled Cotija cheese
1 avocado, sliced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons sour cream, or to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and jalapeno. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion appears translucent, about 4 minutes. Add tomato and garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add salsa and scrape any browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Season with cumin, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Add tortilla chips to the pan and stir until coated with sauce.
Heat remaining oil in a separate pan over medium-high heat. Whisk eggs together and pour into the hot pan; cook until starting to set, about 2 minutes. Scrape cooked egg off the edges and fold into the center. Cook until eggs are halfway cooked but still runny, 2 to 3 minutes more. Fold into the tortilla chip mixture. Keep stirring to finish scrambling the eggs, about 2 minutes. Add Cotija cheese and turn off heat.
Divide egg mixture onto plates. Garnish with avocado, cilantro, and sour cream.

Description: 
My landlady in Mexico used to make chilaquiles when she had stale tortillas. She always scrambled the eggs in, instead of the more typical fried egg on top. It's a very flexible recipe, so use what you have on hand for a yummy brunch dish.
