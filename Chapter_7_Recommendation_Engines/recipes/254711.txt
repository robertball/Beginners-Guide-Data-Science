Ingredients:
1 large spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
2 tablespoons butter (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

1 (8 ounce) package walnuts
1 pinch salt
1 pound Italian sausage, cut into chunks

Scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands with a fork. Transfer to a bowl; add butter, salt, and pepper.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add to bowl with spaghetti squash. Add walnuts and a pinch of salt to the skillet; cook and stir until toasted, about 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl.
Place sausage in the skillet; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in Alfredo sauce and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Spoon sausage mixture over squash and top with walnuts.
