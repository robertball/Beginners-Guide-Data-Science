Ingredients:
1 oz Agave nectar
1 oz Soy sauce
2 oz Tequila
juice and zest of three small limes (about 2 ounces)
2 - 3 cloves garlic (smashed, depapered and minced fine)
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp dried chipotle powder (more to taste)

Directions:
Mix the liquid ingredients then zest and juice the limes.
Prepare the garlic.
Add the dried ingredients.
Marinade the meat for a 1/2 hour to over night depending on the application turning at least once.
Be sure to oil the cooking surface as the marinade does not contain any oil.
To make a glaze, bring the used marinade to a gentile simmer to pasteurize it, then brush onto the meat during the final minutes of cooking.

Description: 
This agave lime marinade has a Cuban influence and a tiny bit of kick. I use it as a beef jerky marinade and for grilled chicken and pork. It also goes great with shrimp, scallops and firm white fish, red snapper is excellent. When using it on the grill the marinade doubles as a glaze because of the small sugar content.
