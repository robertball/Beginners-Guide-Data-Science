Ingredients:
4 very ripe, LARGE bananas, mashed
1 cup Peanut Butter (use sweetened, if you prefer)
1,5 cup rolled oats
1,5 cup of flour
1,5 cup of raisins, or your favorite dried fruit, packed
1/2 cup of Grape Seed or your choice of vegetable oil.
2 eggs, beaten lightly (or use vegetarian egg substitute)
1 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. Vanilla extract (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
In a large bowl, mash 4 large bananas.
Soften peanut butter in the microwave, if needed, for easier handling.
Combine all ingredients in the bowl and let it sit for about 5 minutes or so.
Using an average to smallish size tablespoon, drop spoonfuls of batter on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  Flatten a little if cookies seem too thick.
Bake in the upper third of the oven till golden, for 14-18 minutes, depending on your oven and crispness preference.
Turn cookies over after about 10-12 minutes of baking (optional).
Remove from oven and cool on racks.
See footnotes for an extra step to embellish and/or improve sweetness of baked cookies.

Description: 
I love my finicky friends: some avoid gluten, some - dairy, some don't like processed sugar.  Gives me interesting challenges. This is how I came up with this recipe. This cookie is plenty sweet, very healthy, AND tasty. Enjoy! (*^o^*)
