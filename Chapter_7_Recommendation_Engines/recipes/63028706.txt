Ingredients:
Bag of fingerling potatoes (you want them two-bites big)
16 oz. container sour cream
Packet of dry onion soup mix
Box of fully cooked bacon (or fry up your own), each piece sliced into little squares

Directions:
Mix the packet of soup mix with the container of sour cream; allow to sit for several hours or overnight to soften up
Boil potatoes until easily pierced with a knife tip
Drain potatoes; allow to cool slightly for easy handling
Slice each potato lengthwise, like you would for a twice-baked potato
Using a melon baller or baby spoon, carefully scoop out the insides of each potato into a bowl, leaving a little around the skin for support
Mash or whip potatoes with a mixer, adding big dollops of the sour cream/soup mix until the desired taste is reached (about 2/3 of the container; the remainder is yummy with potato chips)
Spoon mixture into potato skins, mounding up a bit.  Top with small square of bacon or your desired topper
Refrigerate to set the filling, until ready to serve

Description: 
I had these at a catered party, and could not find a recipe anywhere to recreate them, so I made my own.  These are the nicest little appetizers, and a nice change from the usual - plus the bonus of being able to make them early in the day.
