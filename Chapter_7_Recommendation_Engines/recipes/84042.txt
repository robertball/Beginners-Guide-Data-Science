Ingredients:
2 cups butter, softened
3 cups white sugar
6 eggs, room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground mace
1 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9- or 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R).
Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy and noticeably lighter in color. Add room-temperature eggs 1 at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla with the last egg.
Mix together flour, baking soda, salt, and mace in a bowl. Add flour mixture to the butter-egg mixture alternately with sour cream, mixing until just incorporated. Transfer batter to the prepared pan and spread to smooth top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Cool for at least 10 minutes before inverting pan onto a cooling rack, and tapping out the cake. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.
