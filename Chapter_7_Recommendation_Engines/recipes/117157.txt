Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 eggs, beaten
1 cup vegetable oil
2 cups finely chopped ripe bananas
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, undrained
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1 cup chopped nuts

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking soda and cinnamon. In another bowl, combine the eggs, oil, bananas, pineapple and vanilla; stir into dry ingredients just until combined. Fold in coconut and nuts. Pour into a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing cake from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
June Yeates shares this eye-appealing cake that has a temptingly tropical twist in every slice. 'If you like, sprinkle confectioners' sugar over the top,' says the Bradley, Illinois baker.
