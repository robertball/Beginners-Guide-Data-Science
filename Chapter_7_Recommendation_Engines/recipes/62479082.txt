Ingredients:
Crust:
3/4 cup graham cracker crumbs (1 package of a 3 portion box)
2 Tablespoons Ginger
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/3 cup butter
***************************
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup canned pumpkin
3 egg yolks
1 Tablespoon Pumpkin Pie Spice
1/4 teaspoon salt
***************************
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1/3 cup white sugar
1 whole egg
3 egg whites
2 tablespoons whipping cream
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
******************************
Sauce
1 cup whipping cream
3/4 cup maple syrup (real or imitation)
******************************
Whipped Cream
1 cup whipping cream
1 tablespoon vanilla
2 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the graham cracker crumbs, ginger, 2 tablespoons white sugar, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and the melted butter or margarine and mix well.  Firmly press mixture into one 9 inch springform pan.
Combine 3/4 cup of the white sugar, the pumpkin, 3 egg yolks, salt and Pumpkin Pie Spice in a medium bowl. Mix well, and set aside.
Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; gradually add 1/3 cup white sugar and mix well.  Add one whole egg, egg whites and the whipping cream, beating well.  Add cornstarch and vanilla, beat batter until smooth.  Add pumpkin mixture and mix well.  Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 to 55 minutes (exactly 55 in my wall oven). Do not overbake. Center may be soft but it will firm up when chilled. Let cheesecake cool on a wire rack, then refrigerate for several hours.
For the sauce, combine whipping cream and maple syrup in small sauce pan. Bring to boil, and simmer on medium-low for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until thickened, brown, and sticks to a spoon.
Combine whipping cream, vanilla, and sugar in small bowl. With a mixer, mix on high until thickened whipped cream.
Drizzle caramel sauce and whipped cream over individual slices, not on the entire cheesecake.
