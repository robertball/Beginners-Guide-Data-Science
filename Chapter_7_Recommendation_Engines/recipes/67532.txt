Ingredients:
5 cups coarsely chopped mixed fruit (apples, plums, and pears)
1 cup water
3/4 cup apple juice
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon apricot preserves
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard

Directions:
Place fruit in a stock pot over medium high heat. Add water, apple juice, soy sauce, apricot preserves, brown sugar, garlic powder, and dry mustard. Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently to dissolve brown sugar. Reduce heat, and continue simmering for 40 minutes, or until fruit is completely soft. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
Blend sauce in a food processor or blender until completely smooth, adjusting consistency with additional water, if desired. Cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.
