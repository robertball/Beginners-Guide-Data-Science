Ingredients:
4 banana, halved
3 1/2 ounces dark chocolate

Directions:
Stick bananas with a lollipop stick; place on a baking sheet and place in the freezer for 1 hour.
Place chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
Coat frozen bananas with melted chocolate.
