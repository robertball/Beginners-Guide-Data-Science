Ingredients:
1 tb. olive oil
1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
2 tsp. minced garlic
1 yellow bell pepper, finely chopped
1 pound ground turkey
1 28-oz. can crushed tomatoes
1 16-oz. can red kidney beans or cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 c. corn kernels
1 14-oz. can chicken stock
2 c. water
2 tb. chili powder
1 tb. cumin
1 tb. sugar
1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes
1 tsp. Kosher salt
1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 tsp. dried basil
1/2 tsp. dried oregano
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg
1/4 tsp. ground cardamom
couple dashes of ground cloves

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute onion and bell pepper in olive oil over medium heat until onions are translucent.
Add the garlic, saute for 1 minute more.
Add ground turkey and cook until browned, breaking up with a wooden spoon as it cooks.
Add remaining ingredients and stir well to combine.
Reduce heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally and skimming off any fat that rises to the surface.
(Alternately, you can put browned turkey and veggies in a crock pot, add the other ingredients and cook on low for 4 â€“ 6 hours.)
Serve with crackers, over rice or over pasta.
