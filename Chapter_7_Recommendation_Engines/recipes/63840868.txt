Ingredients:
4 (4-ounce) fillets salmon (skin removed)
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup roasted red bell peppers
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 teaspoons minced jalapeno peppers (add up to another tsp for extra spiciness)
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro
1 cup chicken broth
1/3 cup heavy cream
Pinch of cayenne pepper
Salt and pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package angel hair pasta (or enough pasta for 4 servings)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees Farenheit and start to boil water for pasta.
While preheating oven and bringing water to a boil - In a blender, smoothly puree red peppers, parmesan, cornstarch, jalapeno pepper, and garlic.  Add cilantro and chicken broth; whirl to blend.
In a baking dish, arrange salmon filets in a single layer. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Tightly cover dish with foil.  Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).  Cook until fish is opaque, but still moist looking in thickest part, about 12 to 14 minutes.
After putting fish in oven, begin cooking pasta (between 7-12 minutes, depending on brand).
Pour pepper mixture into a saucepan or frying pan.  Add heavy cream.  Stir over high heat until boiling.   Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to taste.  Lower heat to keep warm.
Spoon pasta onto plates.  Toss with some sauce, if desired.  Top with salmon and sauce.
