1 Tbsp olive oil
1 potato

Near the end of the rising period, fry up some bacon and cook the potatoes. Add Greek seasoning to the potatoes.
Punch the dough and smooth it out onto a pizza pan.
Spread sour cream; then add a layer of cheese, a layer of potatoes, a layer of green onions, a layer of bacon, and finally a layer of cheese.

Description: 
A local pizza joint calls this perogi pizza, but baked potato pizza might be more appropriate. Either way, the combination of potato, bacon, sour cream, and cheese makes this the most delicious pizza you will ever taste.
