Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1 pkg. active dry yeast
1 cup milk
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup shortening
1 tsp. Salt until warm (115-120 degrees)
2 eggs

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and yeast.
Heat milk, sugar, shortening and salt until warm (115-120 degrees). Stir to melt shortening.
Add to dry mixture. Add 2 eggs and beat at low speed with electric mixer for 30 seconds. Beat 3 minutes at high speed.
Gradually stir in 1 1/2 to 2 cups flour until dough is moderately stiff.
Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth (8 to 10 minutes). Shape into a ball. Place in greased bowl, turning once to ensure dough is completely covered in oil. Cover; let rise until doubled (45 to 60 minutes).
Punch down risen dough; divide in half. Cover; let rest 10 minutes.
