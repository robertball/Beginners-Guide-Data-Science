Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups sourdough starter
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil

Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
Combine sourdough starter, flour, and salt in a bowl. Knead into a soft dough. Let rest for 30 minutes.
Form the dough into a circle of your desired thickness and size. Place on a circular oven-safe pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until dough looks dry, about 5 minutes. Brush all over with olive oil.
