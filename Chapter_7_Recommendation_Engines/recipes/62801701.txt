Ingredients:
1 cup long grain rice
One 4-ounce slice fresh pineapple (this is slightly more than 1/3 cup chopped after sautéing)
2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup finely chopped green onion
1 small clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup roasted red bell pepper, finely diced
1/4 cup pineapple juice

Directions:
Bring 2 cups of water to a boil, add the rice, cover and simmer for 17 minutes or until done. Set aside.
Prepare the Pineapple: While the rice is cooking, preheat a non-stick skillet until it is very hot. Add the pineapple slice and cook over high heat, for about 2 minutes per side or until brown. Remove from the skillet and cut the pineapple into a fine dice; reserve for later.
In a nonstick sauté pan, heat the oil for 30 seconds. Add the green onion and garlic and sauté for a minute or until the green onion is tender. Add the pineapple, roasted red bell pepper, and pineapple juice and boil down until the liquid has almost entirely evaporated. Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir this mixture into the cooked rice.
*you can buy a jar of these already roasted or you can roast your own.
