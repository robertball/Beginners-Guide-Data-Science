Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
ground black pepper to taste
1 large boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 (12 inch) flatbread pizza crust
1 teaspoon olive oil
3 tablespoons pesto
1 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium heat until a drop of water of sizzles away. Add bacon; cook until the fat begins to render, about 3 minutes. Season with black pepper. Continue cooking until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes more. Set aside on a paper towel-lined plate.
Cook and stir chicken in the bacon grease over medium heat until lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the skillet while you assemble the pizza.
Place pizza crust on a baking sheet; brush edges with olive oil. Spread pesto over the center. Cover with feta cheese, chicken, and bacon.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and edges of the crust are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
