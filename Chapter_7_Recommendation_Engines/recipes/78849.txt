Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup eggnog
2 tablespoons clarified butter
1 egg, lightly beaten

Directions:
Heat a lightly oiled skillet or griddle over medium heat.
In a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in the eggnog, butter, and egg. Mix until dry ingredients are evenly moist.
Pour 1/4 cup batter onto the hot griddle for each pancake. Cook pancakes until bubbly on top. Flip with a spatula, and continue cooking until lightly browned on bottom.

Description: 
You will love these big fluffy pancakes even if you don't like eggnog. It's a great way to start any day, especially Christmas morning. I suggest clarifying the butter but you don't have to if you don't want to.
