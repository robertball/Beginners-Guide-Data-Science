Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice
1 cup water
4 cups fresh cranberries
3/4 cup sugar
1 cup chopped dried apricots
1 cup golden raisins
1 tablespoon grated orange zest

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium heat, mix the orange juice, water, cranberries, sugar, apricots, raisins, and orange zest. Stir constantly until sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes. Bring to a boil, and cook 10 minutes, or until cranberries have burst. Remove from heat, and chill at least 8 hours, or overnight, before serving cold.
