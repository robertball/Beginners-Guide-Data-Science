Ingredients:
1 pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
5 cups sliced peeled peaches
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, cubed

Directions:
Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom crust; trim pastry even with edge and set aside. In a bowl, toss peaches with lemon juice. Combine the sugar, flour, nutmeg and salt; add to peaches and toss. Sprinkle with almond extract; toss gently. Transfer to prepared crust; dot with butter. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie; place over filling. Cut slits in pastry. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cover edge loosely with foil. Bake at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F; remove foil and bake for 45-50 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
Since my daughter, Beth, and her husband, Gary, do not care for cake, they opted for a 'wedding pie' on their special day. Family and friends made 75 pies, many of which were set on a tiered holder to resemble a tall wedding cake. This is Beth's favorite.
