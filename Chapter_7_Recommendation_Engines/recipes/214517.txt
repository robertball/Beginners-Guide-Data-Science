Ingredients:
1 beef T-bone or Porterhouse steak, cut 1 inch thick
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
2 1/4 teaspoons steak seasoning blend
8 ounces button mushrooms, cut into quarters
1/4 cup finely chopped green onions

Directions:
Melt 1 teaspoon butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat; stir in bread crumbs and cheese. Cook and stir 3 to 6 minutes or until lightly toasted. Remove from pan. Set aside.
Press 2 teaspoons steak seasoning evenly onto beef steak. Place steak on rack in broiler pan so surface of beef is 3 to 4 inches from heat. Broil 15 to 20 minutes for medium rare (145 degrees F) to medium (160 degrees F) doneness, turning once.
Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 teaspoons butter in same skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, green onions and remaining 1/4 teaspoon steak seasoning; cook and stir 4 to 6 minutes or until mushrooms are just tender and lightly browned; keep warm.
Remove bone from steak; carve crosswise into slices. Serve with mushrooms. Sprinkle crumb mixture over mushrooms and steak.
