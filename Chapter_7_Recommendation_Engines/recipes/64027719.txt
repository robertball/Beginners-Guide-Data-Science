Ingredients:
1 bunch Asparagus (cut off bottom 2 inches and cut the rest into 1.5-2 inch pieces)
6 cups low sodium chicken broth
2 tbsp butter
1 tbsp olive oil
2 scallions
1/4 cup chopped proscuitto
1 tsp of garlic
1 cup arborio rice
1/2 cup wine
1/2 cup grated parmesan

Directions:
Bring 6 cups of chicken stock to a slow simmer
Melt the 2 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat
Add onions and cook for 3 minutes
Add minced garlic and proscuitto and cook for 3 more minutes. Stirring frequently
Add Arborio rice and stir until mostly opaque
Add 1/2 cup of dry white wine and heat until the wine is nearly absorbed
Add first cup of chicken stock and cook until nearly absorbed.
Continue to add one cup of stock at a time and stir, allowing the rice to absorb each addition of broth before adding more.
After the 4th cup of chicken stock add the asparagus to the chicken stock and cook for 5 minutes.
Drain the stock from the asparagus reserving the stock in case you need more to get the risotto to the serving stage.
The risotto should be slightly firm and creamy, not mushy.  When you reach this point add the asparagus and stir to combine.
Serve hot and top with the Parmesan.
