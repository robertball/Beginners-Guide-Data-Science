Ingredients:
3 pounds asparagus
1/3 cup heavy cream
1 tbsp. margarine or butter
1/4 tsp. dried marjoram
1/4 tsp. dried oregano
1 1/4 oz. pecorino romano cheese, grated(1/2 cup)
salt and pepper
6 large eggs

Directions:
Preheat the over to 350 degrees. Grease 12 4-oz ramekins, line the bottoms with parchment paper, then grease.
Prepare vegetable steamer. Cover and heat until boiling. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer.
Discard ends of asparagus. Cut into 1-inch pieces, separating the tips. Steam half of the tips for 2 minutes or until bright green. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Steam the remaining tips and stalks for 8 minutes or until tender. In a blender, puree the asparagus, cream, margarine, herbs, pecorino, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper until smooth.
In a large bowl, whisk eggs, with the asparagus mixture until fully blended. Separate the mixture among the ramekins. Pour hot water from the steamer into a 18" by 12" roasting pan, coming about halfway up the sides.
Bake flans 35-40 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
Run a thin-bladed knife around the edges of the ramekins. Invert onto serving plates. Garnish with the previously set aside asparagus tips.
