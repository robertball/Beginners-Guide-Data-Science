Ingredients:
12 medium sea scallops
2 Tbs olive oil
1 small shallot, minced (or use 1/4 cup minced yellow onion)
Juice of 1 lemon (about 2 TB.)
Salt and fresh ground black pepper
Fresh chopped parsley

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
When the pan is hot, add shallots. Saute, stirring frequently for 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the lemon juice to the pan to deglaze, and cook until evaporated.
Add scallops to the pan, leaving at least 1/2" of space between each scallop. Cook for 1 minute, then turn, cooking another minute on the other side until deeply browned. Repeat until all scallops are cooked.
Remove from pan immediately and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Top with parsley and serve with a fresh lemon wedge.
