Ingredients:
1 tablespoon avocado oil
1/2 cup finely diced onion
2 large cloves garlic, finely diced
1 pound mild Italian pork sausage, casing removed
1 (16 ounce) package dry mini potato gnocchi
2 1/2 cups no-salt-added diced tomatoes, undrained
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon ground oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 ounces baby spinach
1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg
1 cup shredded fresh mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat avocado oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add sausage; stir to break up the meat and cook until well browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
Drain excess oil and keep meat mixture in the skillet. Add gnocchi, stirring to break up any clumps. Stir in tomatoes, salt, basil, oregano, and pepper. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes.
Stir in spinach and nutmeg and simmer until spinach has wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses on top, cover, and simmer until cheese has melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Sausage, gnocchi, and spinach are the main ingredients in this quick, one-skillet meal. I've used mild sausages but hot Italian sausages can be substituted. Gnocchi is usually in the same isle as dried pasta.
