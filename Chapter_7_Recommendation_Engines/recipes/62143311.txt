Ingredients:
1 stick of butter
1 stick of margarine
1/2 cup of sugar
3/4 cup finely chopped pecans
15 Graham Cracker planks

Directions:
Arrange the graham cracker planks on a cookie sheet making sure they touch each other.  Melt butter, margarine and sugar in a sauce pan and boil for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and add pecans.  Spoon and spread mixture over the graham crackers.  Make sure to hold the crackers together as you spread to cut down on the mess.  Bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes.  Immediately remove the graham cracker planks from the hot pan and separate onto tin foil or wax paper to cool.  After they cool and harden break into bit size pieces and enjoy.
