Ingredients:
2 cups dried kidney beans
5 cups water
2 onions, chopped
2 green peppers, chopped
1/2 lb. mushrooms, sliced (optional)
6 cloves garlic, crushed
15 oz canned tomatoes, broken up
2 cups tomato sauce
1 tbsp. chili powder
1 tbsp. low-sodium tamari

Directions:
Place beans and water in large pot. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over low heat for 1 hour.
Add remaining ingredients, continue to cook over low heat an additional 2 hours.
Be careful with the chili powder as they vary widely in spiciness. The current chili powder I'm using is nuclear strength so I don't even use a teaspoon. I also add a couple of bullion cubes (beef chicken or whatever) for extra flavor.
