Ingredients:
1 cup warm water (30 seconds in the microwave)
1/3 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Place the water, olive oil, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Let the mixture rest for 15 minutes. It will be very frothy when your timer rings! Mix in the salt and flour using the dough hook. Start on “Stir” for a few seconds, until the flour starts to incorporate. Switch to “2” for about 30 seconds and then kick it up to “3” until the dough completely comes together. You know it’s done when all of the dough will join to form a ball and the sides of the bowl are almost clean (no dough left). If your dough is too wet, add an additional tablespoon or two of flour.
Place dough on a cutting board and section into 12 balls. Place the rolls in a 9x13” baking dish sprayed with cooking spray. Let rest for 10 more minutes.
Bake for about 10 minutes, until the tops start to get golden. Enjoy!
