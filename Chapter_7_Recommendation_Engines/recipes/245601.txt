Ingredients:
extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing
4 russet potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1-inch cubes
1 rutabaga, peeled and chopped into 1-inch cubes
1/2 pound baby carrots
1/2 large red onion, chopped into 1-inch pieces
1/2 large white onion, chopped into 1-inch pieces
1/2 lemon, juiced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon lemon pepper
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to bottom position. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a large roasting pan with olive oil.
Toss potatoes, rutabaga, carrots, red onion, and white onion in a large mixing bowl. Add 1/4 cup olive oil and toss to evenly coat vegetables. Mix in lemon juice and garlic. Add Italian seasoning, lemon pepper, and sea salt; toss to thoroughly distribute ingredients. Transfer vegetable mixture to the prepared roasting pan.
Roast in preheated oven until rutabaga is easily pierced with a fork and bright yellow or orange, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
I wasn't able to find a recipe like this for rutabaga anywhere, so I came up with one on my own, and it was fantastic!  Just make sure that you thoroughly cook your rutabaga--it's not so good when it still has that bitter semi-raw taste.
