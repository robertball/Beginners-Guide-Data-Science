Ingredients:
2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 large onion, finely sliced
2 serrano peppers, thinly sliced
2 whole cloves, bruised
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon chile powder
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 pounds beef tenderloin, cubed
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped tomatoes
2/3 cup coconut milk
1 (10 ounce) bag spinach
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Heat the ghee in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Stir in the garlic and onion, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the serrano, and continue to cook for another 3 minutes.  Season with the cloves, garam masala, coriander, chile powder, turmeric, and cumin, cook for 2 to 3 more minutes to release the flavor.
Stir in the beef and salt, cook for 3 minutes more.  Add the tomatoes, coconut milk, and spinach.  Bring to a simmer, then cover, and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Uncover, then stir in the lemon juice, and cook for 10 more minutes, stirring frequently, until the sauce has thickened.
