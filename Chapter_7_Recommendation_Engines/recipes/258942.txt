Ingredients:
cooking spray
5 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped
1/3 large onion, diced
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced (optional)
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 (15.5 ounce) cans yellow hominy, drained
1 (4 ounce) jar pimentos, drained
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x9-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
Cook bacon in a large skillet until almost crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and jalapeno peppers; cook and stir until just soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss in garlic; cook for 1 minute. Pour off and discard grease. Mix in hominy and pimentos; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add 1 1/2 cups of Cheddar cheese and salt and pepper to taste; stir until cheese is just melted, about 2 minutes. Transfer mixture to the casserole dish and top with remaining Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until Cheddar cheese is bubbly, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Handed down from my husband's grandmother from those Sunday dinners. We make this frequently, especially when we have family and friends over and serve it with barbeque. It has turned into a crowd favorite and everyone has asked me for the recipe. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
