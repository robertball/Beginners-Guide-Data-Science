Ingredients:
2-3 T. olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced or chopped
1 carrot, finely diced
1 yellow onion, finely diced
1-2 celery ribs, finely diced
1-1 1/2 lbs. ground lamb
1/2 cup dry red wine
1-2 28 oz. cans crushed tomatoes (depending on how thick you want the ragu)
1 T. tomato paste
2 bay leaves
2 sprigs fresh thyme
1/2 cup beef or chicken broth
Parmesan/Pecorino Romano cheese, grated or shaved
1 lb. fresh pappardelle
3/4 -1 cup fresh whole-milk ricotta cheese
fresh mint, chopped

Directions:
Heat olive oil in heavy-duty skillet. Add onions, carrot & celery, cooking over medium heat until soft.
Add garlic when vegetables are just about ready.
Add lamb and cook until browned.
Add wine and cook until evaporated, then add tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, beef broth, bay leaves, and fresh thyme.
Season with salt and pepper.
Simmer for at least 30 minutes. You may want to add more liquid and/or crushed tomatoes if more thickness is desired.
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente.
Now back to the ragu: after you are satisfied with the taste and texture, remove thyme & bay leaves. Add some Parm or Romano, quick stir, taste, then place in large serving bowl.
Top in the center with fresh ricotta and chopped mint.
If serving individually, top each pasta bowl with a dollop or two of the ricotta and small amount of mint.
