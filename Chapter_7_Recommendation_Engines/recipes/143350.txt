Ingredients:
8 ounces bacon
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 (12 ounce) cans pinto beans, drained and rinsed
2 (15.5 ounce) cans canned butter beans, drained and rinsed
2 (15 ounce) cans canned baked beans with pork
1 cup barbeque sauce
1 cup ketchup
1 cup brown sugar, packed

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain on paper towels, crumble, and set aside. Drain bacon fat from the skillet.
Using the same skillet, cook the ground beef and onion over medium heat, stirring until the meat is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain.
Transfer the ground beef to a slow cooker. Add the pinto beans, butter beans, baked beans with pork, barbeque sauce, ketchup, and brown sugar to the ground beef mixture; stir to blend well. Cover and cook for 4 hours on High. Top each serving with crumbled bacon.

Description: 
This is my Aunt Ro's recipe for baked beans. It's closer to chili than baked beans, and it's great for a potluck or BBQ.
