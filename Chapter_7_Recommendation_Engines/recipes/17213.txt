Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 cup lukewarm water
1 cup Herman Sourdough Starter
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon salt

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the yeast mixture with the Herman Starter, oil, 2 cups flour and salt; mix well. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and form into a loaf. Place into the prepared pan. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the top of the loaf is golden brown and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.
