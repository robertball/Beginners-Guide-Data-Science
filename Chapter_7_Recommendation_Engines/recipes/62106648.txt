1 cup vegetable shortening
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 eggs

1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
2 cups oatmeal
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Cream together shortening and sugars; add eggs, applesauce and vanilla (mixture may appear curdled - this is normal and will resolve when you add the dry ingredients). Sift dry ingredients together, mix into batter. Add oatmeal and chocolate chips. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 350ยบ for 12 minutes or until lightly browned.

Description: 
These are soft cake-like cookies. My mom got this recipe from a friend over 50 years ago and they have been a family favorite ever since. They are especially good made with home made applesauce.
