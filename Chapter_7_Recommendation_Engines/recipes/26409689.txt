Ingredients:
1 bags of cornbread stuffing cubes
2 ribs finely chopped celery
2 med or 1 big finely chopped onion
1 cup finely shredded carrots
1 pound Jimmy Dean Sage Flavor Sausage
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup golden raisins
1 cup dried cranberries
1 cup coarsely chopped green apples
2 small cans chicken stock
1 stick of butter
1/2 tbsp poultry seasoning
1/2 tbsp rubbed sage

Directions:
Place the cornbread cubes in a big bowl.
Fry the sausage, breaking down into small chunks.
Drain the fat and pour over the cornbread cubes.
Add the rest of the shredded/chopped ingredients and mix well.
Warm the chicken stock in the microwave. Measure 2 cups of the chicken stock and add the sage and the poultry seasoning to the liquid. The purpose is so that these seasonings are well incorporated into the mixture.
Pour this warm liquid over the cornbread mixture, mixing well.
If the cornbread cubes were already seasoned, you are probably ok. If they were not, taste so you can adjust salt.
If it does need salt, add it to the rest of the chicken stock and pour it over the mix.
You should have a sticky mixture, but not overly wet.
I am trying my best to 'guess'  the amounts, so it is possible that you may need more or less of something.
Put the mixture in a baking pan and bake at 350 until the top is nicely browned.
