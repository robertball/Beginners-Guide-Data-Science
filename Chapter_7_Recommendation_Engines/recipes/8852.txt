Description: 
This is a quick and easy recipe to prepare, made with what everyone has on hand in the kitchen, and is delicious!  (Note: When I am in a real hurry, I julienne the chicken and add all of the ingredients all at once into the skillet until the chicken is cooked through; then serve over rice.)
