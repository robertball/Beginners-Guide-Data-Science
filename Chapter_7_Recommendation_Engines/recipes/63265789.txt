Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
3/4 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup skim milk
2 egg whites
1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries (if using frozen, do not thaw before using)
For the Crumb Topping:
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
2 tsp milk
2 tablespoons flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Combine the flours, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a medium bowl.
In a separate bowl, combine applesauce, egg whites, and milk.
Mix the dry ingredients into the wet in two additions until well moistened.
Gently fold in the blueberries.
Divide batter evenly between 6 jumbo muffin tins (that have been sprayed with non stick cooking spray).
In a small bowl combine topping ingredients and mix well with a fork. (Add just enough milk to make a nice crumb.  You may need to use more).
Sprinkle the tops of the muffins and very gently press down with your fingertips (just enough to get the topping to “adhere” to the batter).
Bake for 20 – 25 minutes.
Allow muffins to cool for at least 15 minutes before removing them from the tin.
Makes 6 servings.
