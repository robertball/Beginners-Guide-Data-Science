Ingredients:
1/3 cup sour cream
1/2 cup 2% milk
3 eggs, separated
2 cups KELLOGG'S* RICE KRISPIES* cereal
3 (6 ounce) cans flaked white tuna
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
1/4 cup finely chopped celery
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon deli or grainy mustard

Directions:
In large bowl, mix together sour cream, milk and egg yolks. Place 2 of the egg whites in small, deep mixing bowl; reserve remaining egg white, covered in small bowl.
To sour cream mixture add cereal, tuna, onion, celery, 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Beat the 2 egg whites with electric mixer until stiff but not dry; fold into tuna mixture. Spread in 25 x 15 x 5 cm (10 x 6 x 2-inch) baking pan or 1.5 L/6 cup casserole.
Bake at 190 degrees C (375 degrees F) about 30 minutes or until knife inserted in centre comes out clean.
In small bowl, mix together mayonnaise and mustard; cover and set aside. About 5 minutes before tuna bake is done, beat remaining egg white until stiff but not dry and fold into mayonnaise mixture. Spread over hot tuna and return to oven. Bake 5 minutes longer or until topping is set. Sprinkle with remaining parsley. Cut into squares and serve immediately.
