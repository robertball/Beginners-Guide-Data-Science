Pour off grease, add in celery salt, black pepper, salt, garlic powder and finish browning.
Stir in flour until fully absorbed by liquid in skillet and cook 1 to 2 minutes.  Add beef broth, water, gravy packet, ketchup, and w. sauce.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer.
Drain all canned veggies and add to skillet.
Make mashed potatoes according to directions on the packaging and mix in cheese.
At this point you can load each plate with a scoop of mashed potatoes side by side with the beef and veggies!  Top with extra cheese, a pat of butter, or hot sauce if you like.
Or, spread the ground beef and veggies mixture in the bottom of a 3 quart casserole dish.  Top with the mashed potato mixture, sprinkle with paprika and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes or until golden brown.
