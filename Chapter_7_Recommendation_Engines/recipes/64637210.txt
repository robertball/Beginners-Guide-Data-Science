Ingredients:
8-10 small gold potatoes (about 2 ½ lbs)
3 tbsp butter, melted
2 tbsp Parmesan cheese
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves
1 tsp kosher salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375. Grease 12 muffin tins with butter.
2. Peel the potatoes, then slice thin (about 1/16 inch -1.6 mm thick) using a mandolin.
3. Put all of the potato slices in a large mixing bowl and add the cheese, butter, garlic powder, thyme, salt and pepper.
4. Mix well, then arrange the potato slices into stacks inside each muffin tin.
5. Bake 55-60 minutes, or until the potatoes are all tender when pierced with a knife, and the edges and bottoms of the stacks are golden brown.
*Make sure each potato is not wider than the muffin tin or the slices won’t lay flat
*Stack the potatoes over the top of the muffin tins by at least an inch so they don’t shrink down too much
