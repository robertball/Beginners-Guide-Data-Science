Ingredients:
5 portobello mushrooms
1 turkey sausage link, without casing
3 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
1 tablespoon crushed garlic
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 cup cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Remove stems from portobello mushrooms. Arrange the mushroom caps, bottoms up, on a medium baking sheet. Chop the stems and set aside.
Place turkey sausage link on a small baking sheet. Cook uncovered in the preheated oven 15 minutes, or until the interior is no longer pink. Remove from heat and chop.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix together chopped mushroom stems, chopped sausage, chopped garlic, crushed garlic, cayenne pepper, black pepper and seasoned bread crumbs. Slowly cook and stir 5 to 7 minutes, or until bread crumbs begin to brown. Remove from heat, allow to cool approximately 10 minutes and transfer to a medium bowl.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix cream cheese and Parmesan cheese into the mushroom stem mixture. Stuff the mushroom caps with the mixture.
Bake stuffed mushrooms in the preheated oven 20 minutes, or until stuffing is lightly browned.
