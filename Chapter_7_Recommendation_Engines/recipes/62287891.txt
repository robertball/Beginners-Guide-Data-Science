Ingredients:
1 Jar Hoisin Sauce
1 Jar Oyster Sauce
1/2 Bottle Worcestershire Sauce
2 Tablespoons Garlic Powder
1 Large Bottle Ketchup
1/2 Jar Brown Mustard
1/4 to 1/2 Bottle White Vinegar
Salt & Pepper to taste
1 Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper
2 Cups Honey
2 Cups Molasses
2 Cups Sugar

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.
This can be used as a glaze, as a dipping sauce, for basting, for slow crock pot cooking and can be frozen or refrigerated for future use. This recipe makes a pretty good amount of sauce.
I generally use it to slow cook my ribs in the crock pot. Parboil the ribs first before covering the ribs with sauce in the crock and let em ride.
You can also use this as a basting/glaze for oven or grilled meats. I've never tried it on chicken.

Description: 
This is a sauce I created and have used for a long time. It is commonly known around here as My-Oh-Yeah Sauce It goes great with pork or beef. It works especially well poured over spare ribs and slow cooked in a crock pot until the meat is falling off the bones. Best to par-boil or pre-bake the ribs a bit or the fat from the ribs turns the barbecue sauce into a delicious but very thin soup.
