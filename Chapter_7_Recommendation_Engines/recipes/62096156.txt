Ingredients:
2 Cups Cubed or shredded Ham (I use 2 (8oz) Packages of chopped ham)
2 Cups potatoes, peeled and diced
2 Cups water
1/2 Onion, diced
1 cup celery, diced
1/2 Tsp. pepper
1/2 Cup Flour
3 Cups Milk
4 Tbsp. Butter, melted
3/4 - 1 Cup Chicken broth
(Original recipe calls for 1 tsp. of salt but I don't add it because I think it's has enough salt from the ham. You may add it if you wish)

Directions:
Combine potatoes, water, onion, celery, pepper in a large saucepan
Simmer, 30-45 minutes or until vegetables reach desired tenderness
In a seperate bowl, mix flour and one cup of milk, blending well
Add flour/milk mixture, butter, chicken broth, ham and remaining milk to a dutch oven and add vegetable mixture.
Simmer, stirring frequently, on medium heat for about 20 minutes or until heated through and soup thickens.
Cooling slightly before serving will help it thicken more.

Description: 
A warm and filling meal to eat when it's cold outside and you're snuggled up and warm inside. It's thick and creamy and oh so flavorful. Great with some sliced, buttered french bread. Yum.
