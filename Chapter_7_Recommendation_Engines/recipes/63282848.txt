Ingredients:
Crust:
2 sticks butter, softened
1/2 c sugar
2 c flour
1/8 t salt
Filling:
8 eggs
1 1/2 c sugar
3/4 c lemon juice (about 6-10 lemons, depending on size)
3/4 c flour
1 t baking powder
1/4 t salt
Powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. With hand mixer (or hands), mix crust ingredients until thoroughly mixed and a soft dough forms.  Press into ungreased 9x13 pan.  Bake 20-25 min or until firm and golden brown. Let cool 10 min.
While crust is baking, juice the lemons.  While crust is cooling, beat eggs until frothy, then whisk in juice, sugar, flour, baking powder and salt until frothy and lump-free.
Pour over warm crust. Return to oven and bake another 20-25 min, or until filling is set, and top is lightly browned. Turn off oven and leave in for another 3-5 min.
Cool. Cut into squares and dust liberally with powdered sugar.
