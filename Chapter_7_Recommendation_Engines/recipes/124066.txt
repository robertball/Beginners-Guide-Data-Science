Ingredients:
3 eggs
1/2 cup milk
3 tablespoons finely chopped onion
3 tablespoons finely chopped celery
3 tablespoons finely chopped broccoli
2 tablespoons chopped carrot
2 tablespoons chopped pimientos
3 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
4 slices processed American cheese

Directions:
Beat eggs with milk just until combined. Stir in vegetables, bacon, salt and pepper. In a medium skillet, heat butter until it sizzles; turn pan to coat bottom and sides. Add egg mixture; cook over medium heat. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When eggs are set, transfer to a warm platter and top with cheese.

Description: 
My husband asks me to serve this super-easy omelet at least once a week. As you can imagine, during our more than 40 years of marriage, I've made this dish too many times to count!
