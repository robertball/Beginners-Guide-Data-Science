Directions:
Combine all ingredients except for crab meat.
Once you add the bread crumbs to the liquids you will form the filling.
Add crab meat and fold in gently as to not break up the meat too much.
Once all filling mixture has been combined thoroughly shape patties.
Bake, broil, or pan fry until internal temp is 165F turning halfway through cooking time.
