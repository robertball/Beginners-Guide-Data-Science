Ingredients:
2 lbs ground beef
1 small can tomato sauce
1 small can tomato paste
1 medium can diced tomatoes, drained
4 green peppers, chopped
1 onion, chopped
2 tsps vegetable or canola oil
1 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
In the bottom of a sauce pan, fry the onion in the oil.
Add the rest of the ingredients. Cook on medium low for several hours, until the peppers are soft and the beef is tender.
This can also be cooked in a slow cooker.
Serve warm in torpedo or sub rolls.

Description: 
These are a classic Rhode Island treat. So delicious in a soft sub-roll, with a little salt on top. My toddler loves to dip chips in it too.
