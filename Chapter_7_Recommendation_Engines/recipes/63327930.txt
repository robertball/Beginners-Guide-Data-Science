Ingredients:
20 medium to large shrimp (raw, shelled, and deveined)
2 leeks
1 cup of heavy cream
3/4 cup of white wine
2 tablespoons of olive oil
1 tablespoon of chopped fresh tarragon
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Trim the leeks leaving the white and light green portions only.  Wash leeks well as dirt can often rest in between its layers. Cut leeks in half lengthwise and thinly slice into  small moon shaped slivers and set aside.
In a small saucepan over medium heat add 1 tablespoon of olive oil.
Add leeks and cook until leeks become translucent, approximately 3-5 minutes.
Add white wine and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated.
Stir in cream and cook until the mixture is hot but not boiling.
Stir in tarragon and add salt and pepper to taste, keep warm.
At this point you can refrigerate sauce for up to 3 days for later use.
In a large pan over medium high heat add remaining tablespoon of olive oil.
Sprinkle shrimp with a little salt and pepper and fry for approximately 2-3 minutes per side.
Plate 5 shrimp per plate and top with cream sauce.
