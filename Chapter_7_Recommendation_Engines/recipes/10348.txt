1 cup butter
6 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 eggs

1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
To Make Pastry:  Cream butter or margarine and cream cheese. Add flour and mix well. Make into 48 balls; place one ball in each cup of a mini tart pan. Use your fingers or a tart tamper to press out into a tart shell.
To Make Filling:   Break the eggs, but do not beat. Add sugar, melted butter, salt, vanilla and pecans. Mix well. Fill the tart shells. Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for about 30 minutes or until delicately browned.
