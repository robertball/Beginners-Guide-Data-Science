Ingredients:
2 slices bacon
1/2 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 hot chile pepper, seeded and chopped
1 (16 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained and juice reserved
1 sprig fresh thyme
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups trimmed okra
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Crumble bacon into a bowl.
Add onion and garlic to skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add hot pepper and cook until tender, about 3 minutes more. Add drained tomatoes; season with thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook 5 minutes more.
Add okra and enough reserved juice from tomatoes to cover. Simmer, covered, until okra is tender, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
I love Southern food, and okra is no exception. During the summer, when okra can be bought fresh in farmer's markets in Texas, I love purchasing bunches of the stuff and making this dish.
