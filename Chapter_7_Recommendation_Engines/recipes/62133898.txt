Ingredients:
8 oz whole wheat pasta
10 oz baby bella mushrooms, sliced
3 tbsp white wine
1 rotisserie chicken
2 cups chicken broth (I make from the chicken)
2 tbsp butter or chicken fat
2 tbsp flour
1 cup fat free 1/2 and 1/2
1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Remove the meat from the rotisserie chicken and shred, set aside.  Place carcass in a pot just covered with water and simmer for 30 mins to make chicken broth.
Meanwhile, prepare pasta according to package directions.  While pasta is cooking, saute mushrooms in a nonstick pan for about 5 mins with the white wine. Drain the pasta and add the mushrooms to the pasta and set aside.
Strain the chicken broth and discard bones and skin. In a sauce pan heat the butter or chicken fat til melted. Mix in flour to form a rux.  Slowly add 2 cups of chicken broth, stirring constantly, then simmer about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, til reduced to desired thickness.
Heat 1/2 and 1/2 in microwave til warm (about 40 seconds). Remove sauce from heat and stir in 1/2 and 1/2.  Divide sauce equally between the pasta and mushrooms, and the chicken. Place the pasta/mushroom mixture in a 3 qt casserole dish, and dig a hole in the center. Pour chicken and sauce into the center of the casserole.  Top with parmesan cheese and bake at 375 for about 20 mins til browned on top and bubbly.

Description: 
I love this dish, but with all the cream it was too heavy, so I set about lightening up an old favorite. Can be made with left over turkey also...
