Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 clove garlic, minced
1 large zucchini, very thinly sliced
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil a 9x12-inch foil pan with cooking spray.
Mix butter and garlic together in a bowl.
Lay zucchini slices in rows in the foil pan, overlapping if necessary. Brush butter on each slice and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
Cook on preheated grill until cheese melts and zucchini is tender, 12 to 15 minutes.

Love veggies on the grill.  I barely got any of this because it disappeared so quickly.
