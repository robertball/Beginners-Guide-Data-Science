Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package baby spinach, rinsed
1 cup fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and quartered
1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
garlic powder to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a wok, or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and onion, and saute until they are about halfway done. Dump in the spinach, and liberally sprinkle with garlic powder. Fry until the spinach has wilted, about 5 to 7 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe was modified from food I ate while in Cameroon. This is traditionally served with a whole grilled chicken and grilled potatoes and plantains. You eat everything with your fingers! (it tastes much better that way).
