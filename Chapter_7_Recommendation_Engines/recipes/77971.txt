Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, cut into medium dice
1/2 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and cut into small dice
3 large garlic cloves, minced
1/4 cup chili powder
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
2 cups canned hominy, drained
4 cups leftover turkey meat, pulled into large pieces
Salt and pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat oil in a large, deep saute pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell pepper; cook until soft and golden, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic and chili powder; continue to cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add tomatoes, broth and hominy; bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, about 10 minutes, to blend flavors. Add turkey, salt and pepper. Simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in cilantro. Serve with tortilla or corn chips if you like.
