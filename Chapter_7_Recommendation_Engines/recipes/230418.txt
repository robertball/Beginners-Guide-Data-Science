Ingredients:
3/4 cup chopped pitted prunes
3/4 cup chopped dried apricots
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (4 pound) boneless pork loin roast, butterflied
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Mix prunes, apricots, ginger, orange zest, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, and cinnamon in a bowl; season with salt and black pepper.
Open pork roast and spoon stuffing down the center; fold meat over stuffing and tie securely in several places with kitchen twine. Set roast onto a rack in a roasting pan.
Combine brown sugar, flour, cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon cumin, and mustard powder into a paste; spread brown sugar mixture over the roast.
Bake in the preheated oven until a meat thermometer inserted into center of stuffing reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer roast to a serving platter and tent with aluminum foil while you make gravy.
Skim fat from roasting pan and transfer defatted drippings into a small saucepan. Pour 1/2 cup water into roasting pan and scrape up and dissolve any browned bits of food into water; pour into saucepan with pan juices. Bring pan juices to a boil over medium heat. Dissolve cornstarch in 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl and whisk cornstarch mixture into pan juices, stirring constantly until thickened, about 1 minute. Strain gravy into a gravy boat. Serve gravy with roast.
