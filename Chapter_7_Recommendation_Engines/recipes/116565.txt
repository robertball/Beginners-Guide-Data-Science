Ingredients:
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/4 cup peanut butter
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
4 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon water
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 pound boneless beef sirloin cut into 1/2 inch cubes

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first nine ingredients; mix well. Pour 6 tablespoons marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the beef. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade for basting.
Drain and discard marinade from beef. Thread beef onto four metal or soaked wooden skewers. Grill, uncovered, over medium heat or broil 4 in. from the heat for 5 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness, basting frequently with reserved marinade.
