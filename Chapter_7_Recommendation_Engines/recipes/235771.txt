Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves (optional)
3 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons gluten-free baking powder
1 orange, zested and juiced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square cake pan or line with parchment paper.
Process garbanzo beans in a food processor until smooth. Add cinnamon and cloves and pulse until combined. Add eggs, sugar, baking powder, and orange zest; process until just combined. Stir orange juice into garbanzo mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Remove cake from pan and cool completely on a wire rack before cutting into squares.

Description: 
Spicy and moist, you won't believe this cake contains garbanzo beans (chickpeas). The batter is runny so don't worry.
