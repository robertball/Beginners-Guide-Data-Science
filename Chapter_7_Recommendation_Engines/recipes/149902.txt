Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef sirloin
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup buffalo wing sauce
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup sweet onion, sliced
1/4 cup barbeque sauce
4 hamburger buns, split
1/4 cup Additional ketchup
1/2 cup grated Asiago cheese
8 slices cooked bacon

Directions:
Mix the beef, Worcestershire sauce, buffalo wing sauce, pepper, salt, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Form mixture into four patties. Place the patties on a plate; cover. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onion in the olive oil until translucent, about 5 minutes; set aside.
Cook the beef patties on the preheated grill on one side for about 5 minutes; brush the top of each burger with 1 tablespoon of barbeque sauce; flip. Cook burgers until well done, or the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (85 degrees C), about five minutes more.
Place one burger on the bottom half of each bun. Top each burger with cooked onions, ketchup, Asiago cheese, and bacon slices; sandwich with top of bun and serve.

Description: 
This burger is savory, moist, and slightly spicy with the sumptuous flavor of Asiago cheese. I made this up for my husband's birthday. It is always a challenge between us to cook the best burger. I think mine is in the lead so far. Do you agree?
