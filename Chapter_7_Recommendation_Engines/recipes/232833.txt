Ingredients:
8  corn tostada shells
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
Â½ (8 ounce) jar salsa
2 cups chopped fresh cilantro, divided
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed
8  eggs

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
Arrange tostada shells on a baking sheet. Spread a layer of refried beans onto each shell; sprinkle each shell with about 1 tablespoon Cheddar cheese.
Combine chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, salsa, and 1 cup cilantro in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until warm, about 5 minutes.
Put black beans in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until warm, about 1 minute.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook each egg in the melted butter until white is firm and yolk is still together, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully place each cooked egg atop a tostada shell; sprinkle with remaining Cheddar cheese.
Bake tostadas in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
Place each tostada on a plate; top with salsa mixture and cilantro. Spoon black beans on the side.

Description: 
Being Canadian, the only time we were able to enjoy this dish was when we traveled to Cali. When searching for a recipe (including this site) I unfortunately could not find the perfect solution. There were so many different variations with either too many ingredients or missing things we love most. I'm a busy Mom and want EASY so I decided to wing it and came up with my own version. Top with sour cream if desired.
