Ingredients:
⅔ cup milk
⅓ cup vegetable oil
¼ cup water
1  egg
1 (19.8 ounce) package double-chocolate brownie mix (such as Ghirardelli®)
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant pudding mix, any flavor

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Combine milk, vegetable oil, water, and egg in a bowl; whisk until well combined. Whisk in brownie mix, followed by pudding mix. Whisk until batter slightly thickens, about 2 minutes. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 1/3 of the way.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack as quickly as possible to prevent brownies from overbaking.
