Ingredients:
3 large potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
1 medium onion, chopped
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon minced chives
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup crumbled cooked bacon
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients.  Transfer to a double thickness of greased heavy-duty foil (about 18 in. square).  Dot with butter.  Fold foil around potato mixture and seal tightly.  Grill, covered, over medium heat for 30-35 minutes or until potatoes are tender, turning once.
Carefully open foil.  Sprinkle bacon and mozzarella and cheddar cheeses over potato mixture.  Grill 3-5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
