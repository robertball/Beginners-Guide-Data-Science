Ingredients:
1 small head cabbage, cored and cut into large chunks
1/4 cup butter
2 (12 ounce) cans corned beef
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring cabbage pieces to a boil in a pot and simmer until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, then transfer cabbage to a 2-quart baking dish.
Melt 1/4 cup butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in corned beef and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Break up any large chunks of corned beef.
Spread corned beef mixture over cabbage.
Melt remaining 1/3 cup butter in the same skillet over medium heat; whisk in flour.
Pour in milk and season with salt and pepper. Continue whisking until sauce comes to a simmer and is thickened, about 5 minutes.
Pour sauce over corned beef and cabbage mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes.
