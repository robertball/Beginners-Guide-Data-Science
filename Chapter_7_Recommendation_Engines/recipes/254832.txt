2 bananas, mashed
1/4 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon honey
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix mashed bananas, milk, egg, honey, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Stir in oats, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt.
Spoon batter into mounds on the baking sheet, spacing them a few inches apart.

Description: 
Flour-free and sugar-free cookies naturally sweetened with bananas. You can have great cookies for breakfast or any time of the day without any guilt! A little bonus for me was that my 11-year-old brother loved these, even after they had been in the refrigerator!
