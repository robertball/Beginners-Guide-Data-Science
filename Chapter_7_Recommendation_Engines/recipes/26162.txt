Ingredients:
1 cup margarine
1 cup butter
2 cups light brown sugar
2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
4 cups rolled oats
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup candy-coated chocolate pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a very large bowl, cream together the margarine, butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and rolled oats; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in chocolate chips and candy-coated chocolate pieces. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 11 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are golden. If you like chewy cookies, take them out before they look done.

Description: 
These cookies are great just from the oven, but even more amazing you can freeze them after baking and when you thaw them out they will be just as chewy and good as they were when they were fresh.  Recipe is easily halved or doubled.  Yummy!
