Campbell's Baked Italian Chicken and Pasta Recipe Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 can (10 3/4 ounces) Campbell’s® Condensed Tomato Soup
2 cups water
1 Tablespoon dried basil leaves, crushed
2 cups uncooked rotini (spiral) pasta (also works well with penne)
1 pound chicken legs and/or thighs (original recipe calls for skinless, boneless chicken breast halves)
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (provolone also works well)

Directions:
Rinse off chicken in water and set aside. It can be made with or without the skin, but the cheese on top browns - not the skin.
Stir the soup, water, basil and pasta in a 2-quart shallow baking dish. Top with the chicken. Sprinkle with the cheese and additional basil, if desired (I always add about 2 teaspoons of garlic powder and 2 teaspoons of onion powder on top as well, so it's up to you to season to your liking).
Cover the baking dish.
Bake at 350°F. for 30 minutes.
Remove cover and bake at 400°F for an additional 15 minutes.
Turn oven off and leave dish in the oven for an additional 10-15 minutes. Chicken should be thoroughly cooked and the pasta should be tender.

Description: 
This Campbell's recipe has been modified for dark meat and a better cook time, as well as to generate more pasta for the meal. Otherwise, the original recipe (350°F for 45 minutes) tends to overcook the meat and undercook the pasta.
