Ingredients:
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon paprika
salt to taste
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into strips
1 red bell pepper, cubed
1 bunch scallions, trimmed and sliced into 1/2-inch lengths
1 (12 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained and juice reserved
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, 2 tablespoons olive oil, paprika, and salt in a bowl. Add chicken strips and let marinate while preparing the remaining ingredients.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a wok. Add bell pepper and stir-fry for 3 minutes. Add scallions and cook for 2 more minutes. Remove chicken from marinade and add to the wok; discard marinade. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the centre, 10 to 15 minutes.
Combine pineapple juice and cornstarch in a bowl; mix together. Add pineapple chunks to the skillet and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in pineapple juice mixture and bring to a boil. Simmer until sauce has thickened, about 3 minutes.
