Ingredients:
4 plum tomatoes
7 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/4 teaspoon salt, divided
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
24 asparagus spears, trimmed
1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions (green onions), green part only
3 tablespoons sherry vinegar
2 ripe Avocados from Mexico, halved and pitted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Core and cut tomatoes in quarters lengthwise; squeeze out seeds. Place, cut side up, on baking sheet.
In small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the garlic, thyme, 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper; sprinkle over tomatoes. Roast, turning occasionally, until very soft and shriveled, about 2 and a half hours; set aside.
Meanwhile, cut asparagus into thirds crosswise. Cook asparagus in 1 inch of lightly salted water until bright green and firm, 3 to 5 minutes; rinse with cold water; drain well. In small bowl, toss asparagus with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and the scallions; set aside.
To prepare dressing: In small bowl, stir remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil, the vinegar, remaining 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper; set aside. To serve: With a large spoon, scoop Avocado from shells; cut each half into 8 slices lengthwise. On each of 8 salad plates, place asparagus and tomatoes in rows; top with Avocado slices. Stir dressing; drizzle over salads.
