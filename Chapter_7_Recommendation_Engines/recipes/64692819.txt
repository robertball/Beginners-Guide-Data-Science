Ingredients:
1 Chicken carcass, two if it's small.
1 tomato, roughly chopped
2 ribs celery, roughly chopped. Preferably some leaves.
2 med. carrots, roughly chopped
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
6 black peppercorns
5 cloves garlic, whole
2 med. onions, roughly chopped
1/2 tsp salt or to taste

Directions:
On a foil covered baking pan add the chicken carcass, carrots, onions, garlic and celery and bake for 1 hour @ 350 or until the carcass has browned.
Remove the pan from the oven and scrape everything into the Instant Pot.
Add the peppercorns, salt and vinegar and tomato.
Fill the pot to 2/3 full and put the lid on the pot, closed vent.
Press the soup option and adjust time to 30 minutes if necessary.
Allow the pressure to come down naturally when the timer goes off.
Strain the liquid through cheese cloth and refrigerate when cool.
Remove and discard the fat when the broth has chilled.
Note. The vinegar will soften the bones and you won't taste it.
The carrot, onion and garlic should be washed but unpeeled.
The tomato will change the colour slightly but will add flavour.
