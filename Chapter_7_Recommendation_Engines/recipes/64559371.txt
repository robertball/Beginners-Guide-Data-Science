Ingredients:
½ cup cream of coconut, such as Coco Lopez®
3 ripe bananas, sliced and frozen
1 cup frozen pineapple
1" x 3" wide strip of lemon peel
Mint leaves
1 ounce coffee liqueur, preferably Tia Maria
1 ounce dark rum, such as Myer’s

Directions:
Blend cream of coconut, bananas and pineapple until smooth and creamy. Use ice cream maker to freeze, or pour into a freezer-proof container and freeze until firm, stirring every 30-45 minutes to break up large ice crystals. Keep frozen until ready to serve.
Coil lemon peel to create a cylinder and secure across the center with a toothpick. Insert mint leaves through the top to create "pineapple leaves."
Mix coffee liqueur with rum. Add a 2 oz. scoop of sorbet to a coupe glass, then top with liquors.
Insert a toothpick into the center of the sorbet scoop and slip the garnish over it to hold it in place, and serve.

Description: 
Traditional affogato is vanilla gelato topped with espresso, but here a tropical sorbet forms an island in a coffee-flavored rum sea.  Rum-based Tia Maria coffee liqueur is preferred for its wonderful rich flavor.
