Ingredients:
2 cups pecan halves
2 tablespoons bacon drippings
1 teaspoon coconut palm sugar
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).
Put pecans in a resealable bag and pound into small pieces.
Mix bacon drippings, palm sugar, sea salt, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Add pecans to the bowl and stir to coat using a spatula. Spread coated pecan pieces onto a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until pecans are toasted and fragrant, about 1 hour. Cool to room temperature and stir in an air-tight container.

Description: 
This is something I made up one day when I had extra bacon fat and pecans in the kitchen. They keep for up to a week but didn't last the day in my house! Adjust salt and cayenne to taste. Serve on top of a chopped salad.
