Ingredients:
1 can sauerkraut, drained,
1 medium onion, chopped,
3/4 cup ketchup,
1/4 cup prepared mustard,
1 pound hot dogs,
1 pkg hot dog buns,
2 tsp olive oil.

Directions:
In a sauce pan, add oil and heat til hot, but not smoking.  Add onion, and cook 2-3 minutes. Stir in saurerkraut, and let simmer about 5 minutes.  Add ketchup and Mustard. Simmer about 3 more minutes til flavors mingle well.   In another pot add hot dogs and enough water to cover.  Bring to a boil.  I like mine splitting open so I boil them longer.  Drain.  Add hot dogs to buns, and top with sauerkraut mixture.  Wrap hot dogs individually in aluminum foil, and place on a cookie sheet in a preheated 200 degree oven.  For about 30 minutes while you are preparing the rest of dinner. Take them out and enjoy.  Tastes like the dogs from the ball park.
