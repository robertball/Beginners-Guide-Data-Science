Description: 
After doing some extensive research on brownie recipes I found that this recipe is about as basic and minimal as you can get. I did add a little brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar. It seems to deepen the chocolate flavor.  To make it budget friendly I left off the frosting recipe.  You can substitute margarine for the butter but the results are not quite as good.  Be sure to use store brand baking products to save a few extra pennies.Modified from: Best Brownies
