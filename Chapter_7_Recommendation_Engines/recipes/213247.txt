Ingredients:
4 large whole wheat tortillas
3/4 pound extra-lean ground beef
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 cup rinsed canned no-salt-added kidney beans
1/2 cup chunky salsa
4 cups torn mixed salad greens
1/2 cup KRAFT Canada Tex Mex Cheese Light
1 large tomato, chopped
2 tablespoons KRAFT Calorie-Wise Rancher's Choice Dressing

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees F.
Crumple 4 large sheets of foil to make 4 (3-inch) balls; place on baking sheet. Top each with 1 tortilla; spray with cooking spray. Bake 6 to 8 min. or until tortillas are golden brown. (Tortillas will drape over balls as they bake.)
Meanwhile, brown meat with chili powder in large nonstick skillet. Stir in beans and salsa; cook 5 min. or until heated through, stirring occasionally.
Fill tortilla shells with salad greens, meat mixture, cheese and tomatoes. Drizzle with dressing.
