Ingredients:
2 cups diced ham (I use the 2 packaged diced ham if I don't have any left over ham)
2 cups macaroni (potatoes can be substituted I usually use 3 1/2 or 4 cups hash browns but have used sliced tators as well)
1 cheeze whiz
1/8 tsp pepper
1/8 tsp paprika
1 cup grated cheddar
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup diced onion
2 tablespoons margine
1/2 cup diced bell pepper (optional)
(My man loves bacon added to this as well!)

Directions:
Boil macaroni per package directions and drain place in a 9x12 greased casserole pan.
In saucepan, saute onion and bell pepper in margarine.  Add 1 cup of the milk, paprika, pepper, cheddar cheese and the cheese whiz to sauteed mixture and stir until cheese is melted in a nonstick skillet.  Slowly add the other 1/2 cup of milk, until smooth.
Sprinkle ham evenly over macaroni.
Pour cheese mixture evenly over ham and macaroni.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30-45 minutes.
