Ingredients:
4 apples - peeled, cored and cut into thin wedges
1/2 cup margarine, divided
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups dried bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
4 (6 ounce) fillets sea bass

Directions:
Melt 1/4 cup of the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the apples in margarine until tender. Stir in honey, reduce heat, and keep warm.
In a shallow bowl, mix together flour, salt, and pepper. Place bread crumbs in another shallow bowl, and egg in a third bowl.
Melt the remaining 1/4 cup margarine in a large skillet over medium heat.  Dredge the fish in the seasoned flour, dip in egg, then coat with bread crumbs. Place the coated fillets in the hot skillet, and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes per side. The fillets should be nicely browned, and they should flake easily with a fork. Place fish on a serving dish, and spoon the apples with honey over the top of each fillet.

Description: 
Crispy fried fish topped with honeyed apples. This unique dish always get loads of compliments. Plus everyone is always surprised of the pairing of fish and apples. If you can't get sea bass, any firm white fleshed fish will work. Catfish is another fish that goes great with the apples.
