Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening or lard
1 tablespoon corn syrup
1 1/2 cups buttermilk, or as needed

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, sugar, and salt. Cut in the shortening with a fork, pastry blender, or by pinching between your fingers. Make a well in the center, and pour in the corn syrup and buttermilk. Stir with a sturdy spoon to form a soft dough. Divide the dough in half, and pat out into 3/4 inch thick circles on a floured surface. Cut each circle into 6 wedges.
Heat a griddle over medium heat, and grease lightly with cooking spray or oil. Cook scones on each side, then stand them on edge, and cook all three edges. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
My Grandma made these scones to take to teas and for special occasions. Her friends begged for the recipe and she wouldn't give. I think we should share gifts and these are a gift. Serve with butter, jam or cheese.
