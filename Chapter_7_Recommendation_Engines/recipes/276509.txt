Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups heavy cream
3/4 cup rolled oats
8 teaspoons potato flour
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons butter
4 tablespoons finely chopped onion
1 pound 85% lean ground beef
2 teaspoons ground allspice
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix cream, oats, potato flour, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Let sit for 10 minutes at room temperature to allow oats to absorb the liquid; paste should have the consistency of mashed potatoes.
Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until softened but still pale, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onions to the oat paste and mix well. And ground beef and allspice; mix just until combined, 30 to 45 seconds.
Oil your hands and roll mixture into meatballs of desired size, ideally smaller than a golf ball. Place meatballs on a sheet pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are hot, about 10 minutes. Let cool briefly.
Heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add oil. Cook and stir meatballs, about 10 at a time, until browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
