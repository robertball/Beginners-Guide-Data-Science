Ingredients:
1 whole chicken, cut into pieces
1 (14.5 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
1 cup cornflake crumbs

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place the chicken pieces into a glass baking dish, and cover with the cranberry sauce. Sprinkle evenly with the cornflake crumbs.
Cook the chicken until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
