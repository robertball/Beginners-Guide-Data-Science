Ingredients:
8 Slices Bacon
2 Cups Unsalted Butter
2 Cups Granulated Sugar
1/4 t. Salt
12 oz. Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
1/4 t. Cayenne Pepper (optional)
1/2 t. Kosher Salt

Directions:
In a frying pan cook bacon until very crispy, place on a paper towel lined plate and cool to room temperature.
In a large heavy bottomed saucepan, combine the butter, sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring until the butter is melted. Allow to come to a boil, and cook until the mixture becomes a dark amber color, and the temperature has reached 285 degrees F (137 degrees C). Stir occasionally.
While the toffee is cooking, cover a 9x13 baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
Chop the cooled bacon and set aside.
As soon as the toffee reaches the proper temperature, add the bacon and pour it out onto the prepared baking sheet.
As toffee cools, melt chocolate chips in a double boiler over medium-low heat stirring until completely melted. Add cayeene(optional). Pour over top of toffee, and smooth with wet offset spatula.
Garnish with Kosher salt and let cool to room temperature, cover and chill.
