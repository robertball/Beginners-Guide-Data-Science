Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup chopped fresh strawberries
1/3 cup chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons buttermilk
1 teaspoon brown sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in butter using a pastry blender or fork until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in 1 cup buttermilk, and stir just until combined. Fold in strawberries and basil.
Dust a work surface lightly with flour and divide dough in 1/2. Shape each portion into a 3/4-inch-thick circle; cut each into 8 wedges. Place the wedges onto the prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart. Brush tops of scones with 2 tablespoons buttermilk and lightly sprinkle with brown sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Description: 
My first taste of a truly delicious scone was in a tiny cafe in Totnes, England. That day I savored Devon cream tea, which is a pot of English tea, warm scones, clotted cream, and freshly-made strawberry jam. I was hooked! I hope you enjoy these sweet and savory scones as much as we do.
