Ingredients:
4 ounces manchego cheese, cut into 24 small cubes
24 dried pitted dates
8 slices bacon, cut into thirds
24 wooden toothpicks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Stuff 1 piece manchego cheese into each date and then wrap with 1 piece bacon, securing with a toothpick. Arrange dates in a shallow baking dish with the bacon seam down and 1 inch between pieces.
Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes, turn dates with tongs, and continue baking until bacon is crisp, 5 to 6 minutes more. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
