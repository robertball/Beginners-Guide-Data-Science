Ingredients:
1/2 cup ghee (clarified butter)
1/4 cup cashews
1/4 cup raisins
1/2 cup split yellow lentils (moong dal)
1 cup basmati rice
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup jaggery (palm sugar)
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 pinch edible camphor (kacha karpoor)

Directions:
Melt the ghee in a large skillet over medium heat; fry the cashews and raisins in the melted ghee until the cashews are brown and the raisins begin to plump, about 5 minutes. Remove the cashews and raisins from the skillet and set aside. Add the lentils to the skillet and fry in the ghee until fragrant; stir the rice, milk, jaggery, and sugar into the lentils. Reduce heat to low and cook until the rice is tender, adding water as needed to keep moist, about 30 minutes. Mix the cashews, raisins, cardamom, and edible camphor into the mixture to serve.
