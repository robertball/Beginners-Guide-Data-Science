Description: 
Used this on my Thanksgiving ham and everyone loved it! Great for after cooking the ham, as an extra layer of flavor over the sliced ham. I usually make extra for pouring over the sliced ham and this will by itself cover and glaze a 12-pound ham over the course of the whole cook time to keep the ham moist and tasty.
