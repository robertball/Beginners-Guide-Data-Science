Description: 
Don't let the fact that this is a 'diet' recipe from Weight Watchers turn you off. It is SO good for lunch or a light dinner, especially in the summertime! If you have a Trader Joe's close by, they have 'Simply Salmon' available in the meat case that's really good - all cooked and ready to go. Leftover grilled salmon works well, too!
