Description: 
A friend's father passed away and I was asked to attend the funeral remembrance with a dish. I thought this up on the spur of the moment and it was such a hit that I had to give out over 2 dozen recipe copies. It was gone in a jiff also. 
I truly didn't expect that response to it, but it is very good.
