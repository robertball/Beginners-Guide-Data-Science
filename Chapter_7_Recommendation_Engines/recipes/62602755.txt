Description: 
An easy yet delicious whole wheat muffin with the added benfits of flax. Oh, and a dash of Triple Sec to really bring out the orange flavour! 

For extra special muffins, you can also add 1/2 cup dried cranberries or cherries for added flavour and colour. Another option would be to add 1 tablespoon of grated ginger to create some zing!
