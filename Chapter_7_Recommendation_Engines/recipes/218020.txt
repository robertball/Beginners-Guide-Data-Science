Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 cup heavy cream
6 cups fresh blackberries
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a bowl, mix together the flour, 1 cup of sugar, baking powder, salt, milk, melted butter, and cream to make a batter. Spread the blackberries out into an ungreased 9x13-inch baking dish, and top with the batter. Sprinkle the top of the batter with the nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of sugar.
Bake cobbler in the preheated oven until the top is browned, the fruit is bubbling, and a fork inserted into the center of the batter comes out clean, about 1 hour. Allow to cool before serving.

Description: 
This recipe is not only simple, but is sure to become a family favorite. It may also become an oft-requested dish by friends and neighbors, so be prepared to make a few batches. Goes great with homemade whipped cream (adding a pinch of nutmeg to the whipped cream really adds to the dessert)! = )
