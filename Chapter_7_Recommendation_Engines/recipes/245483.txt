Description: 
I grew up in a town that was filled with Wolgadeutsche, or Germans from Russia. Family members and friends of the family made these cabbage pockets, sometimes called Krautbrot or Bierocks. This is a perfect food for lunches, as it is self contained and freezes well. I have changed it slightly to make it easier to make and enjoy. I love mine served hot, with ketchup for dipping!
