Ingredients:
1 medium tomato(es), plum cored, seeded and coarsely chopped
1 medium lemon juiced (use 1 1/2 tablespoons)
1 1/2 tablespoon broth, chicken, fat-free, less sodium
1 tablespoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
1 1/2 teaspoon oregano, fresh chopped, or 1/2 teaspoon dried
salt to taste
peppercorns, black freshly ground, to taste
1/2 small eggplant cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds
1 small zucchini trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch-thick ovals
1 small fennel bulb(s) trimmed and cut into 8 wedges
1/2 medium onion(s), red peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick slices (rings kept intact)
6 tablespoon cheese, feta, crumbled, reduced-fat
6 whole olives, Kalamata, pitted cut in half

Directions:
To make salad dressing: Combine 1/2 chopped tomato, lemon juice, broth, oil and oregano in a blender or food processor; blend or process until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
To make salad: Prepare a grill. Lightly oil grill rack. Cook eggplant, zucchini, 1/2 tomato, fennel, onion and lemon slices, in batches if necessary, until browned and tender. (Fennel will take 4 to 5 minutes per side; eggplant, zucchini and onion 2 to 3 minutes per side; and tomatoes and lemon 1 to 2 minutes per side.) As the vegetables are done, transfer them to a large shallow serving dish. Toss gently with the dressing.
Garnish the salad with feta, black olives and a grinding of black pepper.
