Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon brown rice vinegar, or amount to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
3 tablespoons cold water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 dried red chile peppers, seeded and thinly sliced
1/2 pound baby bok choy, trimmed and chopped
salt to taste

Directions:
Stir together the sugar, brown rice vinegar, cornstarch, and cold water in a small bowl.
Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. When hot, add the chile peppers; cook and stir until browned, about 4 minutes. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon. Add the bok choy to the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until wilted and tender. Pour in the vinegar sauce and bring to a boil. Cook and stir briefly until thickened, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, and season with salt.
