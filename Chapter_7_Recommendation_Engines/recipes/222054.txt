Ingredients:
1 cup white rice
2 cups water
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1/3 cup red wine vinegar
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon ground cumin
4 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon oregano
ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup canola oil
3 (15.5 ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 (10 ounce) box frozen corn, thawed

Directions:
Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Mix tomatoes, vinegar, garlic, cumin, chili powder, salt, oregano, and black pepper together in a bowl. Whisk oil into tomato mixture to make a dressing.
Stir rice, black beans, and corn together in a bowl; toss with dressing until well-coated.
