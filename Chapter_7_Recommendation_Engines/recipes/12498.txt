Description: 
This is a Cheese Pie that you can uses as a basis for your own variations. You could put a thin layer of pickle on the pie base before filling. Another popular variation in our family is the addition of maple cured bacon: the cheese, bacon and maple flavours produce a rich and tasty pie.  It's so simple, even I can manage it!
