Ingredients:
2 (1/2 pound) New York strip steaks, sliced into thin strips
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 sweet onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
salt and pepper to taste
1 pound snow peas
3/4 cup green peas
1 carrot, sliced
2 stalks celery, sliced
1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into chunks
1/4 cup oil for deep frying

Directions:
Place the sliced steak in a large bowl. Sprinkle the cornstarch over the beef slices and mix to coat. Whisk the soy sauce and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar dissolves; pour over the beef slices. Mix and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.
Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the oyster sauce into the onion and garlic; season with salt and pepper. Add the snow peas, green peas, carrot, celery, and red bell pepper; cook and stir until the vegetables are slightly tender, yet still crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a separate skillet. Remove the beef from the marinade, shaking off any excess moisture; discard the marinade. Fry the beef slices in the hot oil to your desired degree of doneness, 3 to 5 minutes per side for medium. Add the cooked beef to the vegetable mixture and mix well. Serve hot.

Description: 
This is an easy Pinoy recipe if you don't have much time. The beef can be sliced and marinated ahead of time making the meat even tastier. Eat the dish alone or serve with rice. Use a tender cut such as New York steak or prime rib.
