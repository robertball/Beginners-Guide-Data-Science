Ingredients:
• 2.5lb bone-in pork shoulder roast (sometimes labeled as a “Boston butt” or
“pork butt”)
• The juice from two limes
• 1 tablespoon honey
• 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne red pepper
• 1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
PREP
1. Label freezer bag.
2. To your freezer bag, add lime juice, honey, cayenne pepper, salt, and pork
shoulder. (Add the pork shoulder to the bag last, so it’s the first ingredient
poured into your slow cooker.)
3. Remove as much air from the freezer bag as possible, seal, and lay flat in
your freezer.
COOK
1. The night before cooking, move frozen bag to your refrigerator to thaw.
2. The morning of cooking, pour contents of freezer bag into your slow cooker
and cook on “low” setting for 8-12 hours, or until pork is cooked through and
falls off the bone.
3. Remove pork meat from the bone.
4. Shred and serve with tortillas or rice.
