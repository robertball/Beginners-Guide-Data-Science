Ingredients:
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 ground nutmeg
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 1/2 cup chopped apple
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts
1 Tbl white sugar
1 tsp ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon; set aside.
In a large bowl, mix together melted butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Stir in the egg and vanilla. Blend in the flour mixture until just combined, then stir in the apples and walnuts. Spread the mixture evenly into the prepared pan. In a cup or small bowl, stir together the remaining cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar; sprinkle over the top of the bars.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in preheated oven; finished bars should spring back when lightly touched. Cool in the pan, and cut into squares.
