Ingredients:
5 pounds all-purpose flour
3 pounds shortening
2 (12 ounce) cans diet lemon lime soda

Directions:
Measure flour into a very large bowl. Mix in shortening by breaking into smaller and smaller pieces using your hands or a pastry blender until lumps are no larger than peas. Gradually stir in the lemon-lime soda so that the mixture is evenly moistened.
Form into baseball sized balls and pat flat. Store each flattened ball in a small resealable sandwich bag, then put those bags into a larger sized freezer bag. Freeze until needed.
