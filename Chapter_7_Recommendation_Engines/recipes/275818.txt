Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package orecchiette pasta
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 cups assorted wild mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
4 Roma tomatoes, diced
2 cups frozen green peas
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
4 ounces BelGioioso Mascarpone cheese
1 cup BelGioioso Parmesan cheese, grated
16 ounces BelGioioso Fresh Mozzarella cheese
Kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon Black pepper

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 12 minutes. Drain and let cool.
In a large pan, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add sliced wild mushrooms and saute for 1 minute. Stir in Roma tomatoes and peas. Add heavy cream, Mascarpone, Parmesan, and Fresh Mozzarella. Stir to combine.
Toss pasta into the sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
