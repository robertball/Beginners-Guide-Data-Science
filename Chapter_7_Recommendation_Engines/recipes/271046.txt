Ingredients:

1 spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt, divided, or more to taste
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided, or more to taste
1 pound ground turkey
1 (16 ounce) can diced tomatoes
8 fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1/2 yellow onion, diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil, or to taste
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
4 ounces chicken broth

Directions:

Coat inside of each spaghetti squash half with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place spaghetti squash, skin-side up, on the prepared baking sheet.
Roast spaghetti squash in the preheated oven until skin can easily be pierced with a fork, 30 to 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook ground turkey in a skillet over medium heat until browned. Combine tomatoes, asparagus, onion, basil, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix well. Add to browned ground turkey in the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and cook until asparagus is slightly tender, about 5 more minutes.
Remove cooked spaghetti squash from oven and let cool until easily handled. Scrape squash into spaghetti strands using a fork and place into a bowl. Try to maintain the integrity of the squash skin and you can using as a serving vessel.
Place 1/2 the spaghetti squash into a serving dish or the squash skin and top with turkey-vegetable mixture.
