Ingredients:
1-2 limes
¼ pineapple, cut into wedges
¼ cup sugar
1/2 ounce silver rum
1 ounce gold rum
1/2 ounce Triple Sec
1/2 ounce orgeat almond syrup
Grilled garnishes (optional): Pineapple wedges, orange rings, bing cherries

Directions:
Cut limes into halves and turn face down into sugar to coat. If you’re garnishing with citrus rings, coat both sides in sugar, too. Cut pineapple into wedges.
Grill limes and pineapple wedges, and whatever fruits you’d like for garnish, turning pineapple and citrus rings until slightly caramelized, 5-10 minutes total. Remove from grill and cool.
Squeeze limes and pineapple. Add ½ ounce lime juice and 1 ounce pineapple juice to ice-filled shaker along with silver and gold rums, Triple Sec and orgeat. Shake until shaker mists over, about 30 seconds. Strain into an ice-filled old fashioned glass and top with grilled pineapple wedge, orange wheel and a bing cherry.
