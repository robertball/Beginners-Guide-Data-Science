Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups cake flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter room temperature
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 egg whites (cold)
1/8 tsp lemon extract (optional)
1/8 tsp almond extract (optional)
red food coloring
blue food coloring

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour bundt baking pan.
In a large bowl, measure flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, shortening, milk and the vanilla, lemon, and almond into a large mixing bowl. Beat 2 minutes on high speed, scraping bowl occasionally.
In a cold large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain.
Pour 1 cup of batter into a bowl and add the red food coloring, mix well. Pour another cup of the batter into a bowl and add the blue food coloring, mix well.
Spoon batter into bundt pan, red first, then white, and then blue around the center.
Bake stoneware bundt at 325 for 60-70 minutes.
Bake 9x13 inch cake for 35 to 40 minutes at 350. If using 9 inch rounds, bake 30 to 35 minutes at 350.
A toothpick inserted into the cake will come out clean.
Decorate with frosting.  Try drizzling thick white frosting, then blue, and red.  Sprinkle with red, white, or blue sprinkles.
