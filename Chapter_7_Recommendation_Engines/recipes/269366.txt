Description: 
A healthier, simpler, and more savory take on sesame chicken. This recipe can be made with regular flour or with a gluten-free flour mix, along with basic ingredients you can already find in your kitchen. My husband absolutely loves it and it is the perfect alternative to a night in with take-out. Best served with steamed rice, broccoli, carrots, and water chestnuts. Serve with steamed rice and vegetables.
