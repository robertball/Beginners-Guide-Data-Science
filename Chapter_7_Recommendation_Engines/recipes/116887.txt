Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (.75 ounce) packet dry brown gravy mix
1 medium onion, sliced and separated into rings
1 medium carrot, sliced
2 medium potatoes, sliced
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Stir in the water, poultry seasoning and pepper. Bring to a boil. Stir in gravy mix. Cook and stir for 2 minutes or until slightly thickened.
Arrange the onion, carrot and potatoes over beef. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Sprinkle with cheese. Cover and cook 3-5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.

Description: 
'I have good memories of eating this meal-in-one often while growing up,' writes Andrea Brandt from Newton, Kansas. 'We all loved the flavor and seldom had leftovers. Instead of sprinkling it with cheddar, I sometimes create a cheese sauce using American cheese and milk. It makes it so cheesy!'
