Ingredients:
2 teaspoons coconut oil
1/2 cup onion, chopped
4 cups chicken stock
2 cups quinoa
4 cups chicken stock
2 cups cooked shredded rabbit meat
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 cups chopped baby kale

Directions:
Melt coconut oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot oil until browned and softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add quinoa; saute until fragrant and toasted, about 3 minutes.
Stir chicken stock, rabbit meat, coriander, cumin, and cayenne pepper into quinoa mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the Dutch oven with a lid, and simmer until liquid is almost completely absorbed, about 15 minutes. Stir kale into rabbit mixture and continue simmering until liquid is completely absorbed and quinoa is tender, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
Naturally gluten-free! Threw this together last night and it was a hit. Quinoa is high in protein and you could totally omit meat and use this as more of a side dish. So many choices.
