Description: 
A traditional Spanish libation, sangria is a wine-based punch that includes seasonal fruit, a sweetener, brandy, and sometimes a splash of soda water for a little fizz. This Sangria packs a power punch of fruity liquid goodness so go easy drinking it to avoid face-first encounters with the floor. Add orange slices, apple slices, nectarine slices, blackberries, and/or blueberries before serving.
