Ingredients:
8 ounces skinless, boneless chicken thighs
2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
2 tablespoons butter
8 ounces fully cooked spicy or mild link sausage, sliced
1 medium yellow onion, sliced
1 green sweet pepper, cut into bite-size strips
2 (14.5 ounce) cans no-salt-added stewed tomatoes
1 cup Minute® White Rice, uncooked
Coarsely chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Cut chicken into 1-inch pieces; in a small bowl, place chicken and toss with the Cajun seasoning.
Heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. In the skillet, melt butter and add chicken and sausage; cook 3 to 4 minutes or until chicken begins to brown.
Add onion and pepper to chicken mixture. Cook, stirring frequently, 3 minutes. Add stewed tomatoes and rice. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and cook 10 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink and rice is tender. If necessary, break up tomatoes with a spoon. Remove from heat. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes.
Spoon jambalaya onto plates and top with fresh parsley, if desired.
