Description: 
I found a recipe similar to this one and lost it before I could make it. So I thought this shouldnt be that hard.. and this is what I came up with. My kids devoured the entire pan and asked for more..Perfect sizes and I love how they look like muffins. I've also played with this seasoning and meats and still had this come out perfect. Hope you enjoy!!
