Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon lemon extract
DOUGH:
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 1/4 cups sugar
1 egg
1 cup cold mashed sweet potatoes
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts or almonds

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine orange juice and cranberries; bring to a boil. Reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until cranberries are softened; drain. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and lemon extract until smooth. Fold in cranberry mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg and sweet potatoes. Combine the dry ingredients; gradually add to creamed mixture. Fold in cranberries and nuts. Transfer to a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cover loosely with foil if the top browns too quickly. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve with the cream cheese spread.

Description: 
We grow plenty of sweet potatoes, so I try to use them in different ways. Slices of this bread, studded with dried cranberries and nuts, are especially tasty served with the citrusy cream cheese spread.
