Ingredients:
3 cups Imagine Organic Low Sodium Free Range Chicken Broth
2 cups water (to blanch asparagus)
1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 small onion, finely chopped
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
1 1/4 cups Arborio rice
1/4 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon grated lemon zest
1/4 cup grated Parmesan
2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley
1/4 teaspoon Hain Pure Foods Iodized Sea Salt

Directions:
Bring Imagine Low Sodium Free Range Chicken Broth and water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Add asparagus and simmer, uncovered, until just tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer asparagus to an ice bath to stop cooking and then drain. Keep broth at a bare simmer, covered.
Cook onion in 2 tablespoons butter with 1/4 teaspoon Hain Pure Foods Iodized Sea Salt in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.
Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add wine and simmer, stirring constantly, until absorbed.
Stir in 1/2 cup broth mixture and simmer, stirring frequently, until absorbed. Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently and letting each addition be absorbed before adding the next, until rice is creamy and tender, about 18 minutes.
Stir in asparagus, zest, remaining 2 tablespoons butter, parmesan, parsley, and pepper to taste.
