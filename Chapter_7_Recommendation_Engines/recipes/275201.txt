Ingredients:
2 tablespoons barbeque sauce
2 teaspoons blueberry jam
1 (1 pound) fillet salmon

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix together barbecue sauce and blueberry jam in a small bowl until well combined. Place salmon on the prepared baking sheet and cover with 2/3 of the sauce. Reserve remaining sauce.
Broil the salmon in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover with the remaining sauce to serve.

Description: 
Need a new way to do fish? Or want to try salmon, but don't care for fish? This recipe is super easy and wonderfully delicious. Take it from me, I am not a fish eater at all. Serve with any vegetable side dish and wild rice.
