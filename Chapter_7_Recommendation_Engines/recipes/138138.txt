Ingredients:
1 bunch asparagus, ends trimmed
2 tablespoons tahini
1 tablespoon water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 clove minced garlic
white sugar to taste
3/4 pound thinly sliced red cabbage
2 radishes, thinly sliced
2 green onions, sliced
2 tablespoons crumbled feta
1/4 cup toasted pine nuts
2 sprigs dill, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Blanch asparagus until just tender, drain, and immediately plunge into ice water to stop the cooking process. When the asparagus is cold, drain and slice on the diagonal into 1-inch pieces.
In a small bowl, stir together tahini, water, lemon juice, and garlic. Stir in sugar to taste.
Toss together asparagus, red cabbage, radishes, green onions, feta, pine nuts, and dill in a large bowl. Pour in tahini dressing and mix to combine.
