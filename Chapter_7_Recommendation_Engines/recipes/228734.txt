Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
3 large eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup sugar
Caramel Banana Sauce:
1 cup Marzetti's® Old Fashioned Caramel Dip
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup half and half
3 large bananas, peeled and sliced into 1-inch pieces
Optional toppings: walnuts, cranberries, chocolate chips, sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
Place 3 tablespoons butter into a 9 inch square baking dish or a 9 inch cast iron pan and melt in oven, about 3 to 5 minutes.
Whisk together the eggs, milk and vanilla in a medium bowl.
In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, cinnamon and sugar.
Whisk egg mixture into flour mixture. Batter may appear a bit lumpy. Carefully pour batter into hot baking dish or pan and return it to oven.
Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until pancake rises high and edges are golden brown.
For sauce, melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add banana slices and cook for 2 minutes or until bananas are just golden. Add Marzetti Old Fashioned Caramel Dip and cream and stir until thoroughly heated.
Spoon or slice pancake into pieces and serve on plates with caramel banana sauce. Serve with optional toppings.
