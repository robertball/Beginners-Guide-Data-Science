Ingredients:
1 14oz. can low-sodium chicken broth
2 tbs all-purpose flour or baking mix
3 tbs unsalted butter
pan drippings from roast chicken
black pepper

Directions:
Pour 1/3 cup of broth into a small bowl or cup. Set aside for later to deglaze the roasting pan.
Make the roux: toast flour in a small saucepan over medium high heat until light golden, about 3 minutes, whisking or tossing frequently. Reduce heat to medium, add butter and whisk constantly until completely combined, about 1 minute.
Make the gravy: Gradually add chicken broth to flour/butter roux, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. If any lumps occur, whisk them out completely before adding more broth. Continue adding broth and whisking until mix is smooth and silky, about 2 minutes.  Set pan aside until chicken is done.
After removing chicken (and any vegetables or herbs you added) from the roasting pan, pour pan drippings into a measuring cup. Set aside to allow fat to separate.
Deglaze the roasting pan: place roasting pan over medium high heat on stovetop (don't worry if you don't have a bridge burner, your largest burner will do) and pour in the reserved 1/3 cup chicken broth. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up brown bits (fond).
Skim and discard fat from pan drippings and add the fond/broth from the roasting pan to drippings. Return the saucepan with the gravy to medium heat and gradually add the pan drippings with fond to gravy, whisking to prevent lumps. Add pepper to taste. Heat to a simmer and serve.

You've roasted the chicken and mashed the potatoes. Now what? Adding pan drippings elevates this simple gravy from bland to yummy. Toasting the flour adds depth.
