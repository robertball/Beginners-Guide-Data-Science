Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable or peanut oil
2 large bunches spinach, washed and chopped fine (about 6 cups)
2 large potatoes, peeled and cut into small cubes (about 2 cups)
1 teaspoon jeera (cumin seeds)
2 dry red chillis, broken in half
1 teaspoon mustard (rai) seeds
6 curry leaves (kadipatta)
1 pinch asafoetida (hing) powder
½ teaspoon turmeric (haldi) powder
Salt to taste
½  teaspoon red chilli powder
½  teaspoon cumin (jeera) powder

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a shallow frying pan. Add the cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and red chillis. Fry for a few seconds till the seeds splutter. Add the curry leaves, asafoetida, and turmeric. Fry for 30 seconds.
Add the potatoes, and fry for 5 minutes till they brown on the outside. Add salt to taste. Sprinkle some water on the potatoes, cover with lid, and cook for 10 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked, but still firm.
Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in another frying pan. Add the spinach, and cook on high heat till the spinach is wilted. Add salt and cook a few minutes more so all the excess water evaporates.
Add the spinach to the pan with the potatoes. Mix well. Add the red chilli powder and the cumin powder. Check the salt and add more if needed. Cook for 5 - 10 more minutes for the spices to mix well. Serve hot.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite dry sabjis. If you like Aloo Methi, then you’ll love this dish too. Goes great with parathas or with some plain rice and ghee.
