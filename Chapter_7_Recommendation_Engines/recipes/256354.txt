Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
32  frozen chicken wings (such as Costco(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), defrosted
⅓ cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons hot sauce (such as Frank's <sup>&reg;</sup>edHot (<sup>&reg;</sup>)) (optional)
¾ cup barbeque sauce, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil and lightly brush with 1 teaspoon oil.
Place wings in a single layer on the prepared pan, skin-side up, with a little space between each wing. Brush the top of each wing with the 1/3 cup oil. Brush hot sauce over the oil layer.
Bake in the preheated oven, basting with pan juices a few times, until wings are browned, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove pan from oven and soak up excess grease with paper towels. Spread barbeque sauce over top side of wings.
Return wings to oven and bake for 5 minutes. Spread a second layer of barbeque sauce over wings; bake for 5 minutes more.
