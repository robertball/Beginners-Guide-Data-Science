Ingredients:
8 oz mixed field greens (radicco, fresee, leaf lettuces, spinach, arugula, etc.)
1 sweet-tart apple, unpeeled, thinly sliced (JonaGold, Gala, Fuji)
4 oz crumbled blue cheese (use smoked if you can find it)
Spiced Pecans
Dressing:
3 Tbl. Balsamic Vinegar
6 Tbl. good quality Extra Virgin Olive Oil
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Put salad greens in a large salad bowl, top with apple slices and blue cheese.
Whisk Olive oil into Balsamic Vinegar, season to taste and pour on salad - may not need to use all of the dressing.
Toss salad to incorporate and divide into salad bowls.  Top each bowl with a small handful of spiced pecans.

Description: 
I serve this salad when we have company for dinner and we have it 3-4 times a week just for ourselves. Using field greens is a must (my friend calls it Weed Salad). One of the keys is to use a very good quality, fruity Extra Virgin Olive Oil for the dressing.  Use the Microwave Spiced Nuts recipe on this Website. The sweetness of the nuts counteracts the tartness of the dressing.
