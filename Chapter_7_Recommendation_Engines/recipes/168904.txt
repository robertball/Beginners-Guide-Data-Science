Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
2 tablespoons butter
1 small onion, roughly chopped
1 small garlic clove
1 cup fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped
1 cup fresh wax beans, trimmed and snapped
1 1/2 cups baby carrots
1 cup low-salt chicken broth
salt to taste
12 small whole new potatoes
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble and set aside.
Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the chopped onion and whole garlic clove. Cook and stir until the garlic has softened, and the onions begin to turn golden-brown, about 8 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a small bowl; remove the garlic clove, mash, and return to the onions. Place the green beans, wax beans, and carrots into the saucepan. Pour in the chicken broth and enough water to just cover the vegetables; season with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes.
After the beans have simmered 15 minutes, stir in the new potatoes and cook until tender, about 30 minutes more. Stir in the garlic, onions, 1/4 cup butter, and cream; return to a simmer. Dissolve the flour in 1/2 cup of water and stir into the soup. Cook and stir until the soup has thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve with crumbled bacon.

Description: 
Recipe's been passed down from my great Grandmother (Year 1889). Given to my Grandmother (1906) the only daughter of 17 boys. Both of whom said 'this meal feeds the soul.' Recipe for me allows for no substitutions. The whole allure of the recipe is the rich dimensional taste and fresh flavors of the summer harvest! Recipe version is different then others. This might satisfy the need from others, for that great flavor they have been looking for in a Hodge Podge.
