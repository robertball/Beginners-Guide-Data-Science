Ingredients:
1 medium sweet potato
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Position a rack in the upper third of the oven, and preheat to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix together olive oil, garlic, and rosemary in a small bowl.
Cut sweet potato lengthwise into 1 1/2-inch thick wedges; place in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with oil mixture; toss gently to coat. Arrange wedges on a large baking sheet in a single layer so they are not touching.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until potatoes are softened and lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Carefully remove from the baking sheet.
