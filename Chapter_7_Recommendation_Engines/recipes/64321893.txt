Ingredients:
1 tablespoon oil, olive
3/4 cup(s) onion(s) coarsely chopped
2 teaspoon garlic minced
salt to taste
pepper, black ground to taste
2 piece(s) chicken, breast, boneless, skinless (6 ounces each)
1 cup(s) pepper(s), red, bell, diced
1/4 cup(s) mushrooms sliced
1 teaspoon oregano, dried
2 teaspoon thyme, dried
1/2 cup(s) vinegar, balsamic
1 cup(s) broth, chicken, less sodium

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; sauté until onion becomes clear and garlic is aromatic.
Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper to taste on both sides of each chicken breast and brown, cooking about 2 minutes. Add bell pepper, mushrooms, oregano, and thyme before flipping chicken. Once browned, remove chicken and vegetables to a rimmed cookie sheet or baking dish, and finish cooking in the middle of the oven, about 5 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, add balsamic vinegar to the hot pan and reduce until almost completely evaporated. Add chicken broth and stir to release all the browned bits. Season pan sauce to taste, and once chicken is done, briefly toss in the pan with vegetables and accumulated juices to coat. Serve.
