1 (5 ounce) package alfalfa sprouts
2 teaspoons balsamic vinaigrette

Description: 
My hubby and his co-workers needed a tasty and healthy alternative to lunch. The flavors come together wonderfully in this veggie sandwich. It is a true California flavor explosion! This is a great sandwich to eat during Lent when you can't eat meat, or for a vegetarian meal anytime. You may toast the bread if you like, or add lettuce, cheese, or bacon.
