Ingredients:
4 Tbs butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 small can sliced pineapple
6 marachino cherries, optional
1 small box Jiffy Yellow Cake mix
1 egg
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Place butter in 8x8 square glass dish, microwave on med until melted.  Stir in brown sugar, microwave 1 minute, stirring after 30 seconds, to form syrup-like  consistency. Spread evenly in pan.
Place pineapple slices evenly in pan, then place a cherry, if desired, in center of each pineapple.
Mix cake mix as directed, pour evenly over top of pineapple mixture.
Cover pan with wax paper, microwave at 50% for 30 minutes, or until center is set. (This recipe was used with an 800 watt microwave).  Allow cake to stand for two minutes, then use a butter knife along the edge to loosen.  Place a plate on top of pan, invert pan, and let sit for a few minutes.  It may be necessary to scrape the pan to get all of the "good stuff"!
Cut into squares. Serve warm or cold.
