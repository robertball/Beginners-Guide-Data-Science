Ingredients:
4 chicken breasts- flattened
8 oz mozarella, sliced
2 large roma tomatoes, sliced
1 C fresh basil leaves
1/2 C balsamic vinegar
For marinade:
1/4 C olive oil
1 Tbsp minced garlic
1/2 tsp sea salt
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp onion powder

Directions:
Mix together marinade ingredients.  Cover flattened chicken breasts with marinade and refrigerate at least 4 hours.
Heat balsamic vinegar in a small saucepan to a slow boil. Allow the vinegar to slow boil for 15 minutes. Watch carefully so as not to burn.  Cook until vinegar has reached half of original volume, allow to cool completely.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place 1/4 C basil leaves, 2 oz mozzarella, and 1/2 of a tomato on each piece of chicken. Roll chicken breast closed and secure with toothpicks or cooking twine.
Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in oven-safe skillet, add stuffed chicken breasts to pan. Sear on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place pan in oven and bake until internal temperature at thickest part of breast is 165 degrees, approximately 10 minutes.
Allow breasts to rest for 5 minutes, drizzle with balsamic reduction before serving.
