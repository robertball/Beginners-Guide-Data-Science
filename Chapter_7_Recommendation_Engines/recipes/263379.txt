Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package chorizo sausage
1 (8 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1/4 large onion, diced
1 (22 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 cups chicken broth, or more to taste
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 loaf French bread, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1/4 cup butter, or to taste
2 tablespoons baking soda
8 eggs, or more to taste
1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco
2/3 cup Mexican crema, crema fresca

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo with mushrooms and onion in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard fat.
Combine diced tomatoes, chicken broth, and tomato paste in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and stir in the chorizo mixture and most of the crema, reserving a small amount to drizzle on top later. Cover and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until stew is the texture of a thick chili, at least 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lightly butter both sides of the bread slices and place on a baking sheet.
Toast in the preheated oven, turning bread halfway, for 10 minutes.
Fill a pot with water and add baking soda. Bring to a boil. Add eggs and boil for exactly 5 minutes and 45 seconds. Remove eggs and immediately place into an ice water bath to stop the cooking process. Remove shells.
Place eggs into the chorizo stew to re-warm them. Top with queso fresco and drizzle with the remaining crema. Serve in bowls with pieces of toasted bread.

Description: 
This is a delicious Mexican chorizo stew with poached eggs. We had this dish in a small beach hotel in Tulum, Mexico called Playa Azul. I have spent the last year recreating and perfecting it. My family loves it.

 Update: After years of making eggs in a pot, I finally came to realize that the dish I had in Mexico was a version of the Middle Eastern dish, shakshuka.
