Ingredients:
8 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves.
2 cups sour cream.
2 (2.25 ounce) cans sliced olives.
1 cup diced onion.
1-2 (4 ounce) cans diced green chilis to taste.
4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese.
salt and pepper to taste..
2 (17.5 ounce) packages flour tortillas.
2 (19 ounce) cans of green enchilada sauce.

Directions:
Boil chicken breasts for 30 minutes or until no pink, let chicken cool for 10-15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Shred the cooked chicken breast meat, and place in a large bowl.
Mix in sour cream, 1 cup shredded cheese, olives, onion, and green chilies. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Place a heaping spoonful of the mixture in each tortilla, roll up, and place rolled tortillas seam-side down in a 9x13 inch baking dish with enough enchiliada sauce to just cover the bottom.
Once all the enchiladas are in place, pour remaining sauce all over the top and then top with remaining cheese.
Bake for about 30 minutes, or until heated through.

Description: 
My cousins wife showed me how to make these years ago. I have never made any other kind of enchiladas since then. They are always a hit whenever I make them for dinner parties or at home.
