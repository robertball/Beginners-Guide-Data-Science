Ingredients:
3 (19 ounce) cans black beans, divided
1 (15 ounce) can black beans
1 tablespoon chicken broth, or more as needed (optional)
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 red onion, chopped, divided
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 medium red bell peppers, chopped
1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
1 pound chorizo sausage links, sliced
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 (15 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes
1 lime, juiced
2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth, or as needed

Directions:
Combine two 19-ounce cans black beans and one 15-ounce can black beans in the bowl of a food processor; process until pureed. Add 1 tablespoon chicken broth, or more as needed, if beans are too thick. Set aside.
Heat oil in a large stockpot. Add onion and garlic; cook until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Add red and green bell peppers; cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add sausage, chili powder, salt, and pepper; cook for 3 to 4 minutes.
Add remaining 19-ounce can black beans and diced tomatoes to the stockpot. Pour in enough chicken stock to cover the ingredients. Add pureed black beans and lime juice. Cook until heated through, about 10 minutes.
