Ingredients:
1 (11.25 ounce) package Pepperidge Farm® Texas Toast Garlic, thawed
3/4 pound fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 eggs
1 cup plain dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup olive oil
3 cups Prego® Chunky Garden Tomato, Onion & Garlic Italian Sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cut each toast in half.
Divide the cheese slices among 8 toast halves.  Top with the remaining toast halves.
Place the flour, eggs and bread crumbs into separate shallow bowls.  Beat the eggs with a fork.
Coat the sandwiches with the flour.  Dip the sandwiches into the eggs.  Coat the sandwiches with the bread crumbs.
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat.  Add the sandwiches in batches and cook until they're well browned on both sides.  Place the sandwiches onto a baking sheet.  Bake for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
Heat the sauce in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat until it's hot and bubbling.  Serve the sandwiches with the sauce for dipping.
