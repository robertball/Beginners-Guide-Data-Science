Mary's Cherry Pie Recipe

Ingredients:
3  Cans of Cherries Drained
2  Cups Sugar
1 Cup Flour
1/4 cup corn starch
1/2  Tablespoon Cinnamon
1/4 Teaspoon Almond Extract
Butter slices
Crust:
2 and 1/2 cups (315 grams) all-purpose flour
1 and 1/4 teaspoons salt
6 Tablespoons (90 grams) unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
3/4 cup (154 grams) vegetable shortening, chilled
1/2 -2/3 cups (120-160 ml) ice water

Directions:
Drain the cans of cherries, and put all ingredients in a bowl minus corn starch and stir well.
Put mixture + cornstarch in saucepan, heat on stove and stir until boiled and thickens.
Put in pie and top with cinnamon and butter.
Bake at 350 for about 1 hour.
Crust:
First, mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add cold unsalted butter and shortening. Using a pastry blender or two forks, cut the butter and shortening until the mixture resembled coarse meal (pea-sized crumbles with a few larger bits of fat is OK). I use a pastry cutter for this step. It’s easier, less messy, and quicker. If you do not have a pastry cutter, use two forks. But buy one – they are an inexpensive addition to a baker’s kitchen.
Measure 1/2 cup of water in a glass. Add ice. Stir it around. Slowly drizzle in the very cold water 1 Tablespoon at a time, stirring with a large spatula after every Tablespoon of water that you add. You  may need up to 2/3 cup of ice water. Do not add any more water than you need to. Stop adding water when the dough begins to clump. I usually use around 1/2 cup.
Turn out the dough on a floured work surface. The dough should come together easily and should not feel overly sticky. Form the dough into a ball. Divide in half. Flatten each half into 1-inch thick discs using your hands. Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 2 weeks).
Enjoy!
