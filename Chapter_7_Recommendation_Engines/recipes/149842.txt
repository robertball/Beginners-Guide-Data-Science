Description: 
I first tasted this tea in a popular Italian restaurant in my college hometown of Kailua. I have been craving it ever since, and have experimented with a few proportions. Add more tea leaves for a stronger tea, but do not steep longer or the tea will end up tasting bitter. (If it does, add a pinch of baking soda.) Always make something to your liking! This is also great to serve at showers.
