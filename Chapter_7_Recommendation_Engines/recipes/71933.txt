Ingredients:
1 pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed
1 head garlic cloves, separated and peeled
3 fresh jalapeno peppers
1 bunch fresh cilantro
1/2 cup water, or as needed
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange the whole cloves of garlic, tomatillos, and jalapenos on a baking sheet. Place under the broiler, and cook for a few minutes. Remove garlic cloves first, as soon as they are toasted, to avoid developing a bitter flavor. Continue to roast jalapenos and tomatillos until evenly charred, turning occasionally. Set aside to cool. Don't remove the charred parts of the tomatillos or the peppers. They add a really nice flavor.
Place peppers and tomatillos in a blender with the garlic and cilantro. Add a little water to the mixture if necessary to facilitate blending. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate until serving.

Description: 
Tomatillos, lots of garlic and spicy jalapenos charred under the broiler give this salsa a rich, earthy flavor. If you like your salsa very hot, added roasted Jamaican scotch bonnets instead of the jalapeno.
