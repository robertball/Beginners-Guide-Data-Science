Ingredients:
3/4 cup barbecue sauce
1/4 cup chopped green onion
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 pounds turkey thighs, skinned and excess fat removed

Directions:
To Marinate: In 2-cup measure combine barbecue sauce, onions, soy sauce, sesame seeds, garlic and ginger. Remove 1/3 cup, cover and refrigerate. Pierce holes in thighs using tines of fork. In self-closing plastic bag combine thighs and remaining marinade. Seal bag and refrigerate overnight, turning occasionally to marinate evenly.
Prepare grill for indirect heat cooking. Cook thighs over hot coals 25 to 30 minutes per side until meat thermometer, inserted in thickest portion of thigh, registers 180 degrees F. During last 10 minutes of cooking, brush with reserved marinade. Serve hot with favorite rice dish and a vegetable, if desired.
