Ingredients:
2 pounds fennel bulbs, sliced, green tops reserved
3 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
salt to taste
1 pinch lemon pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Chop fennel greens and set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Lay some fennel slices in a single layer in the pan; cook until nicely browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and lemon pepper. Remove from pan. Add another tablespoon oil and layer in the next batch of fennel slices and cook the same way. Repeat with remaining oil and fennel. Serve sprinkled with fennel greens.

Description: 
This is an easy way to prepare fennel bulbs. Fennel tastes great pan-fried and you don't need a lot of seasoning as fennel has so much flavor on its own, which just intensifies while sauteeing.
