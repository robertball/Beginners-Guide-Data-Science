Ingredients:
8 ounces multicolored grape tomatoes (such as Wild WonderÂ®)
1/2 cup olive oil, divided
1 1/2 tablespoons Asiago-Romano cheese mix
1/3 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, including all the juice
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh garlic
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 pound dry fettuccine pasta, broken in half
2 1/2 ounces lacinato kale, cut into small pieces
1/4 stick unsalted butter
1/3 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Put tomatoes in a bowl. Add 1/4 cup olive oil, Asiago-Romano cheese mix, black olive and juice, pepper, garlic, oregano, parsley, and basil. Stir and let marinate for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes, transfer juice from the marinating tomatoes to a saucepan over medium heat.
Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil, about 5 minutes. Cook fettuccine at a boil for 3 minutes. Add 1/4 cup olive oil and kale. Continue cooking until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes more. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water. Drain pasta and keep warm.
Add reserved pasta cooking water to the saucepan with the tomato marinade. Continue cooking to thicken and reduce the sauce. Add butter to the sauce and allow to melt, about 1 minute. Add cream and continue cooking until sauce is thickened as desired.
Transfer cooked pasta to a large serving bowl. Add tomatoes and top with cream sauce.
