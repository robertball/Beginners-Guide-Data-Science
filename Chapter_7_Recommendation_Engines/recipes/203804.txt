Ingredients:
10 egg whites
2 eggs
1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chilies, drained

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Prepare an oven-safe skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat.
Whisk the egg whites, eggs, and 1/2 cup of the Cheddar cheese together in a bowl. Cook the egg mixture in the hot skillet until the bottom of the eggs turn opaque, about 1 minute. Cover the skillet with a lid and cook until the eggs are nearly set, 4 to 5 minutes more. Spread the diced tomatoes with chiles and the remaining cheese over the eggs.
Move the skillet to the oven and cook under the broiler until the eggs finish setting and the cheese is completely melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Allow the frittata to rest 5 minutes before slicing to serve.

I usually make it, divide it into individual servings, and store it in airtight containers in the fridge. It stores up to 7 days without losing texture or flavor...voila grab and go breakfast for days!
