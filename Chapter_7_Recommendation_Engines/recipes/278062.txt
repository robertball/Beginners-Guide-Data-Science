Ingredients:
6 cups water
1/3 cup baking soda
1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough
12 links smoked bratwurst
kosher salt (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet or line with foil.
Stir together water and baking soda in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil.
Meanwhile, turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 10x12-inch rectangle. Cut dough into twelve 1-inch strips. Wrap each strip tightly around a bratwurst in a spiral, pinching edges to seal and leaving about 1/2 inch of bratwurst peeking out of each end.
Add 3 wrapped bratwurst at a time to the boiling water. Boil for about 30 seconds. Transfer bratwurst to the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining wrapped bratwurst.
Bake bratwursts until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Cut each bratwurst crosswise into thirds. Serve with mustard.
