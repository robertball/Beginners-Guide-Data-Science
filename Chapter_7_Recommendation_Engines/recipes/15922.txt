1 egg
1/4 cup half-and-half
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
4 cups vegetable oil for frying
3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a medium bowl, beat the cottage cheese and egg together. Stir in the half-and-half, flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and nutmeg. Mix until just combined.
Fill a deep pot to the 2-inch mark with oil. Heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop batter by rounded tablespoons into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown on all sides, about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Serve hot!
