Ingredients:
2 medium sized portabello mushrooms
4 pieces of turkey bacon
2 very small onions, thinly sliced
2 sandwich buns
2 slices of tomato
2 romaine leaves
3 t. horseradish sauce

Directions:
1.  Preheat oven or toaster oven to 400^.  Wipe mushrooms with a damp cloth to remove any dirt.  Wrap 2 pieces of turkey bacon around each mushroom, tucking the ends underneath.  Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray and place mushrooms on the sheet.  Place in the oven and cook for 15 minutes.
2.  Meanwhile, heat a small non-stick pan over medium heat.  Spray it with cooking spray and add the onions.  Saute the onions until brown and carmelized, about 10 minutes.
3.  Cut the sandwich buns in half and spread 1 1/2 t. on each bun (add more or less to suit your own taste).  Place one tomato slice and one lettuce leaf on each bun.
4.  Take the mushrooms out of the oven.  Drain them on some paper towel, then place them on the prepared buns.  Top with the carmelized onions and serve immediately.
