Assemble the vegetable stacks on a baking sheet.  For each stack, layer 2 eggplant slices, 2 mozzarella cheese slices, 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon sauce, 2 zucchini slices, 2 mozzarella cheese slices, 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon sauce, making 6 stacks in all.
Bake the bread according to the package directions.  Meanwhile, bake the vegetable stacks for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
