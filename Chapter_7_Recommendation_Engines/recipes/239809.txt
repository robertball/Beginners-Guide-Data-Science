Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
40 wonton wrappers
8 strips cooked bacon, crumbled
4 plum tomatoes, chopped
1 cup shredded lettuce
1/2 cup light mayonnaise
1 tablespoon honey mustard
3 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 40 mini muffin cups with olive oil.
Press 1 wonton wrapper into each prepared muffin cup, pressing wonton against the bottom and sides of the cup.
Bake in the preheated oven until crisped and corners are browned, about 4 minutes. Cool.
Stir bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, and honey mustard together in a bowl until well-combined. Fill each wonton with bacon mixture and top each with green onion.

Description: 
These appetizers are easy to make and very addictive. I have converted tomato-haters to lovers of these BLT cups. I love that they can be made ahead of time and then a quick spoonful in a cup to serve. You can never make too many - they will fly in a second. The BLT mix can be made in advance and kept refrigerated. Remove from fridge 1/2 hour before serving. You can use butter instead of olive oil, if desired.
