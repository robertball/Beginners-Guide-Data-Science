Ingredients:
4 ounces dry fettuccine pasta
2 teaspoons margarine
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups skim milk
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 ounces Neufchatel cheese
1/4 cup chopped parsley

Directions:
In a large pot cook with boiling salted water cook fettuccini pasta until al dente. Drain.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan over medium-high heat melt margarine; add garlic and saute for one minute. Add flour, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in milk, continue to stir until sauce thickens, about 5 to7 minutes. Add the Neufchatel cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and ground black pepper. Cook until the cheese has completely melted.
Serve Alfredo sauce over cooked and drained fettuccini noodles. Sprinkle the top with fresh parsley.

Description: 
Just as good as the cholesterol-laden original. Created for diabetics, but great for anyone trying to reduce their fat intake. For added flavor try using a garlic and herb Parmesan cheese blend and to increase fiber content use whole wheat pasta. Easily doubled for when you need more than 2 servings. Enjoy!
