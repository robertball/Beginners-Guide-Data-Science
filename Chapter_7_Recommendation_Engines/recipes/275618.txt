Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) spaghetti squash
2 cups shredded cooked chicken
6 cups packed fresh basil
1 cup extra virgin olive oil
3/4 cup pine nuts
4 cloves garlic
2 lemons, juiced
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 pinch sea salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place spaghetti squash in a shallow, non-reactive baking dish.
Roast in the preheated oven until squash is soft when punctured with a fork, 30 to 45 minutes. When cool enough to handle, cut in half lengthwise, and scoop out and discard seeds. Gently scoop out flesh and place in a bowl with shredded chicken.
Combine basil, olive oil, pine nuts, garlic, lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon sea salt in the bowl of a food processor; process until smooth. Add pesto to the spaghetti squash and chicken, tossing to combine. Season with sea salt and pepper.
