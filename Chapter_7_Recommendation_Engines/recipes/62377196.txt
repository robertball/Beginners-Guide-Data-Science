Ingredients:
1 cup rice
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 medium green bell pepper
1 medium red bell pepper
1 medium yellow bell pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (6 ounce) can frozen lemonade concentrate, thawed

Directions:
Cook rice according to package directions, keep warm.  Cut chicken and bell peppers into strips.  Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Stir-fry chicken and garlic in hot oil until chicken is golden, about 5 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium.  Add lemonade concentrate, 3/4 cup water, and bouillon to chicken in skillet and mix well.  Cook chicken mixture until liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes.  Stir in bell peppers.  Cook, covered, until bell peppers are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.  Combine remaining 1/4 cup water and cornstarch in small bowl, mix well.  Stir into chicken mixture.  Bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute.  Serve over rice.
