Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 (12 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, green beans, corn)
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (15 ounce) can ranch style chili beans
1 (15 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix

Directions:
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat and stir in the ground turkey and onion. Cook and stir until the turkey is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Add the mixed vegetables, tomatoes with green chiles, ranch beans, chicken broth, taco seasoning, and ranch dressing mix. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer on low for 20 minutes.

Description: 
Easy soup to make using ingredients that I always have on hand.  My husband loves this stuff.  He likes to put a big spoonful of leftover mashed potatoes in the bowl and cover it with the soup.  I like it served with corn chips and grated cheese. For a spicier soup, add a few diced jalapenos.
