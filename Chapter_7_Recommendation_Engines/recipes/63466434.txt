Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.) Place ice cream near the warm oven to soften.
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs. Stir in the pumpkin puree, sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Mix in soft ice cream until smooth. Pour filling into two 9 inch pie shells.

Description: 
This pumpkin pie recipe uses melted ice cream instead of evaporated milk. The result is delicious. I have never brought home leftovers of this pie. I recommend using fresh pumpkin, but canned pumpkin can also be used.Modified from: Cindy's Pumpkin Pie
