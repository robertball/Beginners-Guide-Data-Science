Ingredients:
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1 red bell pepper, cut into bite-size pieces
1 small white onion, chopped
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 tablespoon cracked black pepper, divided
1 teaspoon roasted garlic, divided
2 (14.5 ounce) cans curried lentil soup (such as Amy's Organic Lentil Soup)

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add red bell pepper and onion; cook and stir until small brown spots begin to appear on the vegetables, about 6 minutes.
Heat a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Stir in half the black pepper and half the roasted garlic until well mixed.
Pour both cans of soup into a 2-quart pot over medium-high heat. Stir occasionally until it starts to bubble, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add the cooked vegetables and turkey; add the remaining black pepper and garlic. Stir thoroughly.
