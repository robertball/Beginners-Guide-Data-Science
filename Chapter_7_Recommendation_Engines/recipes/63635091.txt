Ingredients:
1 can Crescent roll dough
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup white sugar
4 ounces lemon curd
1/2 cup confectioners sugar
1-1/2 teaspoons butter, softened
1-1/2 teaspoons milk, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Remove crescent roll from package, leaving it in its original tube shape.
Cut dough into 8 equal pieces, and place on parchment-lined baking sheet.
Using your thumb, make a deep indentation in each piece of dough leaving the bottom intact.
Mix cream cheese, vanilla and white sugar together until smooth.
Place a heaping teaspoon of lemon curd in the indentation of each roll.
Top with a tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until edges of rolls are just golden brown.
Remove from pan to cool.
Mix confectioners sugar, butter and milk together to make the consistency for drizzling.
Drizzle icing over cooled danish.

Description: 
I just love this quick and easy treat!  So easy and so good.  Any type of jam or jelly with work with this as well as something like Nutella.  They keep well for a few days, too.
