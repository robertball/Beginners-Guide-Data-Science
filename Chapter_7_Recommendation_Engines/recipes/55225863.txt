Ingredients:
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
3 eggs
1/2 cup applesauce
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1 pinch salt
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon instant coffee
1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 square baking dish.
Combine the black beans, eggs, oil, cocoa powder, salt, vanilla extract, sugar, and instant coffee in a blender; blend until smooth; pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top of the mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges start to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes.
