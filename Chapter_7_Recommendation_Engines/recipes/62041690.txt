Ingredients:
1 pkg. (18-20) frozen roll dough
1 small package butterscotch pudding (not instant)
1/2 cup sugar
2 Tablespoons cinnamon
1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)
1 cube butter, melted

Directions:
Before going to bed, place frozen dough in a greased bundt or angel food pan.  Mix pudding mix, sugar, cinnamon and nuts.  Sprinkle over the frozen dough.  Pour the melted butter over the top as evenly as you can.  Cover with a towel and leave out on the counter or table overnight.  In the morning, bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or until lightly brown on top.  To serve turn pan over onto a serving dish.  Lift carefully because the sauce will run out.
