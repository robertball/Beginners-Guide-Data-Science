Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) loaf unsliced, round pumpernickel rye bread
1 (12 ounce) can corned beef
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 small dill pickles, finely chopped
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or as needed
2 tablespoons dill pickle juice, or to taste
1 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste

Directions:
Cut a hole in the top of the pumpernickel loaf (creating about a 6-inch lid); hollow out, keeping bread in chunks. Store extra bread in a resealable bag until ready to serve.
Shred the corned beef into a bowl, and add the onion, dill pickles, cream cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, and pickle juice. Season with garlic powder. Mash together until evenly mixed. Add additional pickle juice or mayonnaise if desired to achieve a spreadable consistency.
Spoon the corned beef mixture into the hollowed-out pumpernickel loaf. Place the lid back on top, and refrigerate until ready to serve.
