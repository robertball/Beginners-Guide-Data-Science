Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
2 cups milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, white sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
Pour milk and vanilla extract into the well; add beaten eggs. Mix wet and dry ingredients together until smooth.
Grease a skillet with oil and heat over medium heat.
Pour 1/4 cup of batter per pancake into the hot skillet; cook until bottom is golden brown and there are many small pinholes in the top of the pancake, about 2 minutes. Flip pancake and continue cooking until golden brown and the middle of the pancake is set, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, greasing skillet with oil between pancakes as needed.

Description: 
I found a recipe here that I ended up changing so much it hardly resembled what I started out with, and my family LOVED them. I thought it would be a nice addition. These pancakes are a blend of good and not-so-good-for-you ingredients, hence the name.
