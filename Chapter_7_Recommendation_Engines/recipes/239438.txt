Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups quinoa flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups flaxseed milk
3 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Grease a griddle or large skillet and preheat over medium heat.
Stir quinoa flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir flaxseed milk, eggs, melted butter, and honey into the flour mixture until you have a thin batter.
Pour 1/4 cup batter onto your hot cooking surface per pancake and cook until bubbles form on top, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the pancake and cook until browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes more.

Description: 
I recently (at 33 years old) learned I am gluten-intolerant and have begun exploring gluten-free cooking. We love pancakes in my house, and I created this recipe to fill the void. We all gobble them down!
