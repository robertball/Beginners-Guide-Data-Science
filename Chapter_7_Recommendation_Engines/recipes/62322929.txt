Ingredients:
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 lb. hot Italian sausage with fennel
1 cup chopped red onion
3 cloves pressed fresh garlic
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 Tbsp. butter
1 1/4 cups Arborio rice
1 cup Pinot Grigio (or any other nice white wine)
3 1/2 cups chicken broth (One box Pacific Organic)
12 oz. fresh Lima beans
1/2 c. freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a Dutch oven or saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Saute sausage and onion until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and thyme and cook until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add butter. Add rice and stir to absorb butter and sausage juices, about 2 minutes. Add wine and stir until absorbed, another few minutes.
Stir in 3 cups of the broth. Lower heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until broth is absorbed, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes. Add the Lima beans. Continue adding broth, 1/4 cup at a time, stirring until liquid is adsorbed and rice is tender and creamy. Keep stirring every few minutes or it will stick to the bottom of the pot. Stir in Parmesan. Serve immediately, with freshly ground pepper to taste.
