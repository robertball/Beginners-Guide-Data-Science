Ingredients:
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup uncooked quinoa
cooking spray
1 (8 ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 egg
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 cups pasta sauce
1 1/2 zucchini, sliced
2 cups baby spinach leaves
1 ball fresh mozzarella, shredded

Directions:
Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Mix ricotta cheese, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, egg, basil, parsley, and oregano together in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper.
Spread cooked quinoa in the bottom of the baking dish. Top with 1/3 of the pasta sauce. Cover with zucchini slices and ricotta mixture. Top with another 1/3 of the pasta sauce. Scatter all the spinach on top. Cover with remaining 1/3 of the pasta sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
This is a delicious way to use quinoa. It's comfort food with a healthy twist with vegetables and low-calorie cheeses. I adapted it from a recipe found in Eating Well. Although it's gluten-free, it doesn't taste like it.
