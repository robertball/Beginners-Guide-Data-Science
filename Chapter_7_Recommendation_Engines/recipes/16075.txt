Description: 
This is the result of a day at home with my brother and nothing to do. We decided to create a new lunch. Serve on rolls or sandwich bread; this is especially nice if you toast the bread, or use a flavorful whole-grain bread. The chicken can be substituted with turkey, and the ingredients can be rearranged to suit differing tastes. Enjoy!
