Ingredients:
3 pounds assorted root vegetables (such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, parsnips, carrots, and celery root)
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 teaspoon sea salt
2 tablespoons finely minced garlic
1 tablespoon each finely minced sage, oregano, rosemary, and thyme

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Peel and slice the root vegetables into "fries." Transfer the vegetable fries to a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Boil the fries for 5 to 7 minutes, until just cooked through but not soft. (Watch carefully so as not to overcook.) Drain the water.
Add the coconut oil, sea salt, garlic, and herbs to the fries and stir briefly. Cover the pot and shake vigorously until the fries are well mixed with their edges slightly mashed.
Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Arrange the fries on the tray so none are overlapping. Place in the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, flipping once halfway through. Remove when the edges turn golden and crispy.

Description: 
These may be the best veggie fries you'll ever eat. The trick is to boil the root vegetables and then shake them vigorously before baking. The herbs and garlic generously coat the outside and the smudged edges will turn crispy in the oven. If you're pressed for time, you can omit the extra steps and send them straight to the oven, though those few extra minutes will yield truly amazing results. Make a big enough batch to share--these won't last long!
