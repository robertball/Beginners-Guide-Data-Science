Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®)
2 cups canned pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped onion
1/4 cup sweet pickle relish
2 tablespoons dill pickle juice
2 tablespoons ketchup

1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Tabasco®)
1 dash liquid smoke flavoring
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt-free seasoning blend
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Melt vegan margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion. Cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix together with beans in a casserole dish.
Stir relish, pickle juice, ketchup, molasses, tomato paste, brown sugar, hot sauce, liquid smoke, garlic powder, salt seasoning, and mustard together in a bowl. Add to the bean mixture and mix to coat.
Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is thick and casserole is heated through, about 1 hour.
