Ingredients:
4 lbs pork ribs
3/4 cup light brown sugar
1 tsp hickory smoke salt
1 Tbsp paprika
1 Tbsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp ground red pepper (optional)
2 cups of your favorite barbecue sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
Peel off tough membrane that covers the bony side of the ribs.
Mix together the sugar and spices to make the rub.
Apply rub to ribs on all sides.  Lay ribs on two layers of foil, shiny side out and meaty side down.  Lay two layers of foil on top of ribs and roll and crimp edges tightly, edges facing up to seal.
Place on baking sheet and bake for 2 hours or until meat is starting to shrink away from the ends of the bone.  Remove from oven. Increase heat of oven to 350.   Open the foil and roll back the edges to expose the ribs, (watch out for the steam!) and tilt the pan and use a small measuring cup to remove the excess liquid.  Cut ribs into serving sized portions of 2 or 3 ribs.  Slather the meaty side of the ribs with sauce, and return them to oven for 30-45 mins.
Alternately, you can grill the ribs on your grill to cook on the sauce.
NOTE: The smoked hickory salt can be made by mixing liquid smoke with sea salt and letting it dry out on a cookie sheet.

Description: 
Just to say, these are the BEST and the EASIEST ribs ever! They are absolutely fall-off-the-bone tender. Make sure to take the membrane off the ribs. Dry the slab of ribs dry and just grip one end of the membrane with a dry paper towel and pull towards you. The membrane should come off easily and quickly!
