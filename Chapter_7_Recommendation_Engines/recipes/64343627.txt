Ingredients:
2.5 – 3 lbs ground chuck (may also add ½ lb ground pork or turkey if desired)
¾ green bell pepper
¾ lg white onion
3 – 4 large cloves fresh garlic
1/2 cup fresh chopped parsley or 1 tablespoon dried
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning blend
2 whole eggs (beaten)
1/8 cup milk or cream
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
½ teaspoon black pepper
½ teaspoon salt
1 ½ cups quick cooking oats
1 medium can tomato sauce
=========================
For Sauce
Medium can tomato sauce
¼ cup brown sugar
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
¼ teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Super finely mince bell pepper, onion and garlic (use a processer if you have one).  Remove all finger jewelry and using your hands combine veggies with remaining ingredients.  Shape meatloaf mixture into desired loaf and chill for ½ hour in the fridge.
If you have one, use a pan that will allow the meat juices (fat) to drip away from the loaf while it bakes.  Otherwise use a standard loaf pan or a baking sheet with a cookie rack.   Place the meatloaf into the preheated oven for 15 minutes, lower heat to 325 degrees and continue cooking for 45 minutes or until ¾ of the way done.  You can tell how done by pressing on the loaf’s sides and judging by the “give in the middle”.
While your meatloaf is in the oven is the time to combine and whisk your sauce together.  Let it stand at room temperature until ready to use.
When meatloaf is 3/4s of the way done, remove from oven, whisk tomato sauce and slowly spoon half over the top,  carefully dripping it so it runs down and completely covers the sides too.  Put it back into the oven for 15 minutes and repeat the spooning process with the remaining half of the sauce.  Finish in the oven for an additional 15 minutes.
Remove from oven and allow to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing  ?
ENJOY!!!!
