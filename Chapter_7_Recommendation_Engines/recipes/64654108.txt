Ingredients:
1-2 gallon-sized bags popped popcorn
1 stick butter
2 tablespoons corn syrup
1/2 cups sugar
2 tablespoons water
3 ounces cherry flavored gelatin

Directions:
1. Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Add in sugar, gelatin, syrup, and water.
2. Once the sugar is dissolved and everything smooth, pour it over your popcorn and stir thoroughly.   It will be sticky!
3. Once you have it mixed well, you’ll need to bake it. I sprayed my baking pan with olive oil spray.
4. Turn the oven to 275 degrees and bake popcorn for 20 minutes.  I stopped halfway through and stirred.
5. Once the popcorn is out it may stick together, so you’ll just need to break it apart.
