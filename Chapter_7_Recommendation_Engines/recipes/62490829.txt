Ingredients:
2 lbs  Pork Tenderloin (or any cut of pork you prefer)
1/2 cup Hoisin Sauce
1/3 cup Soy Sauce
1/3 cup Mirin  (Sherry can also be used here)
1/4 cup Honey
1 Tbs Red Food Coloring (Use only if you NEED the color)

Directions:
Slice tenderloin into quarters lengthwise and once across the center (8 pieces, about 4-5" long and 1" diameter.
Mix the remainder of the ingredients in a bowl for a marinade.
Add pork and 1/2 to 3/4 of the marinade to a plastic bag or other container to marinate the pork for 2-24 hours.  Refrigerate saved marinade.
Place pork on rack or grill top under high heat (Preheated to 400-450F) for 8-10 minutes, reduce heat (to ~325F) and slow cook for 30-35 minutes or until done.  Use the saved marinade for a basting during the cooking process as desired.
Once cooked, let cool and cut into 1/4" slices for Lo Mein, or small cubes for fried rice.
This can also be served alone on a skewer as a Satay dish if you like.
