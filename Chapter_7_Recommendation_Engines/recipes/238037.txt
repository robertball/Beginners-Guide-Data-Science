Description: 
What's the best thing about being a chef? It's being able to name your dishes anything you want! The exotic, tropical tang of the fruit and the richness of the wild salmon work wonderfully together. The 'bango' comes from the spicy sweet pepper jam I use to bind the fresh mango relish.
