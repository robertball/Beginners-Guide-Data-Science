Line the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish with slices of chipped beef. Wrap bacon slices around chicken breasts, and place on top of chipped beef. In a medium bowl, mix together condensed soup and sour cream. Pour sour cream mixture over chicken breasts, and sprinkle with paprika.

Description: 
This is so easy! I use it when I'm having people over for dinner because it can easily be doubled to feed a large gathering or dinner party. Once you put it in the oven, you can forget about it for 2 hours and move on to something else. It's always a huge hit with our guests! Serve over rice and enjoy!
