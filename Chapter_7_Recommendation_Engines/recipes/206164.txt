Ingredients:
1 tablespoon cornmeal for dusting
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup semolina flour
1/4 cup cornmeal
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups buttermilk, or more as needed
1/3 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter an 8x8-inch baking dish and sprinkle 1 tablespoon cornmeal over the bottom of the dish.
Sift the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, 1/4 cup cornmeal, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk the eggs, buttermilk, and vegetable oil together in a separate large bowl. Mix the flour mixture into the egg mixture until just combined; don't overmix. The batter should be pourable; add more buttermilk as needed to get the right consistency.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe from my hometown of Sarajevo, and it is similar to a southern cornbread. What makes it unique is the addition of semolina flour (or Cream of WheatÂ®). If you don't have semolina flour, you can just replace it with additional corn meal. This recipes also makes excellent muffins.
