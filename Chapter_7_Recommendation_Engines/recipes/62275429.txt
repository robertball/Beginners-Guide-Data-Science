Ingredients:
3 pounds carrots peeled and diced
1 large sweet potato peeled and diced
2 large onions peeled and diced
2 cloves garlic chopped
1 large can (32 oz.) vegetable broth
1 small can(6 oz) tomato paste
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley
1 tsp salt
1 tsp. black pepper
1/2 tsp. paprika
1 tsp Tabasco (optional but we always add much more than this!)

Directions:
Place carrots, potatoes, onion, garlic and parsley in large stock pot.  Fill with just enough water to cover.  Cook until tender.
Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.
Remove from heat and let stand 10 minutes.
Using a hand blender, puree until smooth and creamy making sure there are no lumps.  You can also do this in a stand blender but you must wait until the soup is cool enough to be transfered safely and it will take several attempts to complete.

What's for dinner, mom?
