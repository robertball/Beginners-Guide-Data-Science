Ingredients:
2 T extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
2 medium white onions, thinly sliced, about 2 cups
kosher salt
1 lb. brussels sprouts, tough outer leaves removed and trimmed
4 oz. bacon, cut into medium cubes, about 1/4 cup
5 fresh sage leaves, finely chopped
1 medium lemon
Flaky sea salt (such as Maldon)
Crushed red chile flakes

Directions:
In a large skillet set over low heat, heat the olive oil.  Add the onions and a large pinch of kosher salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are sweet and caramelized, about 30 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside.
In a large stockpot, blanch the Brussels sprouts in salted, boiling water until bright green and just tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove the Brussels sprouts from the water and set aside to cool.  Cut some of the larger Brussels sprouts in half but leave the smaller ones whole.
In a medium skillet set over medium heat, cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until it is crisp on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Pour off the excess fat, leaving about 1 tablespoon.  Add the halved Brussels sprouts cut side down to the pan and cook without stirring over medium heat until the sprouts are tender and nicely caramelized.  Add the remaining sprouts to the pan and cook until browned, about 5 minutes more.  Stir in the caramelized onions and sage.  Finish the dish with a few drops of freshly squeezed lemon juice, sea salt, chile flakes and a drizzle of olive oil, all to taste.  Serve immediately.
