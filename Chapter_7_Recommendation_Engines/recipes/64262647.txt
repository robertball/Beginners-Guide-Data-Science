Ingredients:
1 cup pumpkin puree
2 eggs
2 cups almond milk
2 cups gluten free all purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Whisk pumpkin puree and eggs together in a bowl until smooth. Add milk, flour, baking powder, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg; whisk until batter is smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
