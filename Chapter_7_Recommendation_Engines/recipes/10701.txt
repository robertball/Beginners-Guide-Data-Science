Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese
1 egg, separated
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1 cup finely chopped walnuts
1/4 cup apricot preserves

Directions:
Cream butter, cream cheese, egg yolk, vanilla, lemon peel and salt until fluffy.  Gradually mix in confectioners' sugar, then the flour to make stiff dough.
Chill dough for 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Shape dough into 30 - one inch balls.
Beat egg white until foamy. Dip balls in egg white then roll in chopped nuts.  Arrange 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet and make a depression in each with your thumb.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, until cookies begin to brown on the bottoms. Carefully remove to wire rack and while hot fill each depression with 1/2 teaspoon of apricot preserves or your favorite jam.
