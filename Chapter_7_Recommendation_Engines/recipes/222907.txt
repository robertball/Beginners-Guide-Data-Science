Ingredients:
1/2 cup baby spinach leaves
1/2 cup arugula
1 clove garlic, slivered
1 bone-in chicken thighs with skin
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt

Directions:
Stuff spinach leaves, arugula, and garlic under the skin of the chicken thigh and place on a baking dish. Sprinkle with seasoned salt.
Bake chicken thigh in the oven set at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
Arugula was on sale and I wanted to find new ways to use it. This became a quick favorite. I've found that there's no need to preheat the oven; a little longer cooking time produces a juicy thigh with crispy skin.
