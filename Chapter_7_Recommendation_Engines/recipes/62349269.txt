Directions:
Boil eggs.
Boil potatoes until tender(or I do them in the microwave). Cool
Cut up into bite sized pieces in large bowl. Crumble eggs over potatoes.
Mix the rest of the ingredients in another bowl and pour over potatoes and mix gently. Can add more seasonings to your family's taste. Keep refrigerated.

Description: 
Creamy potato salad made by my Mom who taught my Dad how to make it after she had a stroke. I was amazed how well he did, he never made a thing until Mom could no longer do any thing, he picked up the kitchen duties very quickly and was really good at it. I miss them every day.
