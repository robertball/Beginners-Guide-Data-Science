Ingredients:
1 pastry for single-crust pie
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1/2 cup rice milk
6 large egg whites
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons molasses
4 teaspoons canola oil
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 10-inch pie plate with pie crust.
Combine pumpkin puree, rice milk, egg whites, sugar, molasses, oil, cinnamon, cloves, vanilla extract, salt, and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl. Beat until blended using a hand mixer or whisk. Pour filling into the pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until the middle is set, 50 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
I developed this recipe because I am lactose intolerant and am always looking for dairy-free recipes. It also happens to be low cholesterol, low fat, and high flavor! What's not to love? I call it pumpkin spice pie because I like a lot more spice in my pie than the average recipe calls for. Happy baking (and eating)!
