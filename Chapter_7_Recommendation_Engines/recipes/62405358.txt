Ingredients:
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 eggs
2 tablespoons water
Panko bread crumbs
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 (4 ounce) beef cube steaks
1/2 jar Spaghetti sauce
4 slices mozzarella cheese
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a shallow dish, stir together the flour, salt and pepper. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and water with a fork. In a third bowl, or shallow dish, mix together the crumbs, 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese and basil.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dredge the cube steaks in the seasoned flour, dip into the egg mixture, and coat with the cracker crumb mixture. Place them in the skillet, and fry just until browned on each side. Arrange steaks in a single layer in a greased casserole dish.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven.  Spoon Spaghetti sauce over steaks when the 15 minutes are up. Cover and cook 30 minutes more. Uncover and top each steak with mozzarella cheese and remaining Parmesan cheese; sprinkle remaining oregano over the top. Bake for 5 more minutes, or until the cheese is melted, and the sauce is hot.
