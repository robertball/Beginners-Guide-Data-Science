Ingredients:
leftover:
stuffing/dressing
cranberry sauce
turkey
gravy
mashed potatoes

Directions:
Brush a baking dish with butter(depending on how many leftovers you have, will determine the size).  Layer in order of above.  I usually put dark meat on one side and white meat on the other.
Wrap tightly & freeze.
Before baking drizzle all over with melted butter. Bake uncovered at 350 for 1 hour or until heated thru.

Description: 
This is such a yummy casserole.  When we take it out of the freezer a few months later, it is liking having Thanksgiving again in every bite!
