Ingredients:
1 (19 ounce) can ready-to-serve lentil soup
1 cup cooked brown rice
1 (7.75 ounce) can unsalted mixed vegetables, drained
1 large canned roasted red pepper, diced
1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Combine soup, rice, mixed vegetables, peppers and 6 tablespoons of the cheddar cheese in a 2-quart, microwave-safe casserole or baking dish. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and level the top of the mixture. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of cheddar cheese.
Cover and cook in a microwave oven at full power until heated through and the cheese has melted (about 5 minutes).
Uncover and cool for 1 minute before serving.

Description: 
Vegetarian main dishes often require hours of chopping and cooking, and a laundry list of ingredients â€“ but not in this dish. This easy casserole turns a can of vegetarian lentil soup into a hearty casserole with the help of nutritious, ready-to-serve whole-grain brown rice, canned vegetables, and cheddar cheese. Because all of the ingredients go into the casserole already cooked (canned vegetables are simply cooked vegetables in a can), all they need is a few minutes in a microwave before they are delightfully done and ready to serve.
