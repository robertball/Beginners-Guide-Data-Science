Ingredients:
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 pound ground beef
1/2 package taco seasoning mix
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 avocado, diced
1 cup shredded lettuce
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup tomatoes, diced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mat.
Spread Cheddar cheese into four 6-inch circles, placed 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts and is lightly brown, 6 to 8 minutes.
Cool for 2 to 3 minutes before lifting with a spatula. Place over wooden spoon handle wrapped in aluminum foil balanced over 2 cups/cans. Let taco shells cool completely, about 10 minutes.
Cook beef in a skillet over medium-high heat until browned, stirring often to separate meat, about 7 minutes. Season with taco seasoning, salt, and pepper; cook for 1 minute more.
Divide beef mixture among cheese taco shells. Top with avocado, lettuce, Cheddar cheese, and tomatoes.
