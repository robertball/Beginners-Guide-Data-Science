Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups very warm water
1 Tbsp. active dry yeast
1 Tbsp. salt
1/8 cup olive oil
1/4 cup honey
6 1/2 cups fresh ground whole wheat flour
1/4 to 1/2 cup vital wheat gluten
Additional whole wheat flour if needed

Directions:
Warm oven to 175 degrees F, then turn off.
In a KitchenAid or other heavy-duty mixer equipped with a dough hook, mix together the water and yeast.  (If desired, add 1 tsp. of the honey and let sit for 5 minutes.)
Stir in the salt, oil, and honey.  Mix in 3 1/2 cups of the flour.
Mix in vital wheat gluten.
Gradually add remaining flour and knead until dough comes together and cleans sides of mixer.
Knead five minutes, adding additional flour if necessary.
Place dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat.  Cover and let rise 25 minutes in warm oven or until double.
Punch down.  Spray bread pans with cooking oil.  Divide dough into two or three equal pieces.  Form loaves and place in pans.  Spray tops with cooking oil.  Place in oven and let rise 15 minutes or until almost double.  With dough in oven, turn oven on to 350 degrees F.  Cook 25-30 minutes or until loaves are golden and hollow-sounding when tapped.
Immediately remove from pans and place on wire racks to cool.
