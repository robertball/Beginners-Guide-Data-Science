Ingredients:
3/4 cup chopped celery OR 1/3 - 1/2 cup chopped dill pickles (my favorite)

1/3 cup chopped onion, optional
1/4 cup or more mayonnaise
seasoning salt
dill
6 buttered hamburger or ciabatta buns (cut diagonally to serve)

Directions:
Combine first 6 ingredients.
Spread mixture on bun bottoms; replace tops (or make as open face).
Wrap each sandwich in foil or lay out open face ones on cookie sheet.
Bake @ 350 x 15 - 18 minutes, or until cheese is melted. Broil open face buns for a few minutes longer, if desired.
Serve hot from the oven.

A yummy hot sandwich as a meal on its own or paired with your favorite soup. The melted cheese adds a lot of flavor. Amp up the cheese and spices to your own taste.
