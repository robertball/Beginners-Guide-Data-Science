Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
10 tablespoons butter, diced
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 egg
2 tablespoons cold water
1 cup water
3/4 cup white sugar
3 eggs
3/8 cup evaporated milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C.)
In a large bowl, mix flour and salt together. Blend in butter with a pastry cutter until mixture resemble coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, beat the egg with the cold water. Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture to form a soft dough. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Divide dough in half. Roll each half out to 1/8 inch thickness. Using a 3.5 inch (8.5 centimeter) fluted round cookie cutter, cut out 22 rounds. Press dough into lightly greased 3 inch tart pans.
In a saucepan over low heat, stir water and sugar until sugar dissolves. Measure 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the resulting syrup and set aside to cool.
In a large bowl, combine eggs, evaporated milk and vanilla. Beat until smooth. Strain into reserved syrup and mix well. Pour into prepared tart shells.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is set.
