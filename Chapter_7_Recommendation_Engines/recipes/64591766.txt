Ingredients:
3 ounces Peach-Basil Syrup (see below) with peach pieces)
11/2 ounces bourbon
3 dashes bitters (I used Prohibition Aromatic Bitters from Atlanta's 1821 Bitters, but Angostura bitters would be good, too)
Ice
2 to 3 ounces sparkling water (such as lime La Croix)
Peach slice
Basil leaf

Directions:
1. Muddle syrup and peach pieces in bottom of shaker to break peaches up. Add bourbon, bitters, and four ice cubes and shake vigorously until ice is nearly gone.
2. Pour into a chilled 8 ounce glass with a few more ice cubes. Add seltzer and stir gently. Top with peach slice and basil leaf.
Peach-Basil Syrup
4 ripe unpeeled peaches, pitted and coarsely chopped
11/2 cups sugar
1 cup water
3 sprigs basil, tied together with string
Bring all ingredients to a boil in a small pot and simmer, stirring, until sugar dissolves. Cool to room temperature in pot. Remove basil sprigs. Pour into clean Mason jar, cover, and chill completely. Makes 2 to 21/2 cups, enough for 8-10 cocktails. Keeps in fridge for up to 3 weeks.
