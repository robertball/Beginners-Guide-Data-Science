Description: 
Chilean sea bass, also known as Patagonian toothfish, has landed on lots of 'do not eat this' lists due to overfishing, but the fish can be found through sustainable sources. Flavored mayonnaise keeps the sea bass moist while it's cooking, and you can create countless sauce variations by changing the seasonings. The recipe is inspired by the cuisine of San Sebastian.
