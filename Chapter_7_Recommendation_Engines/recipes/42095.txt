Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup butter
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup dried currants
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 cup milk, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 baking sheets.
Combine sugar, butter, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Combine flour, currants, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Stir into the butter mixture alternately with tablespoons of milk until the flour is fully incorporated.
Drop spoonfuls of batter onto the prepared baking sheets. Press down lightly with a fork. Dip fork in sugar or water if it sticks.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let stand on the baking sheets for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
