Ingredients:
3 cups water
3 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons butter
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups old-fashioned grits
vegetable oil
6 ounces fresh pork chorizo (Mexican style)
1/4 cup butter
1 small shallot, minced
1 large uncooked lobster tail, meat removed from shell and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 teaspoon chopped garlic
4 ounces shredded Gouda cheese
4 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring water, broth, 2 tablespoons butter, and salt to a boil in a heavy saucepan. Stir in grits. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until water is absorbed and grits are a thick consistency, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly oil a 8x10-inch baking dish.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chorizo; cook and stir, breaking into small pieces, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
Heat 1/4 cup butter in a pot. Add shallot; cook and stir until shallot softens and butter is bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes. Add lobster and garlic. Cook just until lobster turns opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
Whisk shredded Gouda cheese and Cheddar cheese into the grits. Add chorizo, salt, and pepper. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Top with lobster, shallots, and pan drippings.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes.
