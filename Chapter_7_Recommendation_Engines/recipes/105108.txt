Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups dry black beans
4 cups water
3 slices bacon
2 medium onions, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 smoked pork hocks
4 cups water
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 tablespoon chili powder
3/4 teaspoon instant beef bouillon granules
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Rinse black beans. In large saucepan, combine black beans and 4 cups water. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Cover and let stand for 1 hour. (Or, place beans and 4 cups water in large saucepan. Cover and let soak in a cool place for 6 to 8 hours or overnight.) Drain and rinse beans; set aside.
In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon; drain on paper towels. Set aside. Cook onions, celery, and garlic in hot drippings about 5 minutes or until tender. Add black beans, pork hocks, 4 cups water, vinegar, chili powder, beef bouillon, and pepper. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer about 11/2 hours or until beans are tender. Add additional water during cooking, if necessary. Skim off fat. Remove meat. When cool enough to handle, cut meat off bones; coarsely chop meat. Discard bones.
Meanwhile, using a potato masher or fork, lightly mash bean mixture. Return chopped meat to pan. 1 tablespoon cilantro; heat through. To serve, crumble bacon over soup. Top with additional chopped cilantro, if desired.
