Ingredients:
cooking spray
2/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
3 large eggs
1 cup light corn syrup (such as KaroÂ®)
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup chopped pecans
1 (15 ounce) package pastry for a double-crust 9-inch pie, at room temperature

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 mini muffin cups with cooking spray.
Mix white sugar, butter, and flour together in a large bowl until well combined. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and mix well after each addition. Whisk corn syrup and vanilla extract into sugar mixture; fold in pecans.
Roll pie crust pastry onto a floured work surface; cut into circles using end of a drinking glass or a biscuit cutter. This will make 11 crusts. Roll the scraps into a ball and roll back onto the floured surface; cut 1 more circle. Press each circle into the prepared muffin cups. Repeat with remaining pie crust pastry.
Spoon pecan mixture, about 2 tablespoons per pie, into pie crust pastry.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 18 minutes. Allow tarts to cool in muffin tins for 5 minutes before loosening edges from sides of tin; let rest 5 minutes more. Transfer tarts to a wire rack to cool completely.
