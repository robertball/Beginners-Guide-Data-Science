Description: 
This is a recipe dictated to me after much pestering from my best friend Shelly from Bangladesh who never writes anything down. The unique thing about THIS curry is that one day she accidentally used corned beef and it was FANTASTIC (you may use brisket beef or lamb instead) so I have adapted it to the recipe. Trust me when you eat this beef curry you will never want to try another, its THAT good!
