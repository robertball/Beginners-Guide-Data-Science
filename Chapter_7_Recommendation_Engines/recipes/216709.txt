Ingredients:
1 large turnip - peeled, halved lengthwise, and sliced 1/2-inch thick
2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle dark beer, or amount to cover
1 pinch dried savory
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the turnip in a pot with enough cold, salted water to cover. Bring the water to a boil and cook until the turnips are soft, about 7 minutes; drain. Transfer the turnips to a shallow baking dish. Dot the top of the turnips with pieces of butter. Pour enough of the beer into the dish to cover the turnips. Season with savory and salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until the beer is mostly cooked off and the turnip is tender, about 1 hour.

Description: 
Turnips are a tough sell, but I find myself liking the bitterness more as I get older! These are sweet, deep, and mark the first time I have ever heard the phrase 'Can I finish the turnips?' This is a great side for turkey or pork roast.
