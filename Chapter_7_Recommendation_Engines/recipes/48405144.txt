Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
5 tablespoons butter, divided
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1 1/2 cups milk
2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 ounces processed cheese food (eg. Velveeta), cubed
2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Cook macaroni according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and ground mustard until smooth. Gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat. Add the cheeses, stirring until cheese is melted. Drain macaroni.
Transfer macaroni to a greased 1-1/2-qt. baking dish. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni; mix well. Melt the remaining butter and pour over top. Sprinkle the bread crumbs over top. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes or until heated through and topping is golden brown.
