2 tablespoons diced onion
2 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoon capers, drained
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Heat a large pan over medium heat.  Add in olive oil and butter.  Let it get very hot then add in shallots and garlic.  Let cook for 2 minutes.
Season both sides of the fish with salt and pepper.  Add to the pan and cook the first side for 3 minutes then flip over.
Meanwhile in a large bowl add the petite tomatoes.  Take the juice and pour into the pan with the fish to add extra flavor.
Add in salt, pepper, basil, onion, garlic, capers, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Combine well using a large spoon.
Reduce heat to a low temperature and top each fish with the bruschetta.  Cover for 2-3 minutes to let it warm through then remove from pan and plate to enjoy with your favorite side dish!
