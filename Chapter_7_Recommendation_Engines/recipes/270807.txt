Ingredients:
1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup brown sugar, or more to taste
1 (5.3 ounce) container blueberry skyr (such as Siggi'sÂ®)
2 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoons honey
2 large lemons, zested
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups frozen blueberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition. Mix in blueberry yogurt, honey, and lemon zest.
Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Gradually add to the yogurt mixture and mix until well combined. Fold in blueberries using a spatula.
Divide batter among prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I fell in love with skyr when I visited Iceland a few years ago. It's a mild, thick yogurt and high in protein as an added bonus. I used blueberry-flavored skyr to make these muffins and it gave them such a tender texture!
