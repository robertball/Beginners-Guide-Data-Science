Ingredients:
2 cups candied cherries
1 cup raisins
1 cup blanched almonds
1 cup dried pineapple pieces
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups butter
6 eggs
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line two loaf pans with parchment paper.
Coat cherries, raisins, almonds, and pineapple with 1 cup flour.
Beat sugar, butter, and eggs together until creamy. Sift remaining flour with baking powder and salt. Add to butter mixture; stir in vanilla and almond extracts. Fold in the fruit and almond mixture. Spoon batter into the prepared pans and spread evenly.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Wrap cakes tightly and let age in a cool place for 2 to 4 weeks.
