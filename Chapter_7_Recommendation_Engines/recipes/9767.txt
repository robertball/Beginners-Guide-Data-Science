1/2 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Cream together the butter and salt while slowly adding the powdered sugar.  Add the nuts, vanilla and flour and mix until well blended.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough in the shape of logs about 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces and bake for 15 to  18 minutes.
Roll cookies in powdered sugar when they are still warm.  Let cool on wire racks.
