Description: 
Tonight, I was desperate to use up the chicken and fresh spinach in my fridge. I didn't have much energy or time and I couldn't find anything I wanted to make. I took a chance and threw this together from what I had on hand and it turned out great! It can be as simple or as fancy as you want. My picky 5-year olds and husband enjoyed it (except the spinach), so that pretty much makes it a keeper.
