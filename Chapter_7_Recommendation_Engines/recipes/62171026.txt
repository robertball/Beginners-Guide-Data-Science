Ingredients:
FOR THE FILLING:
2/3 c. dried cranberries
4 medium apples, any baking variety, peeled and sliced
1 T sugar
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/8 tsp. nutmeg
FOR THE TOPPING:
1/2 c. butter or margarine
1/2 c. whole wheat pastry flour
1/2 c. bran
3/4 c. sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1 egg, beaten
1/4 c. chopped walnuts, optional
Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, optional

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the dried cranberries in a small bowl, cover them with hot water, and microwave them on HIGH about 20-30 seconds to soften them.  Drain the cranberries and combine them, then combine them with the apple slices.  Transfer fruit to a 9-inch pie dish and do not fill more than two-thirds full.
Mix the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a small bowl and sprinkle over the fruit.
To make topping, melt butter or margarine and set aside.  In a separate bowl, stir together pastry flour, bran, sugar, salt, and egg until blended.  Whisk in butter or margarine, then drop spoonfuls of topping over fruit and if using nuts, sprinkle them on top.
Bake pie until golden brown, about 40-45 minutes.  Serve warm, with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping, if desired.

Description: 
I could not find a healthier version of Swedish Apple pie so here is one I came up with using whole wheat pastry flour and bran.  The topping is nice and crunchy while the apples are very soft.  The spices may be adapted to suit your own taste.
