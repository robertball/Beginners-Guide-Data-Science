Ingredients:
2 cups almond flour
4 eggs
1/4 cup Greek yogurt (such as FageÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste

Directions:
Beat almond flour, eggs, Greek yogurt, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl with a mixer at high speed until creamy.
Heat a skillet over medium heat; add just enough olive oil to cover the surface.
Ladle 1/4 cup of the batter into the center of the hot skillet; cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
Store this low-carb pan-fried bread in an airtight container between sheets of waxed paper. I add seasonings such as onion powder, garlic powder, or ground chipotle pepper. It needs to be in powder form to keep it from getting too moist.
