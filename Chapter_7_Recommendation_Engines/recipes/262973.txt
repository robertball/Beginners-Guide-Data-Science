Ingredients:
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
salt
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Spread out trimmed asparagus in 1 layer on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Roll asparagus back and forth so it is evenly covered with olive oil
Bake in the preheated oven until asparagus is lightly browned and easily pierced with a knife, 20 to 30 minutes depending on the thickness of the asparagus. Flip asparagus after 15 minutes. Season with salt and drizzle with balsamic vinegar. Bake until balsamic vinegar starts to caramelize, about 1 minute more.
