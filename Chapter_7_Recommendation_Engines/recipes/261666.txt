Ingredients:
2 sheets frozen puff pastry
2 tablespoons butter
1 (8 ounce) package white mushrooms, finely chopped
1 (6 ounce) package portobello mushrooms, finely chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Set frozen puff pastry sheets on a counter and thaw for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin tins.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add white mushrooms and portobello mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally and adding garlic halfway through, until liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Add Italian seasoning and pepper.
Unfold pastry sheets onto a lightly floured surface; roll each into a 12x16-inch rectangle. Cut each rectangle into twelve 4-inch squares. Drape squares into muffin cups. Place 1 1/2 teaspoon mozzarella cheese into each cup and spoon 1 1/2 teaspoon mushroom mixture on top. Add a portion of Parmesan cheese. Gather the 4 edges of the square to the middle; twist to seal the puff and seal the edges. Repeat until cups are filled.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I was trying to think of something that would be a savory hors d'oeuvre to bring to a dinner party. After stumbling across a few recipes that were close, but not quite what I wanted, I came up with my own recipe. Everyone raved and there was not one left to take home! Enjoy!
