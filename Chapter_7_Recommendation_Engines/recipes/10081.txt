1 egg
1 tablespoon orange zest
1/2 cup orange juice
1 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Beat all ingredients except flour and nuts in a large bowl with mixer on medium speed until blended (mixture will look curdled).
With mixer on low speed beat in flour just until blended. Stir in walnuts.
Drop by rounded tablespoon 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes until tops look dry. Cool on cookie sheet 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.  Frost with Orange Cream Cheese Frosting (see footnote for link to recipe).
