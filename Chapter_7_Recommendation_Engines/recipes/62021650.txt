Ingredients:
2 pkgs active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees)
2 cups scalded milk
1/2 cup margarine
7 cups unbleached white flour
1 cup sugar
1 cup mashed potatoes
2 eggs
2 tsp salt
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped nuts
melted butter or margarine
cinnamon-sugar

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Scald milk with margarine and let cool to lukewarm.  Add cooled milk mixture to the dissolved yeast.  Stir in 4 cups flour.  Add the sugar, mashed potatoes, eggs, and salt.  Gradually add enough flour to make a soft dough.  Cover and let rise until double (1 hr).
Punch down the dough and divide in half. Roll each into a 1/2" thick rectangle.  Brush with melted butter or margarine, then sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar, raisins and nuts.  Roll up from the long edge, press edges.  Cut one-inch slices.  Place on greased cooky sheet.  Cover and let rise until doubled (30 mins).  Bake at 350 degrees about 20 mins.  Ice with powdered-sugar icing.
