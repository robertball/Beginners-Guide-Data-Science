Title:
Taco Pie "Pie for supper??" Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 vidalia onion
1 1/2 pounds (or so) ground beef
1 small can chopped green chilies
1 packet taco seasoning
2 frozen pie crust (1 for top 1 for bottom)
2 cups grated cheese
refried beans

Directions:
First brown the beef with sliced or chopped onions (I like vidalia onions because they are sweeter and tender) Drain beef then return to the pan and add green chilies and taco seasoning, add a few tablespoon water to help blend the seasonings but not too much.  Spread a thin layer of refried beans on the bottom of an unbaked pie shell that has been brought to room temp.  (I use the dehydrated refried beans in the bag, they taste better than canned, canned smell like dog food) then add a layer of cheese (whatever is your favorite I use a mexican blend) then add the ground beef mixture, then add another layer of cheese and top with the top crust.  Pinch the edges with a fork to seal then bake on a cookie sheet in the oven on about 375 to 400 until the crust is golden. Serve with my recipes for mexican potatoes and cornbread peppers on this sight.
Use more or less ingrediants to suit your taste.
Hint-- buy a frozen pie crust that has 2 pie crusts, let them both come to room temp, fill one with your goodies then carefully pull the edges away from the other one, slowly flip the pie crust and use it as your top crust.
