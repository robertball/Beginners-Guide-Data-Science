Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 cups sugar
2 cups light corn syrup
2 cups heavy whipping cream, divided
2 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Combine butter, sugar, corn syrup, and 1 cup whipping cream in a large, heavy stockpot. Cover over medium-low heat, stirring gently, until sugar dissolves.
Turn heat to medium and cook until candy thermometer reaches 224 F, stirring occasionally. Stir in the remaining 1 cup whipping cream. Continue to cook over medium heat until thermometer registers 245 F (soft ball stage). Add vanilla.
Pour mixture into a greased 9 x 13 pan. Cool overnight and then cut into squares. Wrap individually in wax paper.
After caramels have cooled and been cut, try dipping some halfway or completely in melted chocolate. Place the dipped caramels on a sheet of wax paper sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. If desired, sprinkle with kosher or coarse sea salt for a gourmet treat.
