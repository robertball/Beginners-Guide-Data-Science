Ingredients:
2 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup wheat germ
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup whole wheat all-purpose flour
3/4 cup raisins (optional)
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup honey
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup applesauce
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Optional:  nuts, dried cranberries, dried apples, flaked coconut, trail mix, mini chocolate chips.  Modify by adding extracts to compliment additions.  Gently melt some chocolate or Nutella, and drizzle over the top of bars once they're out of the oven!

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a large bowl, mix together the oats, brown sugar, wheat germ, cinnamon, flour, raisins (and any additional mix-ins) and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in the honey, egg, oil, applesauce, and vanilla. Mix well using your hands. Pat the mixture evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake for 18 to 22 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bars begin to turn golden at the edges. Cool for 5 minutes, then cut into bars while still warm. Do not allow the bars to cool completely before cutting, or they will be too hard to cut.
