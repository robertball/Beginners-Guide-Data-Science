Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 pounds boneless chicken, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1 large onion, chopped
5 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 cup water
1 cup chicken broth
3/4 cup peanut butter
2 cups chopped fresh spinach

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-heat heat; cook the chicken in the skillet until completely brown, 5 to 7 minutes; remove and set aside. Add the onion, potatoes, garlic, pepper, salt, coriander, cumin, and red pepper to the skillet and cook until the onions soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the water, chicken broth, and peanut butter. Return the chicken to the skillet and top with the spinach. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are cooked through, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is a twist of a recipe I found some years ago. I've been passing the recipe around every year as the weather gets cooler. It's a great rib sticker! It also freezes well!
