Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup corn syrup
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
12 ounces chopped pecans
1/4 cup margarine, softened
2 teaspoons baking soda

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or spray with cooking spray.
Mix sugar, corn syrup, maple syrup, water, and salt together in a pot over medium heat until sugar is dissolved, 5 to 10 minutes. Fold pecans into sugar mixture.
Place a candy thermometer in pecan mixture and turn heat up to medium-high. Gently stir mixture until it reaches 300 degrees F (150 degrees C), about 10 minutes.
Quickly removing pot from heat and stir in margarine and baking soda until well mixed. Pour mixture onto the prepared baking sheet and spread out with a spatula. Allow to cool until hardened, about 30 minutes. Break into pieces.

Description: 
A unique twist on peanut brittle. I mixed the seasonal flavors of maple and pecans and it turned out beautifully. The brittle has a slightly buttery taste to it from the nuts and a warmth from the maple.
