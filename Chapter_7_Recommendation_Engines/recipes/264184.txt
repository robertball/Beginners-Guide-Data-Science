Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato
1 large egg
1/4 cup goat cheese
freshly ground black pepper
cayenne pepper to taste
1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
1/2 cup self-rising flour
2 tablespoons butter, or to taste
4 slices bacon, diced

Directions:
Place sweet potato on a microwave-safe plate. Poke holes all over and microwave until completely tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool briefly.
Cut sweet potato in half and scoop flesh into a bowl. Mash thoroughly while still warm. Add egg, goat cheese, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and salt. Whisk until well combined. Add flour; mix with a spatula until no dry spots remain. Cover dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add bacon. Cook and stir until bacon is just starting to crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.
Fry 5 dumplings at a time in the hot butter until golden brown and crusty, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining dumplings. Plate the dumplings and top each serving with some bacon butter.

Description: 
I started off by boiling these, which turned into a waterlogged mess, so I decided to skip that step and just pan-fry the rest. And voila! The experiment came close to what I wanted--something with the taste of roasted sweet potatoes, but with more of a gnocchi-like texture. Enjoy these as a side dish to grilled pork chops, topped with goat cheese and chopped green onions.
