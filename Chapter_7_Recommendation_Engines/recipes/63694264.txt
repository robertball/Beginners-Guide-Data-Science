Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef, 1 package Lipton Spanish rice, Shredded Cheese, 2 large cans enchilada sauce, small flour tortillas, black olives, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes

Directions:
Brown ground beef. Prepare rice per directions. After meat is brown, add half can enchilada sauce and simmer on low heat. Add your rice, mix well. Spray a baking pan. Fill tortillas, sprinkle a little cheese inside and place in pan. Cover the rolled enchiladas with enchilada sauce and sprinkle with cheese.
Bake at 350 for 30 minutes.
This is enough filling to make 2 pans, so it's a great recipe to share. Try different fillings, I like diced cooked potatoes and green peppers.
