Ingredients:
Crust:
2 cups graham cracker crumbs
2 cups Finlandia Unsalted Butter, melted
Filling:
4 (200 g) containers Finlandia Vanilla Bean Creamy Gourmet Cheese
1/2 cup sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
5 eggs
Topping:
Mixed fresh berries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Butter bottom and sides of springform pan.
In medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Press in bottom and two inches up the sides of pan. Set aside.
In mixer bowl, combine creamy gourmet cheese sugar, corn starch, and flour. Beat on low speed until mixed. Beat on medium speed until creamy.
Add eggs one at a time, beating on medium speed only until combined, stopping mixer and scraping sides of bowl, if necessary. Pour batter over crust.
Bake 50 to 60 minutes or until center is set, but still jiggles slightly. To prevent overbrowning, cover top loosely with foil after 45 minutes.
Turn oven off and leave door slightly ajar. Leave cheesecake in oven for one hour to cool gradually.
Remove and place on cooling rack. Cool completely, about 2 1/2 hours.
Serve at room temperature with fresh berries, or cover and refrigerate to serve cold. Store in refrigerator up to three days.
