Ingredients:
FOR THE MEATBALLS
1lb lean ground beef
1lb lean ground pork
1 small onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons dried mustard
1/2 cup ground raw hazelnuts
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon Himalayan salt
1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon ground Ceylon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
FOR THE GRAVY
3 cups bone broth
3/4 cup raw cashew pieces, soaked overnight and drained
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup ghee (or make your own)
2 tablespoons tapioca flour
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon Himalayan salt
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom

Directions:
INSTRUCTIONS
Add all the ingredients for the meatballs to a large mixing bowl and knead well with clean hands to fully combine.
Form into approximately 48 meat balls, roughly the size of a ping pong ball (a small ice cream scoop really helps to do this quickly and efficiently)
Place a large heavy skillet over medium high heat and add a liberal amount of cooking fat, preferably lard. Sear the meatballs until nice and golden all around, about 4-5 minutes. You will probably have to work in batches, so you will want to reserve the partially cooked meatballs to a shallow bowl while you work on the others.
While your meatballs are cooking, add all the ingredients for the gravy to your blender and process on the highest possible speed until completely combined and creamy looking.
Once all the meatballs are cooked, transfer them back to the skillet along with their juices and pour the gravy all over them. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat and cook the meatballs for about 20 to 25 minutes on a slow simmer. Donâ€™t worry if you see quite a lot of foam forming on the surface at the beginning, it will eventually blend right in and completely disappear.
