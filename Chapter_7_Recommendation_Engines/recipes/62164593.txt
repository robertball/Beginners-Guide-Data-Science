Ingredients:
1 pkg no yolks noodles
1 onion chopped (on the larger side)
2 cups of cabbage chopped
2 kielbasa sausages sliced (can substitute chicken or ground beef
1/2 cup sour cream (less if you desire a less creamy sauce)
5 tbs butter
1/4 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp pepper
a couple shakes of garlic powder
olive oil

Directions:
Boil out your noodles and set aside. (noodles can boil while you cook ;)
In a large skillet saute onions and cabbage with 1 tbs butter until soft and sweet. You may add olive oil periodically to keep from burning. Separately prepare kielbasa in another skillet until browned on each side.
Once your onions, sausage and cabbage are prepared add sausage, sour cream, 4 tbs butter, paprika, pepper and garlic powder to the large skillet. Allow to bubble then add noodles. Allow to bubble again and serve in a serving dish. Enjoy!
