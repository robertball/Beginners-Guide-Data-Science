Ingredients:
Prime Rib bottom round center cut
1/4 cup salt
1/4 cup pepper
2 tbl. garlic powder
few sprigs chopped rosemary (optional)

Directions:
Bring Prime Rib to room temp
Preheat oven to 500°F degrees.
Make a rub of salt, pepper, garlic powder and rosemary and apply to meat. Place meat in a shallow roasting pan fat side up. DO NOT COVER. Make sure that the roasting pan you use is not much bigger than the roast so that it cooks in juices.
Roast at 500°F at 5 minutes per pound for RARE, or 6 minutes per pound for MEDIUM and 7 minutes per pound for WELL DONE. I usually put a cookie sheet on the bottom rack and roast on top rack to help with juice splatter.  Turn off oven at the end of cooking time and DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR FOR TWO HOURS.
Open and remove from over after the 2 hours and let rest for 10 minutes.
