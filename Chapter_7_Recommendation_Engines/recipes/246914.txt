Description: 
This refreshing drink is wonderful both chilled and warm. Naturally sweet yet elegant. Great for hot summer days and fancy dinner parties. You could add a little peach or strawberry juice to the finished product if you would like a little more flavor. Garnish with a little fresh mint and rose petals.
