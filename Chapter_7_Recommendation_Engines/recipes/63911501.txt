Ingredients:
Marinade:
2/3 cup mirin or sherry
1 cup soy sauce
1/8 cup rice or white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup pineapple juice from canned pineapple chunks
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1 dash red pepper flakes
black pepper to taste
Qunioa:
1 1/2 cup quinoa (rinsed well)
1/3 cup marinade
1 2/3 cup vegetable stock
Roasted Vegetables:
2 Squash
2 Zucchini
1 large Red onion
1 Eggplant
2 Portobello mushrooms
3 Bell peppers
2 cups Cherry tomatoes
1 15oz can Pineapple chunks
1 15oz can Chickpeas, rinsed

Directions:
Marinade: Whisk together the ingredients for the marinade.
Quinoa: Rinse the quinoa well.  In a pot, add marinade, vegetable stock and quinoa and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer covered for 15-20 minutes.
Roasted Vegetables:  Preheat oven to 425.  Roast the lightly salted chickpeas for 30 minutes while you prepare the marinade. Cube all the vegetables.  Marinade the squash, zucchini, eggplant and mushrooms in a zip lock bag for an hour.  While that is marinading, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and roast the red onions and peppers drizzeled with marinade for 30 minutes.  Roast the cherry tomatoes and pineapple chunks next for 30 minutes.  Do the same for the marinated vegetables until everything is caramelized.
Sauce:  Take 3/4 cup (or whatever is left) of the marinade and cook in a small pan on medium heat until it is reduced by half.
Mix the quinoa and vegetables together and dress with the sauce.  Serve over a bed of spinach and top with roasted chickpeas.
