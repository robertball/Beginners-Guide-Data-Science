Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (18.5 ounce) package yellow cake mix
2 (3.9 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix
1 cup chopped walnuts, divided
1 cup Irish whiskey, divided
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 large eggs
1/2 cup butter
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 6 mini loaf pans with cooking spray.
Combine cake mix, pudding mixes, and 1/2 cup walnuts in a large bowl.
Whisk 1/2 cup Irish whiskey, milk, and oil together in a separate bowl. Whisk in eggs. Pour over cake mixture and stir until blended. Divide batter among the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in brown sugar. Add remaining walnuts, 1 tablespoon whiskey, and water. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in remaining whiskey.
Cool cakes for 5 minutes before inverting a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Use a toothpick to poke small holes across the tops. Pour whiskey topping over cakes and leave to soak in as they cool.
