Ingredients:
1 whole-grain English muffin, split
2 teaspoons tomato salsa
1 strip turkey bacon, chopped
2 tablespoons shredded Italian cheese blend, or as needed

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Put English muffin halves cut-side down onto a baking sheet. Spread 1 teaspoon salsa over each muffin half. Divide bacon between each half and sprinkle enough cheese over the 'pizza' to just cover the sauce.
Bake under the broiler until the cheese is melted, 5 to 10 minutes.
