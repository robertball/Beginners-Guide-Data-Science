Ingredients:
16 large, fresh shrimp
6 dried Guajillo chiles
3 tablespoons of lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3 garlic cloves
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
1/2 cup water (to thin out the chile paste if neccesary)

Directions:
Re-hydrate the chiles by bringing 2 cups of water to a boil, remove from heat place chilies into water and cover with lid for about 20 mintues. Drain water (save about 1/2 cup)and take the rehydrated chiles and blend them with the lime juice, salt, garlic, and onion until the ingredients are well blended. Add the water a little at a time to create a “sauce”-like consistency.
Prepare the shrimp if necessary by removing the head and the legs. You will also need to de-vein each shrimp. Place the prepared shrimp into a large bowl and drizzle the chile sauce over the top. Toss the shrimp in the sauce until well-coated. The lime juice will begin to “cook” the shrimp, so you will need to grill them as soon as possible.
Run the shrimp onto skewers and place on a medium-heat grill for 5-10 minutes or until the shrimp is thoroughly cooked and white all the way through.
Serve with rice as a meal or eat them as an appetizer!
