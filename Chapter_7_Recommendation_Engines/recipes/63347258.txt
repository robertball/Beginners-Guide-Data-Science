Description: 
There are actually two different styles of hot and sour soup. One is Northern China style, which usually looks white. The other is Southern China style, which usually looks red. What makes the Northern one hot is white pepper powder. What makes the Southern one hot is hot bean sauce. The one I am sharing today is the Southern China style, it has a different taste than the Northern one as it has bean sauce in it that has a little bit more oil in the soup.Modified from: Hot and Sour Soup (Suan La Tang)--Southern China Style
