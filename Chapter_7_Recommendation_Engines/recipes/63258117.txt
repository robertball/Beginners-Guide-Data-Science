Ingredients:
1 extra large egg
1 tsp dijon mustard
1 T. lemon juice
1 C. "light tasting" olive oil
1/2 tsp sea salt (to taste)
pinch of cayenne (optional)

Directions:
Add egg, mustard, lemon juice & salt to blender, food processor or a cup (if you're using a stick blender).
Slowly add the olive oil as you're blending until you get the right consistency.  Normally just a couple of minutes, if that and voila!  Homemade mayo.
