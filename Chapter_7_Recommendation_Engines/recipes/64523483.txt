Ingredients:
1 box lemon cake mix
1/2 cup butter (1 stick), softened
1 egg
1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk (I use fat-free)
1/2 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Line a 9x9 baking pan with foil and spray with cooking spray.
Mix butter with a mixer (hand or stand) until smooth. Mix in cake mix and egg; beat until combined. Note: if you use a hand mixer it will take a long time to come together. Just keep on mixing until you get a thick cookie dough.
Press 2/3 of the cake mixture in the bottom of the prepared pan. Sprinkle white chocolate chips over the top and drizzle the sweetened condensed milk over the top of the chocolate. Break up the remaining dough and crumble it over the top of the bars. Press lightly to seal.
Bake for 28-33 minutes, until slightly browned. Cool completely before cutting. (It helps to refrigerate them after theyâ€™ve reached room temperature.)
Note: you can do this in a 9x13 pan by using the whole can (14 oz) of sweetened condensed milk and 1 cup of white chocolate chips, but the bars will be thinner. Baking time will also need to be adjusted.

Description: 
There is only one hard and fast rule about gooey bars: they need to chill and set before you cut them.
