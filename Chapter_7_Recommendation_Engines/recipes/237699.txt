Ingredients:
3 cups 2% milk
2 (3.75 ounce) packages instant French vanilla pudding mix
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool WhipÂ®), thawed
1 (14.4 ounce) package graham crackers
2 cups fresh raspberries (optional)
1/2 (16 ounce) package milk chocolate frosting

Directions:
Stir milk and vanilla pudding mixes together in a bowl until pudding is thick. Fold whipped topping into pudding.
Place 1 layer of graham crackers in the bottom of a 9x13-inch glass dish. Spread a layer of pudding over graham cracker layer; top with a layer of raspberries. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, ending with graham crackers.
Warm frosting in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until melted, 15 to 30 seconds; drizzle over graham crackers. Refrigerate until torte is set, about 4 hours.

Description: 
Favorite man recipe! I add fresh raspberries in the layers to add more flavor! Sometimes I use German chocolate frosting in place of the milk chocolate frosting.
