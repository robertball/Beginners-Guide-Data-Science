Ingredients:
Olive Oil
1/2 lb lean ground meat (your choice)
1 cup chopped onions
1 heaping tbsp of homemade taco seasoning (or you can use the packaged type if you like)
2 cups of cooked rice
3-4 bell peppers, halved and seeds removed
1 can of black beans, drained & rinsed
Â½ cup of corn
1 (15 -16 ounce) jar of salsa (my favorite is mango peach)
Shredded Cheddar Cheese
Toppings:
fresh cilantro
sour cream
sliced avocado

Directions:
Pre heat the oven to 400 degrees. Lightly coat the peppers with olive oil and roast in a baking dish about 20-25 minutes just until cooked thru. Remove the peppers from the oven and allow to cool until you can handle them.
In a bowl add the taco seasoning, cooked ground meat, chopped onions, black beans, corn and rice. Add in the jar of salsa and mix well.
Carefully spoon the meat mixture into each half of the bell peppers and place back into the baking dish. Cook the peppers for another 15-20 minutes or until the peppers are cooked all the way through. Before removing from the oven sprinkle the tops of each pepper with shredded cheddar cheese. Place back into the oven just until the cheese has melted.
Remove from the oven and top with fresh cilantro, avocado slices and/or sour cream just before serving.
