Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, chopped (about 6 c.)
2-3 broccoli crowns, chopped (about 6 c.)
1 pound bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/2 c. onion, finely chopped
1/2 c. raisins (dark or light work, but light look prettier!)
2 c. shredded cheddar cheese
2 c. mayonnaise, regular or light
1 c. sugar
1/4 c. (4 T.) white vinegar

Directions:
1. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet.  Cook over medium heat until evenly brown.  Crumble and set aside.
2. Combine the cauliflower, broccoli, bacon, onion, raisins, and cheese in a large bowl.
3. In a medium bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, sugar, and vinegar.  Pour over salad and toss to coat.  Mixture will appear dry.
4. Refrigerate and allow the salad to chill for at least 2 hours before serving.
Note:  This recipe may easily be cut in half to make a smaller quantity.

Description: 
This salad is a sweet way to get your family and friends to eat their veggies!  Even people who don't like broccoli or cauliflower have found themselves loving it!  I created this recipe to try to imitate a salad we found in Philadelphia's Reading Terminal farmer's market, originally from the Pennsylvania Dutch region.
