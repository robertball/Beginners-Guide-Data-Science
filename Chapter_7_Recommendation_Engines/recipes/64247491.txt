4 medium potatoes, thinly sliced with skin on)
Potato seasoning (1/8 tsp tumeric, 1/8 tsp paprika, 1/8 tsp hot chili powder, 1/8 tsp masala, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/2 Tbsp soy sauce)
Oil for frying
5 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 small onion, chopped
1 tsp ginger root, sliced
1/8 tsp tumeric
1/8 tsp paprika
1/8 tsp hot chili powder
1/8 tsp masala
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Place pork seasoning in large bowl and mix.  Add pork, mix well and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes.
Place potato seasoning in another bowl and mix.  Add potatoes, mix well and set aside for at least 10 minutes.
To cook the potatoes, heat 1-2 Tbsp oil in a large frypan and add potatoes.  Cover pan and cook for 5 minutes.  Turn potatoes, cover pan and cook 3 minutes.  Lower heat and simmer until done (about 45 minutes).
To cook pork, saute garlic, onion, ginger root, 1/8 tsp turmeric, 1/8 tsp chili powder, 1/8 tsp paprika, and 1/8 tsp masala in 1-2 Tbsp oil in large pot.  Stir for 1 minute.  Add pork and mix.  Cook for 3 minutes, stirring often.  Cover and cook an additional 3 minutes.  Stir, cover, and cook 5 minutes more.
Add 1/2 cup water and cover.  Cook until meat is done (about 30 minutes).  Add water if necessary, but don't let it get too runny.  Serve with rice.
