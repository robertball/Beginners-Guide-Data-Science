Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups quinoa flour
1 1/2 cups tapioca flour
3 tablespoons ground flax seeds
3 tablespoons granular no-calorie sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon potato flour
1 tablespoon potato starch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum
1 1/2 cups water
1 egg
3 tablespoons grapeseed oil
1 teaspoon grapeseed oil

Directions:
Combine quinoa flour, tapioca flour, ground flax seeds, baking powder, potato flour, potato starch, salt, baking soda, and xanthan gum in a large bowl.
Whisk water and egg together in a separate bowl. Pour over quinoa flour mixture; mix until batter is well blended. Mix in 3 tablespoons oil.
Heat 1 teaspoon grapeseed oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop 1/3 cup batter into the skillet and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
I created this recipe after developing food allergies to almost everything including rice which is the main ingredient in a lot of gluten-free baking. These pancakes are not only fluffy and delicious but have all the amazing nutrients found in quinoa!
