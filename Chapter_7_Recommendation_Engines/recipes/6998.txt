Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons salt
2 eggs
1/2 cup melted butter
1 cup canned pumpkin
7 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup butter, softened (optional)

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water and stir in sugar, salt, 1/2 cup butter, pumpkin and eggs. Add 3 cups of the flour and beat well. Stir in enough additional flour to make dough easy to handle. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic. Place in greased bowl, covered, and allow to double in size.
Punch down, and divide into 4 parts, rolling each into a 12-inch circle. Spread with 1/4 cup butter if desired. Cut into 8 wedges. Roll up each wedge beginning at wide edge. Place on greased sheet and allow to rise.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15-20 minutes.
