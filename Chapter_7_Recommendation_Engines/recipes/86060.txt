Ingredients:
12  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 cup apricot preserves
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange the chicken pieces in a single layer in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bake uncovered for 25 to 30 minutes, or until no longer pink in the center, and juices run clear.
While the chicken is cooking, stir together the apricot preserves, sour cream, mustard, salt and pepper in a small bowl. When the chicken is done, remove from the oven, and coat with the sauce. Return to the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until sauce is bubbly and hot.
