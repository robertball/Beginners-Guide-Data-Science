Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 head iceberg lettuce, shredded
6 leaves green leaf lettuce, chopped
12 small cherry tomatoes, halved
1 (6 ounce) can medium olives, drained and halved
1/4 large cucumber, cubed
3 radishes, thinly sliced
2 scallions, thinly sliced
Dressing:
1/2 cup tomatillo salsa
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 (10 ounce) bag tortilla chips, warmed
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Drain and discard grease.
Meanwhile, combine iceberg and green leaf lettuces in a large bowl. Toss in cherry tomatoes, olives, cucumber, radishes, and scallions.
Combine tomatillo salsa, lime juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl; whisk until blended. Pour dressing over salad, and toss to combine. Serve salad over warm chips with Cheddar cheese and ground beef.

Description: 
A taco salad with tons of vegetables for flavor and crunch, and lean ground beef for delicious flavor and protein. My daughter normally doesn't care for any type of salsa, but the tomatillo dressing appealed to her. Top with sour cream and chiles, if desired.
