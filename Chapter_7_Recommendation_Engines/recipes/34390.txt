Ingredients:
3 (4 ounce) cans mild whole green chiles, drained (optional)
2 cups shredded Pepper Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Split each chile lengthwise into halves and remove the seeds. Arrange 2 chile halves and about 3 1/2 tablespoons of the cheese near the outer edge of each tortilla. Roll tortilla to enclose the filling. Repeat process with remaining tortillas, chiles and cheese. Arrange the filled tortillas seam side down in a greased 9x13 inch baking pan. In a small bowl, whisk together the enchilada sauce and sour cream. Spoon over the filled tortillas.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until bubbly and heated through. Garnish with cilantro.
