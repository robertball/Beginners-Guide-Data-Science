Ingredients:
3 large beets of various colour varieties
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp fleur de sel

Directions:
Slice the beets as thinly as possible with a sharp knife or mandolin. Toss with water, vinegar, and oil and marinate at least 10 minutes.
Arrange the beets on food dehydrator trays in a single layer and reserve any beets that won't fit in your dehydrator in the fridge.
Sprinkle with the fleur de sel and dehydrate over-night, preferably for 12 hours. If you don't have a food dehydrator, use baking sheets in the oven on the lowest possible temperature for 3.5 hours.
