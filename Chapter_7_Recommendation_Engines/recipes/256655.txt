Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add 1 teaspoon salt. Cook cauliflower chunks in the boiling water until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Cut into bite-size chunks.

Description: 
This cauliflower dish is very simple and mild in taste. It is inspired by Momofuku Ko's skate dish. They used this cauliflower, olive, and water chestnut combination as the side dish. I was blown away - the crispy texture of water chestnut works perfectly with the soft and earthy taste of the cauliflower.
