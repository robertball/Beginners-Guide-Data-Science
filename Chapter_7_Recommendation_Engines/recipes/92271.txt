Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Safeway SELECT Verdi Olive Oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon fresh rosemary leaves or crumbled dried rosemary
1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage leaves or dried rubbed sage
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 (2 pound) chicken
2 heads garlic (each 2 in. wide)
Rosemary sprigs, rinsed
Salt and pepper

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of the olive oil with the lemon juice, thyme, rosemary, sage, and pepper.
Rinse chicken and pat dry. Pull off and discard lumps of fat. Rub olive oil mixture all over chicken and set bird breast up on a rack in a 9- by 13-inch roasting pan. Rub remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil all over garlic. Place garlic heads on rack beside chicken.
Roast in a 425 degrees F oven until garlic is soft when pressed, about 1 hour, and chicken is well browned and meat is no longer pink at thigh bone (cut to test), 1 to 1 1/4 hours. If garlic is done before chicken, transfer garlic to a dish; keep warm. Tip juices out of body cavity into roasting pan.
Put chicken on a platter, surround with garlic heads, and garnish with rosemary sprigs. Keeping chicken warm, let rest 5 to 10 minutes.
Carve chicken. Separate garlic cloves and squeeze garlic from peels to eat with chicken. Add salt and pepper to taste.
