Ingredients:
9 ounces 85% dark chocolate, chopped
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon rum
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, or to taste
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, or as needed
1/4 cup coconut flakes, or as needed

Directions:
Place chocolate, cream, and butter in top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in rum, followed by confectioners' sugar. Cool briefly, then cover and cool in the refrigerator until firm, about 5 hours.
Shape chocolate mixture into oval eggs. Place cocoa powder and coconut flakes in separate small bowls. Roll 1/2 of the chocolate eggs in the cocoa powder and the other 1/2 in coconut flakes. Transfer to the refrigerator.

Description: 
These chocolate easter eggs are made without a mold. They are basically oval chocolate truffles . I usually coat half in cocoa powder and the other half in coconut flakes. Store in the fridge for up to 1 week, but they never last that long in my house!
