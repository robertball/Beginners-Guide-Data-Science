Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound ground beef
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with mild green chilies, undrained
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup long grain rice, uncooked
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 small head cabbage, chopped
1 cup shredded Colby cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Brown together the beef, green pepper, onion, and garlic until the meat is no longer pink and the vegetables have softened, about 8 minutes. Drain liquid from pan.
Stir in tomatoes, tomato sauce, rice, salt, basil, oregano, and the cayenne, white, and black pepper (adding more pepper to taste, if desired). Spread mixture into an ungreased 9x12-inch baking pan. Top with cabbage and Colby cheese.
Cover and bake in preheated oven for 65 to 75 minutes, or until the rice is tender.
