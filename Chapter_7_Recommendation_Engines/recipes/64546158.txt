Ingredients:
3 MorningStar Farms Chipotle Black Bean Burgers, thawed and cut into 1/4 pieces
3/4 cup salsa
3-4 tbsp light cream cheese (optional)
1 cup shredded light Mexican cheese
2 tsp southwest or Mexican seasoning (optional)
8 large flour tortillas
1 tbsp butter or margarine, melted
toothpicks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
In a medium bowl, toss together black bean burgers, salsa, cheese, and seasoning.  (Optional: before mixing salsa with rest of ingredients, heat up salsa and cream cheese in a small saucepan until cheese is well-blended.  Alternatively, just add a little cream cheese to each quesadilla when putting it together)
Use pizza cutter to cut tortillas into large triangles.  (Save the scraps for another recipe, if desired)
Place about 2 tbsp of burger mixture into center of each triangle.  Fold corners of large triangles over filling, completely enclosing filling.  Secure with a toothpick.  Place on a baking sheet, toothpick side up.  Brush with butter.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 9-12 minutes, or until beginning to brown on top.
