Ingredients:
1 Pillsbury pie crust (just one side
1/2 bag chocolate chips
2 eggs whites, at room temperature
1/8 tsp. cream of tartar
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
1/4 cup sugar
1/8 tsp. salt
3/4 cup chopped pecans or walnuts
3 Tbsp. pine nuts, toasted
chocolate shavings (opt.)

Directions:
Position rack in lower third of oven.  Preheat oven to 400F.  Let dough stand for 30 minutes at room tempuerature, or until pliable enough to roll without cracking.
On lightly floured surface, roll dough to 14x9 inch oval, about 1/8 inch thick, rotating and suting with flour to prevent sticking.
Fold in half to transfer to a piece of parchment slightly larger than dough.  Unfold dough.  Loosely fold and roll edge, without pressing, to form rimmed crust.  Place parchment with pastry on baking sheet.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until light golden brown (crust edge will be a little raw inside).
Meanwhile, for filling, melt chocolate in microwave on 50% power about 2 minutes.  Stire frequently until chocolate is almost completely melted.  Remove from microwave.  Stir until melted; set aside.
In bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar and vanilla until soft peaks form.  Gradually add sugar and 1/8 tsp. salt.  Beat until whites are stiff but not dry.  Pour pecans and melted chocolate over whites; fold with spatula until batter is uniform color.
Remove crust from oven.  Reduce oven to 350F.  Dollop filling on crust.  Spread to 1/2 inch thick.  Bake 10 minutes, or until surfact looks dry and slightly cracked (fudgy inside).  Cool on baking sheet on rack.  Serve warm or cool.  Cover and refrigerate after 2 hours or up to 24 hours.  To serve, sprinkle pine nuts and chocolate shavings.
