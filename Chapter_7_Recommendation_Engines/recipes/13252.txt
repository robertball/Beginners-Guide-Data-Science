Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds pork neck bones
2 (7 ounce) cans diced green chiles
2 pounds potatoes, cubed
28 ounces chopped stewed tomatoes
1 large sweet onion, cubed
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons chili powder
4 cups water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Place bones into a heavy roasting pan and add enough water to cover bottom of pan.  Cover pan with a tight fitting lid and cook until browned.  You may need to add more water while it is cooking so be sure to check.
In a large stock pot, combine browned boned, chilies, potatoes, tomatoes, onion, celery, cumin, chili pepper and liquid.  Simmer for 5 to 6 hours.
Remove bones from soup, remove any meat, and place meat back into soup.  Once vegetables are tender, serve.
