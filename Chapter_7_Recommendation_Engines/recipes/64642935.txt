Ingredients:
5-6 cups frozen pineapple chunks (let thaw a teeny tiny bit before blendingmaybe 3 minutes on the counter, we still want it frozenjust not SOLID 1/2  1  cup COLD unsweetened almond milk, or COLD coconut milk (I used coconut milk today )  Start with 1/2 cup liquid and continue adding while blending until desired consistently is achieved. You can use a touch of sweetener if you choose (raw honey, stevia, pure maple.you really dont need a lot! A few drops will doraw honey tastes the best with pineapple). I do NOT use any sweetener, and each one of my children love it!

Directions:
Blend everything in a high-powered blender until desired consistency.I used a low setting, stopping several times to stir, in order to get it to process. I use a blentec blender. If your blender is not high powered, then try a food processoror just be very patient with it. It will work!Optional: Add a few fresh slices of Pineapple on top!
