Ingredients:
1 pound bulk pork sausage
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well drained
1 (4.5 ounce) jar sliced mushrooms, drained
12 eggs
2 cups heavy cream
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
In a skillet, cook sausage and onion until the sausage is browned and the onion is tender; drain. Remove from the heat; stir in 1 cup cheese, spinach and mushrooms. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a bowl beat eggs. Add cream and nutmeg; mix well. Pour over sausage mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
Here in the middle of cattle country, our days always seem to be busy. This dish is true to its name--it's filling and keeps us going all morning. We also like to serve it to guests to give them a taste of true country cooking.
