Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups applesauce
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon hot water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
16 ounces gumdrops, no black ones
3 cups raisins
1 cup chopped pecans
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Line two 9 x 5 inch loaf pans or a 10 inch tube pan with greased parchment or heavy paper.
Sift together the flour, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and salt.
Cut the gumdrops in fourths.  Fry the pecans in the 1 tablespoon butter or margarine.  Mix pecans, raisins, and gumdrops together, and roll in 3/4 cup of flour mixture.
In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup butter or margarine and white sugar.  Mix in beaten eggs.   Mix in the flour and spice mixture alternately with the applesauce.  Dissolve soda in hot water, and stir into batter.  Stir in the vanilla.  Stir in nuts, gumdrops, and raisins.
Bake for 2 hours. The baking time for the tube pan should be about 30 to 40 minutes longer. Test about 10 minutes before the longer time. You may not get a clean tester, but you will be able to tell if it is the candy gumdrop or dough.  Cool.  Wrap in foil.

Description: 
A delightful memory from my childhood.  My mother made this cake for Christmas every year. She baked it about 3 weeks before, and drizzled it with grape juice daily.
