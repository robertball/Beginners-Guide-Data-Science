Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups warm (70 degree) water
2 tsp sugar
3/4 tsp salt
3/4 tsp MSG
3 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp cornmeal
3 1/4 cups flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp onion powder
1 1/2 tsp yeast

Directions:
Start the yeast in the water and sugar
Once the yeast is frothy, combine all ingredients in bread machine, use dough setting.
Pull the dough out after the cycle is complete it's been rising in the machine for 30 minutes. Place the dough in a olive oiled bowl and cover.
Let rise for an hour then push it down. Let rise again for another hour.
Preheat the oven and your pizza pan at 450 degrees.
Take out the pan, add a few tablespoons of olive oil and place the pizza dough in the pan. It should be hot enough that it starts to sizzle, essentially beginning to fry the dough.
Add your sauce (see pizza sauce recipe here) toppings, leaving a quarter of an inch or so of uncovered dough. Bake for 10 - 15 minutes until crust is golden brown.
