Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) whole chicken
1 cup butter at room temperature
1 whole head garlic, minced
3  lemons, zested
1  orange, zested
2 tablespoons chopped chives
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 ½ teaspoons salt
1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground coriander

Directions:
Rinse chicken and allow to air-dry for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Beat butter, garlic, lemon zest, orange zest, chives, sesame oil, thyme, salt, black pepper, and coriander in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Loosen skin of chicken over breast and thighs with your fingers; generously coat entire chicken with butter mixture, including inside cavity. Insert butter mixture beneath loosened skin.
Place chicken on a rack set into a roasting pan with breast side down. Cover chicken with aluminum foil, sealing foil to roasting pan.
Roast in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Uncover pan, turn chicken over so breast side faces up, and roast until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh reads 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 20 more minutes.
Raise oven temperature to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Continue to roast chicken until skin is golden brown, about 10 more minutes. Let chicken rest 10 minutes before carving.
