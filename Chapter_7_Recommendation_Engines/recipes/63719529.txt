Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2 eggs
4 tablespoons oil
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups 100% whole wheat flour
1 cup Holly's Oatmeal
1/2 cup Splenda Brown
1/4 cup Splenda Measure
1 Tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups fresh blackberries

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups, or line with paper muffin liners. Whisk the milk, eggs, oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl.
Mix the flour, oats, sweeteners, baking powder, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, and salt in a bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the egg mixture. Stir until just combined. Gently fold in the blackberries. Pour batter into greased loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Wrap tightly with foil and cool in pan for 30 minutes.  Remove and place bread on rack and allow to cool completely before slicing.
