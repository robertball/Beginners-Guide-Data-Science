Ingredients:
1 lb bulk italian sausage-mild, sweet or spicy
1 medium sweet onion, sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 14.5 ounce can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1 14.5 ounce can diced tomatoes, italian style, undrained
2/3 cup white wine
1 c whipping cream
2-3 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped
1 lb box of pasta of your choice (penne or rigatoni work well), cooked

Directions:
In large saute pan cook italian sausage over  medium high heat, breaking up with spoon as it cooks.  Cook for 5 minutes then add sliced onion, garlic and  artichokes and continue to saute until sausage is cooked through, about 10-15 minutes, total.  Drain excess fat.
Add wine to deglaze pan and simmer until liquid is almost evaporated.
Add tomatoes and simmer 5-7 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium low.  Add cream and let sauce thicken about 5-7 minutes.  Do not boil.
Add cilantro, mix and let simmer another 2 minutes.  Serve over pasta or mix in with pasta, whatever your personal preference is.

Description: 
This is one of my very favorite pasta dishes.  The artichokes are chopped so even my non-artichoke eating kids approve.  I created this dish with flavors I love and hope you will enjoy it as much as my family and friends do!
