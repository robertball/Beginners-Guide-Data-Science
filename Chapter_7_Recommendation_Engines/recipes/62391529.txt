Ingredients:
1/4 tsp salt
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
3-5 Tbsp ice water
5 Tbsp cold butter, cut up
3 Tbsp vegetable shortening

Directions:
Sift together flour and salt in medium bowl. Add cut up butter and shortening. With fork (or in pastry blender/food processor) mix together until it looks like crumbs and the butter and shortening is evenly mixed with the flour and salt. Add water, 1 Tbsp at a time, mixing after each addition until dough holds together well but isn't too wet. Shape into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Place in the fridge for at least 15 minutes to chill. Roll out on floured surface.

Description: 
makes one crust. Always comes out great. Tastes better when you use butter instead of margarine, but margarine still tastes good
