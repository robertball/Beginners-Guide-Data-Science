Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
3 eggs, well beaten
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 cup water

Directions:
In a large bowl, sift together all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt.
Mix sugar, eggs and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small bowl. Quickly stir into the flour mixture. Mix in approximately 1/2 the water. Knead into a soft, pliable dough, using more of the water as necessary.
Cover dough with a tea towel and allow to sit at least 1 hour while desired filling is prepared. To use, divide into two parts. Cover half the dough with plastic wrap while you roll out the other.
Carefully stretch the dough into paper thinness on a lightly floured surface (a clean cotton sheet is ideal) and lightly brush with remaining vegetable oil. Fill and bake as desired.
