Ingredients:
1 cup sour cherries, not pitted
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup good quality white vinegar, or as needed

Directions:
Wash and drain the cherries, place them on a metal baking sheet, and set in the sun for 1 hour to be sure they are completely dry.
Place cherries in a sterilized jar with a plastic lid; add salt. Pour in vinegar to fill the jar. Close lid tightly and set aside for taste and color to ripen, 3 to 4 weeks. Refrigerate.
