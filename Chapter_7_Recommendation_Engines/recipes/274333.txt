2 cups strawberries, hulled and quartered

1 pinch salt

Directions:
Combine rhubarb, strawberries, water, orange juice, honey, star anise pod, and salt in a small pot and bring to a slow boil over medium heat. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.
Remove the lid and simmer until fruit is soft, about 5 more minutes. Turn off heat and allow to cool completely. Remove star anise and place compote into jars. Use within a few days and keep refrigerated.
