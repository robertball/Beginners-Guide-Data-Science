Ingredients:
4 slices ham, chopped
1 small apple - peeled, cored and finely chopped
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
2 slices Cheddar cheese
4 slices bread
2 tablespoons butter
2 eggs
4 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Mix ham and apple with mayonnaise in a small bowl. Spread onto two slices of bread. Top each one with a slice of cheese and a second slice of bread.
Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Whisk together eggs and milk in a small bowl. Quickly dip both sides of the sandwich into the egg mixture. Fry sandwiches in pan for 1 to 2 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Watch carefully. You want the sandwiches to be golden in color and the egg to be cooked.

Description: 
This is a satisfying sandwich that is quick to make and fills you up. Although the ingredients are not necessarily 'figure friendly' they are a good way to get your kids to get their protein, and fruits all in one meal item. You can substitute your favorite types of bread, meat and cheese.
