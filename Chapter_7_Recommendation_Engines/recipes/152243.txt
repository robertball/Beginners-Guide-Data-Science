Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, rinsed and patted dry
6 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
½ cup soy sauce
½ cup apple cider vinegar
½ cup water
2 tablespoons pickling spice, wrapped in cheesecloth

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until oil is shimmering. Cook garlic in oil for no more than 30 seconds. Add all of the chicken to the pot; cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is white all over. Do not brown.
Pour in soy sauce, vinegar, and water, and add the pickling spice. Make sure the spice ball is submerged. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and place lid on pot so that some steam can escape. Simmer for 1 hour, or until chicken is very tender.

Description: 
My Filipino Mom taught me how to make this traditional dish following the recipe her mother taught her. And though I've made a couple of changes, I guarantee they're Mom-approved. 'Lolah' is 'Grandma' in the Philippines, in case you were wondering. Serve over steamed rice.
