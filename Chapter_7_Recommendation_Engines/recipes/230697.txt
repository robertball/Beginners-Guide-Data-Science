Description: 
For Super BowlÂ® one year, I really wanted to make jalapeno poppers but wasn't in the mood for all the work so I put this dip together. It combines all of the flavors of a jalapeno popper and has become a request at every football party we throw, as well as one of my husband's favorite dips.
