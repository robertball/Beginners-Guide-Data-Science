Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
2 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
3 cups grated zucchini
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Grease and flour two 4x8-inch loaf pans.
Beat eggs in a large bowl until light and foamy; mix in vegetable oil, sugar, vanilla extract, and zucchini until thoroughly combined.
Whisk flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl.
Stir the flour mixture into the zucchini mixture.
Mix in chopped walnuts and chocolate chips.
Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaves comes out clean, about 1 hour.
Let cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing to finish cooling on wire racks.
