Ingredients:
1 whole frozen banana, peeled
1 tbsp cocoa powder, or more to taste
1 cup sweetened almond milk (or for normal dairy milk, try 1 cup + 1-2 tbsp granulated sugar)
a pinch of salt (optional, for a stronger flavor)
1-2 tbsp of nut butter (optional, for protein and a more calorie-dense shake)

Directions:
Slice your banana into at least 5 equal parts and add in the milk, cocoa powder, and salt to your blender.
Mix on the highest setting for around 10 seconds.
Add in the nut butter and mix on the medium high for another 20-30 seconds, ensuring that there are no lumps of banana or butter.
Pour into a tall glass and serve with whipped cream or extra cocoa powder. Enjoy!
