Ingredients:
20 ounces cheese ravioli
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
1 1/4 cups chicken broth
1 (14 ounce) can pumpkin pie filling

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly-salted water to a boil; cook the ravioli in the boiling water until tender, about 5 minutes; drain.
Prepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic in the hot skillet until brown. Stir in the sage, thyme, cayenne pepper, chicken broth, and pumpkin pie filling; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes. Ladle over drained ravioli to serve.

Description: 
More like a ravioli with pumpkin sauce, this is a wonderful mix of sweet and spicy. If it is too sweet, use a can of solid packed pumpkin in place of the pumpkin pie filling and use more broth and some pumpkin pie spice. I've made it both ways, and both are great. My husband preferred it with the pumpkin pie mix. Modify the cayenne pepper to taste; we like it spicy so we use 2 teaspoons!
