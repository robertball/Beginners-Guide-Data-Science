Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2 eggs
1/4  cup oil
1 tsp. salt
2 tsp. baking powder
1 1/3 cup corn meal
2/3 cup flour
about 16 hot dogs
flour for dusting
hot fat for deep frying

Directions:
In large bowl, combine milk, eggs, oil, sugar and salt.  Mix it very well.  Sprinkle in the baking powder, corn meal and flour.  Stir it all up to make a slightly thick batter.
Dry off your hot dogs with paper towel.  Cut hot dogs in half. Dust them with flour coating them completely (otherwise the batter won’t stick).  Shove some long toothpicks into each hot dog half.  Allow your hot fat to heat up to about 375 degrees – smokin’ hot.
To coat each hot dog, fill a slender glass with batter and dip your hot dog into the batter swirling it to coat evenly.  Place in hot fat carefully.  Only fry 2 or 3 at a time and turn when the bottom side is well browned.  Allow to drain on paper towel.
Serve with different mustards.
