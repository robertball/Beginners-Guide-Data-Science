Ingredients:
45 mini muffin liners
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup smooth peanut butter
1 cup coconut oil
½ cup honey
½ teaspoon vanilla extract, or more to taste

Directions:
Set muffin liners on a large baking sheet.
Combine cocoa powder, peanut butter, coconut oil, and honey together in a bowl; stir in vanilla extract. Continue mixing until all lumps are gone. Transfer mixture to a piping bag or resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped. Pipe the mixture into each muffin cup, filling 3/4-full.
Refrigerate bites until set, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
These rich chocolates will make you look like a gourmet chocolatier. These are good for desserts with tea/coffee at a gathering. Use organic ingredients and cute paper liners to impress. Keep chilled until served as they'll begin to melt outside of the refrigerator in about 15 minutes. For this reason they're not particularly kid-friendly.
