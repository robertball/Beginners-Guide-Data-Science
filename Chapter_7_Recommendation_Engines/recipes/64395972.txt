Ingredients:
1lb. cherry tomatoes, washed (I used red and yellow)
6 roma tomatoes, washed and diced into 1 inch pieces
1 28oz. cans tomato sauce
1 15oz. cans tomato sauce
2 14.5oz. can diced tomatoes
1 small can of tomato paste
2 red bell peppers, washed, seeded and diced into 1 inch pieces
6 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced thin
1 large onion, peeled and diced coarsely
2T onion powder
2T garlic powder
1T Italian seasoning
1T oregano
2T low sodium soy sauce or liquid amino
2-3T maple syrup
1C red wine (I use a nice merlot.

Directions:
After you prepare all your ingredients, place them into a large slow cooker and mix well.
Set the slow cooker on low, cover and walk away.  This is a great recipe to make first thing in the morning, or before you go to bed.  You want to cook this on low for 12 hours.  You can get away with 8, but the extra 4 hours makes a difference.Turn the heat off, and blend everything
