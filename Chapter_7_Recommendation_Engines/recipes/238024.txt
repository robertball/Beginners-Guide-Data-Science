Description: 
These are wonderful to have on hand to add to soups, roasts, veggie dishes--anything you want to add a little flavor to. When completely frozen, pop 2 to 3 pods into a snack-sized resealable plastic bag, label, date, and return to the freezer. Do this until all are bagged. Thaw and stir a pod into the eggs to get veggies into you kids! Drop frozen ones into the pot to thaw as the meat cooks.
