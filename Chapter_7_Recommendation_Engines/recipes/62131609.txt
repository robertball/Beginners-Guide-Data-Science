Ingredients:
1 c. Oreo crumbs
3 T. sugar
1/4 c.  butter, melted
1 c. white chocolate chips
3/4 c. sugar
3 packages (8 oz each) cream cheese, softened
2  tsp. vanilla extract
3 eggs
1 c. roughly chopped Oreos
whipped cream for serving, optional
4 Hershey's Cookies & Cream candy bars, roughly chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.  Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan.
Combine cookie crumbs and sugar in a small bowl, drizzle in butter while stirring until evenly moistened.  Press mixture into bottom of prepared pan.  Bake 10 min. and set aside to cool.  Reduce oven temp to 350.
Meanwhile, microwave white chocolate chips in small microwavable bowl on med-hi (70%) power for 1 min; stir.  Continue microwaving, stirring every 10-20 seconds, until smooth.  Cool to room temperature.
Combine sugar, cream cheese and vanilla in a large bowl.  Beat at high speed, scraping bowl often, until smooth.  Add eggs, mix well.  Gradually beat in white chocolate, and fold in Oreos.
Spread mixture over crust.  Bake 40-50 min. or until just set, with the center jiggling slightly when lightly shaken.  Cool on wire rack to room temperature, then chill overnight.  Just before serving, top with whipped cream, if using, and sprinkle with chopped candy bars.

Description: 
My friend Danae, while pregnant, could not get enough of a Cookies & Cream candy bar, so for her birthday I made this cheesecake for her.  You really can't go wrong with white chocolate and Oreos!
