Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 bunches green onions, coarsely chopped, divided
1 large red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
3 cloves garlic, diced
1 large tomato, chopped
1/2 cup sliced black olives
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced
2 cups drained canned black beans
1 1/2 cups cooked white rice
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 lime, juiced
1 dash hot sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste
2 (8 ounce) cans enchilada sauce
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1/2 cup sour cream, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add most of the green onions, reserving some in a bowl, red bell pepper, and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add tomato, black olives, and jalapeno peppers; cook and stir over low heat until tomato is soft, about 5 minutes.
Mix black beans and rice together in a large bowl. Fold in tomato mixture. Stir in cream cheese, 1 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese, cilantro, lime juice, and hot sauce.
Divide black bean mixture evenly among tortillas using a large spoon. Roll up tortillas.
Spread a thin layer of enchilada sauce in a large, shallow baking pan. Arrange rolled tortillas seam side-down over the sauce; cover with remaining enchilada sauce. Sprinkle reserved green onions and remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese on top. Cover baking pan with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until Cheddar cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve enchiladas with sour cream.

Description: 
These enchiladas are a filling and flavorful recipe that will satisfy everyone, even non-vegetarians. These are best when you use really large tortilla shells and stuff them full. I love to use organic ingredients for a great flavor.
