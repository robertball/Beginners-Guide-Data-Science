1 pound fresh tuna steaks, minced
1 carrot, grated
1/2 cup onion, chopped

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together tuna, carrot, onion, chives, eggs, panko crumbs, and mayonnaise. Season with garlic salt and black pepper.  Form into patties.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Arrange patties in the pan (only as many as will fit easily in the pan). Cook, uncovered, 10 minutes per side, or until golden brown.

Description: 
I got this recipe from my coworker - loved it and then made it for my boyfriend. Now he loves it and I make it at least twice a month. You can eat this plain or as a burger. I recommend eating them with hamburger buns, mayo, lettuce and onions.
