Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 teaspoons mesquite seasoning
½ (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend
⅓ cup real bacon bits
⅓ cup sliced green onions
¼ cup mayonnaise
1 ½ teaspoons chipotle-flavored hot sauce (such as Tabasco(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Chipotle Pepper Sauce)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil; brush with olive oil.
Season chicken breasts with mesquite seasoning and place in the prepared baking dish.
Mix cheese blend, bacon bits, green onions, mayonnaise, and chipotle-flavored hot sauce together in a small bowl. Spread mixture evenly over chicken.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 16 minutes. Turn off oven; leave chicken inside for 2 minutes. Turn on broiler; broil chicken on low until topping is golden, 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
This dish is like Alice Springs Chicken on steroids. Mixing everything together gives it a much better, juicier flavor. I like to pair it with steamed veggies.
