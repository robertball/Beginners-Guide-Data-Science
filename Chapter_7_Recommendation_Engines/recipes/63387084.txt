Ingredients:
2 cups flour
2 tsp. cinnamon
1 1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup canola oil
1 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
3 eggs
2 tsp. vanilla
1/2 cup sour cream
3 cups shredded zucchini
3/4 cup mini chocolate chips
Topping:
2 Tbsp. brown sugar
2 Tbsp. granulated sugar
1/2 tsp. cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour 2 loaf pans and set aside (I used 1 loaf pan and 1 9 x 9 pan).
Mix topping ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
Place flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside.
With a stand or hand mixer beat oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and eggs until combined and slightly fluffy, 1-2 minutes.
Add vanilla and sour cream and mix until combined. Gently stir in the zucchini. Take a spoonful of the flour mixture and stir in with the chocolate chips (that will help keep them evenly distributed). Stir remaining flour mixture into batter and mix just until combined. Add chocolate chips and stir to combine.
Divide the batter between the two pans and sprinkle topping over each.
Bake for 50-60 minutes. When they're done, a toothpick should come out without goopy batter on it and the tops cracked with sugar. Remove from oven and let cool on rack for 5-10 minutes and then remove from pans.
