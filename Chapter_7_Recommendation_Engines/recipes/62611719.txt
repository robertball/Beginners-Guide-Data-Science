Ingredients:
1 tbsp chili powder
1 ½ tbsp flour
½ tsp cocoa powder
¼ tsp garlic salt
½ tsp oregano
1 ½ cup water
4 oz tomato sauce (½ cup)

Directions:
In a small sauce pan, combine the dry ingredients and whisk them together well.
Slowly add the water, whisking all the while to prevent any lumps from forming.
Place the sauce pan on the stove and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then whisk constantly until the mixture thickens, about 3-6 minutes. Shut off the heat and whisk in the tomato sauce.
