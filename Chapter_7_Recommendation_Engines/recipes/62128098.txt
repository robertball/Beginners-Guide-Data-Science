Ingredients:
4 Strips of bacon
16 oz bag of frozen okra - chopped
1 can of diced tomatoes with greed chiles (mild unless you like you things spicy)
1 tsp of minced garlic
1 tbs of minced onion
1/4 tsp of chili powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Cut the bacon into small slices and start frying it in a frying pan on medium heat.
2. When the bacon starts to brown but is not yet crispy, add the garlic and onion.
3. Stir the mixture until the garlic and onion is absorbed in the grease.
4. Add the tomatoes with the juice and cover and heat on medium heat until mixture starts to boil.
5. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add okra and chili powder.
6. Cook covered (make sure that it does not boil over) until okra is tender.  You don't want the okra to over cook or it will start falling apart.
