Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) boneless rolled pork loin roast, halved
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup cranberry juice
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 cup cold water
salt to taste

Directions:
In a Dutch oven, brown roast in oil on all sides over medium-high heat. Transfer to a 5-qt. slow cooker. Combine the cranberry sauce, sugar, cranberry juice, mustard, pepper and cloves; pour over roast. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove roast and keep warm.
In a saucepan, combine cornstarch, water and salt until smooth; stir in cooking juices. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with roast.

Description: 
You can put this roast in the slow cooker and then forget about it, knowing it will be moist and tender when you get home after a day of work or Christmas shopping. The fruity sauce complements the meat so well.                                -Joyce Turley                                 Slaughters, Kentucky
