NA
Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package dried soba noodles
⅓ cup soy sauce
⅓ cup rice wine
1 ½ tablespoons white sugar
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound chicken, cubed or thinly sliced
1  onion, thinly sliced
1 small head cabbage, very thinly sliced
3 cups julienned carrots, about 1 inch in length
1 tablespoon chopped ginger
2  green onions, thinly sliced, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook soba in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse in cool water. Set aside.
Mix soy sauce, rice wine, and sugar together in a small bowl, stirring until sugar is dissolved.
Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and onion and cook in the hot oil for 3 to 5 minutes. Add cabbage, carrots, and ginger and cook until cabbage is softened, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Place prepared noodles on top of chicken and vegetables in the wok. Pour sauce on top. Cover and cook another 3 to 5 minutes. Remove lid and toss mixture together until well combined. Sprinkle green onion over the mixture and serve.

Description: 
The great thing about this Japanese-style yakisoba recipe is you can replace the chicken with any other meat or simply use no meat at all. This can make a great main dish or side dish.
