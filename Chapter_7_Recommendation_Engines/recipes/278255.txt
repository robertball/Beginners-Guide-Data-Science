Ingredients:
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup yellow cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 large eggs
1 cup whole milk
1/4 cup honey

Directions:
Drop butter in a 9-inch cast iron skillet and place on the center rack of the oven; preheat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove skillet from oven as soon as butter melts; this may be before oven reaches set temperature. Tip the skillet until melted butter coats all sides.
Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
Whisk eggs thoroughly in another large bowl. Add milk and honey and whisk until combined. Add dry ingredients and stir just until mixed; pour batter into the prepared skillet. Stir batter in a folding motion to incorporate any remaining melted butter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes before cutting and serving.

Description: 
After much experimentation adapting and combining recipes, this one is the keeper. A scratch cornbread combining honey and pepper in an iron skillet yields a very tasty cornbread of excellent texture.
