Ingredients:
1 loaf french bread
8 eggs
1 cup whole milk
2 cups half-and-half
2 TBS sugar
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 tsp. nutmeg
dash of salt

Directions:
Slice bread about 1 inch thick and place in a generously greased 9 by 13 baking dish overlapping the pieces.  In a medium size bowl, place the remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly with a rotary beater or whisk.  Pour mixture over bread making sure that all the bread slices are moistened.  It is okay if the mixture runs in between the slices of bread.  Cover and place in refrigerator overnight.  The next morning bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for approximately 40 minutes.

Description: 
This delicious french toast reminds me of a cross between creme brulee and a very moist custardy bread pudding. Serve it with butter and maple syrup and a side of bacon for a scrumptious breakfast that everyone will love!
