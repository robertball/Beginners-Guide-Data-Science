Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups pecan halves
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
6 large over-ripe bananas, mashed
1 cup cane sugar
1 3/4 cups white whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
1 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 9x5-inch loaf pans with parchment paper.
Process pecan halves in a food processor until a flour forms; transfer to a bowl. Process oats in the food processor until a flour forms; add to pecan flour. Mix bananas and sugar together in a bowl; add to pecan flour mixture. Stir white whole wheat flour, baking powder, coconut oil, and salt into pecan flour mixture until batter is thick and well mixed. Spoon batter into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a loaf comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
