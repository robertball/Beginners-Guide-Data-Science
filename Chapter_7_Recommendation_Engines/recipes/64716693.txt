Ingredients:
8 Yukon Gold potatoes
1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese
1 dash ground nutmeg
5 tbsp unsalted butter
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 cups half & half
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
Prepare your Dutch oven by spraying it with a bit of non-stick cooking spray.
Slice the potatoes using a mandolin or very sharp knife and place the slices in the Dutch oven.
Cut the butter into cubes and evenly distribute over the sliced potatoes.
Sprinkle the minced garlic over the potatoes.
Pour the half and half over the potatoes and season everything with salt and pepper.
Add a dusting of nutmeg (not too much).
Place the Dutch oven over medium heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, until all of the butter is melted.
Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the top and transfer to the preheated oven.
Bake for 30 minutes.
Remove from oven and let stand for about 15 minutes before serving.
Dig in and enjoy!!
