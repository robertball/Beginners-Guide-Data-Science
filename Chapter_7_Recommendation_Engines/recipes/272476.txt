Ingredients:
8 ounces 70% bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
4 large eggs
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Adjust a rack to the middle of the oven. Butter six 4-ounce ramekins.
Put the chocolate and butter in a metal or glass bowl over barely simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted. Remove from the heat.
Place the eggs, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a mixer. Whip at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add the chocolate; mix until combined. Spoon into the prepared ramekins and place on a baking sheet.
Bake for about 10 minutes or until the edges are set but the center is underdone. Let cool 3 minutes before serving.
