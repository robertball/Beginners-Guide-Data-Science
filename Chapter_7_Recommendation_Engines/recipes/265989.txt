Ingredients:
Honey Dijon Vinaigrette:
1/2 cup olive oil
6 teaspoons white balsamic vinegar
4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
2 1/2 teaspoons honey
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
Salad:
12 strips bacon
4 large shallots, thinly sliced into rings
12 cups packed kale, massaged
3 roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup walnuts
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Whisk olive oil, balsamic vinegar, mustard, honey, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes together to make the vinaigrette.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Reserve 3 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.
Cook shallots in the bacon fat until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on a paper towel.
Add kale and red peppers to the skillet and saute until warmed through but not wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Place kale, red peppers, and garlic in a serving bowl. Top with the vinaigrette, diced bacon, shallots, walnuts, and Parmesan cheese.
