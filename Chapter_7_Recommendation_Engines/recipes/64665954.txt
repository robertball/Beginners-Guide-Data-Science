Ingredients:
2 pkg sweet Hawaiian rolls
1 1/2 lbs of Virginia ham
12 slices Swiss cheese
1 stick real butter
2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp poppy seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place the bottom half of 12 rolls in a 9x13 pan (you'll need 2 pans). Place about 2 shaved slices of ham on each roll. Cut the cheese slices into 4 parts and place 2 small pieces on each sandwich. Put the dinner roll tops on.
In a saucepan, mix butter, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, and poppy seeds. Wait until all butter is melted and then brush the melted mixture over the ham sandwiches. Cover with foil and let sit in fridge for 1 hour or over night (or bake them right away if you want).
Bake sandwiches 15 min or until cheese is melted. Serve. They are great hot and even at room temp!
