Ingredients:
2 lbs. potatoes, scrubbed
3 cloves garlic
1 large sprig fresh rosemary (about 1 tbsp leaves)
4 tbsp butter
3 to 4 tbsp milk
3/4 cup shredded Manchego cheese
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place a steamer basket into a large saucepan; add about 1" water to bottom of the pan.
Cut potatoes into large chunks and place in steamer basket along with whole garlic cloves and sprig of rosemary.
Cover and bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium high and continue cooking, covered, until potatoes are fork tender, about 12 minutes.
Discarding rosemary, transfer potatoes and garlic cloves to a large boil.  Add butter and milk and mash slightly.
Add manchego cheese and season with salt and pepper; mash or whip with electric hand mixer until desired consistency.

Description: 
Rather than boiling, potatoes are steamed with garlic and fresh rosemary, infusing them with aromatic flavor, then mashed with butter, milk and Manchego cheese for a creamy, comforting take on mashed potatoes.  You can opt to peel or not peel the potatoes.
