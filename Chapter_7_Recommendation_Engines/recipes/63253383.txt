Ingredients:
Cake:
2 and 1/2 cups all purpose flour
2 cups sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 and 1/3 buttermilk
1/2 cup shortening or butter(softened)
1 tsp vanilla
4 egg whites or 2 eggs
1/8 tsp salt
Toppings:
Coconut
2 containers of Vanilla Frosting
Red food coloring
Graham crackers
Mini chocolate chips.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Farenheight. Combine all dry ingredients in a bowl and mix together with a whisk. Add shortening or butter, vanilla, and buttermilk. Mix well with an electric mixer, then add eggs, and mix again. Put cupcake liners in cupcake pans, and pour the cupcake batter into the pans 2/3 of the way. Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden on the top. Let cool. When cupcakes are cooled, frost them with the vanilla frosting. Put shredded coconut on top of the frosting. Mix red food dye with leftover frosting to make pink icing. Cut graham crackers into bunny ear shapes, then ice with white icing and pink icing to make them look like ears. Insert the bottom of the ears into the cupcake top. Then add mini chocolate chips for eyes, and pink frosting for noses. These are such cute cupcakes and so delicious! Your family will love them for Easter.
