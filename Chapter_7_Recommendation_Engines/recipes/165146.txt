Ingredients:
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup golden corn syrup
1/4 cup crunchy peanut butter
1 1/2 cups KELLOGG'S* RICE KRISPIES* Vanilla Flavour cereal, finely crushed
3/4 cup semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Combine sugar, corn syrup and peanut butter in large saucepan. Heat over medium heat, about 1 minute, stirring to dissolve sugar.
Remove from heat; immediately stir in crushed cereal. Press into 20 cm (8-inch) square baking pan lined on bottom and two sides with foil. Alternately, press about 10 mL (2 tsp) mixture into small candy papers in 5 cm (1 3/4-inch) diameter mini muffin/tart pan.
Melt chocolate in medium bowl in microwave or over saucepan of boiling water. Stir until smooth. Spread over mixture in pan, or spoon 5 mL (1 tsp) over top in each cup.
Let cool to set chocolate. Lift out of pan, remove foil and cut into small bars. Store in covered container up to one week.
