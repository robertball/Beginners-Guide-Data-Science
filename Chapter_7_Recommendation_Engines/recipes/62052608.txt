Ingredients:
1 large eggplant
juice of 1/2 lemon
1 1/2 Tbl. Tahini sauce
4 cloves garlic, smashed
1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes (optional)
parsley for garnish
salt to taste

Directions:
1.  Cut a slit in the eggplant and then bake the eggplant in the oven at 400 for 40 min.  The last 5 min, when the eggplant is completely shrunk and soft, move it to the top shelf and let burn.  This adds an authentic toasted taste to the eggplant dip.
2.  Peel the eggplant skin off and add the contents into a bowl.  Add all the ingredients except for the garnish and stir well.
3.  Garnish with parsley and sprinkle olive oil and serve with pita bread.
