Submitter: 
Idahoan
Description: 
Bean soup is on the menu in the Senate's restaurant every day. There are several stories about the origin of that mandate, but none has been corroborated. According to one story, the Senate's bean soup tradition began early in the 20th-century at the request of Senator Fred Dubois of Idaho. We like his version because it contains mashed potatoes, of course!
