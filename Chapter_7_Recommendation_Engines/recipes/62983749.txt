Ingredients:
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 pork tenderloin (about 1 pound)
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
5 sheets phyllo dough (14 inches x 9 inches)
3 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
1. In a small skillet, bring cream and mustard to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes or until mixture is reduced to about 2/3 cup. Remove from the heat; stir in thyme.
2. Meanwhile, place pork on a rack in a shallow baking pan. Brush with oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil 6 in. from the heat for 6 minutes. Remove from the oven; cool slightly. Change oven temperature to 400°.
3. Set aside 1/2 cup mustard mixture for serving; spread remaining mixture over the pork. Place one sheet of phyllo dough on a work surface; brush with butter. (Keep remaining phyllo dough covered with plastic wrap and a damp towel to prevent it from drying out.) Repeat layers four times. Place pork on one edge of phyllo dough; roll up tightly and tuck in ends. Place bundle in an ungreased shallow baking pan.
4. Bake, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 160°. Transfer to a serving platter. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with reserved mustard sauce. Yield: 4 servings.
