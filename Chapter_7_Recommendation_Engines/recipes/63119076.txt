Ingredients:
1 banana - peeled
Mini-marshmallows

Directions:
Peel each banana and place on a large square of aluminum foil.
Cover the banana with marshmallows and your choice of sweet chips - mixes are great!
Wrap each banana in aluminum foil and write each persons name (with LARGE letters) in Sharpie marker on the outside of the foil.
Cook on grill, in a fire, or even in your oven (350F) for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat carefully. Let cool for a few minutes and open VERY carefully.
Eat with a spoon and try not to dribble chocolate on yourself!
