Ingredients:
3 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 stalks celery, chopped
1/2 large onion, diced
4 green onions, white and green parts separated and sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups uncooked white rice
1/2 cup golden raisins

Directions:
Bring chicken broth to boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; continue simmering while preparing remaining ingredients.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir celery, onion, green onion white portions, garlic, curry powder, and salt in the hot oil until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a bowl.
Cook and stir rice in the same skillet until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes.
Stir toasted rice into boiling chicken broth. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue simmering until rice is tender and broth is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Remove rice from heat and stir in raisins, green onion tops, and celery mixture until well blended.

Description: 
Surprisingly easy and extremely flavorful. The curry powder does not add an actual curry taste, just a nice rich flavor, so give it a try even if you aren't a curry fan.
