Ingredients:
1 large head cauliflower, cut into small florets
3/4 cup light mayonnaise
2 tablespoons yellow mustard, or more to taste
2 small dill pickles, finely chopped
1 teaspoon dill pickle juice
6 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
3 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place 1/3 the cauliflower florets into a microwave-safe bowl, cover, and cook in the microwave until tender, about 6 minutes. Repeat with remaining cauliflower. Set aside to cool, about 30 minutes.
Combine mayonnaise, mustard, pickles, and pickle juice in a large bowl. Add cooled cauliflower and mix with a spatula until florets are covered with dressing. Add cooked eggs and bacon; mix to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour so flavors can meld. Season with salt and pepper before serving.

Description: 
I tried the Keto Potato Salad recipe on this site and liked it so much I wanted to make it a full meal, so I modified it accordingly. You can add onion and green onions and modify ratios depending on your tastes. Also good as a side dish.
