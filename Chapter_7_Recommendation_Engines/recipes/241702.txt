Ingredients:
3 sheets aluminum foil, rolled into balls
1 (5 pound) whole chicken
1 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as Pappy's Choice(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), or more to taste
8 cloves garlic, or more to taste, crushed
8  limes, quartered
Â½ cup white wine
20  corn tortillas, warmed
1 bunch cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Put aluminum foil balls in the bottom of a slow cooker crock.
Season chicken with seasoned salt. Rub half the garlic on the inside surfaces of the chicken's cavity and leave them inside. Squeeze 8 lime quarters into the cavity; drop the squeezed quarters into the cavity. Place the chicken atop the foil balls. Squeeze 8 more lime quarters over the outside of the chicken; drop squeezed lime quarters into the bottom of the crock. Rub remaining garlic over the outside of the chicken and put garlic in the bottom of the crock. Pour white wine into the crock.
Cook on Low until the chicken meat pulls apart easily, 5 to 6 hours.
Remove chicken to a cutting board. Remove meat from bones and shred completely. Serve chicken on warmed tortillas with cilantro for topping and lime wedge.

Description: 
This has quickly become one of our favorite dinners in our house. My husband and I add jalapenos and hot sauce. My son loves these topped with cheese and sour cream as well. It's from a bunch of different recipes; I just took out what I loved most about each one and threw it together. It's quick and easy, and with the leftover chicken (when there is any) I make a pot pie or chicken and dumplings.
