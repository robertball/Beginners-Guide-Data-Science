Ingredients:
Sauce:
3 1/2 cups cold water
2/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce
5 tablespoons vegetarian beef-flavored bouillon
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
4 teaspoons bottled minced garlic
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
Vegetables:
3 tablespoons peanut oil, or more as needed
1/2 head cabbage, coarsely chopped
1 bunch asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 cups sliced carrots
1 (8 ounce) package fresh broccoli florets
2 cups snow peas
2 cups diagonally sliced celery
2 cups cooked white rice

Directions:
Combine water, soy sauce, bouillon, cornstarch, sugar, garlic, rice vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, and red pepper flakes in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk until cornstarch is fully dissolved, about 3 minutes. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Boil until thickened and reduced by a third, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
Pour peanut oil into a large skillet or wok. Add cabbage, asparagus, carrots, broccoli, snow peas, and celery. Saute over medium-high heat until tender but not mushy, stirring with a spatula, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low; pour sauce over vegetables and stir until completely coated. Serve over rice.

Description: 
This is a Chinese-style stir-fry with a brown sauce. You can use any combination of your favorite vegetables. The sauce can be made ahead of time, so you can easily just stir-fry the veggies and add in the sauce. Add chicken, beef, or (my favorite) fried tofu. This recipe is easily adaptable to use your favorite vegetables - just chop enough to completely fill your large skillet. Garnish with chow mein noodles.
