Ingredients:
16 Halloween-colored chocolate sandwich cookies, chopped
1 1/2 cups broken small pretzels
1 bag of white chocolate discs, melted
1 bag of orange chocolate discs, melted
1 small bag M&M; candies
2 cups candy corn
halloween sprinkles

Directions:
On a foiled lined cookie sheet, spread out the cookie pieces, M&M candies, pretzels and candy corn. Melt each of the chocolates in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water, or in the microwave, stirring frequently until melted. Add a 1/2 tsp of vegetable oil to loosen chocolate if necessary. Remove from the heat while there are still a few chunks, and stir until smooth. White chocolate burns easily.
Drizzle both the white and orange chocolate with a spoon over the goodies on the cookie sheet. Top with sprinkles. Let cool until firm. Break into pieces and store in an airtight container.
