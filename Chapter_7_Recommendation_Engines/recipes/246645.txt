Ingredients:
Marinade:
3/4 cup cola-flavored carbonated beverage (such as Coca-Cola®)
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup water
2 green onions, chopped
3 tablespoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons sesame seeds
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 pounds short ribs

Directions:
Combine cola beverage, white sugar, soy sauce, water, green onions, sesame oil, garlic, sesame seeds, and black pepper in a bowl until marinade is well-mixed.
Place short ribs in a resealable plastic bag and pour in marinade. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove short ribs from marinade, discarding marinade.
Cook short ribs until browned and cooked to desired doneness, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
After trying many recipes for homemade-style Korean BBQ, I finally found a great recipe from a friend who learned it from his mom. It's sweet, salty, spicy, and very tender (Thanks to the Coke®). I use this same recipe to make Bulgogi and Dae Ji Bool Gogi (Spicy Pork) and simply change the onions to sliced bulbs for the bulgogi.
