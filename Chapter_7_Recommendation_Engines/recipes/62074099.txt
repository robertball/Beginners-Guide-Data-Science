Ingredients:
4 medium potatoes
1 cup chicken broth
2 Tbs flour
2 cups milk
3 cups grated medium to sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Slice potatoes about 1/4 inch thick and put into a sauce pan.  Cover with water and bring to a boil for 5 - 7 minutes. (you don't want to cook them until done)
While the potatoes are cooking, bring the chicken broth to a boil and whisk in the flour.  Turn the heat down and cook for a few minutes to allow to thicken. Slowly add in the milk and continue to stir. Gradually add (2) of the 3 cups of grated cheese and allow to melt.  Drain off the water from the potatoes and put into a greased baking dish.  Pour the cheese mixture over the potatoes and toss to coat.  Sprinkle remaining cheese on top and bake until the potatoes are done. (you can taste the cheese mixture to see if you need salt and pepper, it tends to not need salt because of the chicken broth)

Description: 
An easy very cheesy potato dish with only 5 ingredients.  Broiling the potatoes makes a wonderful crunchy chewy top that my boyfriend and I fight over!
