Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup canola oil
2 cups frozen blueberries

Directions:
Combine milk and vinegar in a small bowl; allow to rest for 5 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; make a well in the center. Pour eggs, milk mixture, and canola oil into well; stir until batter is just combined. Fold in blueberries and pour batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool slightly on a wire rack.

This is a modified version of a recipe given to me by a friend. I've subbed in all sorts of other fruits, and even veggies, for the blueberries, and they come out awesome every time.
