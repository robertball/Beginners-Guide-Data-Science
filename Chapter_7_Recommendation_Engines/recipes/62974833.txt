Rinse the sliced potatoes in cold water to prevent browning. Pat dry with paper towels.
Place a layer of potatoes in the bottom of the baking dish, sprinkle with, onion, cheese, salt, and pepper. Continue layering the potatoes, onion, cheese, and seasonings in this way, ending with a layer of cheese.
