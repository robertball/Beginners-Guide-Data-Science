Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
1 cup celery, diced
1 cup onion, minced
2 cups potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 cup carrots, diced
3/4 cup flour
1 cup bottled clam juice
3 (6.5 ounce) cans minced clams
1 quart half-and-half
3/4 thyme
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup heavy cream (optional)
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped

Directions:
Drain juice from clams into a large skillet over the onions, celery, potatoes, and carrots.  Add water to cover, and cook over medium heat until tender.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan over medium high heat, fry the bacon until crisp, about 10 minutes, crumble and set aside.
With bacon grease whisk in flour until smooth (may need to add more bacon grease or butter).  Whisk in half and half and stir constantly until thick and smooth.  Stir in bottled clam juice, cooked vegetables, and seasonings.  Heat throughly, but do not boil.
Whisk in the heavy cream and heat for about 5 minutes.(optional)
Stir in clams just before serving.  If they cook too much they get tough.
Garnish with parsley and crumbled bacon.

Description: 
Bottled clam juice is the secret ingredient for this extra-flavorful chowder.  Otherwise, this is a fairly standard chowder recipe with lots of potatoes, bacon, and onions.Modified from: New England Clam Chowder II
