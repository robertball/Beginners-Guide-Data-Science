Stir-in garlic for 30 seconds (do not brown/burn)
Stir in Italian seasoning, and immediately stir in the snow peas & 1-2 TBS water
Toss & stir (almost braising, though barely cooking) for a minute or two on medium heat until they just begin to change to a brighter green color
"Finish" cooking 2 more minutes, tossing & turning with 1 tsp FRESH lemon juice and 1 TBS Ex.Virgin Olive Oil, and a sprinkle of Kosher (coarse) salt and a few grinds of pepper
That's it ... 5 minutes, done, not overcooked. Serve these up warm!

Description: 
The original called for microwaving to cook this dish.  Whoa, Microwave?  Never, never microwave as your primary cooking method ... it ruins your food, cooks unevenly, and gives a tinny flavor.  Instead, so easy, this takes 5 minutes in a pan. You want to barely cook these as noted to keep the lightly crunchy natural sweetness of this seasonal delicacy!Modified from: Lemon-Butter Snow Peas
