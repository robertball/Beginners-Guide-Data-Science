Ingredients:
2 eggs, separated
1 3/4 cups rice milk
1 cup rice flour
3/4 cup modified tapioca starch
1/2 cup canola oil
1/4 cup almond meal
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.
Mix egg yolks in a separate bowl using a hand beater. Beat in rice milk, rice flour, tapioca starch, oil, almond meal, sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt just until smooth. Fold in stiff egg whites.
Spray the preheated waffle iron with cooking spray. Cook waffles until golden brown and the iron stops steaming, about 5 minutes per waffle.
