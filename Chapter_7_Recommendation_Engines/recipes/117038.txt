Ingredients:
1/4 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon shortening
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/3 cup 1% buttermilk

Directions:
Place onion in a small microwave-safe bowl; cover and microwave on high for 1-2 minutes or until tender. In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in cheese and onion. Stir in buttermilk just until moistened.
Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 8-10 times. Pat or roll out into a 4-in. circle; cut into four wedges. Place 2 in. apart on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 450 degrees F for 8-12 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
