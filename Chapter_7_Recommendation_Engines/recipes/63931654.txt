Ingredients:
1 cup boiling water
6 Tablespoons dried milk
1/4 oz (1 envelope) Knox Unflavored Gelatin
4 cups shredded cheese; equal parts colby jack, cheddar and swiss

Directions:
Put water on to boil.  Line your selected, prepared mold* with plastic wrap, set aside.  Once water has boiled, add to blender.  Sprinkle in dried milk and unflavored gelatin.  Pulse to blend.  Add shredded cheese and blend until smooth.  Immediately** pour into prepared mold.  Put in refrigerator until set, about 2 hours to overnight.  Take out of refrigerator, remove from mold and enjoy!  Keep refrigerated.
* I made a mold by cutting a Cheez-It cracker box 3 1/2" up from the bottom.  It's length is 6 1/2".  I lined it with press and seal, plastic wrap will work great, also.
**The cheese will set up immediately.  Pour into mold as soon as you stop the blender.
