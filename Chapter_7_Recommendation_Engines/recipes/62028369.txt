Ingredients:
Mousse Filling:
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp. peanut butter
3/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp. confectioners sugar
1/2 cup milk
1 cup heavy cream, chilled
1/4 cup chocolate chips, melted
2 Tbsp. chopped peanuts

Directions:
Cream the cream cheese, peanut butter and confectioners sugar in a mixing bowl with an electric beater on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes.  With mixer on low speed, gradually add the milk and mix until combined, about 20 seconds.
Whip the cream in another bowl to soft peaks and fold it into the peanut butter mixture.  Scoop the filling into the pie shell and freeze for at least 6 hours.
Two hours before serving, move pie from freezer to refrigerator.  Drizzle with melted chocolate and sprinkle with chopped peanuts.  8-10 servings
Chocolate Crust:
1 1/4 cups chocolate wafer cookie crumbs
3 Tbsp. sugar
6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted
Stir the crumbs and sugar together in small bowl.  Add butter and stir to combine.  Pat crumbs firmly over the bottom and up the sides of a 9" or 10" pie plate.  Bake at 375Â° on center oven rack for 8 minutes or until crust is crisp and golden.  Allow crust to cool completely before filling.

Description: 
This rich and delicious mousse pie is always a hit. I sold tons of them to area restaurants in the mid-90's when I was a dessert caterer.
