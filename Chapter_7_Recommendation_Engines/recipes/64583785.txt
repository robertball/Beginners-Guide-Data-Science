Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef or turkey
1 3/4 cups ketchup (I make my own)
1/4 cup mustard
3 onions, chopped
3 tablespoons chili powder
3 tablespoons raw apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup sugar

Directions:
Brown meat and drain.
Put it along with the remaining ingredients in a sauce pan and cook covered for 45 minutes on medium low.  Be sure to stir frequently because it will stick.
Serve warm on top of cooked hot dogs.
It is also great topped with chopped onions, relish, and/or slaw.
This recipe tastes even better the second day and freezes well.
