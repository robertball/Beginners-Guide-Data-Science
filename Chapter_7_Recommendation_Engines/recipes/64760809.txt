Ingredients:
8 Slices Thick Bacon
1 Small Red Onion
1/4 Cup Minced Garlic (or less)
2 Tbsp Salted Butter
1/2 Cup Prepared Pasta per Person
Drizzle of Olive Oil
5-8 Carrots
4-6 Celery
1 Large Bell Pepper
2 Large Chicken Breast
2 Bay Leaves
2 Tbsp Rubbed Sage
1 Tbsp Rosemary
1.5 Tbsp Basil
Pepper to Taste
2 Tsp Mediterranean Salt/Fine Pink Himalayan
1 Tbsp Turmeric
2 Tbsp Parsley
4 Cups Prepared Chicken Broth
1/2 Cup Arrowroot Powder

Directions:
Mince the bacon and add to large skillet (like super big skillet), cook until you get some grease, add chopped onion and garlic. Cook, and brown
Add cubed chicken to skillet and turn on low, add chopped bell pepper when chicken is cooked, but not yet browned. Add 1 Tbsp Butter, and lightly brown the chicken.
Add 1/2-1 Cup water to skillet (depending on how soupy you like it), turn up to boil. Add your chopped carrots and celery. Pour more water to just cover the veggies and chicken. Medium Heat, cook until veggies are at preferred softness. Do not cook for too long at high boil, this is what causes dried out chicken.
Prepare your broth in a separate pot. Put all of the spices in the broth, and the drizzle of olive oil. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
Pour broth into skillet
Add Arrowroot Powder
Make your pasta in salt water, cook al dente, drain, add other Tbsp butter, stir gently.
Put Pasta in bowl, add soup
Enjoy!!
