Ingredients:
1 (9.25 ounce) container cashews, chopped
1 cup light brown sugar
1 cup golden syrup (such as Roger'sÂ®)
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Lightly spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with butter flavored cooking spray. Arrange chopped cashews in the bottom of dish.
Combine brown sugar, golden syrup, sweetened condensed milk, and butter in a large, heavy bottomed saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Do not stir once the sugar syrup begins to boil. Heat to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball.
Pour caramel over top of cashews. Stir well. Use a heatproof rubber spatula to spread the mixture evenly in the dish; allow to cool for 1 hour. Cut cooled caramel into squares or roll into balls as desired.

Description: 
My Canadian grandma makes these every year for Christmas. She lives in the States now and has to have the Roger's syrup shipped to her, but plain white granulated sugar can be used instead.
