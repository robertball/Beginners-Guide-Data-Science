2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons water
1 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)

1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until dissolved.
Combine soy sauce, sugar, mirin, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes together in a saucepan over medium heat until the mixture starts to simmer.
Slowly whisk in cornstarch mixture.
Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened, stirring often, about 10 minutes.
Pat chicken dry with paper towels; arrange in a baking dish.
Pour sauce over chicken breasts, coating all sides.
Bake at 400Â° for 35 to 30 minutes or until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear.
