Ingredients:
2 & 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
1 cup sweet potato puree (just bake some sweet potatoes, peel and blend!)
1 cup soy or almond milk (or your favorite non-dairy milk)
2 Tablespoons lemon juice
1 Tablespoon brown sugar
1 Tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Measure out your soy milk and stir in the lemon juice. Set aside for 5 minutes.
In a large bowl mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt together.
Add the soy milk mixture and sweet potato puree to the dry mix. Mix until JUST COMBINED. A few little lumps is okay. Add additional flour if it seems way too sticky
For drop biscuits just spoon it out onto your parchment lined baking sheet.
For cut biscuits lightly dust flour on your work surface. Dump the just combined dough onto the surface and pat into a 3/4" tall round. Cut out your pieces and then combine the scraps, pat together again and repeat. These will be very delicate and may slightly pull apart while moving them if you are not careful. Just be gentle and pat them back together once they are transferred to the pan.
Bake the biscuits for 15 - 18 minutes or until they just begin to lightly brown.
