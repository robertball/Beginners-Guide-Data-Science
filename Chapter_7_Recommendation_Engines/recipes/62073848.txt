Ingredients:
non-stick spray
1/2 stick butter
4 oz non-fat cream cheese (or reg., or neufchatel)
1 C + 2 T sugar (or succanat)
1 egg
1 C whole wheat flour (or white, or half of each)
1 t baking powder
1/4 t salt
1 t vanilla
2 C frozen blueberries
1 t cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F, spray a 9" round cake pan.  Beat the butter and cream cheese until creamy, about 3 minutes.  Gradually add sugar then the egg, beating well.  In a small bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt.  Stir in vanilla; fold in berries.  Mixture will be super-globby - spread in pan.  Combine 2 T sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle over the top.  Bake for 1 hour, cool on rack.  You may double the recipe for a 9x13 pan, but only use 3 C of blueberries or you will have an overload.
