Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
3/4 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup shortening
1 egg
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
8 slices American cheese, quartered

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add milk, sugar, shortening, egg, salt and 2 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 4-6 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.
In a skillet, cook beef and onion until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in tomato sauce. Remove from the heat; set aside. Punch dough down; divide into 16 pieces. On a lightly floured surface, gently roll out and stretch each piece into a 5-in. circle. Top each circle with two pieces of cheese and about 3 tablespoons beef mixture. Bring dough over filling to center; inch edges to seal.
Place seam side down on a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 20 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-12 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.

My mom stuffs soft homemade yeast rolls with ground beef, tomato sauce and cheese to make these tasty sandwiches. They're great leftovers, too. My son takes them in his lunch the next day. -Nancy Holland, Morgan Hill, California
