1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 cup finely diced onion
1/2 cup finely diced celery
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 quart half-and-half

Salt

Directions:
Melt the butter into the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
Add the onion, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion becomes translucent.
Whisk in the flour and cook for about 1 minute.
Whisk in the half-and-half. Simmer until thickened.
Whisk in the chicken broth. Simmer until thickened again.
Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt, the thyme, parsley, nutmeg (if using), carrots, spinach, chicken, and gnocchi.
