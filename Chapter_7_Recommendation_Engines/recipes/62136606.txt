Ingredients:
Cookie:
·	¾ cup butter
·	1-1/4 cups granulated sugar
·	1 tsp. vanilla
·	1 egg, lightly beaten
·	1-1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
·	¾ cup unsweetened chocolate powder
·	1-1/2 tsp. baking powder
¼ tsp. salt
Filling:
·	¾ cup semisweet chocolate chips
·	3 tbs. water
·	1 tbs. butter
·	¾ cup heavy whipping cream, whipped

Directions:
For cookies, in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer, beat butter until smooth; gradually add sugar, mixing well with each addition. Add vanilla and egg; mix well. Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Add flour mixture to butter mixture; mix well. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with floured cookie cutter. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake in a pre-heated 400-degree oven about 8 minutes, or until done.
For filling, melt chocolate chips, water, and butter in a microwave or double boiler; stir until smooth. Cool to room temperature. Fold in whipped cream.
To assemble cookies, spread desired amount of filling on one side of a cookie, top with another cookie. Repeat with remaining cookies and filling. Store in the refrigerator.
