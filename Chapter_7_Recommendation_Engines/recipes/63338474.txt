Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups Flour
1/3 cup Cocoa
1 teaspoon Baking Soda
1/2 teaspoon Salt
1 cup Butter
3/4 cup Smooth Peanut Butter
3/4 cup packed Brown Sugar
3/4 cup Granulated Sugar
1 teaspoon Vanilla
2 Eggs
10 ounces Peanut Butter Cups, coarsely chopped
1 cup (6 ounces) Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, beat the butter, peanut butter, sugars, and vanilla until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition until thoroughly blended. Stir in the dry ingredients until smooth. Fold in the peanut butter cups and chocolate chips.
Spoon 2 tablespoons dough about 2 inches apart onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake until slightly firm to the touch, but not brown, 10-13 minutes. Cool for a few minutes before transferring from the baking sheet to a wire rack to cool completely.
