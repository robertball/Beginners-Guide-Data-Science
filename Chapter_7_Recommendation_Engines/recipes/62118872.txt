Make veggie mix ahead of time and store shredded veggies in refrigerator for quick use.  You can use flavored cream cheese if your child has a favorite and you may also substitute shredded fruits such as apples, or pear slices and sprinkle with cinnamon.  You can also make up a bunch of these and freeze.  Just pull one out in the morning for lunch.
