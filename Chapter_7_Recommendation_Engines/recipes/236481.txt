Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons salt
3/4 pound cleaned smelt
1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk together flour and salt in a pie plate. Dredge smelt in flour mixture, coating both the outside and cavity of the fish.
Heat oil in a frying pan 1/4-inch deep over medium heat until hot. Place fish in the hot oil; fry until crisp and firm, 2 to 3 minutes each side. Remove fish with a slotted spoon; drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
