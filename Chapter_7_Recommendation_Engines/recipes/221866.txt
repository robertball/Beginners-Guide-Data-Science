Description: 
This delicious beef stew combines elements of a traditional American beef and barley stew with those of the classic French boeuf bourguignon. I created this for my husband, much to his delight. Guests have raved, too. This is a time-consuming recipe, but I don't think you'll be disappointed. Serve with boiled new potatoes if desired.
