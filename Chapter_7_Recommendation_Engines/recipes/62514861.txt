Ingredients:
9  12 lasagna noodles, prepared according to package directions
2 cups cottage cheese
1 egg
3 cups mashed potatoes
1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese
6 green onions, thinly sliced including the tops
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 13 x 9 pan. Place 3 – 4 noodles on the bottom of the pan.
In a small bowl, combine cottage cheese and egg. Spread the mixture evenly over the lasagna noodles.  Sprinkle 1/3 of the green onion slices over the cottage cheese mixture.
Place 3 – 4 noodles over the green onions. In a medium bowl, combine mashed potatoes and mozzarella cheese. Spread the potato mixture over the noodles. Then top with half of the remaining green onion slices.
Place 3 –4 noodles over the green onions. Brush melted butter over the noodles. Sprinkle with remaining green onions and cheeses.
Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. Remove foil and bake for an additional 5 – 10 minutes or until the cheese begins to brown.

Description: 
I serve this as either a meatless dish with a garden salad or as a side dish. However, if there is any leftover, my kids request this for breakfast and I haven’t been able to think of a reason why I shouldn’t let them eat it then.
