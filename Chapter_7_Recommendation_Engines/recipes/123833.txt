Description: 
I CREATED this recipe 30 years ago, when my new husband requested deviled eggs. He wouldn't eat celery or pickle relish, so I substituted garlic and onion. He approved.    My co-workers always request these eggs for our potluck lunches. I'm not sure they know I can cook anything else! -Eva Friesen, Carson City, Nevada
