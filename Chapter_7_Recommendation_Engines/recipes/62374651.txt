Ingredients:
1- 16 oz can garbanzo beans (drained and rinsed)
2-3 cloves garlic
1-2 green onions
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup tahini
3 tbs olive oil
1 tsp ground cumin
chopped fresh parsley or green onion for garnish

Directions:
I drain and rinse the canned garbanzo beans.  I find this makes it easier on my family's stomachs.
Put garlic and onion in food processor and process for a few seconds.  Add beans, lemon juice, olive oil and tahini.  Process until smooth.  Blend in ground cumin.
Garnish with chopped parsley or green onion and serve with vegetables or pita wedges.

Description: 
I used to make this recipe from a vegetarian cookbook I no longer have.  I couldn't find anything like it on allrecipes, so I experimented until I came up with it on my own.
