Ingredients:
12 cups Shredded chicken (I boiled two whole chickens)
8 cups Shredded pepperjack cheese
8 cups Shredded cheddar cheese
10 cups Spanish rice (I made mine by cooking rice according to the directions and adding 1 can of tomato sauce and mixing in 1T chili powder, 2t cumin, 1/2 c fresh cilantro and 3 cans of green chili's)
Burrito size flour tortillas (60-70 count)
3 cans re-fried beans with 1 can of Rotelle mixed in

Directions:
1. Mix chicken and cheese together in a very large bowl
2. Arrange your assembly station with chicken/cheese, rice, beans and tortillas
3. At the bottom (about 1 inch from the bottom edge) put a few tablespoons of rice, few tablespoons of beans, and 1/2c of Chicken/cheese.
4. Roll the bottom edge over the filling, roll over one more time, fold in sides, and roll till at the top edge.
5. Bag in serving sizes (I did two per quart size bag)

Created this recipe to cut down on fat and money. Store bought burritos have up to 17g of fat in them per burrito! These have only 13g. Cost is way under $1 per burrito.
