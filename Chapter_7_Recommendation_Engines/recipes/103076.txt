Ingredients:
1/2 pound breakfast sausage, spicy or mild
5 eggs
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 (4.5 ounce) can diced green chiles, drained
2 green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch glass or ceramic pie plate with cooking spray.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; add sausage and fry until it loses its raw color, 5 to 7 minutes.
Spread sausage into the bottom of the prepared pie plate. Lightly beat eggs in a medium bowl, mix in Cheddar cheese, chiles, and green onions, and season with chili powder, cumin, and black pepper; pour over sausage.
Bake until set, about 20 minutes. Cool briefly, cut into wedges, and serve.
