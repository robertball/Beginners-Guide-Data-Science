Ingredients:
4  andouille sausages, sliced
4 cups olive oil
4 cups all-purpose flour
½ cup minced garlic
12 quarts chicken broth
4 (12 ounce) bottles beer (such as Shiner(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Bock)
4 cups diced sweet onion
4 cups diced green bell pepper
4 cups chopped celery
4 cups frozen chopped okra
2 ½ cups green onions, chopped
1 cup Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 cup chopped fresh parsley
2  whole rotisserie chickens, meat shredded and bones discarded
4 pounds 100-count shrimp
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes.
Whisk olive oil and flour together in a large stockpot over medium heat until mixture is thick and smooth. Cook and stir until mixture is browned and bubbling, 10 to 20 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.
Slowly whisk chicken broth and beer into flour mixture; bring to a boil. Mix sweet onion, bell pepper, celery, okra, green onions, Creole seasoning, and parsley into broth.
Stir shredded chicken, shrimp, and sausage into vegetable-broth mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer, stirring often, until flavors blend and vegetables are tender, about 60 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.

Description: 
Hybrid of a classic dish. Hands-down the best gumbo I've ever made or eaten. Served best over potato salad or rice. Yes, gumbo on potato salad is delicious! This was for our wedding rehearsal dinner; for a normal recipe, divide everything by four.
