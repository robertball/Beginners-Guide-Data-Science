Ingredients:
Chickpeas:
5 cups water
1 1/2 cups chana dal
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1 onion, roughly chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons minced ginger
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 tomatoes, roughly chopped, or more to taste
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or less to taste (optional)
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup chopped cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Combine water, chana dal, turmeric, and salt in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 20 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
While chana dal is cooking, heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering, about 2 minutes. Add onion and cook 30 seconds. Add ginger and garlic; cook 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, cumin, salt, and cayenne. Cook and stir for 30 to 60 seconds. Add water and stir to remove browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Cook 2 minutes more.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Chana dal should be soft enough to be easily crushed by a spoon.
Transfer 1/3 to 1/2 of the cooked dal into the skillet with the onion mixture. Use an immersion blender to process until pureed. Mix in remaining dal and cook until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Top individual servings with cilantro.

Description: 
This variation of mixed dal was developed over a series of happy accidents and has become a household favorite. This version has more ginger and a smoother texture. It's made in the Instant Pot® and I've tried it with a variety of fats. When using coconut oil, it has sufficient flavor that I think the cilantro is unnecessary.
