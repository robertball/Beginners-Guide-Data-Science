Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 1/2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes
1 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch cubes
salt to taste
2 onions, coarsely chopped
1 jalapeno chile pepper, finely chopped, or more to taste
4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 cup orange juice
1/2 cup lime juice
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 limes, zested
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 (10 ounce) packages corn chips (such as Fritos®)
1 cup crumbled cotija cheese
1/2 cup pickled jalapeno peppers
2 limes, cut into wedges
1 bunch cilantro, roughly chopped

Directions:
Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season beef chuck and pork shoulder generously with salt. Cook in the hot oil in batches until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch.
Stir onions, jalapeno chile pepper, and garlic into the Dutch oven; cook until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, orange juice, lime juice, chili powder, lime zest, cumin, and oregano. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover partially with the lid, and simmer until beef and pork fall apart when pressed, about 3 hours.
Divide corn chips among serving bowls. Spoon chili on top. Garnish each serving with cotija cheese, pickled jalapeno peppers, limes, and cilantro.

Description: 
Simple chili prepared in a Dutch oven, then served over a bag of Fritos® or other chips with loads of toppings (like sharp Cheddar cheese, scallions, diced onion, sour cream, and avocado). Perfect for picnics, block parties, camp-outs and game nights. You can simply pour out the Fritos into a serving dish and top with the accompaniments or--if you wish to be truly authentic, and I think you do-- serve the Frito pie directly in the Frito bag.
