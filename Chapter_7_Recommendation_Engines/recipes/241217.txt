Ingredients:
2 ½ tablespoons flax seeds
1 cup almonds
¾ cup sesame seeds
½ cup sunflower seeds
½ cup cocoa nibs
¼ cup raw cocoa powder
3 tablespoons raw maca powder (optional)
3 tablespoons chia seeds (optional)
1 ½ teaspoons spirulina powder
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt
1 cup Medjool dates, pitted
½ cup tahini
½ cup almond butter
⅓ cup honey
½ teaspoon vanilla extract
½ cup shredded unsweetened coconut

Directions:
Soak flax seeds in a bowl of water for 10 minutes. Drain.
Blend almonds in a food processor or blender until finely chopped; transfer to a bowl. Mix sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, cocoa nibs, cocoa powder, maca powder, chia seeds, spirulina powder, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt into almonds.
Process dates in the food processor or blender; add to almond mixture.
Combine tahini, almond butter, honey, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Slowly mix almond mixture into tahini mixture until it holds together. Form mixture into bite-size balls.
Spread coconut in a shallow bowl. Roll the balls in the coconut until coated. Chill balls in the refrigerator, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
These are raw, gluten-free, wheat-free, low glycemic snacks that are loaded with potent proteins, enzymes and nutrients. They contain copious amounts of raw superfoods, protein-rich spirulina, and raw Ecuadorian cacao. Think of them as a round granola bar: lots of packed energy, and easy to eat on the go. This is my go-to snack. For longer-term storage, keep in the freezer.
