Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
1 red onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons salt-free garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash®)
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika, or to taste
1 dash curry powder
1 dash ground cumin
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
1 (16 ounce) jar chunky salsa
1 (15 ounce) can chili beans in sauce
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can white hominy, drained
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
2 tablespoons hot sauce (such as Taco Bell®)
1 (11 ounce) can condensed Cheddar cheese soup
1 (1 pound) package shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add turkey, onion, garlic, salt-free seasoning, Cajun seasoning, garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, curry powder, and cumin. Cook and stir until turkey is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low and add chicken stock, salsa, chili beans, black beans, hominy, olives, and hot sauce. Stir and bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors have combined, 15 to 20 minutes.
Whisk condensed Cheddar cheese soup into the stockpot. Remove from heat when soup is melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Top each bowl with 1/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend.
