Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
1 green chili finely chopped
1/2 cup chili powder
1 tablespoon cayenne
ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together.
Pack all around a 10 pound brisket and refrigerate 24 hours before smoking.
Place in smoker, careful not to dislodge the rub. Smoke for 8 hours.
Store this rub in an airtight container in a cool dark place.
It is best to not store this rub too long or the brown sugar will harden and clump.

Description: 
This is another basic barbecue rub for brisket. What this one adds is finely ground green chili. What you want to do is chop up the chili and then grind it into the other ingredients. By using a fresh chili you get more than just a touch of heat. The green chili adds a fresh herbal flavor that really makes this rub stand out.
