Ingredients:
2 tablespoons corn oil
2 cups diced onions
2 teaspoons Louisiana-style hot pepper sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon chili powder
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup water
5 cooked hot dogs, sliced into 8 pieces each
40 RITZ Crackers
3 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet on medium-high heat. Add the diced onions; cook and stir until fluid has evaporated and onions are soft, about 8 minutes.
Stir in hot pepper sauce, sugar, and chili powder. Simmer for about 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and water; stir. Simmer for another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Arrange RITZ Crackers on a serving platter and top each cracker with a slice of cooked hot dog. Spoon a small amount of the hot dog onions on top of each.
Drizzle the yellow mustard on top of the onions and serve warm.
