Ingredients:
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 green onion, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons hoisin sauce
1/4 teaspoon chili garlic sauce
1 pound beef tenderloin, cut into 3/4 inch cubes
1/4 cup teriyaki sauce
1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Whisk together the sesame oil, vinegar, green onion, garlic, hoisin sauce, and chile garlic sauce in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add the beef tenderloin cubes and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate at room temperature for 10 minutes, or in the refrigerator up to 8 hours.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Spread the beef cubes onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 8 minutes for medium-well. Transfer to a bowl and toss with teriyaki sauce. Skewer each piece of beef with a toothpick and place onto a serving platter. Sprinkle with sesame seeds to serve.
