Ingredients:
4 cups apple juice (1 quart)
1 cup kosher salt
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon whole peppercorns
Rind of one orange or lemon (rind only no pith)
3 quarts ice cold water (a combo of ice cubes and water works well)
1 Turkey

Directions:
Measure the apple juice into a saucepan and bring to a boil with the salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, and orange rind.
Let stand for about 10 minutes to develop the flavors, then add the ice water.  Stir and allow to cool completely (using ice cubes helps this)
Add the turkey to the brine.
Refrigerate over night for turkey
Remove turkey from brine - rinse and place in large stock pot - on it's end to drain and the skin to dry - overnight in the refrigerator.
Roast as desired.   If deep frying the turkey omit the brown sugar, as it will burn.

Description: 
This is a brine for turkey.    It makes it so juicy you'll ask when you're having it again!  I do not recommend brining a turkey that has already been pre-brined aka Butterball.Modified from: Brine for Pork or Turkey
