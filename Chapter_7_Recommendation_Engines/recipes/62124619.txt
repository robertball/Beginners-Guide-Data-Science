Description: 
Got this recipe from a friend,they are always well received. These brownies are more cake like. The first time I made them I took them to work they were gone in a flash they told me to go home and make some more.I guess I should mention that I put them in the refrigerator until the candy hardens maybe 1hr but not mandatory.
