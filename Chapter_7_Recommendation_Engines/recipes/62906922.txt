Ingredients:
10 lbs of Apples (your favorite or a variety)
4 cups unsweetened apple juice
1 cup Sugar
1 Tblsp Apple Cider Vinegar
1 & 1/2 tsp Cinnamon
1/2 tsp Ground Cloves
1/2 tsp Ground Allspice

Directions:
Wash and quarter the apples, and remove stems. Do not peel or core, as they will be put through a food mill when softened.
Put apples and juice into a stockpot and bring to a boil. Simmer until soft and mushy about 20-30 minutes, depending on the type of apples used.
When soft, spoon the apples into a food mill and push through the puree while discarding the cores and peels remaining in the mill.
You will be left with very tasty apple sauce, which you could preserve just like this without going any further.
To make the apple butter, pour the apple puree into a 6 qt crockpot and set to high with the lid off so that the moisture can evaporate. Leave on high overnight or for up to 24 hours until reduced by half.
When reduced by half, add sugar, vinegar and spices and stir well. Continue to simmer on high in the crockpot for another 2-6 hours until mixture mounds on a chilled plate without any water seperating from the edges.
Fill jars and process in boiling water bath for 5-10 minutes.
