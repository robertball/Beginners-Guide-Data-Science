Ingredients:
Filling
Six 14 oz packages of dried figs, tips removed
1 pound dried fruit mix
2 apples, cored & rough chopped
1 orange, seedless & rough chopped
1-2 cups pecans
2 teaspoons cinnamon
2 cups Orange juice
1-2 cups spiced Rum
Dough
16 cups flour
14 teaspoons baking powder
4 cups shortening
6 cups granulated sugar
12 eggs
2 tablespoons vanilla extract

Directions:
These instructions are for ½ batch at a time you must repeat with remaining ingredients to get a full batch.
Filling
Open & cut off tip of 3 packages of figs, finely chop in food processor . Add ½ lb. of dried fruit mix chop, add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, use half the OJ & Rum to thin this mixture, remove to large mixing bowl.
Combine 1 cored apple (peel & all), ½ of the orange (peel & all) & ½ of the pecans & chop in food processor. Add this to the fig mixture and combine well.
Repeat steps 3&4 with remaining filling ingredients. Refrigerate overnight to develop flavors.
Dough
Cream ½ the shortening & half sugar. Add 6 eggs & whip this up smooth and light. Add 1 tblsp. of vanilla to this.
Combine 8 C. of flour, 7 tsps. of baking powder, and 1 tsp. salt. Add this mix to the creamed mixture. This should get to the point where it pulls off the walls of the mixing bowl. Divide into 5-6 packages, wrap & store these to chill overnight to ease rolling.
Repeat steps 7&8.
Assembling Cookie
Using wax paper under & over  dough roll out a rectangle-shaped sheet of dough. A thickness of about a ¼ " & about 6" wide will give you a cookie about about 2 ½ " – 3" long when done.
Down the center of the length of the rectangle spoon the fruit mix approx. 2 – 3" wide about ½" thick, from top edge to bottom of dough. Make sure enough dough left over at each edge to fold over the filling.
Fold the edges over and cut the filled rectangle you see into cookies approximately 1"  wide. Your result will be a row of cookies 1" by 3" and about 1" tall. Bake approximately 20 min @ 375 degrees.
When cooled slightly frost and sprinkle with some kind of colored sugar or non-parrels.

Description: 
This is my version of a dried fruit & fig Italian cookie.  My husband asked me 20 years ago to learn how to bake these, and this is what we have developed based on the traditional Cuccidati but updated. This is a lot of cookies. I have never counted but I would guesstimate we make approximately 200 or more cookies from this recipe it will depend on your dimensions. These freeze fine.
