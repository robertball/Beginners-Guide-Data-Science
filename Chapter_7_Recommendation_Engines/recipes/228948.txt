Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated

1/4 cup real maple syrup
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, garlic, and ginger until onion is softened, about 8  minutes. Add blueberries, maple syrup, cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, molasses, lemon juice, cinnamon, cumin, chili powder, paprika, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper; stir to combine. Simmer over medium-low heat until sauce is slightly reduced and bubbling, 5 to 7 minutes.
Remove skillet from heat; cool slightly. Pour sauce into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
