Ingredients:
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 cups water
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
3 leaves fresh basil leaves
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon salt (instead of using salt, use two halved carrots to reduce acidity)
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, saute onions in the oil until golden brown.  Add crushed tomatoes, water, tomato paste, basil, garlic, salt and pepper.  Let the sauce come to a boil, lower heat to low and stir occasionally until desired thickness.  Sauce is ready when oil rises to the top. Skim off oil.
