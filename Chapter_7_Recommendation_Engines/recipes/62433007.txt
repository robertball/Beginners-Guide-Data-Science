Ingredients:
Cake:
1 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup virgin coconut oil*
3 Tablespoons key lime juice**
1/2 Tablespoon key lime zest
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk
Frosting:
4 oz. cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup virgin coconut oil
1/2 Tablespoon key lime juice
1/2 teaspoon key lime zest
1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar
Topping:
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease or use paper liners in a 12-count muffin pan.
In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder and salt.
In a large bowl combine the sugar and 1/2 cup coconut oil, beat on medium speed until light and airy, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the 3 Tbsp. key lime juice and 1/2 Tbsp. zest and vanilla.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
With the mixer on low speed, add 1/3 of the flour mixture, then 1/2 the milk, then another 1/3 of the flour, then the last 1/2 the milk, and finally the last 1/3 of the flour mixture.  Mix only until the the last flour addition is just incorporated.  Do not overmix.
Pour batter evenly into muffin cups, about 2/3 full.  Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tops bounce back when touched lightly.  Cool cupcakes completely before frosting.
To make frosting, beat the cream cheese and 1/4 cup coconut oil until combined and creamy.  Mix in the 1/2 Tbsp. key lime juice and 1/2 tsp. zest.  Gradually stir in confectioner's sugar.  Frost cupcakes.
For the coconut topping, stir and cook the flaked coconut in a medium non-stick skillet over medium heat until lightly toasted.  Remove from pan to cool.  Once cool, top cupcakes with toasted coconut, pressing in lightly.  Garnish with a slice of key lime if desired.
