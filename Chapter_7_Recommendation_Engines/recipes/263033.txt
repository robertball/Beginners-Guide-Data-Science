Ingredients:
cooking spray
7 eggs, at room temperature
1/2 cup butter, melted and cooled
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups blanched almond flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a silicone loaf pan with cooking spray.
Whisk eggs in a bowl until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add melted butter and olive oil; mix until well combined.
Combine almond flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt in a separate bowl; mix well. Add gradually to the egg mixture, mixing well until a thick batter is formed.
Pour batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
