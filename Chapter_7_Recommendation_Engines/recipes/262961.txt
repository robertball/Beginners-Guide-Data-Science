Ingredients:
3 tablespoons sliced almonds
4 trout fillets
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsalted butter
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 large tomato, diced
1 tablespoon capers

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread almonds onto a baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until almonds start to turn golden brown and become fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.
Place trout on a flat work surface. Slice horizontally through the middle, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Open the fillet like an open book. Dredge trout lightly in flour. Repeat with remaining fillets.
Melt 1/2 cup butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place trout skin-side down on the hot skillet and cook until bottom is firm and lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn over and cook until trout flakes easily with a fork, 2 to 3 minutes more.
Heat 2 tablespoons butter and remaining olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute tomato and capers until juices are released, 2 to 3 minutes.
Place each trout fillet skin-side down on a plate and top with the roasted almonds and tomato-caper saute.

Description: 
I call this dish 'high-desert trout,' as it has become a mainstay in my culinary arsenal inspired by a brunch stop at a beatnik bungalow in the middle of nowhere set in the pristine high desert of 29 Palms, California, known as the 29 Palms Oasis Inn. A fan favorite with friends and family over the years and it gives me a good excuse to go trout fishing! The tomato and caper saute provides a palate-pleasing twist on the traditional trout almondine.
