Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 cups plain yogurt
1/2 teaspoon white vinegar
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onions in butter until tender and lightly browned.
Transfer onions to a serving bowl, and stir in yogurt and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate for at least one hour before serving to blend flavors. This tastes even better if it sits overnight. The onion flavor gets stronger.

Description: 
This onion dip is a hit with all of my friends. Sometimes I throw in some fresh herbs from the garden too. They can't believe it isn't made with sour cream because it tastes great! For really low fat, use nonfat plain yogurt. Perfect for dipping potato chips or veggie sticks.
