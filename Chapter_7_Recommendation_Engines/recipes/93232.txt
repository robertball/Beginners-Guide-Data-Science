Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 pounds beef sirloin, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 large onion, chopped

4 large tomatoes, chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried, crushed Mexican oregano
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Place the beef sirloin in the Dutch oven and cook until the cubes are brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion, red bell pepper, tomatoes, garlic, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, paprika, and water.
Continue cooking, stirring often, until the meat is tender, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
In this recipe, chunks of lean beef are simmered with fresh tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, garlic, and Mexican seasonings to make a rich spicy gravy (guisada).  Serve with warm tortillas and garnish with guacamole, sour cream, and/or cheddar cheese for awesome guisada tacos. If your gravy is too thin, whisk a 1/2 cup of the gravy with 1 tablespoon of flour and stir it back into the meat mixture; cook until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes.
