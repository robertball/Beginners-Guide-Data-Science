Ingredients:
1 whole chicken-boiled (or baked), deboned and shredded.
1 Tblsp. butter or margarine
1/2 onion-chopped
1/2 green bell pepper-chopped
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 can rotel
1 cup chicken broth (either canned or from the boiled chicken)
1 cup instant rice
1 pkg. shredded cheese-any kind, but i use fiesta blend.
1 large bag Doritos or nacho cheese flavored tortilla chips-crushed

Directions:
in a skillet, saute onion and bell pepper in the butter, place in large mixing bowl along with the cream soups, rotel, chicken broth, and rice. mix well to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste and I like to add a few dashes of chili powder for a little kick.
In a 13x9 baking dish (glass or metal) sprayed with non-stick cooking spray, spread 1/2 of the crushed tortilla chips, 1/2 of the shredded cheese, and all of the shredded chicken. Then pour the soup mixture over the top, and top with the other 1/2 of the shredded cheese. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes, remove and top with remaining crushed tortilla chips, place back in over for another 30 minutes. Allow to cool slightly and enjoy!
*Note* the reason you dont put the chips on top for the entire hour cooking is because they tend to get really dark and hard, and slightly hard to chew...but I found that putting them on 1/2 way thru the cooking process makes them come out perfectly done.
