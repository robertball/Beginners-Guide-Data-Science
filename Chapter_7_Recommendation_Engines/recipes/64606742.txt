Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1 cup butter or margarine
1 egg yolk
3/4 cup sour cream
1/2 cup sugar
2 tsp. cinnamon

Directions:
Mix flour and butter in large bowl.
Cut in butter until crumbly.
Beat yolk and sour cream. Add to flour mixture.
Mix together well.
Chill, covered in fridge at least 4 hours.
Stir sugar and cinnamon together to use instead of flour for rolling dough.
Sprinkle some over working surface. Roll 1/4 of dough into circle about 10" diameter, sprinkling with sugar mixture on both sides as needed, both to roll and for taste.
Cut into 16 pie shape wedges (I use a pizza cutter).
Beginning @ outer wide edge, roll each section toward the point in center.
Arrange on foil-lined baking sheets, fairly close together, but not touching.
Repeat with remaining dough.
Bake @ 375 x 18-20 minutes, or until browned.
Makes about 4 dozen.

Description: 
A Christmas favorite - or at least that's usually when I make the extra effort to make these moist little cinnamonny morsels. They freeze well and look great on a baking tray.
