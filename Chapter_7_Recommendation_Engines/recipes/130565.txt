Ingredients:
2/3 cup white sugar
1 cup corn syrup
2 tablespoons bourbon whiskey
3 eggs
1/3 cup melted butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup coarsely chopped pecans
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 (9 inch) refrigerated pie crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat the sugar, corn syrup, bourbon, eggs, butter, and salt together in a mixing bowl until smooth and creamy. Fold in the pecans and chocolate chips. Pour the mixture into the prepared pie crust. If desired, cover the edges of the pie with aluminum foil strips to prevent excessive browning.
Bake in preheated oven until the center sets, about 50 minutes. Cool before serving.

Description: 
My family loves this pie at Thanksgiving, Christmas or really any holiday of the year. So put on some jazz, pour yourself some java, and have a piece of this delicious dessert. The chocolate chips and the bourbon add a delicious change to the normal pecan pie. Top with whipped cream and enjoy.
