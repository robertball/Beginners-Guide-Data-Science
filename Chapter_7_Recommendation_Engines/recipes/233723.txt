Ingredients:
Â¼ cup crumbled goat cheese
2 tablespoons diced roasted red pepper
2 tablespoons chopped pecans
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4  thin chicken breast cutlets
8 slices pancetta

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
Mix goat cheese, red pepper, pecans, and garlic together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Lay each cutlet onto two slices of pancetta.
Sandwich each chicken cutlet between two sheets of plastic wrap; pound chicken with a kitchen mallet to about 1/4 inch thick. Spoon goat cheese mixture onto the chicken cutlets. Roll chicken and pancetta around the goat cheese mixture and place onto prepared baking sheet with the seam side down. Season each roll with salt and pepper.
Cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the rolls should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

I came up with this with some ingredients I had on hand and it was a hit with the whole family. Also great reheated for husband's lunch the next day. Who wouldn't love chicken stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon?
