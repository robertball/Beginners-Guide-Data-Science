Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
3/4 cup butter, softened
3 eggs
2 cups mashed ripe banana
1/2 cup sour cream
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour two 8x4 inch pans.
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. Stir in the banana and sour cream.
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and pecans; stir into banana mixture, just until combined. Pour batter into prepared pans.
Bake in preheated oven for 55 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a loaf comes out clean. Remove from pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or cold.
