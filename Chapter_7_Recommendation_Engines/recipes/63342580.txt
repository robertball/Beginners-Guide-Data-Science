Ingredients:
3 lb. boneless pork shoulder roast, fat trimmed
2 tbsp. flour
1 1/2 tbsp. salt
2 tsp. freshly ground pepper
2 tbsp. olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
5 fresh sage leaves
3 1/2 cups whole milk
1 tsp. lemon zest

Directions:
Mix together flour, salt and pepper and sprinkle over pork.
Heat oil in saute pan and add pork.
Turn to brown well on all sides - about 15 minutes.
Transfer pork and any juices to a slow cooker.
Let saute pan cool slightly, then add garlic and sage and stir constantly over medium heat until garlic just turns golden, about 1 minute.
Add to slow cooker along with milk and lemon peel.
Cover and cook on high about 7-8 hours but remove crock pot lid about 3 hours before pork is done to let pan juices reduce and thicken.
Serve with sauce.
