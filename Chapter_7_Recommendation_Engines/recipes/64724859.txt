Ingredients:
2 loaves day old bread, torn
1 package of bacon diced
1 onion, diced
3 stalks of celery. diced
1/2 tsp sage
1/4 cup butter

1 cup chicken broth

salt and pepper to taste
1 egg, slightly beaten
1/2 cup milk
3 Chicken thighs (optional)

Directions:
Tear bread into smaller pieces, put into a large bowl.
Cut bacon and fry in smaller batches in large pan until lightly brown.  Cook giblets in separate pan, don't overcook as they will continue to cook in oven.
Remove bacon from grease and drain on paper towel on plate.
Cook celery until almost cooked (in water or in microwave).
Cook onion in bacon grease, stir often.  Caramelize and drain.
Combine bacon, giblets, celery, onion, bread and spices.   Mix until ingredients are fairly distributed.  Mix egg, milk and broth and add to bread mixture.  Add melted butter.
Spray casserole dish with non-stick.  Place bread mixture into a covered casserole dish in a water bath (larger pan with water part way). Top with chicken thighs (optional).  This adds a lovely poultry flavor .  If using turkey drippings., thighs are not required   Dish will require 1 hour cooking at 350 degrees.
If you like a crunchier topping,  remove chicken thighs and brush with melted butter during the last 15 minutes.  Cook uncovered for 15 minutes only.

Description: 
A variation on our favorite Mom's stuffing.  Can be made inside turkey or in a water bath.  The caramelized onion takes the stuffing to a whole new level.  I forgot the sage one time and no one noticed.  Rave reviews from family.
