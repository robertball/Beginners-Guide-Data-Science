Ingredients:
2 cups ground flax seed
1 tablespoon baking powder
5 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup canned pumpkin
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup honey
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Whisk flax seed and baking powder together in a large bowl; add eggs and beat until smooth. Beat pumpkin, water, honey, salt, vanilla extract, and cinnamon into flax mixture until batter is smooth. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
A moist, flourless treat that comes together in minutes. A delicious way to incorporate healthy omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and fiber into your diet! The pumpkin is subtle, lends a touch of sweetness, and replaces oil in the recipe. Toasted with butter makes a winning breakfast! 
Feel free to make this savory by replacing the pumpkin with 1/4 cup oil, omitting the honey, and adding rosemary, garlic, sun dried tomatoes, parmesan cheese etc.
