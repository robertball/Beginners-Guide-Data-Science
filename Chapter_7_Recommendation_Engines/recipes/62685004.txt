Ingredients:
I used the choco chip recipe off the package as the place to leap off. I substituted homemade applesauce for the 3/4 C of granulated sugar, but used the regular 2/3 C. of brown sugar. I also substituted 1 C. of soy flour, and 1/2 C tapioca flour for 1 1/2 C. of regular flour. And I used whole wheat flour for the other cup of regular flour. Organic brown eggs, of course.... And a package of white choco chips, 3/4 C chopped cashews, and about 1 C. of dried cranberries.

Directions:
Mix as per package instructions
