Ingredients:
8 ounces egg noodles
4 tablespoons butter, melted
1 (20 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained and rinsed
1 pound corned beef
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 cups shredded Swiss cheese
1 tomato, sliced
1/2 cup crushed saltine crackers
1/4 teaspoon caraway seed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.  Toss with half the melted butter and place in a 9x13 baking dish.
Spread sauerkraut over the noodles; cover evenly with corned beef.  Spread mayonnaise over beef and top with the shredded Swiss and tomato slices.
In a small bowl, toss together crushed crackers and caraway seed with remaining melted butter.  Sprinkle crumb mixture over Swiss and tomato.
Bake in preheated oven 1 hour, until bubbly and golden.

Description: 
Satisfying, tasty and filling! A breeze to make. Using the Reuben ingredients and adding noodles really works. You can substitute Thousand Island dressing for the mayonnaise for added zip.
