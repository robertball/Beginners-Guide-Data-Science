Ingredients:
1 pound chicken tenders, cut into bite-size pieces
2 teaspoons garam masala
1 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
½  yellow onion, finely diced
1 ½ cups chicken stock, or as needed
1 cup apricot preserves
¼ cup white vinegar
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 teaspoon lime zest
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Season the chicken with garam masala, garlic powder, salt, and pepper; set aside. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the onions in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken; cook and stir until the chicken pieces are no longer pink on the outside, about 5 minutes. Remove the mixture from the pan and set aside.
Pour 1 cup of chicken stock into the pan and bring to a simmer. Scrape up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan; stir in the apricot preserves and vinegar. Thin with the remaining chicken stock as needed to create a smooth sauce. Season to taste with the hot sauce. Place chicken back in pan; simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Stir in lime zest and butter before serving.
