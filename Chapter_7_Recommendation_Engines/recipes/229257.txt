Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon maple syrup
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cloves
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Whisk milk, egg, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Stir milk mixture into flour mixture until just blended.
Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil on a griddle over medium heat; pour about 1/4 cup batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until bubbles begin to form on top of pancakes, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until second side is golden brown, 3 to 5 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
I loved the texture and flavor of the original recipe, but I love cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg in my recipes. Enjoy! Of course with any pancakes you can add chocolate chips, blueberries, etc. while cooking. It tastes great with dark chocolate chunks. Make sure you add them on top just before the bubbles all pop and before you flip them so the chocolate doesn't melt so much.
