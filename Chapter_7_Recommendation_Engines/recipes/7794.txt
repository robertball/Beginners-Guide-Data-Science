Ingredients:
4 cups cake flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 3/4 cups white sugar
6 egg yolks, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter and flour two 8 inch round cake pans then line them with parchment paper.
Sift the flour with the baking powder and salt and set aside.
Cream the butter until fluffy.  Add the sugar gradually and beat until light and fluffy.  Beat in the egg yolks and add the vanilla.  Add flour mixture to butter mixture, alternating with milk.  Stir the batter until smooth.  Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes. This cake rises very well so only fill the cake  pans 2/3 full. Cool cakes in pans for 10 minutes, then cool thoroughly on a wire rack. Frost as desired.
