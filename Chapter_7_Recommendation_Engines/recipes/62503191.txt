1 cup small rolled oats
2 cups boiling water
1 cup butter
2/3 cup cocoa
3 cups brown sugar
4 eggs
1 tsp. vanilla
2 cups flour
pinch of salt
2 tsp. baking powder
2 tsp. baking soda
Icing:
1/2 cup sugar
3 Tbsp. flour
1 egg
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup butter
3 Tbsp. icing sugar
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Pour boiling water over oats, then add remaining wet ingredients.
Mix dry ingredients, then stir wet into dry ingredients.
Bake in a greased 9 x 13 (or round) pan at 350 F for 40-45 minutes.
Icing: Mix sugar, flour and egg; add milk.
