Ingredients:
3 cups granulated sugar
3/4 cup margarine/butter
2/3 cup evaporated (canned) milk (5 1/3 oz.)
12 oz. chocolate chips OR 1 cup creamy peanut butter
17 ounces marshmallow cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Combine sugar, margarine and milk inot a large sauce pan over medium heat.  Bring to a roiling boil and continue boiling over med. heat for 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and add remaining ingredients (chocolate OR peanut butter, marshmallow cream, vanilla and nuts) and pour into a greased 13x9 baking pan.  Allow fudge to cool until firm.
For layered fudge:
Using two pans and twice the ingredients (I recommend doubling the ingredients rather than splitting...more fudge is better)Combine sugar, margarine and milk as above into two large sauce pans.  Boil each for 5 minutes and remove from heat.  In one pan add the remianing ingredients (chocolate chips, marshmallow cream, vanilla and nuts) and pur into a large greased baking pan.  In the remianing pan combine the remaining ingredients (peanut butter, marshmallow cream, vanilla and nuts) and pour on top of the chocolate fudge in the pan.  Allow fudge to cool until firm.
