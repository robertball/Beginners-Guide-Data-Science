Ingredients:
1 cup raw unsalted peanuts
1/4 cup old-fashioned rolled oats (optional)
1 cup raisins
1 cup dates, pitted and chopped
1 1/2 cups flaked coconut

Directions:
Place peanuts in a food processor; pulse to the consistency of bread crumbs. Add oats; pulse just until mixed. Add raisins and dates and process just until mixed, scraping down sides as needed. Add coconut; process thoroughly until mixture is finely chopped.
Press mixture into a round glass pie dish; refrigerate until set, 40 minutes to 1 hour. Cut into squares.

Description: 
These are a semi-quick and energy-packed healthy alternative to baked cookies and granola bars. They are very dense, but make a great treat to stick in a lunch box in small portions. This recipe requires a food processor, but a meat grinder will also do.
