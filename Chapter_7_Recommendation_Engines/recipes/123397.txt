Ingredients:
1 cup chopped sweet onion
2 garlic cloves, minced
3 tablespoons butter
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls
1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute onion and garlic over medium heat, in butter until tender.
Cut asparagus into 1-in. pieces; set the tips aside. Add remaining asparagus to skillet; saute until crisp-tender, about 4-6 minutes. Add asparagus tips and pepper; saute 1-2 minutes longer or until asparagus is tender.
Press dough into an ungreased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan; seal seams and perforations. Bake at 375 degrees F for 6-8 minutes or until lightly browned. Top with asparagus mixture; sprinkle with cheeses. Bake 6-8 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Cut into squares.

Description: 
'We have asparagus almost every day during the short Midwest growing season,' jots Judy Wagner from Chicago, Illinois. 'This quick pizza-like dish is great for a luncheon or a light dinner, or as an appetizer. For variety, you can saute half a pound of sliced fresh mushrooms with the onion and garlic.'
