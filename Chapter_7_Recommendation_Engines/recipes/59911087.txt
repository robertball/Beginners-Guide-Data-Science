Ingredients:
6 pork chops
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
2 egg, beaten
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 cups of chicken broth
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all purpose flour
8 mushrooms sliced
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with garlic powder and seasoning salt to taste. Place the beaten eggs in a small bowl. Dredge the pork chops lightly in flour, dip in the egg, and coat liberally with bread crumbs.
Heat the 4 tablespoons of oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the pork chops 5 minutes per side, or until the breading appears well browned. Transfer the chops to a 9x13 inch baking dish, and cover with foil.  Bake until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees, depending on thickness 40 mins to and hour.
While baking, in the pan you browned the pork chops in, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and add 2 tablespoons of flour, stir until flour mixture takes on a brown, but not burnt color.  Slowly whisk in 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and mushrooms.  Season with salt and pepper. Serve over baked pork chops.

Description: 
These moist and juicy pork chops are super simple to make.  Make a sauce from scratch instead of using  a can of soup.  Purchase the pork chops in the bulk pack at you local grocer.  If  you have extras wrap and freeze for later use.Modified from: Baked Pork Chops I
