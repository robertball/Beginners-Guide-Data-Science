Ingredients:
10 6-inch flour tortillas
2 cups cut up left-over rotisserie chicken
1 cup low fat shredded 4-cheese mexican cheese
3 T butter
1/4 of a large onion, diced very fine
3 T flour
2 cups chicken stock (or broth)
1 cup fat free sour cream
1 4oz can chopped chilies
1 cup low fat shredded 4-cheese mexican cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Mix the chicken and 1 cup of cheese in a bowl.  Fill the 10 flour tortillas, dividing evenly.  Place in a sprayed 10x13 casserole.  Set aside.
In a medium sauce pan melt the butter and add the onion.  Saute until clear and then add the flour, stirring well and cook about 1 minute.  Pour in chicken broth slowly, while stirring.  Once thickened, add the 1 cup of sour cream and the chilies and heat, but do not boil.
You can use an immersion blender to smooth out the sauce and pour over the rolled up tortillas, otherwise, pour sauce directly over the tortillas.  Cover with the other 1 cup of cheese.  Bake for 25 minutes.  Then broil for about 3 minutes to brown the cheese.

I found this recipe on Pinterest and tweaked it to make it lower in fat.  Using the fat free sour cream was perfect, I couldn't tell the difference.  Also, using the reduced fat cheese was just fine.
