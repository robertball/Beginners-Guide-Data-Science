Ingredients:
3 oz cheese (preferably mild cheddar) or combination of cheeses, grated on large holes of box grater (about 1 cup, lightly packed)
4 slices white sandwich bread (1/2-inch-thick), such as Pepperidge Farm Toasting White
2 T butter (preferably salted), melted

Directions:
If you want to make more than two sandwiches at once, get two skillets going or use an electric griddle, set at medium-low (about 250 degrees), for 10 minutes per side.
Heat a heavy 12-inch skillet over low to medium-low heat. Meanwhile, sprinkle a portion of cheese over two bread slices. Top each with a remaining bread slice, pressing down gently to set.
2. Brush sandwich tops completely with half the melted butter; place each sandwich, buttered side down, in skillet. Brush remaining side of each sandwich completely with remaining butter. Cook until crisp and deep golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes per side, flipping sandwiches back to first side to re-heat and crisp, about 15 seconds. Serve
