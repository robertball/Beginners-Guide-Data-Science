Ingredients:
Salad:
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1/2 cup frozen baby lima beans
water to cover
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup slivered almonds
3 Campari tomatoes, diced
2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions
2 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into small chunks
Dressing:
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
3 tablespoons almond oil
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Bring 2 cups water, quinoa, and bouillon granules to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Spread quinoa onto a baking sheet and refrigerate until cooled, about 30 minutes. Rinse saucepan.
Place lima beans into the saucepan and add enough water to cover beans by 1 inch; season with salt and pepper. Cover saucepan with a lid and bring water to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until beans are cooked through but still tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain water and rinse beans under cold water to stop the cooking process; refrigerate until cool, about 10 minutes.
Cook and stir almonds in a skillet over medium heat until toasted, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and cool almonds to room temperature, about 5 minutes.
Mix quinoa, lima beans, almonds, tomatoes, scallions, and mozzarella cheese together in a large bowl.
Whisk vinegar, almond oil, olive oil, Italian seasoning, basil, garlic, and salt together in a bowl until smooth; pour over quinoa mixture and stir to coat.

Description: 
Serve this cold salad as a delicious summer side to your favorite grilled meat  or try it alone as a great light lunch. I have been experimenting a lot with quinoa recently, and this is by far my favorite recipe. It's such a nice, healthy alternative to pasta and rice!
