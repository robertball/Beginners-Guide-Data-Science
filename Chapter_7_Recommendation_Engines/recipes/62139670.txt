Ingredients:
1 whole chicken
1 green pepper (diced)
1 large onion (diced)
3 Jalepenos (diced)
1 can spicy Rotel
2 packets taco seasoning
1 pack flour tortillas
2-3 tablespoons canola oil

Directions:
Place all ingredients except 1 packet taco seasoning (and tortillas/oil) in large pot. Fill with water until chicken in just covered. Bring pot to a boil, reduce heat, simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until chicken is done. Remove chicken from pot and let cool. While chicken is cooling, do not drain water. When chicken is cool enough, pick all the meat off the bones, and dice/shred into bite-sized peices. Pour off about half of the liquid, making sure not to lose any vegis. Return the chicken to the pot. Stir the remaining taco seasoning into the the pot. Simmer for about 10 minutes, use a slotted spoon, to spoon into tortillas. (best if you fry the tortillas in 1-2 tablespoons of oil first).  Serve with beans, tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, salsa, cheese.....
