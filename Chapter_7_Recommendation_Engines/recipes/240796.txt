Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup quinoa
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 small sweet yellow onion, chopped
1 sweet potato, chopped
1 cup chopped kale, or more to taste
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped, or more to taste
1 pound ground buffalo meat
2 eggs
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, or more to taste
1 tablespoon minced garlic, or more to taste
1 tablespoon ketchup, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch dried oregano, or more to taste
1 pinch dried basil, or more to taste
1 pinch dried thyme, or more to taste
1 tablespoon barbeque sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, sweet potato, kale, and red bell pepper until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Combine buffalo meat, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, ketchup, salt, black pepper, oregano, basil, and thyme together in a bowl. Add vegetable mixture and quinoa to buffalo mixture and mix well. Transfer mixture to the prepared loaf pan; top with a thin layer of barbeque sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
