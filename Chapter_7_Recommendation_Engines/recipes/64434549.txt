Ingredients:
1 lime
2" piece of ginger
4 large fresh, basil leaves

Directions:
Prepare a 1L glass jar by washing and rinsing thoroughly. Dry the jar.
Remove any stickers from the lime and wash with baking soda and water to remove any unwanted surface substances. Rinse well. Cut into wheels. If using a small mouth jar, cut each wheel into halves to make it easier for insertion and removal from the jar. Add to jar.
Wash the basil leaves with baking soda and rinse well. Tear the leaves into four smaller pieces to help release the flavour. Add to jar.
Peel and crush, very well, the ginger to help release oils and flavour. Add to jar.
Fill jar with filtered spring water. Affix a water-tight seal to the jar. Gently turn the jar upside down a few times to mix the ingredients with the water.
Keep the closed jar in the refrigerator for at least two hours. For optimal flavour let rest for 8 hours. Top up water when as used. This mixture lasted up to 50 hours in my refrigerator topping up 4 times.

I found this on dish.allrecipes dot com in an article by Vanessa Greaves. This is one of the flavour combinations suggested. I would never have imagined flavoured water with basil would taste so good. I tested out different amounts over a few days and this one worked best for my family's taste preferences. This is a wonderful combination for kidney health thanks to the potassium content in basil and ginger.
