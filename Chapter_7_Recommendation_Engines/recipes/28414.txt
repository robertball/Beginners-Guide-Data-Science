Description: 
I'm the mother of four boys who are definitely carnivores! I usually like to make a lot of easy prep slow simmer meals. Like stews, sauces, pot roasts etc. These things work for me cause the prep is quick and cook time is usually a no brainer...check every now and then.....and tada...dinner!!!!
