Ingredients:
1, 14 oz. pkg. of refrigerated Firm Tofu, drained
1, 12.3 oz. pkg. of shelf-stable Silken Firm Tofu, drained
1 Tablespoon Lemon Juice
1 Tablespoon Low Sodium Soy Sauce
1 Teaspoon Garlic Powder
2 Teaspoons Dried Basil
2 Teaspoons Dried Oregano
1 Teaspoon Dried Thyme
1 Tablespoon Dried Parsley
1/2 Teaspoon Salt
1/4 Teaspoon Black Pepper
1 can or jar, 26 oz., Spaghetti Sauce
1, 1 lb. box Lasagna Noodles (20 noodles)
1/2 Cup Mozzarella Flavor Rice Shreds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions until al dente.  Drain.
While noodles are cooking, make the filling.  Place both kinds of tofu, lemon juice, soy sauce, garlic powder, basil, oregano, thyme, parsley, salt, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl.  Using a potato masher, mash until thoroughly combined.
Lightly grease a deep-dish 13x9 inch baking pan.  Pour just enough spaghetti sauce (approx. 1/2 to 3/4 cup) to coat the bottom of the pan.
Take the lasagna noodles (a few at a time) and place them on a cutting board.  Put 2 Tablespoons of filling in the center of one end of each noodle.  Loosely roll the noodle up and place seam side down in the prepared baking dish.  Repeat until you have filled and rolled 20 noodles and placed them in 4 rows with 5 in each row.
Cover the filled and rolled noodles with the rest of the spaghetti sauce.
Sprinkle with the Mozzarella Flavor Rice Shreds.
Bake, uncovered, for 25 minutes.
