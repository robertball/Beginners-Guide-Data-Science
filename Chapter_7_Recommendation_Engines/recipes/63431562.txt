Ingredients:
2- 2.5 pounds oxtails, rinsed and patted dry
3 quarts cold water
1 tbsp. beef base, or to taste
1 cup barley (not quick-cooking), rinsed
1 bay leaf
6 black peppercorns
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 large onion, coarsely chopped
4 ribs celery, sliced abt 1/4 in. thick tbsp.
4 carrots, sliced abt 1/2 in. thick
1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
Opinional: 2 potatoes, diced abt 1/4 in thick

Directions:
In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, brown oxtails on all sides. There should be enough natural fat so additional oil is unnecessary. Remove oxtails and discard any rendered fat in pan.
Add water and oxtails to pan. Bring to a boil, skimming off any frothy foam that comes to the surface. Add barley, bay leaf, peppercorns, garlic, celery, onion and beef base. Bring back to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour.
Add carrots and tomatoes (potatoes, if using), bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour or until carrots, barley and meat are tender. Remove meat from bones and return to soup. Remove bay leaf and serve.

My grandmother use to always make this during the winter months and my favorite comfort soup! I have served this to many who know its oxtail and who don't. The one's who loved it most are the one who found out it was oxtail in the end! Love a best kept secret!
