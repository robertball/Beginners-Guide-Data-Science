Ingredients:
1 large yellow onion, diced
2 stalks celery, chopped
1/4 cup water
4 large yams, peeled and cubed
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 cups water
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
2 cups coarsely chopped kale, or more to taste

Directions:
Combine onion, celery, and 1/4 cup water in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in yams, tomatoes, garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper. Cover with 5 cups water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until yams are fork-tender, about 25 minutes. Stir in beans and kale; cook until flavors combine, about 10 minutes more.
