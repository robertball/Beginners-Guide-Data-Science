Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
2 1/2 cups tomato juice
1 1/2 tablespoons yellow mustard
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
20 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
5 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Cook ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes; drain excess grease and transfer ground beef to a large saucepan. Mix tomato juice, yellow mustard, black pepper, hot pepper sauce, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and salt into the beef.
Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour, stirring frequently.

Description: 
This is a spicy meat hot sauce perfect on hot dogs or hamburgers. Here in upstate New York you grow up putting meat hot sauce on your burgers, red and white hots. Adjust the amount of heat to your taste; the recipe as written is pretty spicy. I put the hot sauce in small freezer-safe containers and freeze for later use.
