Ingredients:
8 oz chopped dried dates
1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup whole raw almonds
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
1 tbsp coconut oil
3/4 tsp ground cardamom
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla extract
Pinch of salt

Directions:
1. Place dates in a small bowl. Add enough hot water to completely cover the dates. Allow to soak until softened, about 10-15 minutes. Drain, but reserve soaking liquid.
2. In the bowl of a large food processor, add dates, 2 tbsps of the toasted sesame seeds, walnuts, almonds, coconut, coconut oil, cardamom, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt. Pulse several times until mixture comes together to form a soft "dough," scraping down the sides as necessary. If mixture is too dry, add in some of the reserved soaking liquid, 1 tbsp at a time, until desired consistency is reached.
3.  Pour dough onto a piece of parchment paper. Using lightly greased hands, roll into a log about 10 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Sprinkle remaining toasted sesame seeds evenly over the roll on all sides, gently pressing them into the roll. Wrap roll in parchment paper, and place into the fridge until firm, at least 1-2 hours.
4. Remove roll from fridge, and cut into 16, 1/2-inch thick rounds. Serve immediately, or keep stored in refrigerator until ready to use.
