Ingredients:
1 (5 1/2 pound) bone-in turkey breast, skin removed
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
1 medium onion, chopped
1/4 cup chili sauce
3 tablespoons white vinegar
2 tablespoons dried oregano or Italian seasoning
4 teaspoons beef bouillon granules
11 kaiser or hard rolls, split

Directions:
Cut turkey breast in half along the bone. Place the turkey breast, green pepper and onion in a 5-qt. slow cooker coated with nonstick cooking spray. Combine the chili sauce, vinegar, oregano and bouillon; pour over turkey and vegetables. Cover and cook on low for 5-6 hours or until meat juices run clear and vegetables are tender.
Remove turkey, reserving cooking liquid. Shred the turkey with two forks; return to cooking juices. Spoon 1/2 cup onto each roll.

Description: 
I hope you enjoy these tasty turkey sandwiches as much as our family does. The recipe makes plenty, so it's great for potlucks. (Leftovers are just as good reheated the next day.)                    --Carol Riley of Galva, Illinois
