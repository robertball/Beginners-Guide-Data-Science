Ingredients:
3 cups boiling water
1/4 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms
1/2 piece kombu seaweed
1 tsp miso paste
1 tsp authentic mirin
3 dashes bitters such as Angostura?

Directions:
Rinse the mushrooms. Pour 3 cups boiling water into a pot. Add the mushrooms. Let sit for 20 minutes. Drain and reserve the water discarding any gritty residue.
Gently wipe the kombu with a damp cloth just enough to remove any visible contaminants. Do not remove the white film; that is important for flavor.
Add the kombu to the pot with the mushrooms and drained water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the miso and mirin. Simmer until reduced by 50%, stirring occasionally. Add 3 dashes of bitters. Stir and allow to cool. Scoop out the mushrooms and kombu. Use a sieve to strain out any solids.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to two weeks or freeze.
Note: you can freeze this in ice cube trays for handy single portions

Description: 
Fish sauce is a vital source of umami in Asian dishes, but not everyone can use it. Allergies keep me from enjoying recipes that contain fish sauce, so Iâ€™ve developed this replacement that gives a nice umami flavor without fish, animal derivatives, or their by-products consequently making this a vegan and gluten free recipe.
