In a saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat, Add the vegetables and cook until tender, about 5 minutes, transfer to a bowl.
Brush each wonton wrapper with water and place 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center.
Fold the wrapper into a triangle, release the air and press the edges together to seal, wetting the dough if necessary to make it stick. Pinch together the two corners of the folded edge. Repeat with the remaining wrappers.
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add dumplings few at a time and boil until cooked through, about 3 minutes.
