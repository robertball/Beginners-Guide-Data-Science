Ingredients:
1/2 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 lemon, juiced, or to taste
2 teaspoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package orecchiette pasta
2 cups fresh basil
2 tablespoons pine nuts (optional)
4 cloves garlic
1/4 cup grated Romano cheese
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 pint Champagne tomatoes, halved

Directions:
Toss shrimp with lemon juice and 2 teaspoons olive oil in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper; let sit for 10 minutes.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add orecchiette and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 12 to 13 minutes.
While the pasta is cooking, pulse basil, pine nuts, and garlic in a blender. Add Romano cheese; pulse until combined. Drizzle in olive oil slowly and blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
Drain pasta and mix with pesto; add tomatoes.
Cook shrimp in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 3 minutes. Add to pasta.
