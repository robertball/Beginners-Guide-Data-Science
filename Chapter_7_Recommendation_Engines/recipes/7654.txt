Ingredients:
8 egg whites
1 dash cream of tartar
1 cup white sugar
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 tablespoons grated lemon zest
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup finely chopped blanched almonds

Directions:
In a bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until stiff.  Gradually beat in 1/2 cup sugar.
In another bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
In a large bowl, cream the butter or margarine with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar.  Beat in lemon rind, lemon juice, sour cream, and vanilla.  Stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture, along with about 1/3 of the beaten egg whites.  Fold in the rest of the egg whites gently but thoroughly.  Stir in the almonds.  Turn the batter into a greased and floured tube pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 70 minutes, or until it tests done with a toothpick.  Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
This cake is pale in color, but very rich--much richer than an angel food cake.
