Ingredients:
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar or lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
1/3 cup Lindsay® Spanish Olives or Lindsay® Spanish Olives Stuffed with Pimiento, drained and sliced
1/3 cup Lindsay® Large Black Ripe Pitted Olives, drained and sliced
1/3 cup red bell pepper, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
4 well-trimmed beef strip steaks, cut about 3/4-inch thick
4 cups mixed salad greens
2 medium tomatoes, cut into wedges
2 tablespoons cilantro, chopped

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk together 1/3 cup of the oil, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. Add olives and red bell pepper; mix well. Let stand while preparing steaks.
In another small bowl, combine remaining 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, oregano, paprika and cayenne pepper; mix well. Sprinkle over both sides of steaks.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add steaks; cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until well-browned and medium rare. Transfer to a carving board; tent with foil and let stand 5 minutes.
Arrange salad greens and tomatoes on four serving plates. Carve steaks crosswise into 1/4 inch thick slices; arrange over greens. Spoon olive mixture over steak and greens; garnish with cilantro.
