Ingredients:
4 pork chops
1 Tbsp olive oil
¼ cup soy sauce
2 Tbsp honey
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp sesame oil
1 tsp ginger, minced
2 tsp sriracha sauce
black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 F degrees.
In a medium size bowl whisk together the soy sauce, honey, garlic, ginger, sesame oil and sriracha sauce. Pour over pork chops and let marinade for about 20 minutes.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet for medium high heat. Add pork chops, without marinade, and cook for about 5 minutes for the first side, or until it gets a nice brownish color. Flip the pork chops and pour the remaining marinade over them. Cook another 5 min on this side.
Place the skillet in the oven to finish cooking them. Roast for about 10 minutes, or until pork chops are completely cooked through.
notes: If your pork chops are not very thick, mine were about 1 inch in thickness, you might not need to finish cooking them in the oven.
