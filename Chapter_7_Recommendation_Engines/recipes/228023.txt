Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 bananas, mashed
1/4 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup chocolate chips
1/4 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
Mix mashed bananas and brown sugar together in a large bowl. Add eggs, olive oil, and vanilla extract; mix well.
Mix flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture. Fold chocolate chips and walnuts into batter. Distribute batter into the muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
I searched everywhere for a hearty breakfast muffin and had to invent my own in order to make it tasty and whole-wheat without loads of sugar or exotic ingredients. 100% whole-wheat. Almost no fat and very little sugar. But chocolatey and delicious. This is a very dense muffin that literally could replace a meal (if nuts are added).
