Ingredients:
1 cup water
3/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
6 cups halved fresh apricots
1 tablespoon butter
Topping:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
7 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/2 cups milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bring water, 3/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg to a boil; stir until thickened, about 1 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add apricots and 1 tablespoon butter. Simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Combine flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Cut 7 tablespoons butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles a coarse crumb. Stir milk into crumbles until topping is just moistened. Spoon topping over apricot mixture. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sugar over topping.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.

Description: 
When I was growing up, we had fruit trees and every year we had to come up with things to do with the extra fruit.  This cobbler became one of my favorites.
