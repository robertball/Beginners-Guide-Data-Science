Ingredients:
1 unbaked 10-inch pie shell
8 tart apples, peeled and thinly sliced
1/4 C sugar
1/4 C unbleached white flour
2 T fresh lemon juice
STREUSEL TOPPING
1/4 C unbleached white flour
1/2 C sugar
1/3 C butter
2 C grated sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a large bowl, dust the apple slices with the flour and sugar, then drizzle them with the lemon juice.
Give mixture a few turns with a big spoon.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F
Prepare streusel topping by hand with a pastry cutter.
Mix in the flour and surge and cut in the butter until the topping becomes crumbly.
If it seems too sticky, add a little more flour.
Fill the pie crust with the apple slices, sprinkle the grated cheese over the apples and cover the cheese with the streusel. The streusel prevents the cheese from burning.
Bake for 30-40 minutes until the pie is bubbling and golden brown.
