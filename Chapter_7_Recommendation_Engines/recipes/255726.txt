Ingredients:
1 butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed
1/2 leek, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch slices
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 (16 ounce) package pork sage sausage (such as Jimmy DeanÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place butternut squash and leek in a shallow roasting pan. Drizzle olive oil on top; season with salt and pepper.
Roast in the preheated oven until butternut squash is tender and lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Broil on high until evenly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
Cook and stir sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir into butternut squash and leek mixture.
