Ingredients:
1 1/2 c. All Purpose flour
2/3 c sugar
1/4 c. Special Dark Cocoa powder
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. baking powder
1 c. Fat free Greek yogurt
1 egg, beaten
1/4 c. Mild Olive or vegetable oil
1/2 c. Milk or low fat buttermilk
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 - 2/3 c. Chocolate chips (regular or min)
*optional: 1 tsp. finely ground coffee, to enhance the chocolate flavor

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line 18 muffin wells.
2. Measure and sift flour, sugar, cocoa and leavening agents. Set aside.
3. Measure and whisk all wet ingredients. Add dry to wet and mix with a spatula.
4. Add chocolate chips and scoop (with a #24 scoop) into lined muffin tins. Batter will be fairly stiff. A single scoop will be about 3/4 of a muffin; 1 1/2 scoops will make a bigger muffin.
5. Bake for 13 to 16 minutes. Test with a toothpick or cake tester to check for doneness.
