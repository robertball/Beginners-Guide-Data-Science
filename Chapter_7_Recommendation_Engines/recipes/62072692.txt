Description: 
I had been making this clam dip for years when my mother threw me an engagement party. I made this dip and my new brother-in law, who hates seafood, tasted it without knowing what was in it.  When I told him, he was shocked and now hunts for it on the appetizer table at every party I have.  It is wonderful cold or warm, but must be refrigerated overnight either way for the flavors to really pop.  Enjoy!!
