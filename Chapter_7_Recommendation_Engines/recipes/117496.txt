Description: 
Though fresh fruit steals the show in this morning medley, the subtle honey sauce makes it an especially sweet treat. 'It takes just 10 minutes to assemble this easy salad, which tastes so good with brunch,' says Dorothy Dinnean of Harrison, Arkansas. TIP: Don't have those fruits on hand? Try blackberries, mangoes or peaches instead.
