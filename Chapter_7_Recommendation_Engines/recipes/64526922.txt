Ingredients:
1 lb tubes & tentacles (buy the already cleaned to save TIME)
2 eggs
1/2 cup full fat coconut coconut milk
1 cup coconut flour
2 cups almond flour*
Hefty pinches of each: garlic powder, salt, pepper, dried parsley,  cayenne, and red pepper.
Coconut oil for frying

Directions:
Beat eggs and coconut milk in a medium sized bowl.
Mix the breading ingredients and and place in a shallow bowl right next to your egg mixture.
Heat your oil in a large skillet - you'll know it's ready if you drop in a tiny piece of breading and it begins to sizzle.
Slice up your squid (I bought a pound already cleaned because it's WAY less messy - I've ruined a shirt with these stinky-inky suckers) and dredge each ring/tentacle individually into your wet mixture.
Then dip into the breading and fry up until crispy.
Cooks note - make a big batch of this breading and transfer only a little at a time to a smaller bowl for dipping since it gets gummy and practically unusable pretty fast.  Make sure each part of the squid gets coated, then drop in some hot coconut oil.  Serve with lemon wedges or homemade aioli.
