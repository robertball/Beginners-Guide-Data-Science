Ingredients:
1 & 1/2 cups flour
1/4 cup wheat germ
1/4 cup rolled oats
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp grated orange peel (optional, but especially recommended with rhubarb)
1 cup fruit, chopped if large(I used rhubarb diced small, strawberries and blueberries)
2 TBSP sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1 egg
1/4 cup oil
1 TBSP honey
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 cup Greek yogurt
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees (for muffins) or preheat waffle iron (for waffles).
Combine first 5 ingredients in a bowl. Place fruit in the bowl on top of the dry ingredients and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Lightly toss to coat and then stir into the rest of the dry ingredients in the bowl.
In a separate bowl, combine the wet ingredients and whisk briskly.
Gently stir wet and dry ingredients together, just until incorporated. Place in greased (sprayed with oil) muffin tins, filling 2/3rds full. Bake at 400 for 20 minutes or until tops resist when lightly pressed. For waffles, follow the directions on your waffle iron.
Cooling:  tilt muffins on their sides in the muffin tins to prevent soggy sides; place waffles on a cooling rack.

Description: 
Use any combination of fruit to make these muffins. I had one muffin worth of batter left and experimented by dropping it into the waffle iron. Excellent as waffles!
