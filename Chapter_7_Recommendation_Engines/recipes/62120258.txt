Ingredients:
8 potatoes (white and starchy like idahos or yukon gold)
2 cans cream of chicken soup
1/2 cup (1 stick) melted butter
1pint(2 cups) sour cream
1 cup chopped green onion
2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 or 2 cups crushed corn flakes mixed with 1/2 a stick of melted butter.

Directions:
Pre heat the oven to 350 degreees farenheight. Peel the potatoes and boil them until they are just done(not yet near falling apart). With a whisk, mix the cans of soup with the sour cream and melted butter and green onions.  Whisk in the cheese(a whisk will evenly distribute the cheese).  Cut the potatoes into slices about one inch thick.
Lay a thin layer of the mix in a 13X9 inch baking pan(glass works best).  Then lay a layer of potatoes down, and a thick layer of mix over that... continue layering being sure to coat all of the potatoes well... and ending with sauce on the top layer instead of any exposed potatoes.  Sprinkle the corn flake mix over the top evenly.  Bake it for 45 minutes, it will be fragrant, bubbly and the corn flake topping will be crispy(this recipe serves about 12 people).
