Description: 
I love eggplant parmesan and this one is great because there is no frying. It is tough to get my kids to try things and they weren't really interested in eggplant but I cut the eggplant into shapes, like shooting stars, with a cookie cutter and made it more like nuggets for them. I still tastes great and they loved it!Modified from: Eggplant Parmesan II
