Ingredients:
16 large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon minced shallot
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/4 cup chicken stock
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/8 teaspoon ground paprika
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup crushed garlic croutons
3 cups frozen riced cauliflower (such as Green GiantÂ®)
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
4 lemon wedges

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place shrimp in a shallow baking dish.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic, shallot, and olive oil and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chicken stock, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, paprika, salt, and pepper. Pour this mixture over shrimp and sprinkle with crushed croutons.
Bake in the preheated oven until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 9 to 11 minutes; do not overcook.
While shrimp is cooking, place riced cauliflower in a large nonstick skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until hot, about 5 minutes.
Serve shrimp over riced cauliflower. Garnish with chopped parsley and lemon wedges.

Description: 
Shrimp scampi is a classic, but decadent dish typically made with lots of butter and served over high-carb pasta or white rice. This version lightens things up a bit and is quick and easy enough for a weeknight meal.
