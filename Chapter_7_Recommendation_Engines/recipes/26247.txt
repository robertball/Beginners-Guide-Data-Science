Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Saute garlic until browned.  Add sausage and cook for 4 minutes, breaking apart with a spoon. Add green onions and cook until sausage is evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
Stir in mushrooms, basil and oregano; cook for 5 minutes.  Stir in tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, and tomato paste.  Add water, red wine, red pepper flakes, and sugar.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for at least 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a great homemade sauce. It's savory and spicy, as well as thick and chunky. The secret is the combination of Italian sausage, green onions, red wine and red pepper flakes. Easily double or triple amount and top on anything! Even better the next day. Enjoy.
