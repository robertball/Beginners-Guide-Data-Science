Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1/3 c. flour
1 T. paprika
salt & pepper to taste
4 T. butter, divided
1 T. flour
1 med. onion, chopped (about 1/3 c.)
1 c. chicken stock (or 1/2 c. stock 1/2 c. white wine)
1/3 c. sour cream

Directions:
Pound chicken to even thickness
In shallow dish, combine flour with paprika and salt & pepper.
Coat the chicken in seasoned flour, shaking off the excess.
Heat 3T. butter in a large skillet.
Cook the chicken over medium heat until golden brown on both sides and cooked through (about 12 - 15 min.).  Remove from skillet and keep warm.
Add remaining 1 T. butter to the pan drippings if needed.
Saute onion about 3 min. until softened.  If oil still remains in pan, add up to 1 T. flour to soak up butter and thicken sauce.
Add stock and wine and cook, stirring well, about 3 min. over medium hear until reduced by half.
Remove from heat and stir in sour cream until sauce is smooth.
Serve over noodles or rice.  Pour sauce over chicken to serve.
