Ingredients:
1 Cup water
1/2 Cup butter
1 1/4 Cup all-purpose flour
5 Eggs

Directions:
Boil the water and butter together in a saucepan.   Add the flour all at one time and stir rapidly with a wooden spoon until the dough leaves the side of the pan and forms a ball.  Remove the pan from the heat and beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition.  A hand mixer works excellent for this.  Continue beating until the mixture is smooth and has a sheen.  Pipe the pate a choux through a pastry tube onto a buttered cookie sheet.  Bake for 15 minutes at 425 and then lower the heat to 375 and bake until a light golden brown (approximately 15 minutes) or until the sides feel rigid.  Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.
