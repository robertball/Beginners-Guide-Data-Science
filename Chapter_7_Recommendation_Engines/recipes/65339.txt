Ingredients:
2 teaspoons CRISCO速 All-Vegetable Oil
8 cups salted mixed nuts
1 1/3 cups SMUCKER'S速 Strawberry Jelly
4 tablespoons paprika
4 teaspoons cumin
Coating:
1 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons paprika
2 teaspoons cumin

Directions:
Combine oil and nuts in a medium bowl; set aside.
In a small saucepan, melt SMUCKER'S(R)  jelly over medium heat. Add paprika and cumin. Cook the mixture to the hard ball stage, 260 degrees F measured on a candy thermometer (or you can test for the hard ball stage by dropping a teaspoon of the mixture into a glass of iced water; the mixture will harden instantly if it has reached the proper temperature).
Immediately pour the mixture over the nuts. Stir with a wooden spoon to evenly coat the nut mixture. Cool for five minutes. Combine brown sugar, paprika and cumin in a small bowl. Once cool enough to handle, sprinkle nuts with the brown sugar mixture. Stir to combine.
Let cool completely, then pack into decorative, airtight tins.
