Ingredients:
1 pound ground country sausage
4 English muffins, halved and torn into bite-sized pieces
1 cup diced onion
1 cup diced bell pepper
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
8 eggs, beaten
1 1/4 cups milk
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Cook ground sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring often, until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Spread torn English muffin pieces along the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Layer cooked sausage, onions, bell peppers, and Cheddar cheese over English muffin pieces.
Combine eggs, milk, basil, and pepper in a bowl; whisk until well combined. Pour egg mixture into the baking dish. Gently press down on top of the casserole mixture with a spatula. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Uncover casserole and bake in the preheated oven until casserole is set and eggs are cooked, about 35 minutes. Check by inserting a knife. Let cool for 15 minutes before eating.
