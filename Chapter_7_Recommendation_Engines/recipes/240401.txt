Ingredients:
1 pound bacon, chopped, or more to taste
2 large onions, chopped
5 ripe tomatoes, roughly grated
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni, or more to taste
4 cups grated Cheddar cheese, divided
1 cup grated mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Cook and stir bacon and onions in a skillet over medium heat until bacon is crisp and onions are softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Add tomatoes to skillet; cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and return pasta to pot.
Preheat oven to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Stir 3 cups Cheddar cheese into the tomato mixture until cheese is melted and sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Mix sauce into pasta. Pour pasta mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and top with remaining Cheddar cheese and mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is one of my family's choice meals. I have even taught my 11-year-old daughter to make it. Awesome for busy weeknights and when you have your kid's friends over. If you prefer it meatier add more bacon.
