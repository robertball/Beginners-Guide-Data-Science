Description: 
I love serving this savory soup to lunch guests. Italian turkey sausage gives the broth just the right spice. I never cooked much when I was growing up, so when I got out on my own, I found that great recipes like this can make anyone a good cook. -Betty Christensen, Victoria, British Columbia
