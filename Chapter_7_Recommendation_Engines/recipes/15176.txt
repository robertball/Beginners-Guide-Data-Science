1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes

Directions:
In a large skillet combine the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, garlic, sugar, vinegar, oregano and red pepper flakes. Stir all together and simmer over low heat for at least 30 minutes (for the best flavor). Stir frequently to prevent burning.

Description: 
This is my Sicilian great-grandmother's recipe. I've never tasted better. Serve with meatballs and Italian sausage; it's also terrific as a marinara sauce.
