Ingredients:
2 cups dry polenta
5 cups water
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 kielbasa sausage, chopped
3 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
2 tablespoons red pepper flakes
1 pound uncooked shrimp - peeled, deveined, and tails removed
8 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Bring polenta, water, and salt to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to low and simmer until polenta is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook kielbasa sausage until browned, 5 to 8 minutes; stir in garlic, rosemary, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring often, until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Mix in shrimp and stir gently until shrimp are pink and no longer translucent inside, about 5 minutes.
Transfer shrimp mixture and any pan juices to a large serving bowl and stir grits into the mixture. Stir Cheddar cheese into the hot mixture until melted.

Description: 
This is a recipe my Alabama mama taught me, who picked it up when she lived in New Orleans. I make it for my family in Oregon and they love it too! This is a traditional Christmas dish for our family, but could be eaten as an entree, a side, or even breakfast anytime of the year!
