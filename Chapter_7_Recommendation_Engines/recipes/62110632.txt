In a food processor, grate onion on small grate size, remove from processor and put into lrg bowl.  Grate all bologna in the same way, discarding any big pieces that slipped through.  Put into bowl with onion.  Add pickle relish, 3/4 c miricle whip, garlic and mustard, mix well.  Cover and refridgerate for at least 2 hours before eating.  May need additional 1/4 c miricle whip, ground bologna somewhat absorbs it making it not so easy to spread.  Serve on white bread with an american cheese slice.
