Ingredients:
1 pound small heirloom tomatoes, halved
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons truffle-infused olive oil (such as Olevano)
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 French baguette, cut into 1-inch-thick slices
1 clove garlic, peeled and halved

Directions:
Toss heirloom tomatoes with chopped basil, truffle oil, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet; add chopped garlic. Cook baguette slices until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Rub each side of the baguette with the halved garlic clove.
Spoon tomato mixture over the baguette slices.

Description: 
Inspired by the Julie and Julia motion picture, here is a little twist on one of the most the delicious-looking recipes to grace the movie screen! Unless you and your guests are prepared to eat the bruschetta immediately, I suggest keeping the heirloom tomato mixture separate from the bread because it will become soggy. Serve the tomato mixture in one bowl and the bread on another serving platter. Be prepared to get a little messy!
