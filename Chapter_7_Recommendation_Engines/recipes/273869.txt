Ingredients:
1 large sweet onion, diced
2 jalapeno chile peppers, diced
1 habanero chile pepper, diced
6 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
12 Roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 fresh limes, juiced, with pulp reserved
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt

Directions:
Preheat a smoker grill for 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Add water to the bowl and wood chips to the side tray according to manufacturer's directions.
Place onion, jalapeno peppers, habanero peppers, and garlic in an aluminum roasting pan small enough to fit into your smoker. Drizzle with olive oil, stirring to completely cover.
Place the roasting pan into the preheated smoker. Smoke, using 1 to 2 pans of wood chips, until vegetables are tender but not dried out, about 1 to 2 hours.
Meanwhile, place tomatoes in a large glass bowl. Add cilantro, lime juice, lime pulp, cumin, and seasoned salt. Mix to combine, cover, and refrigerate.
Add smoked vegetables to the tomato mixture, stir to combine, and return to refrigerator to marinate for at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is not a super-quick recipe - this is a 'slow down and enjoy making a great, smoky salsa your family and friends will love' recipe. But the pico de gallo is very easy to make.

 I used a food smoker to get the smoke flavoring.
