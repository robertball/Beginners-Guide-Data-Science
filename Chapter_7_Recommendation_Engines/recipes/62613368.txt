Directions:
In a medium bowl with a wooden spoon, beat peanut butter until it becomes slightly creamier. Add sugar and mix well. Finally, add the whole egg and mix.
When well blended, drop by spoonfuls onto a greased cookie sheet or spray with cooking spray to prevent from sticking.
Bake at 350Â°F degrees for about 12-15 minutes or until you see them golden brown at the bottom.
