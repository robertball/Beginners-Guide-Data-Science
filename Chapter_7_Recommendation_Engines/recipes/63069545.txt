Ingredients:
One 24-ounce jar medium or mild salsa
Juice from one lime
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
One 1.25-oz. package taco seasoning
jalepeno pepper, finely chopped
1 can diced green chiles
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a slow cooker. Cook for 6 hours. Serve the chicken with the salsa mixture spooned over the top. If you're feeling crazy, throw a dollup of sour cream on top with some crushed tortilla chips.
This is also delicious as a taco filling or in a taco salad.
