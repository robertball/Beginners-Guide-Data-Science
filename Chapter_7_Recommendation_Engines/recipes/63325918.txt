Ingredients:
canola oil for frying*
1 acorn squash (large grapefruit size)
2 T grated red onion
1 or 2 finely chopped Serrano or jalapeno peppers*
1 egg
3 T all purpose flour
2 tsp cumin
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)
1 pinch cayenne/red pepper
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp paprika
4 Corn tortillas or taco shells
1 avocado
1 tomato
lettuce for garnish
4 T freshly grated Cotija cheese*

Directions:
Heat the oil for frying in a deep fryer or heavy pot.
Peel most of the skin from the squash. It is not necessary to peel the crevices.
Grate the outside of the squash by hand, or remove seeds and soft center, chop, then grate squash in food processor.
In a mixing bowl, combine squash, onion, peppers, egg, flour, cumin, black pepper, salt, cayenne, chili powder, and paprika.
Drop by spoonfuls into the heated oil.
Do not overcrowd the squash or they will not cook well.
Cook squash in the oil until golden brown.
Remove squash from oil and drain on paper towels.
Cook the rest of the squash in the same manner.
While your oil is hot, you can deep fry the corn tortillas until golden brown for a crispy chalupa.
Serve squash on or in tortillas/shells and top with the rest of the ingredients.  Serve with refried beans for extra yum.

Description: 
This is one of those recipes where you'll cross your eyes in pleasure after tasting.  Great for vegetarian meat substitute or hiding veggies from your kids.  They do not taste like squash. If you don't have Cotija cheese, you can substitute parmesan. But Cotija marries well with cumin.
