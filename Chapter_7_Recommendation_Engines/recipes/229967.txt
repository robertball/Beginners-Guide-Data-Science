Ingredients:
vegetable cooking spray
1 (18.25 ounce) package spice cake mix (such as Duncan Hines速 Signature)
1 (15 ounce) can pure pumpkin (such as Libby's速)
1/2 (12 ounce) package miniature chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 12 nonstick muffin cups with cooking spray.
Mix spice cake with pumpkin in a bowl with an electric mixer until batter is thick and smooth; stir miniature chocolate chips into batter. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean or with moist crumbs, about 15 minutes. Let muffins rest for about 3 minutes to set before removing from pan to finish cooling on a wire rack. Store in a covered container.
