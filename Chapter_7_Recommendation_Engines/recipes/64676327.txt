Ingredients:
About 15 cups air-popped popcorn (about 1/2 cup unpopped kernels)
1 cup toasted walnuts
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1/2 tsp maple extract
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp baking soda

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees, and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Combine popcorn and walnuts in a large bowl; set aside.
3. In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, maple syrup, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, cloves, maple extract, and vanilla extract. Bring to a boil, stirring often to dissolve sugar. Once boiling, cook mixture without stirring, until it reaches 230 degrees on a candy thermometer (or "thread" stage).
4. Remove mixture from heat and stir in baking soda quickly--mixture will foam up, so mix quickly but carefully.
5. Pour hot syrup mixture over popcorn and walnuts, and toss until well coated.
6. Spread the caramel corn onto the parchment covered baking sheets. Bake at 200 degrees for 60 minutes; stirring every 15 minutes.
7. Allow caramel corn to cool on baking sheets. Break up any clumps if necessary. Store in an airtight container.
