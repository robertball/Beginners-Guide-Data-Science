Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
3 tablespoons minced garlic
1/3 cup flour
4 cups half-and-half
1 cup dry vegetable soup mix
1/2 cup dried onion flakes
2 tablespoons lemon pepper
1 pinch dried thyme
1 pinch saffron
1 cup diced salmon
1 cup diced halibut
1 cup peeled and deveined shrimp
1 cup peeled and deveined prawns
1 cup scallops

Directions:
Melt butter with garlic together in a large pot over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour; cook and stir until mixture makes a paste and is fragrant, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk half-and-half into flour mixture until smooth. Add vegetable soup mix, onion flakes, lemon pepper, thyme, and saffron to half-and-half mixture; cook and stir until mixture thickens, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir salmon, halibut, shrimp, prawns, and scallops into half-and-half mixture; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring frequently, until seafood is cooked through and chowder is hot, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
My husband, a former commercial fisherman, proclaimed this to be the most delicious seafood chowder he's ever had. Also a huge hit with family and friends. Can be made with any type of fish or seafood. Add crumbled bacon for extra flavor.
