Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup cinnamon-flavored applesauce
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon coconut extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup cake flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup raisins
4 (1.23 ounce) packages instant apple-cinnamon oatmeal
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1 cup whole wheat flour

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix together butter, white sugar, brown sugar, applesauce, egg, vanilla, coconut extract, and almond extract in a large bowl until smooth in texture. Add cake flour, baking soda, and salt; mix until blended. Stir in raisins, instant oatmeal, and dried cranberries. Mix in whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until blended. Drop tablespoon-sized scoops of dough onto a nonstick cookie sheet and flatten dough with a spoon.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
Be warned: These breakfast cookies are addictive. I took a basic oatmeal cookie recipe and pumped it up. It has whole wheat flour so it's filling and excellent as a breakfast cookie. I gave a friend this recipe and her family can't get enough. Incredible flavor!
