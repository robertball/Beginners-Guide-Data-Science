Ingredients:
*Cooking Ham, cubed, approx. 1/4 cup
*Salt Pork, cubed, about 4 or 5 one inch cubes
1 tbsp. olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 can (14 oz.) diced tomatoes
2 cans (15 oz. ea.) black beans (partially drained)
1 can (8 oz.) tomato sauce
1 tsp. oregano
1/4 tsp. salt
Additional salt to taste
Cooked rice

Directions:
* Note:  You may use 5 to 7 strips of bacon, diced, in place of the cooking ham AND salt pork.  You may find you will not need the olive oil if you use the bacon.
Cooking directions:  In large saucepot, heat olive oil.  Add cooking ham and salt pork.  Cook for about a minute to release flavor, stirring often to avoid sticking.  Add onion, green pepper and garlic.  Saute about a minute or two.  Add tomatoes, beans, tomato sauce, oregano and 1/4 tsp. salt.  Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.  Add additional salt to your liking.  Serve over hot cooked rice.
If you desire less liquid in your beans, you may drain the beans prior to adding to the pot.  Our family likes "sauce" over their rice so I only partially drain the beans.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite Puerto Rican dishes my mom used to make.  I've had so many people ask me for this.  This recipe works great for garbanzo beans (chick peas) as well.  serve over a bed of rice.  YUM!
