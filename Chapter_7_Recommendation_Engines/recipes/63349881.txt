Ingredients:
2 cups red quinoa
3 cups water
4 handfuls of greens
10 rice paper wrappers
Dressing:
4 Tbs. rice vinegar
5 Tbs. soy sauce
2 tsp. minced garlic
2 Tbs. minced ginger
4 tsp. sesame oil

Directions:
Rinse and drain the quinoa and cook for 12 minutes in 3 cups of water. While quinoa cooks, make the dressing, cut up the greens and whisk the greens and dressing together in a bowl. Once quinoa is done, combine it with the dressed greens.
Before assembling the spring rolls,  fill a square pan with water.  Then soak a wrapper for 30 seconds or until it begins to soften. Donâ€™t let it sit for too long because it will soften and fall apart. Place the wet rice wrapper on a flat surface and with a spoon fill the wrapper with about 3 Tbs. of the lettuce-quinoa mixture. Fold the edges over and roll into a spring roll.  Repeat by soaking another rice wrapper and wrapping it. Keep going until all the filling has been used.
