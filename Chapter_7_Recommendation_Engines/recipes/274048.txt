Ingredients:
2 tablespoons coconut oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 medium onion, cut into half moons
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
2 tablespoons curry powder
3 pods cardamom pods
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
½ cup plain yogurt
½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 cube chicken bouillon

Directions:
Heat coconut oil over medium heat in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet. Add chicken and brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Season with salt and pepper. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add ginger and garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in curry powder, cardamom, and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Pour coconut milk into the skillet and scrape all cooked bits from the bottom. Pour in tomatoes, yogurt, cilantro, lemon juice, and chicken bouillon. Mix well. Reduce heat to low and let simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This mild chicken curry has a rich, creamy gravy that is divine. A little citrus lifts the coconut and enhances that flavor of the complex spice blend. Part of our constant meal rotation, it's well received and often requested.
