Ingredients:
10 fresh tomatillos, husks removed
2 fresh jalapeno peppers, stems removed
1 bunch fresh cilantro, stems trimmed
3 avocados, peeled and pitted
1 tablespoon garlic powder
salt to taste

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil and stir in tomatillos and jalapenos. Boil until tomatillos turn bright green and soft, about 10 minutes.
Place cilantro, avocados, cooked tomatillos, and cooked jalapenos into a blender, working in batches if necessary. Blend until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add about 1 tablespoon of tomatillo cooking water, or as needed, if salsa is too thick.
Stop the blender, and season the salsa with garlic powder and salt to taste. Blend again briefly to mix in the seasonings. Transfer to a bowl for serving.

Description: 
This is a green salsa I learned while in Mexico. It is a green salsa with avocado and it is delicious! I always make it when we do carne asada. I am always begged for the recipe. Enjoy!
