Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix
5 tablespoons salsa, divided
8 (6 inch) corn tortillas
2 cups shredded cooked turkey
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 cups shredded red cabbage
1 cup crumbled queso fresco
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
1/2 cup sliced green onion

Directions:
Stir milk, mayonnaise, ranch, dressing mix, and 1 tablespoon salsa together in a small bowl. Chill, covered, until serving.
Warm tortillas in a large dry skillet over medium-high heat, about 30 seconds per side. Stack and wrap in foil to keep warm.
Stir together remaining salsa, turkey, and cumin in a skillet; cook over medium heat until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Divide among tortillas. Top each taco with red cabbage, queso fresco, avocado, green onions and 1 tablespoon ranch dressing.
