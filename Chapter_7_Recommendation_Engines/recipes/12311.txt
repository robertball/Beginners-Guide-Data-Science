Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups vanilla wafer crumbs
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
1/3 cup cold milk
3 egg yolks
2/3 cup white sugar
1 cup hot milk
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
3 egg whites
1 cup heavy cream, whipped
1 1/2 cups fresh shredded coconut
1 tablespoon fresh shredded coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together wafer crumbs and melted butter. Press mixture firmly into bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Bake in preheated oven for 7 minutes. Remove and allow to cool.
Dissolve gelatin in cold milk and set aside to soften.
Beat egg yolks and sugar together, then slowly pour in hot milk while whisking constantly.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture coats a spoon. Remove from heat, then stir in gelatin, followed by almond extract. Chill.
Beat egg whites until stiff. Fold egg whites, whipped cream, and coconut into chilled custard. Pour into pie shell, and sprinkle with additional coconut. Chill 6 hours or overnight before serving.
