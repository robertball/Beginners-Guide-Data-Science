Ingredients:
1 (17.6 ounce) container full-fat Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons maple syrup, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup freeze-dried blueberries
2 tablespoons cacao nibs

Directions:
Line two 9-inch rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk together yogurt, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Divide mixture between the 2 baking sheets and spread out using a spatula until about 1/4-inch thick. Scatter sliced almonds, dried blueberries, and cacao nibs evenly over each baking sheet.
Place baking sheets in the freezer for at least 3 hours, or overnight. Remove from freezer and roughly break or slice into about 2 dozen pieces.
