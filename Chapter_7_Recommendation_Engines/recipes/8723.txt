Ingredients:
3 pounds chicken thighs
2 tablespoons soy sauce
½ cup ketchup
¼ cup corn syrup
1 pinch garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Rinse the chicken pieces and place them, single layer and skin side up, in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Mix the soy sauce, ketchup, corn syrup and garlic powder in a small bowl. Baste the chicken with the sauce, reserving some sauce for basting during baking. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven, basting approximately every 15 minutes, for 1 hour (or until chicken is done and juices run clear).
