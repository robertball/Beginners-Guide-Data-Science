Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
4 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
8 ounces braunschweiger (liverwurst), sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir potatoes into hot oil to coat; season with garlic powder and onion powder. Place a cover on the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are browned and tender, about 15 minutes. Drain excess oil.
Mash braunschweiger into the potato mixture. Cook and stir until the braunschweiger is hot and slightly crisp, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to serve.

Description: 
I was making breakfast one morning and decided I wanted some kind of meat to go with my eggs and fried potatoes.  All we had on hand was some braunschweiger, so I tossed some in the pan with the potatoes and this dish was born.
