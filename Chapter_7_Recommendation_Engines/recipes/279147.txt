Description: 
This picture-perfect focaccia is both a beautiful bread art piece and also happens to be incredibly delicious. Made with traditional yeasted dough, it uses a bit of milk (instead of sugar) to help the yeast rise and give additional flavor. It looks like a complicated project, but actually comes together super fast. Don't be scared by the prep time, most of the work happens while the dough is rising!
