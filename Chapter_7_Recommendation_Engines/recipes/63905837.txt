1/2 cup green pepper, chopped, 2 ounces
1/2 cup celery, sliced thin, 2 small stalks
1/2 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced, 2 ounces or 4 medium
1/4 cup onion, chopped, 1 1/4 ounces
2 cans chicken broth or 4 cups homemade broth

1/2 cup water
1/2 cup carrots, sliced, 2 1/2 ounces or 1 medium carrot *
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Heat the oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the chicken; cook and stir 4-5 minutes or just until no longer pink.
Add the green pepper, celery, mushrooms and onions. Cook and stir 7 minutes or until the vegetables are tender crisp.
Add the broth, bouillon, water, carrots, parsley, pepper and salt.
Simmer, uncovered, 15-20 minutes or until the carrots are tender.
Add the Egg Noodles and simmer a few minutes until heated through.
EGG NOODLES: 3 eggs, 2 tablespoons heavy cream, 1/8 teaspoon salt, pinch pepper. Whisk all of the ingredients together in a small bowl. Pour 3 tablespoons of egg mixture into a hot buttered 7-8" skillet and swirl around until the mixture coats the bottom of the pan. Cook until the eggs are set but not browned. Flip and lightly cook on the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter to make 4 crepes. Cut the crepes into strips resembling flat noodles.
