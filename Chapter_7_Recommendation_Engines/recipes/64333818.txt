Ingredients:
1 med. cabbage
½ cup water
2 pounds of ground meat, I use a mixture of beef, pork and veal. If you can't find the mixture use 1 pound of beef and 1 pound of pork
1 egg
1 cup rice
½ cup chopped onion
¼ cup minced fresh parsley
2 lg cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp salt
1 tsp dried thyme,basil and oregano
¼ tsp pepper
1 28 oz tin tomatoes with juice, crushed and pureed
½ tsp dried thyme, basil or oregano(second amt)

Directions:
Place cabbage, core end down and water in a 8-10 cup microwave safe casserole. cover and microwave on high for 10 to 15 minutes or until outer leaves of cabbage are soft. Drain and cool.
Remove 12 leaves carefully, Trim out the thick stem of the larger leaves to make them easier to roll.
In a large bowl mix together all the remaining ingredients except tomatoes and the second amt of dried herbs.
Divide this mixture into 12 equal parts, and place one part on the stem end of each cabbage leaf. Roll up leaves and fold in ends. Place rolls, seam side down, in a casserole dish large enough to hold rolls in a single layer.
Combine tomatoes and second amt of herbs and pour over cabbage rolls. cover dish and in 350% oven until done (approx 60 mins)
Let stand 10 mins. before serving
*Cabbage can also be boiled. If boiled don't discard the water, this is great for split pea soup.
