Ingredients:
2/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 1/3 cups sugar
2/3 cup fresh orange juice
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon grated orange peel
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
2 eggs
2 cups cake flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
FROSTING:
1 cup flaked coconut
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons fresh orange juice
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
4 teaspoons grated orange peel, divided
1 cup heavy cream, whipped

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add juices and peel; mix well (mixture may appear curdled). Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift flour with baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture and mix well. Pour into two greased and floured 8-inch cake pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes or until cake tests done. Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
For frosting, combine coconut, sugar, juices and 3 tablespoons peel; mix well. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes or until sugar is dissolved. Fold in whipped cream. Spread between cake layers and over the top. Sprinkle with remaining orange peel. Chill for at least 1 hour. Store in the refrigerator.
