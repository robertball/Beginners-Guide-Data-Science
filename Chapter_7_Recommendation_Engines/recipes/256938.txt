Description: 
We just returned from a glorious vacation to Maui. Our memories quickly became all the more glorious upon our return to rainy Seattle! 
Now, on a gloomy Saturday afternoon, I have put together this dish to bring a little Hawaii back into our lives and kitchen. You can serve as a salad over finely sliced red and green cabbage (I prefer Napa cabbage).
