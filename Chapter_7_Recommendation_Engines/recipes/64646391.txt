Ingredients:
100 g shrimp
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon sake
1 avocado
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
1 pinch salt
1 pinch pepper
1/2tomatoes
1 -2 green lettuce
4 slices bread
30 g cheese
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Put the shrimps in a microwave-safe bowl then add a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper. Add a teaspoon of cornstarch and a teaspoon of sake then mix well. Cover the bowl or wrap it with a microwave-safe cling wrap then cook in the microwave for 2 minutes using 600W.
Put the avocado in a bowl then mash using a fork. Squeeze out the juice from half of a lemon or about 1 tablespoon of lemon juice onto the avocado to prevent it from browning. Add a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil and then season it with a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix the ingredients well until well-combined.
Wash and then dry the green lettuce then tear it into smaller pieces about the size of the sliced bread.
Slice the tomato thinly then place on top of a paper towel. The kitchen paper will absorb the excess liquid from the tomatoes. Let the paper towel absorb the liquid for about 10 minutes.
Place the green lettuce on top of 2 slices of bread then add a slice of tomato. Spread the avocado mixture evenly on top of the tomato. Add some cheese on top. Arrange the shrimps evenly on top. Add some more cheese then sprinkle with a pinch of pepper.
Preheat your sandwich maker.
Toast it until it is brown and crispy which usually takes about 5 minutes.
