Description: 
This is a favorite of mine, my friend introduced us to it. It's really simple, very few ingredients, and tastes amazing! So easy, low prep time, and great flavor results. Mmmmm. I serve this with couscous and you can even chop some of the apples and rosemary up from the dish and mix into the couscous.
