Ingredients:
For the sauce:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2-4 teaspoons chili garlic sauce, such as Sriracha sauce
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
1 teaspoon rice vinegar
For the shrimp:
1 lb. medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 egg, beaten
1 cup milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
2-4 cups vegetable oil

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine egg and milk. Add shrimp and stir to coat.
In a separate bowl, combine flour, breadcrumbs, salt, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and basil. Pour half of the bread coating into a large resealable plastic bag. Add shrimp, seal bag, and shake until shrimp is thoroughly coated.
Return shrimp to the egg mixture; coat. Pour the second half of the breading into the plastic bag. Add shrimp and shake until thoroughly coated.
Refrigerate shrimp for 20 minutes to ensure the coating adheres to the shrimp.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Working in batches, add shrimp and fry, turning halfway through, until golden brown, about 2-4 minutes.
Remove shrimp from oil and place on paper towels to drain.
Drizzle sauce over the shrimp or serve alongside as a dipping sauce.

Description: 
I found this recipe floating around the web a few months ago.  Only later did I discover that itâ€™s a copy cat recipe for a very popular appetizer at Bonefish Grill.
Double battering the shrimp ensures a super crispy coating.  And the sauce is creamy, tangy, and spicy.  It's the best thing I have ever fried.
