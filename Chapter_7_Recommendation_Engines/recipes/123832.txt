Description: 
I REMEMBER going blackberry picking with Mom and Grandma. Even at 70 years old, Grandma could pick 3 gallons of berries before I had my pail half full.    Grandma made up this recipe with her mom, and it's been passed down for five generations now. -Diana Martin, Moundsville, West Virginia
