Ingredients:
1 small onion, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

8 whole black peppercorns, crushed
1 tablespoon pickling salt
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon celery seed
1 (4 pound) beef brisket
1 cup water
4 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
1/2 small head cabbage, sliced into strips

Directions:
Stir together the onion, garlic, mustard, vinegar, bay leaves, peppercorns, salt, parsley, and celery seed in a bowl. Cover, and refrigerate for 24 hours.
Rub the brisket with the mixture, wrap tightly, and refrigerate overnight.
To cook the brisket, place it into a slow cooker along with the water. Cover, and cook on low for 5 hours. Add the carrots, and cabbage, and continue cooking until the brisket is tender, about 3 hours more.
