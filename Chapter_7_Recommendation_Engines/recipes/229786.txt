Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground chicken
1 red bell pepper, cut into large dice
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar, or more to taste
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
5 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)
1 teaspoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil
1/2 cup chunky peanut butter
3 tablespoons hot water
3 tablespoons soy sauce
5 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)
6 large leaves of iceberg lettuce
2 carrots, shredded
1 tablespoon chopped green onion, or to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Cook and stir ground chicken in a large skillet until the meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir red bell pepper into chicken; cook and stir until pepper is slightly softened, about 5 more minutes.
Whisk 1/2 cup soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, ginger, 5 dashes hot pepper sauce, and sesame oil in a bowl; pour over chicken mixture. Cook and stir chicken mixture with sauce over low heat until flavors have blended, 5 to 10 minutes.
Mash peanut butter with hot water in a small bowl until smooth; stir 3 tablespoons soy sauce and 5 dashes hot pepper sauce into the mixture. Set dipping sauce aside.
Form lettuce leaves into cup shapes and fill with chicken mixture. Top lettuce wraps with shredded carrots, sprinkle with green onion and cilantro, and a spoonful of peanut dipping sauce.

Description: 
These are so yummy! They taste really close to the lettuce wraps that you can order from that famous Asian restaurant chain. The number of servings will depend on if this is an appetizer or main course for you and how big you make them. If an appetizer, then maybe 6 servings; if a main dish, then 4 servings.
