Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup chopped blanched almonds
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
Confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg, vanilla, and almonds; mix a few seconds until well incorporated. Stir in the flour until a dough forms.
Roll the dough into a rope 3/4-inch thick. Cut the rope into 3-inch long pieces. Shape the cookies by rolling each piece back and forth while pressing down gently with two fingers on each end until the piece is about 5-inches long. The dough piece should be plump in the center, and thinner on it's ends. Repeat with remaining cookies.
Place the cookies onto a cookie sheet, bending the ends toward each other to form a crescent 'C' shape. Bake in preheated oven until the edges have turned golden brown, about 20 minutes. Dust immediately with powdered sugar, then cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
This is a Polish cookie my aunt used to make as a Thanksgiving holiday treat. Although I'm not Polish, I make them too, and serve them on a cold winter's night with hot coffee or tea.
