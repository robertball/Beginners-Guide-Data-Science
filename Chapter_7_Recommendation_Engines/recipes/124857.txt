Ingredients:
1 pound dry pinto beans
6 large carrots, sliced 1/2 inch thick
1 large chopped onion
6 stalks celery, sliced into 1/2 inch pieces
1 large clove garlic
3 1/2 pounds ham hocks
2 teaspoons paprika
CSIPETKE:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Wash and sort beans.  Soak in cold water overnight; drain.  In a large 8-qt. pot, combine beans, carrots, onions, celery, garlic, meat and paprika.  Add enough water to cover ingredients by 2 in. simmer, partly covered, for 2-1/2 hours or until the beans are tender, adding more water as needed.  When beans are tender; remove meat to side dish.
To make Csipetke, mix all ingredients into stiff dough; let rest for 30 minutes.  Divide into 4 parts.  Flatten each part and pinch off pieces about the size of a cherry pit; roll between fingers and drop into hot soup.  Cook 30 minutes.  Blend in sour cream, if desired.  Mix in parsley and vinegar; adjust seasoning.  Cut reserved ham into bite-size pieces; stir into soup.

Description: 
This soup simmering on your stove will fill the whole house with the most tantalizing aromas. By the time that you ladle it out, your family (or guests) will likely be standing in line! I adapted the recipe from a Hungarian cookbook. When my family's extra-hungry, I serve it with 'pocket bread' I've filled with either jam or cheese for a hearty variation.
