Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
10 ounces white marshmallows
1  1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
5 cups crispy rice cereal
1 cup sliced almonds, toasted (optional)
1/4 cup small dried fruit of your choice (optional)

Directions:
1. Line a 9x13-inch pan with foil sprayed with cooking spray. Set aside.
2. Melt butter and marshmallows together in large pot over medium to low heat stirring occasionally being careful not to burn.  Remove from heat. Stir in cinnamon until evenly distributed.  Stir in cereal, nuts and dried fruit, if using. Combine well.
3. Using a buttered wooden spoon or spatula, scrape mixture into prepared pan. Pat down to make top even with the buttered implement or waxed paper.
4. Let cool before cutting into squares, diamonds or triangles.
Option: these  look nice drizzled with dark or white chocolate to make them classier but it does make them sweeter. They are already pretty sweet.
