Ingredients:
1 (12 oz.) tube Pillsbury Grands Jr. Golden Layers Buttermilk Biscuits
2 T. sweet hot mustard, plus more for serving if desired
9 oz. pkg. fully cooked pork sausage links
4 tsp. finely grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
With fingers, spread each biscuit to an oval about 2 inches wide x 4 inches long.
Brush sweet hot mustard onto the flattened out biscuit.
Place a sausage link across the short edge of the biscuit and roll up lengthwise. (You will use 10 links and have 2 left over)
Cut each biscuit into 4 round slices.
Lay flat on a baking pan.
Sprinkle each "bite" with the finely grated parmesan cheese.
Bake for 18-20 minutes or until biscuits are browned.
Remove from oven and place a toothpick in each one to serve.
Serve with additional sweet hot mustard if you like.

Description: 
This is an easy appetizer to serve at any gathering. I like to put a dot of sweet hot mustard on each bite after they are cooked, but it might be better to just offer the extra mustard for those who want it.
