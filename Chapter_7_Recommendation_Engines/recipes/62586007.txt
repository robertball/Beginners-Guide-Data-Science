Ingredients:
2 large lobster tails, split
1 cup crushed round butter crackers, about 15 crackers
1/2 cup jumbo lump crabmeat
4 tablespoons clarified butter
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves
1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning
1 clove minced garlic
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
In a mixing bowl combine the crushed crackers, crabmeat, butter, the parsley, garlic, Old Bay, lemon zest and juice and toss to combine. Adjust seasonings with salt and white pepper.
Split two lobster tails along the top, lifting the tail meat out and lightly buttering it before laying it on top of the shell.
Cover each the tail with the stuffing and bake the lobster tails until the stuffing is golden brown on top and the lobsters are heated through and thoroughly cooked, about 10 to 12 minutes. (The temperature on an instant-read thermometer inserted into the lobster meat should register 145 degrees F.)
Serve with fresh lemon wedges.
