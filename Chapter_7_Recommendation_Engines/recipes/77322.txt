Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups graham cracker or chocolate wafer crumbs
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 (14 ounce) can EAGLE BRAND® Sweetened Condensed Milk
3 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.  Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar and butter; press equal portions onto bottoms of 24 lightly greased* or paper-lined muffin cups.
In large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy.  Gradually beat in sweetened condensed milk until smooth.  Add eggs and vanilla; mix well.  Spoon equal amounts of mixture (about 3 tablespoons) into prepared cups.
Bake 20 minutes or until cakes spring back when lightly touched. Cool. Chill.  Garnish as desired.  Refrigerate leftovers. *If greased muffin cups are used, cool baked cheesecakes.  Freeze 15 minutes, remove from pans.  Proceed as above.
