Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 eggs
1/4 cup onion flakes
1 tsp. salt
1 TBS. worchestershire sauce
1 TBS. mustard
1 8 oz. tomato sauce less 2 TBS.
2 TBS brown sugar
1 TBS vinegar

Directions:
Mix all but brown sugar, vinegar, and 2 TBS tomato sauce. I just make it into a sort of flat loaf and place in a glass baking dish.  You can mix 2 TBS taomato sauce, brown sugar, vinegar and put as glaze over meat, But I prefer using ketchup. Cook for 15 minutes in the microwave.
