Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) avocados, pitted peeled and mashed
1/4 teaspoon coarse garlic salt

Directions:
Stir together avocado and garlic salt until smooth and evenly combined. To keep guacamole from turning brown, leave one of the avocado pits in until ready to serve.

Description: 
This is certainly one of the easiest guacamole recipes I have ever encountered.  As a guacamole connoisseur, I was highly skeptical.  After learning that one of the more famous Mexican restaurants in northern New Mexico uses a similar recipe, I decided to give it a try.  The taste was amazing!
