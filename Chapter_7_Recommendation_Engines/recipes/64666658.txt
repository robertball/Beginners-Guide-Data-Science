Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
4 Tbsp of sriracha
1 tsp of water
1 lb thick cut bacon

Directions:
Place your silicone mat on your rimmed cookie sheet followed by the metal cooling rack.
Then lay your thick cut bacon in a single layer. Mix ingredients, It should have the consistency of wet sand similar to sand used for making sandcastles. Spread a layer of sauce on the bacon. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 13 minutes. Allow it to set for a few minutes before flipping the bacon over. By waiting a few minutes it allows the coating to set up and not run off the bacon right away. Give the other side of the bacon a sriracha bath and bake for an additional 13 minutes at 400. Allow the coating to set for a few minutes and then transfer to a plate to cool completely. If you let the bacon cool completely on the cooling racks it can be difficult to peel the bacon off the racks with out loosing that precious sriracha candy coating. The the reason you are using a silicone baking mat is once cooled the dripping just peel off the baking mat! No chipping and scrubbing the baked on drippings off the cookie sheet. But if you don’t have the silicone baking sheets do not worry.  Just soak the trays in the hottest water you have until it dissolves off.
