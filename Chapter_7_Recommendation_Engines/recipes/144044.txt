Ingredients:
1 (10 inch) whole wheat tortilla
1 teaspoon orange marmalade
1 teaspoon pure maple syrup

Directions:
Lay the tortilla out on a clean surface or dinner plate. Spread orange marmalade on one half, then spread maple syrup on the other. Roll the tortilla up tightly, starting at the end with the syrup and finishing with marmalade. Use toothpicks to hold it together if needed, or wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for a few hours, then slice into 1 inch pieces to serve.

Description: 
This is a splendid recipe that is extremely tasty!  You don't really cook anything, so it is good for kids to make, but it is better if it can chill for about three and a half hours so the marmalade and syrup can seep into the tortilla so you get a sweeter and gooier product.  This simple recipe is tantalizingly gooey and sweet, so it can be used as a snack, part of a meal, or a dessert!
