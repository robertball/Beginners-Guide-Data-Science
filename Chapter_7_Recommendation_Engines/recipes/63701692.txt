Ingredients:
2 English Cucumbers
8 oz Cream Cheese or Neufch√¢tel
2 Tbs very finely chopped white onion
1/2 tsp dried dill
cayenne pepper to taste
Tabasco (red or green) to taste
green food coloring (optional)

Directions:
Peel your cucumbers and cut them in half down the length of the cucumber to seed them.  Cut them into 2 inch sections and use a food processor on pulse to very finely chop.
Transfer chopped cucumber to a tea towel, and add the onion to the pile.  Twist the towel, squeezing all of the liquid out into a bowl to reserve.
Transfer the dried cucumber and onion back to the food processor, making sure the bowl is relatively dry, and add the cream cheese, dill, Tabasco, and cayenne to the cucumber mixture. You can add a drop of green food coloring here if you would like a subtle green color.
Process the mixture until desired consistency is reached, scraping down the sides.  If it needs thinning, add cucumber water back in, a teaspoon at a time, while processing.
You can serve it immediately, or refrigerate  it to firm up and let the flavors meld.

Description: 
This Louisville staple is an easy and refreshing Cucumber spread or dip, and can be served with almost anything you could imagine.  Dipping club crackers or pita and french bread toast points are favorites, but carrot sticks and pretzels are great too.  We use it for cucumber sandwiches, spread it onto our BLTs, and use it as a sauce on poached salmon.
