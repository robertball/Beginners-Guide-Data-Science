Ingredients:
2 cans Rotel diced tomatoes "Mexican" style with lime juice and cilantro (DO NOT SUBSTITUTE with another brand OR flavor!!!!)
1/2 Large green pepper
1/4 White onion
1 medium size Jalapeno pepper

Directions:
Loosely chop green pepper and onion into large pieces
Remove stem, tip, membrane and seeds from jalapeno, keeping only the flesh
Toss all ingredients into the food processor and pulse on a medium speed until everything looks finely chopped.
Add diced tomatoes (do not drain) and pulse a few more times, until it has the consistency you prefer.
Season with salt-to-taste and pop into the fridge until serving.
Salsa may look 'frothy' at first - it will settle!

Description: 
My husband and I make up a batch of this salsa twice a week. It is so good! Fast, easy, unbelievably fresh tasting, and easy to modify to taste/heat preference by adding more or less green pepper, onion, or jalapeno. This makes enough for a crowd (half it for a family) and is best served cold after a couple of hours in the fridge!
