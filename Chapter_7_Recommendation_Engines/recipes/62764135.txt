Ingredients:
6 tablespoons sour cream
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
Several grinds black pepper
2-3 ounces blue cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Add all together.
I also used this recipe for large Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza, without the Red Sauce. Fabulous.

Description: 
Jo's modified version (Jo Loves Cooking) was excellent, though I did slightly modify as follows (to get less of a mayo-dominant taste). I used this as the sauce on Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza recipe on this site and was the rave-pizza of the several I made.  Anyway, I doubled all ingredients in her recipe EXCEPT for the mayo, then added 1/2 cup buttermilk.  Next time will add a little more bleu cheese than what you called for, though in any case, no bleu cheese from any store can compete with this. Nice job!Modified from: Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing
