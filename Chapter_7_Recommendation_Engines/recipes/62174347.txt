Ingredients:
•1 Head Romaine Lettuce - washed and chopped
•3 Green onions - chopped
•1 1/2 cups Pineapple chunks - canned (reserve juice)
•1 1/2 cups Peaches - chopped - canned
•1/3 cup Chopped and pitted Kalamata Olives
•1/3 cup Walnuts - chopped
•Cider vinegar and olive oil salad dressing - I suggest my recipe or use your favorite lite brand. You don't want something that will over power the flavors in this salad!

Directions:
Toss all ingredients together except pineapple juice and dressing.
When salad is plated, add the desired amount of salad dressing.
Then drizzle each serving with about 2 Tbls. of the reserved pineapple juice.

Description: 
I came up with this salad recipe when I was craving something sweet and sour, but also healthy! I highly recommend using my 'Lite Italian Dressing' on this because it won't over power the other flavors in this salad!
