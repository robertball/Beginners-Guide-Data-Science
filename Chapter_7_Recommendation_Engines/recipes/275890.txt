Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) pumpkin, peeled and cubed
2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste
1 red chile pepper, seeded and minced

1 1/2 (14 ounce) cans low-fat coconut milk
6 sprigs fresh basil

Directions:
Combine pumpkin, curry paste, and chile pepper in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook until pumpkin begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add enough water to cover completely. Bring to a boil and cook until soft, about 30 minutes.
Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Pour in coconut milk and serve with fresh basil leaves.

Description: 
A good way to change up pumpkin soup! Great for those who like a good bit of spice but can be adjusted to taste. Even my boyfriend who does not like pumpkin enjoyed this one! Depending on the level of heat you want, you can increase or decrease the amount of heat in the dish.
