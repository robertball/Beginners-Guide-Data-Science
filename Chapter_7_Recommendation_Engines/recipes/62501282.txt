Ingredients:
8  chicken tenders, flattened and cut in two
3-ounce package softened cream cheese
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and finely chopped
8 slices bacon, cut in half

Directions:
First: Dab 1/2 teaspoon (more or less) of cream cheese on top of each chicken tender.  Sprinkle a scant 1/4 teaspoon of peppers over cream cheese.  Fold or roll chicken to enclose cream cheese mixture.  Wrap each roll with one piece of bacon and secure with a toothpick.
Second: Grill until bacon is brown and crispy on both sides.

Description: 
Whether you’re planning a cookout this weekend or cooking indoors (rain predicted here in Texas), grill up a few of these sizzling treats for a quick appetizer or serve as an entree.  I can’t think of a better way to celebrate the Fourth of July than with a big plate of  these spicy and cheesy, smoky and crispy chicken nuggets.
