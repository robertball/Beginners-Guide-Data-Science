Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegan margarine (such as Earth BalanceÂ®)
1/2 yellow squash, thinly sliced
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 yellow onion, diced
1/2 cup diced jalapeno peppers
1 (12 ounce) package cubed tofu
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon garlic powder
5 flour tortillas
2 tablespoons vegan sour cream

Directions:
Melt margarine in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add squash, bell pepper, onion, and jalapeno. Simmer to your desired level of doneness, 5 to 10 minutes. Add cubed tofu. Cook and stir until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add soy sauce and garlic powder; cook about 5 minutes more.
Wrap tortillas in a moist paper towel and heat in the microwave on high until soft, about 30 seconds.
Spread a thin layer of vegan sour cream on each tortilla. Add tofu and vegetable mixture and roll up, burrito-style.
