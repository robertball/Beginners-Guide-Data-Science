Heat in microwave both water and milk about 35 seconds each.
Add milk & luke warm water, orange extract, and mix on medium speed for about 1 min. just enough for batter to come together
Finally add nuts and incorporate with a spatula.
Spray a 1.5 Qt. loaf pan using cooking spray, cut a sheet of parchment paper to line a loaf pan, leaving enough of the edges showing so that you can lift the cake from the pan easily.
Pour batter into the pan and bake at 350 for about 45-50 minutes or until a tooth pick inserted comes out clean.
Let cool completely. Slice and serve.

Description: 
This cake is simple to make and can also be made into muffins. Not too sweet, and the recipe is also versatile. By simply adding 1/2 tsp. fresh grated ginger and even fresh or dried cranberries instead of the dates, or even apples & cinnamion. Either way this recipe works perfectly.
