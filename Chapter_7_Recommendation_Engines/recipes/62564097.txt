Ingredients:
3/4  c  Unblanched ground almonds
1/2  c  Butter
1/2  c  Sugar
1  tb  (rounded) flour
1  tb  Heavy cream
1  tb  Milk

Directions:
1.  These cookies require precision timing and fast action but the results are worth the trouble. I make them for holidays and special occasions, but they are delicious anytime.
2.  Preheat oven to 350. Butter and flour baking sheet.
3.  In a small, heavy pan, place all ingredients. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly until butter melts. Drop by teaspoonful: onto baking sheet (do not bake more than six at one time).
4.  Bake at 350 for 7-9 minutes. Cookies should be only slightly brown and still bubbling at the center. Let cool only for a minute or so until the edge is firm enough to lift with a thin spatula Then, working quickly, lift cookies and turn them top side down onto paper towels. Roll over the handle of a wooden spoon to get a cylinder shape and let cool until crisp.
5.  Use a fresh cookie sheet for each baking to avoid cookies sticking on sheet. If cookies get too firm to roll over the spoon handle, place back in the oven for a few moments.
6.  Store cookies in an airtight cookie jar or tin. They will keep for a long time, and can be made well ahead of the holiday season.
7.  Variations: These cookies also can be left flat-make them smaller if you do that; however, they don't have the flair of the rolled lacy effect. Or roll ends of cooled cookies in melted chocolate
