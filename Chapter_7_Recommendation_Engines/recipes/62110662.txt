1/2 tsp. thyme
1/2 tsp. paprika
1/8 tsp. pepper
1/8 tsp. ground ginger
1/8 tsp. allspice
1- 1/2 lb. beef round steak, cut in 1/2" cubes
1/3 c. olive oil
2 c. chopped sweet onion
1 c. beef broth

1 c. diced potatoes
1 c. sliced carrots (optional, you can use 1/2c more potato)
PIE PASTRY:
2 3/4 c. flour
1 tsp. coarse salt
1 c. lard. (*for a different flavour, you can substitute Butter Flavour Crisco with 1 tbsp of sugar for the lard)

Directions:
In a bowl, mix flour and spices. Dredge steak in flour and seasoning mixture. Brown meat and onions in heated oil. Add broth and red wine simmering until tender (about 20 mins). Add potatoes and carrots, cooking until tender (about 20 mins). Cool slightly.
Line 10" pie pan with pastry. Add meat mixture,(sprinkle with another 1/2 tsp of thyme if desired) and cover with top crust. Bake 400 degrees for 30 minutes.
For crust:
Add salt to flour in a large bowl. Cut lard into flour mixture until it resembles coarse bread crumbs. Add 1/2 cup ice water. Mix well. Roll out.
