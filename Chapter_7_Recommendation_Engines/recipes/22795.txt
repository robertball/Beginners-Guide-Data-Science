Ingredients:
24 large clams in shell, scrubbed
1 green bell pepper
1 red bell pepper
1 small red onion
1/4 cup Italian-style dry bread crumbs
2 cloves garlic, peeled
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed
1 tablespoon butter
4 slices bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces

Directions:
Shuck clams from shell. Clean shells thoroughly. Place each clam onto a clean 1/2 shell; set aside.
Preheat broiler for medium heat.
In a food processor or blender, combine green and red pepper, red onion, bread crumbs, garlic, sea salt, pepper, oregano and butter. Blend until mixture becomes a mush, but not watery.
Spoon 1 teaspoon of mixture onto the top of each clam, and add one 1 inch piece of bacon on top.
Place the clams on a broiler pan and place under broiler about 4 inches from the heat. Broil for 8 to 12 minutes or until desired crispness of bacon is achieved.
