Description: 
Smokey Bacon, Creamy Cheese, and a Bit of Heat, This recipe is a result of a good harvest! We had a lot of Yellow Wax Peppers come off our plants this year. One of our favorite recipes is Bacon Wrapped Pepper Poppers but it takes a long time to stuff the peppers, wrap them in bacon and then wait for them to bake, so I decided to try the same ingredients in a dip form and this is the result! Definitely a new family favorite!
