Description: 
This lemony salad is served hot from the wok. Escarole is a bitter green, but can be less so when grown shielded from the sun.  In general, lighter green leaves indicate a milder flavor. Thinly sliced tomatoes are a great accompaniment. This recipe can be doubled.  For a larger party, cook in batches.
