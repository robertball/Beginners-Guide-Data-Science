Ingredients:
7 ounces fresh tofu, sliced
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon honey
1 cup basmati rice
1 ½ cups water

Directions:
Combine the soy sauce and ginger in a small bowl.  Add tofu slices; cover and refrigerate overnight.
Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Keep hot.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove tofu from marinade, place on a baking sheet. Reserve marinade.
Toast the sesame seeds by placing them in a dry skillet over medium heat. Stir seeds constantly until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Immediately remove toasted seeds from pan to prevent burning. Reserve.
Bake the tofu in the preheated oven until hot and cooked to your liking, approximately 8 minutes.  Drizzle tofu with remaining marinade.
Divide rice between 2 bowls, top with baked tofu, drizzle with honey, and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.
