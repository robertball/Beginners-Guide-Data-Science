Ingredients:
2 cups red wine
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer
3 fluid ounces Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup steak sauce
4 (1/2 pound) beef steaks

Directions:
In a glass bowl or baking dish, mix together the red wine, beer, Worcestershire sauce and steak sauce. Place steaks into the marinade, cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours to allow the alcohol to get the meat good and soft.
Preheat your oven's broiler.
Place steaks on a rack over a broiling pan. Arrange the shelf so that the steaks are about 5 inches away from the heat source. Broil for 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness.
Pour the marinade into a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for about 15 minutes. Repeatedly strain the mixture to remove the proteins (foamy substance). Not doing this will make it taste bad. Once the marinade has been cooked down to remove all of the meat proteins and alcohol, use as a sauce.

Description: 
This steak marinade is just awesome! Serve with a good, quality dark beer. The cut of the meat doesn't really matter too much in my opinion, though I do prefer New York Strips personally. I also like to saute some fresh mushrooms and onion in a bit of olive oil, and add them to the sauce.
