Ingredients:
2 cups cake flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup canola oil
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 lemon, zested
1 cup grated zucchini
Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl and set aside.
Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add sugar and oil until well blended. Add buttermilk, lemon juice, and lemon zest and blend together. Fold in zucchini until it is mixed well. Add flour mixture and blend together until well combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
While loaf is still warm, combine powdered sugar, lemon juice, and milk in a bowl for glaze and spoon over bread. Let glaze set up before cutting and serving.
