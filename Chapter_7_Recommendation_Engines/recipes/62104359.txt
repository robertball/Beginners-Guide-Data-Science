Ingredients:
8 pcs chicken (I use thighs, skin & bones attached)
10-15 snack crackers, crushed
1/4-1/3c cornmeal
salt & pepper, to taste
1 tsp sage/poultry seasoning
1 tsp tarragon (optional)
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 egg, beaten with a little water (1-2 tsp)
1/4-1/3c shortening
1/4-1/3c butter/margarine
*enough oils to get a depth of 1/2" in dish

Directions:
Turn oven to 375F.
Put shortening & margarine into 9x13" (or larger) casserole dish, place in oven to melt together; keep warm while dredging chicken (see below)
Meanwhile, put crackers into large plastic zip-seal bag & crush to coarse meal.
Add cornmeal & seasonings, shake well to mix.
In shallow dish, beat egg with water.
Dip chicken into egg & water; place 2 or 3 pieces into bag with cracker crumbs, shake well to coat.
Put coated chicken, SKIN SIDE DOWN, into casserole dish.
Bake in oven for 30 minutes, turn chicken over and bake another 15 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.
**VARIATION** My Mom always used cornflakes in place of the crackers - if you choose to try this variation, omit the salt in the recipe.

Description: 
This is a very easy way to have great fried chicken, without standing over a frying pan. My family loves this - and it's simply a matter of changing the seasonings to get an entirely new flavour.
