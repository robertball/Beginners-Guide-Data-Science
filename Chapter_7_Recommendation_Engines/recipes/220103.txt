Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 1/4 cups water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1/2 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-OÂ®
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (12 ounce) jar strawberry preserves
1 (12 ounce) container cream cheese frosting
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lightly grease and flour a 9x9-inch square pan and a 9-inch round pan.
Stir together the cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a bowl until smooth.
Mix in the strawberry gelatin until combined.
Divide the batter evenly between the 2 prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
Transfer the square cake onto a large platter.
Cut the round cake in half, then arrange the cut side of the cake along two edges of the square cake to create a heart shape.
Poke several holes on the top of the cake using the handle of a wooden spoon or spatula.
Pour the sweetened condensed milk over the cake so that it runs into the holes; allow the milk to soak in.
Spread the strawberry preserves on top of the cake.
Fold the cream cheese frosting into the whipped topping in a bowl until just incorporated.
Spread the frosting over the top and sides of the cake.
