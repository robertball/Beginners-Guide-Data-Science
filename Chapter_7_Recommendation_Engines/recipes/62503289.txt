Ingredients:
Cake:
2 cups flour
2 cups sugar
1/4 t salt
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 eggs
1 t vanilla
1 t baking soda
2 sticks butter
4 heaping T cocoa powder
Icing:
1 3/4 sticks butter
4 heaping T cocoa powder
6 T milk
1 t vanilla
4 cups powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. In a large bowl combine flour, sugar and salt, set aside. In another bowl mix together buttermilk, eggs, vanilla and baking soda, set aside.
In a medium sauce pan melt the butter and add the cocoa.  While mixing these together, bring 1 cup of water to a boil. Now add the water to the butter/cocoa mixture and turn off the heat. Pour the chocolate mixture into the flour mixture.  Stir together and then add the egg mixture.  Stir until smooth.  Pour into a rimmed cookie sheet, a 10x15 inch pan and bake for 20 minutes.
While the cake is cooking, make the icing.  Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add the cocoa and stir until smooth.  Add the milk and the vanilla. Next add the powdered sugar and stir together.  As soon as the cake comes out of the oven, pour the warm icing on top.  Try to pour the icing to cover the cake evenly to avoid spreading. Serve warm.
