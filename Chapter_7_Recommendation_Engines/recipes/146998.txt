Ingredients:
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground chile pepper
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup water
3/4 cup skim milk
2 tablespoons fat-free plain yogurt
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 head cauliflower, broken into florets
2 lemons, juiced

Directions:
Mix flour, coriander, cumin, chile pepper, mustard powder, turmeric, and salt together in a bowl. Mix in water until a paste forms. Stir in skim milk and yogurt.
Heat oil in a nonstick pot over medium heat. Add cumin seeds; heat until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spice paste; heat for 1 minute. Add cauliflower to the pot and toss with spice paste until completely coated. Cover and cook cauliflower over medium-low heat, stirring several times to coat and prevent burning, until tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
Stir lemon juice into the cauliflower just before serving.
