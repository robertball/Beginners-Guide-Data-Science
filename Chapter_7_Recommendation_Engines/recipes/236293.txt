Ingredients:
1 soursop fruit, peeled and cut into chunks
1 1/2 cups milk, or to taste
2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Working in batches, press soursop pieces through a fine-mesh strainer with the back of a spoon into a bowl to remove the juice from the fruit.
Whisk milk, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg into soursop juice until sugar is dissolved completely. Pour punch into a pitcher and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
