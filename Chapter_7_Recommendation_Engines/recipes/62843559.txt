Ingredients:
2 eggs, beaten
1 1/3 cup sugar
2 tsp maple syrup
3 cups grated fresh zucchini
2/3 cup melted salted butter
2 tsp baking soda
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 tsp cinnamon
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup (slightly chopped) dried cranberries
METHOD
1 Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large bowl, mix together the sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Mix in the grated zucchini and then the melted butter. Sprinkle baking soda and salt over the mixture and mix in. Add the flour, a third at a time. Sprinkle in the cinnamon and nutmeg and mix. Fold in the nuts and dried cranberries or raisins if using.
2 Divide the batter equally between 2 buttered 5 by 9 inch loaf pans. Bake for 1 hour (check for doneness at 50 minutes) or until a wooden pick inserted in to the center comes out clean. Cool in pans for 10 minutes. Turn out onto wire racks to cool thoroughly.
Makes 2 loaves.
