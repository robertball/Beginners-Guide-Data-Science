Ingredients:
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
3/4 c orange juice
1/2 c plain yogurt or sour cream
2/3 c chicken stock
1T EVOO for marinade
1/4 c apricot preserves
2 clove garlic, minced
1 T minced fresh ginger
dash powdered cloves
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, 4 bone-in breasts, 6 bone-in chicken thighs, or a single chicken cut up.
(optional) 1T EVOO or Canola Oil for stove top.
(optional) Canola oil for grill.

Directions:
In a bowl blend the balsamic vinegar, orange juice, yogurt, chicken stock, 1T EVOO, apricot preserves, ginger, garlic and cloves. Place chicken and marinade in a large Ziploc-type bag and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours, preferably overnight. Turn several times to insure all chicken is well covered with marinade.
Grill: Preheat grill. Add chicken and marinade to baking dish, take to grill area. Place chicken on oiled, heated grill. Cook turning sides until juices run clear--depending on bone-in or boneless chicken.
Oven: Preheat to 350F. Place chicken and marinade in baking dish, bake ~1.5 hours or when juices run clear, depending upon chicken type and size used. Rest chicken, reduce sauce stovetop. Serve over rice or pasta.
Stovetop: Brown chicken in ~ 1T canola or olive oil. Set chicken aside. Reduce marinade until desired thickness. Serve over rice or pasta.
