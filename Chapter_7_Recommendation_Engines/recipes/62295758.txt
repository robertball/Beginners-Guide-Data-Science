Cut avocado into large chunks.
Mash avocado and peas together using a potato masher or fork, or, if a very creamy texture is desired, in a food processor.

Description: 
If you long for your favorite south-of-the-border dip but don't want the fat of avocado, try this reduced-fat version of guacamole. You can use either green peas or green beans for part of the avocado. Green peas will give this dip a slightly sweet flavor that we found especially appealing.  The peas in this guacamole help to lower the fat content and they also add cancer-fighting fiber.  Original recipe from pcrm.org (Recipe from The Survivorâ€™s Handbook, The Cancer Project).
