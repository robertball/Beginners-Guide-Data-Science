Ingredients:
1/2 lb Frozen or par-boiled snap peas
1/2 lb Frozen or par-boiled baby carrots
1/2 lb Raw Cashews
1/2 lb Frozen mustard greens
1 chopped shallot
1 chopped red pepper
1 cup brown rice
Sesame oil
Water
To taste:
Rice vinegar
Chili Oil
Salt
Tamari or soy sauce
Sesame seeds

Directions:
Pour the rice and 2 cups water into a pot.  Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer.  The rice is cooked when all the water is absorbed.  This should take 35-45 minutes.
If you are using fresh peas and carrots, par-boil them at this time.
When the rice is done, pour it into a frying pan with enough sesame oil to coat it but not so much that there is excess.  Also add tamari and salt or soy sauce to taste.
Fry the rice on medium heat for about 20 minutes, stirring every two to three minutes.  Add sesame oil as needed.
Meanwhile, place the peas, carrots, cashews, greens, shallot, and pepper in another frying pan.  Pour in enough sesame oil to coat the pan but leave little excess.
Stir-fry on high heat for twenty minutes, adding all seasonings to taste.  Do not add enough chili oil to make the vegetables very spicy.  Add sesame oil as needed.
Serve the vegetables over the rice.
