Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 red bell pepper, sliced into 1/2-inch strips
1 green onion, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 bunch collard greens, chopped
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add bell pepper and green onion; cook until onion is soft and whites are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garbanzo beans and garlic; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Add collard greens; cook until greens wilt and turn bright green, 2 to 4 minutes.
Transfer to a large serving bowl. Splash vinegar over greens and sprinkle with sea salt. Serve immediately.

Description: 
These sauteed collard greens are a healthy alternative to traditional greens recipes. Everyone in my family likes their greens a little different--some add Tabasco sauce, for example.
