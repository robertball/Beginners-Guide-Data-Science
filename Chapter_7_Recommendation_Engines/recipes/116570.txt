Ingredients:
1 Pastry for double-crust pie (9 inches)
2 eggs
1 cup sour cream
3/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon salt

Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom of pastry; trim even with edge of plate. In a mixing bowl, beat eggs on medium speed for 1 minute. Add sour cream, sugar, vinegar, cinnamon, cloves and salt; mix well. Stir in raisins. Pour into pastry shell. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie. Place over filling; trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in pastry.
Cover edges loosely with foil. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F and remove foil. Bake 40-45 minutes longer or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
For my family, this pie is as essential for Thanksgiving dinner as turkey, dressing and mashed potatoes! I've been told this recipe's been in the family since the 1860's.
