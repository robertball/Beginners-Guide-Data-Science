Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs lean ground beef
1 med onion, chopped
1-15oz can lima beans, undrained
1-15oz can corn, undrained
1-15oz can green beans, undrained

3-4 carrots, sliced
2-15oz cans stewed tomatoes, undrained
1-28oz can crushed tomatoes
1-16oz bag frozen peas

Directions:
Brown the ground beef and onions in a large pot. Drain if necessary. Add all veggies except the tomatoes and peas. Bring meat and veggies to a boil and then let simmer in veggie juices until potatoes and carrots are tender, about 20-30 minutes. Add tomatoes and salt and pepper. Add enough water to bring juices to the consistancy of a soup. Bring to a boil and add peas. Simmer for 15-20 minutes. Serve and enjoy. Makes approximately 20-1 cup servings.

Description: 
Simple, simple, simple and simply good. I got this recipe from a friend many years ago when I stopped by and she had a pot simmering on the stove. After the second, or was it the third bowl, I begged her for the recipe and have been making it ever since. Rarely do I have any left-overs. And it makes a lot so you can feed a large family rather economically.
