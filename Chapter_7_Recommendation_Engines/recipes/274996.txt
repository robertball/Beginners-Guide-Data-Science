Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
3 cloves crushed garlic
2 large zucchini, sliced crosswise into rounds
1 pound ground Italian sausage (such as JohnsonvilleÂ®)
1/2 (14 ounce) jar pizza sauce
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine melted butter and garlic in a small bowl. Brush zucchini rounds with garlic butter and place on the prepared baking sheet. Reserve extra garlic butter.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Turn, brush with additional garlic butter, and bake another 10 minutes. Remove from the oven.
Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Top each zucchini round with a small spoonful of pizza sauce, a generous helping of cooked sausage, and a hearty sprinkle of mozzarella cheese. Bake until cheese is melted and toppings are warm, about 5 minutes.
