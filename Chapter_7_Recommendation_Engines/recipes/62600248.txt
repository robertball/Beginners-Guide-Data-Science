Ingredients:
6 large red or yellow onions, peeled and thinly sliced.
Olive oil
1/4 teaspoon sugar
2 cloves garlic, minced
8 cups beef stock
1/2 cup dry white wine (or dry vermouth)
1 bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon dry thyme
Salt and pepper
8 slices of toasted French bread (baguette sliced)
1 1/2 cups of grated Gruyere
a little grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a large saucepan, sauté the onions in the olive oil on medium high heat until well browned, but not burned, about 30-40 minutes (or longer).
Add the sugar about 10 minutes into the process to help with the carmelization.
Add garlic and sauté for 1 minute.
Add the stock, wine, bay leaf, and thyme. Cover partially and simmer until the flavors are well blended, about 30 minutes.
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Discard the bay leaf.
To serve:
Ladle the soup into large casserole dish. Cover with the toast and sprinkle with cheese. Put into the broiler for 10 minutes at 350 degrees F, or until the cheese bubbles and is slightly browned.
Serve immediately in warm bowls.
