Ingredients:
1 cup pecan halves
1/2 cup hulled (green) pumpkin seeds
12 cups freshly popped popcorn (microwave, air-popped or stovetop)
1 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup Gay Lea Spreadables Butter, Cinnamon & Brown Sugar
1 tablespoon Sriracha hot sauce, or to taste
1 teaspoon coarse sea salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spread pecan halves and pumpkin seeds on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast for 6 to 8 minutes or until fragrant; cool slightly.
Meanwhile, melt Spreadables butter with hot sauce.
Combine warm popcorn with pecan halves, pumpkin seeds, and cranberries in a large bowl. Drizzle with butter mixture and toss to coat. Sprinkle with salt and re-toss to distribute salt evenly. Serve immediately.
