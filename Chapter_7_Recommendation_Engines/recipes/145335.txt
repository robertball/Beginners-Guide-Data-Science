Whipped cream (optional)

Directions:
Stir together fruit syrup and peanut butter until smooth. Add softened cream cheese. Stir until blended. Spread mixture evenly on 8 slices of bread. Place banana slices on top of 4 slices of bread. Top with peanut butter covered bread slices to make 4 sandwiches.
Whisk together eggs and milk in a shallow bowl.
Melt butter in skillet or on griddle over medium heat.
Dip both sides of each "sandwich" in egg mixture, letting it soak in slightly. Cook in hot skillet or on griddle, 2 minutes or until golden brown. Turn, cooking another 2 minutes or until golden.
Serve immediately topped with additional strawberry syrup and whipped cream, if desired.
