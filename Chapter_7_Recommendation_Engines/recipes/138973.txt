Ingredients:
3 pounds baby red potatoes, cut in half
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup minced garlic
1 tablespoon seafood seasoning
8 ounces bacon
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup minced garlic
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup olive oil
1 large red onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 bunch parsley, minced
5 hard boiled eggs, roughly chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Toss halved potatoes with 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup garlic, and seafood seasoning. Place in a single layer onto baking sheets and bake in preheated oven until tender and golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes. Once cooked, remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.
Meanwhile,  place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium heat until evenly browned and crispy. Pour off bacon grease and reserve. Allow the bacon slices to cool, then crumble and set aside.
Whisk together balsamic vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Pour in the oil in a slow, steady stream while whisking vigorously to make a vinaigrette. Toss the roasted potatoes together with the vinaigrette and reserved bacon grease. Fold in red onion, parsley, and eggs. Allow to stand at room temperature 20 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I do not like traditional potato salad made with mayo or mustard, so I decided to make my own unique recipe. When I brought this to my husbands company potluck all of his friends were impressed and it was gone before I knew it.
