Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
1 onion, sliced
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
5 (10.5 ounce) cans beef consomme
6 bay leaves
1/2 cup white wine (optional)
1 French baguette, cut into 1/2 inch slices
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Place the onion in the butter and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until tender. Stir in the thyme and remove from heat.
In a large pot over high heat, combine the consomme, bay leaves and white wine, if desired. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, stir in the sauteed onions and allow to heat through, about 10 to 15 minutes.
Ladle soup into 4 individual oven-safe bowls, filling each about 3/4 of the way. Top each bowl with 2 slices of baguette bread and then cover each with the cheese.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 10 to 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
