Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 pound processed cheese food, cubed
pickled jalapeno pepper slices, to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place lean ground beef and onion in a large, deep skillet over medium high heat. Cook until beef is evenly brown and onion is soft. Drain and turn heat to medium low.
Pour in condensed cream of mushroom soup. Mix in processed cheese food and desired amount of jalapeno peppers. Cook and stir until all ingredients are well blended, about 10 minutes.
Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl. Cover and chill in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight.
Reheat the mixture in a slow cooker, mixing in about 1 tablespoon of water to thin if necessary, before serving.

Description: 
This dip recipe was given to me by a co-worker some 15 or more years ago. She made it for potlucks at work, and it was always gone from the nurse's station before the rest of the food was put out! It's a simple mixture of beef and cheese, but it should always be made a day in advance to allow the flavors to blend. Serve with your favorite corn chips.
