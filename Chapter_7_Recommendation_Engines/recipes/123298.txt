Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees F)
1/3 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup quick-cooking oats
1/3 cup wheat germ
1 tablespoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornmeal

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water.  Add whole whet flour, oats, wheat germ, sugar, salt and 1-1/4 cups of all-purpose flour; beat until smooth.  Add enough remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft dough.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Punch dough down (no not knead).  Shape into a loaf.  Coat a 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and sprinkle with half of the cornmeal.   Place loaf in pan; sprinkle with remaining cornmeal.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.  Bake at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
Carol Forcum suggests this nutty-tasting loaf. 'There's no need to knead the dough, which bakes into a hearty bread with the texture of English muffins,' says the Marion, Illinois reader.
