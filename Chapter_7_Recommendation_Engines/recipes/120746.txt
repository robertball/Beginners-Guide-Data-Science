Ingredients:
1 1/8 cups water (70 to 80 degrees F)
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 cup quick-cooking oats
3 cups bread flour
2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
3/4 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup chopped pecans
TOPPING:
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first seven ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed). Just before the final kneading (your machine may audibly signal this), add the cranberries and pecans.
When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface; cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Divide into eight balls. Push thumb through the center of each ball to form a 1-in. hole. Place on a lightly floured surface. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes.
In a large saucepan, bring 2-qt. water to a boil. Drop bagels, one at a time, into boiling water. Cook for 45 seconds; turn and cook 45 seconds longer. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain well on paper towels.
Combine brown sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over bagels. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
