Ingredients:
1 small onion
1 apple
3 cloves garlic
1/2 tsp groundallspice
1 tsp ground marjoram
1 tsp celery seed
1 tbs tomato paste
1 tbs ground sage
1 tsp anise seed
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 lb ground chicken thighs

Directions:
Add all ingredients except the chicken to a pan and cook on medium for 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool.  Add ground chicken to the mixture.  Shape into patties, about 4 tbs of the mixture (I use a large mellon baller) and fry in batches in a nonstick skillet until brown and no pink remains (165 degrees on an instant read thermometer).  Wipe skillet between uses as the tomato paste residue will burn.
