Ingredients:
2 pieces Naan bread
8 slices mozzarella cheese
1 large Roma tomato thinly sliced
1 clove garlic finely chopped (2 if you like it garlicky)
6-8 fresh basil leaves roughly chopped
1 strip prosciutto sliced
1 green onion sliced
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Meanwhile place Naan bread in a foil lined baking tray and brush top of bread with olive oil.
Start by placing garlic and onion on the bread and make sure it is spread out all over the bread. Follow with mozzarella cheese(about 4 slices per pizza) then tomatoes. Add a little of salt and pepper over tomatoes.
Add basil and prosciutto last, then sprinkle 1 tablespoon of Parmesan cheese on each pizza.
Bake for about 10 minutes or until pizza crust is crispy on the edges and cheese is melted. I like to put the oven on broil for the last 2 minutes for extra crispiness.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite friday night dishes. This Pizza is quick, simple and delicious.Instead of making the pizza dough from scratch I decided to use Naan bread for the pizza base. Using Naan bread not only saves time but it is great for portion control.
