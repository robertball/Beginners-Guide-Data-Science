Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough
1 pound ground beef
1 (15 ounce) can sloppy joe sauce
1 small onion, chopped (optional)
1 small green bell pepper, seeded and chopped (optional)
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut the biscuit dough into quarters and press to cover the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Place the ground beef into a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink. Add the onion and bell pepper about halfway through, cooking and stirring until tender. Drain off excess grease and stir in the sloppy Joe sauce. Season with garlic salt and pepper.  Pour the mixture over the biscuits and spread to cover evenly.
Bake in the preheated oven until the biscuits are cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle the cheese on top. Return to the oven until the cheese has melted, about 10 more minutes.
