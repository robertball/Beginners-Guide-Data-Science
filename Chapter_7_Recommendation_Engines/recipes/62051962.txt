Ingredients:
1-15oz can tomato sauce
1-28 oz can crushed tomatoes
4 lb lean ground chuck or sirloin
6 oz natural maple syrup
1 large onion, coarsely chopped
2 fresh jalopena peppers, coarsely sliced (seeds removed)
1 fresh red bell pepper, coarsely chopped
2 cloves minced garlic
1 TBS freshly ground course black pepper
2 TBS chili powder
1 40 oz can kidney beans, drained
1 or 2 - 12 oz bottles chilled Heineken Beer
2 TBS olive oil
Salt to taste

Directions:
In a large stock pot, over medium heat, combine tomato products, jalopena peppers, maple syrup, black pepper and chili powder.  Stir frequently.
In a large skillet, heat olive oil over low/medium eat.  Add bell peppers, onions and garlic.  Cook until onions are translucent.  Transfer to stock pot.
In the same skillet, cook ground meat just until pink is gone.  Drain excess fat and transfer to stock pot.  Bring entire contents to a boil.  Add one bottle of chilled beer and bring back to boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 1 hour while stirring frequently.
Add salt, one tsp at a time until you like what you have.  Use chilled beer to "shock" flavors and thin chili for desired consistency.

Description: 
Not for the faint of heart.  This hearty chili strives to excite all the taste buds.  Each bite is, at first sweet and then blossoms into a slow burn that begs for the next bite. Use coarsly sliced jalopena, so that the less adventuresome can easily identify and scoop them out. Serve with fresh grated sharp process white cheddar and warm garlic bread.  Serve left-overs on hot dogs - yes, beans and all.
