Ingredients:
6 large baking potatoes
3 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups shredded pepperjack cheese
2 (11 ounce) cans Mexican-style corn, drained
2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chile peppers, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pierce each potato several times and rub generously with oil.  Bake until softened, about 45 to 55 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine sour cream, cheese, corn and chiles.
When the potatoes are cooked, cut a slit in the top of each one and squeeze or scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/2 inch thick shell.  Combine the potato flesh with the cheese mixture; mix well.  Spoon the potato mixture back into the shells, and place them on a baking sheet.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and golden brown.
