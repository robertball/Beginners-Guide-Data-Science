Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds salmon fillets
1 1/2 teaspoons rubbed dried sage leaves
Salt and ground black pepper
2 tablespoons Filippo Berio Olive Oil or Filippo Berio Extra Light Olive Oil plus some for the baking dish
1 cup dry white wine

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 13 x 9-inch baking dish with oil.
Season the fillets evenly with the sage. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in the baking dish. Drizzle with oil. Pour the wine into the dish, being careful not to pour it directly on the fish. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the salmon is opaque in the center.
Remove the fillets to a platter. Pour the pan juices into a saucepan. Boil for about 5 minutes or until reduced by at least half. Season with 1/8 teaspoon salt. Pour over the fillets.
