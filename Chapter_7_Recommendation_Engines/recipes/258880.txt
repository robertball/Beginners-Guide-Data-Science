Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons hot sauce (such as Frank's <sup>&reg;</sup>edHot (<sup>&reg;</sup>))

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Combine Brussels sprouts, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl; mix until evenly coated. Spread sprouts onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are starting to wilt, about 20 minutes. Transfer sprouts to a bowl.
Heat butter and hot sauce in a saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour mixture over sprouts and stir until coated.

Description: 
Highly addictive side dish. The trick to an excellent batch is getting the right level of crispy without burning the sprouts, which requires some attention since Brussels sprouts differ so greatly in size.
