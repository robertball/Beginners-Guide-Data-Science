Description: 
I got this delicious recipe from a friend at work when looking for something fun and easy for my young girls to make without much supervision in preparing it. They were begging me to allow them to bake a cake all by themselves! Just dump all ingredients into a bowl, mix and bake. Makes a great moist cake and almost impossible for young cooks to mess up. Plus it has a delicious, rich cream cheese icing.
