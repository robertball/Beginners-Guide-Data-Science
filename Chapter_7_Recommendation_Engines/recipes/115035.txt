Ingredients:
1 cup steak sauce, such as Dale'sÂ®
1 cup whiskey
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound bacon strips, cut in half
6 duck breasts, deboned and cut into cubes
1 box wooden toothpicks

Directions:
To make the marinade, stir the steak sauce and whiskey together in a bowl. Pour the marinade into a resealable plastic bag and add the duck cubes. Seal the bag, turn once or twice to thoroughly coat the duck, and place in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Preheat a grill for medium heat. Soak the toothpicks in a bowl of water at least 1/2 hour to prevent burning.
Remove the duck from the marinade, and discard the sauce. Wrap a piece of bacon around each duck cube and secure with a toothpick.
Cook the duck bites on the preheated grill until bacon is crisp and duck is no longer pink, turning once, 5 to 10 minutes. Place on a serving plate, cool slightly, and serve.

Description: 
This is a great way to quickly cook duck or goose breasts. My husband is a duck hunter, but he doesn't really care for traditional duck recipes so he came up with this and everyone raves! It works well for duck or goose. If you can find Dale's Seasoning, a seasoning sauce with 11 spices, that's our favorite for the marinade. The recipe is easily adapted as hunters' success rates tend to vary.
