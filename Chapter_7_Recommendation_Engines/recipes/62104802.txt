Ingredients:
6 hard boiled eggs
4 TB sour cream
2 tsp. prepared mustard
1/2 tsp. salt
1 can (10-3/4 oz.) condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup cheddar cheese, shredded
1/2 cup onions, chopped
2 TB butter or margarine
1/2 tsp. paprika

Directions:
Slice hard-boiled eggs in half lengthwise.  Remove yolks and set whites aside.
In a bowl, mash the yolks with a fork.  Add sour cream, mustard and salt and mix well.
Fill the egg whites with the yolk mixture and set aside.
In a saucepan, saute the onions in butter until tender.  Add the soup and sour cream and mix well.
Pour half into an ungreased, shallow baking dish.  Arrange stuffed eggs over the sauce.  Spoon remaining sauce on top.  Sprinkle with cheese and paprika.
Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking.
Bake, uncovered for 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven until heated through.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
I love this breakfast dish because you can make it the night before and then just pop it in the oven the next morning. I've fixed it for overnight guests and they just love it.  It's rich so some nice fruit would be great with this.
