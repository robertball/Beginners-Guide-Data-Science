Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons mild curry paste
1 small red onion, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
1 celery stalk, chopped
1 small red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 cubes vegetable bouillon
1/2 pound lentils
3 cups water, more if needed
3/4 cup spaghetti sauce
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 pinch ground black pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil and curry paste in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, celery, red bell pepper, and red pepper flakes until onion is softened and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Break the bouillon cubes into onion mixture; add lentils and stir.
Pour enough water into the pot, so the water line is 1 inch above the lentil and onion mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until lentils are fully cooked, about 40 minutes. Stir spaghetti sauce into the soup and simmer 5 minutes. Stir cilantro and black pepper into soup right before serving.

Description: 
Several years ago, I tried this vegan soup at Deception Pass Grill and I had to have the recipe. Bursting with flavor, this spicy and vibrant soup is not only a pleasure to eat, but is also perfect for these cold winter nights ahead.
