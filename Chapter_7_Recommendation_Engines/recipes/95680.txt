Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup minced garlic
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup soy sauce
black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)

Directions:
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until the garlic has softened, and turns golden brown, about 5 minutes. Pour in the lemon juice and soy sauce, season with the black pepper and cayenne pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, and continue simmering for 5 minutes.
To use: Brush Ruben's Garlic Grill Sauce onto red meats, chicken, and fish before and during grilling. It also works well as a marinade.

Description: 
This is a grilling and broiling sauce for garlic lovers!  The flavor is a tangy and garlicy. It's great on red meat, chicken, or fish, and is wonderful on prime rib!  My dad has been making his 'secret' sauce for our family and friends for over 35 years. Everyone loves this sauce! Dad just passed away a month ago but his recipe lives on.
