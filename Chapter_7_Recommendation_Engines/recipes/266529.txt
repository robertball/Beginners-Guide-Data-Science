Ingredients:
1/4 (16 ounce) package whole wheat rotini pasta (such as Barilla®)
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
3 links chicken sausage links (such as Al Fresco®)
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 yellow bell pepper, diced
1/2 onion, diced
1 pinch salt
1 medium jalapeno, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes (such as Hunt's®)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute sausage in the skillet until nearly cooked through, about 3 minutes. Add bell peppers, onion, and salt; cook about 3 minutes more. Add jalapeno and garlic, stirring constantly. Add tomatoes and cooked pasta; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes more.
