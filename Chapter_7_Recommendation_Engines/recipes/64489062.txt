Ingredients:
32 oz. (One Box) of Chicken Broth
One Bunch of Beets
One Handful of Baby Carrots
One Small Butternut Squash
Two Sweet Potatoes
¼ Cup Parmesan Cheese
3 Tbsp Dill
One Medium-Sized Celery Root
2 Tbsp Olive Oil
2 tsp Olive Oil
Two Shallots
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375º F.
Pour the chicken broth in a pot on the stove and toss a handful of baby carrots in. Leave them cooking for five minutes after the broth starts boiling, then strain them.
Chop up the celery root, and sauté it in 2 Tbsp olive oil for twenty minutes. Mince the shallots and chop up the beet greens, and add them to the sauté during the last ten minutes.
Put 2 tsp olive oil on the beets and wrap them in aluminum foil. Put them in the oven for an hour. Then, cut the butternut squash into cubes, toss with aluminum foil and put them on the baking dish (or cookie sheet) and bake them for 45 minutes. Cut the sweet potatoes into discs, and toss them with the butternut squash, and bake them for 45 minutes as well.
When the beets are done, slice them into quarter-inch slices, and then mix everything together in a bowl.
Put dill and Parmesan cheese on top, and serve with salt and pepper to taste.
