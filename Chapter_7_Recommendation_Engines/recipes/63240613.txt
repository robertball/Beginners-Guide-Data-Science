Ingredients:
3 c. rhubarb pieces, cut 1/2 inch or smaller
1 (3 oz.) pkg. red strawberry Jello
1 c. butter
2 eggs
2 c. flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1 1/4 c. sugar
1 c. sour cream
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. soda
Nut Mixture:
1/2 c. brown sugar
1 tsp. cinnamon
2 tbsp. white sugar
1/2 c. chopped walnuts

Directions:
Mix rhubarb thoroughly with red Jello. Set aside. Make a batter starting with creaming butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs well. Stir in sour cream. Add flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Spread half of the batter into a greased 9 x 13 inch pan.
Put rhubarb lightly over batter. Combine sugars, cinnamon and nuts and sprinkle half of this over rhubarb. Spread the rest of batter over this. Sprinkle with remaining nut mix. Bake about 35 minutes in a 350 degree oven until lightly browned.

This is our favorite rhubarb recipe that I've been making for years.  I lost it recently but was able to find the recipe on Cooks.com, thank goodness.
