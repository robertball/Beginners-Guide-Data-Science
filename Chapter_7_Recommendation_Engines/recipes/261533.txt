Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground bison
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons chipotle chile powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained (optional)
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)
1 (8 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup warm water
2 tablespoons masa harina (corn flour)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and bison until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Transfer meat to a bowl.
Heat the remaining olive oil in the same saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute green bell pepper, onion, and garlic until the onion becomes translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the cooked meat. Add chili powder, chipotle powder, and cumin. Stir again. Add crushed tomatoes, kidney beans, diced tomatoes, corn, tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon salt, and sugar. Stir well; reduce heat to low and simmer the chili for at least 25 minutes.
Combine warm water and masa harina in a bowl. Pour into the chili. Continue simmering until thickened, about 10 minutes more. Season with salt.

Description: 
This hearty chipotle bison chili recipe is based on the one my mom used when I was growing up. It's perfect for cold winter nights or just when you want a little comfort food! It's great with any type of ground meat, even ground turkey. Serve topped with Fritos® and Cheddar cheese. This is also very good over cornbread.
