Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 cup coconut milk
1 tablespoon coconut oil
Honey or stevia to taste

Directions:
BRING WATER TO A BOIL. ADD TURMERIC POWDER AND SIMMER GENTLY FOR 10 MINUTES.
ADD COCONUT MILK AND COCONUT OIL. HEAT UNTIL WARMED THROUGH.
SWEETEN WITH HONEY OR STEVIA TO TASTE.
Feel free to experiment with the ingredients and proportions to create the brew that is just right for you.
You can substitute almond milk or regular milk for coconut milk, as long as it contains some fat.
Ghee, traditional clarified Indian butter, works great instead of coconut oil and adds a rich buttery flavor.
