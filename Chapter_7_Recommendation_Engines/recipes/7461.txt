Description: 
This is an old family recipe from my deceased grandmother, whom I am honoring today by placing her recipe on your site for Mother's Day.  I used this recipe to win a cooking contest in 1983 for Pet Dairy, INC. in Sarasota, FL where I worked.  I was so surprised and honored to win and I want to share her recipe with all of you.
