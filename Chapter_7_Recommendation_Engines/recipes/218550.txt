2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
1 small head cabbage, chopped
1 small green bell pepper, chopped

1 cucumber, thinly sliced
2 small tomatoes, cut into wedges (optional)
1/4 cup vinegar
1/2 cup canola oil
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Place garlic powder into a bowl. Stir in enough water to make a runny paste. Toss in the cabbage, bell pepper, carrot, cucumber, and tomatoes until well coated. Let stand for 10 minutes.
Whisk together the vinegar, canola oil, and salt in a bowl. Pour dressing over the prepared vegetables. Mix thoroughly, then cover and refrigerate overnight.
