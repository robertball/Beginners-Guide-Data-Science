Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chocolate cookie crumbs
1/3 cup butter, melted
4 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, chopped
12 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 eggs
3 tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8 inch springform pan. In a medium bowl, combine cookie crumbs and butter. Mix well and press into the bottom of springform pan.
In the top of a double boiler, heat chocolate, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool to lukewarm.
In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, brown sugar and cornstarch until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Blend in the coffee liqueur. Fold 1/3 of the filling into the melted chocolate, then pour the chocolate mixture back into the filling and mix until no streaks remain. Pour into crust.
Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until filling is set. Allow to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.
