Ingredients:
8 slices of smokey bacon, chopped
1/2 of a small onion, chopped fine
1/4 cup red pepper, minced
1/4 cup green pepper, minced
1 teaspoon serrano chili, minced fine (use more if you like a good "kick" - less if you prefer mild)
5 large eggs
pepper, to taste
1 cup shredded cheese (your choice)
1 20 oz can hominy, drained and rinsed
Salt, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium size skillet fry the bacon until crisp.  Drain.  Set aside.  Reserve 1 teaspoon of the drippings in the skillet.  Add onions, peppers and hominy.  Cook until onions are soft.  Beat eggs, add pepper and pour over vegetables.  Sprinkle the bacon on top.  Top skillet with a lid and cook until the eggs are nearly set.  Top with your choice of cheese, cover again until the cheese melts.  Let stand for a minute before slicing to serve.
Buen Provecho!
