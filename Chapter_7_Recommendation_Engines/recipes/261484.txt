Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup coconut oil, at room temperature
1/2 cup butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup turbinado (raw) sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1 cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/2 cups dried cherries, roughly chopped
3/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut
1/2 cup milk chocolate chips, roughly chopped
Glaze Topping:
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons cherry jam
1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 24-cup mini muffin tins or line cups with paper liners.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Combine coconut oil, butter, white sugar, turbinado sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on high speed until well combined, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add yogurt and almond extract and beat on medium-low to incorporate. Mix in flour mixture on the lowest speed until batter is just combined.
Fold cherries, coconut, and milk chocolate chips into the batter. Fill muffin tins 3/4-full of batter using a small scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.
Combine confectioners' sugar, cherry jam, and heavy cream in a small bowl; mix with a spoon until no lumps of confectioners' sugar are visible and glaze is smooth. Thin with more cream if needed. Drizzle over scuffins.
