Ingredients:
Peach Filling:
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 cups sliced fresh peaches
1 teaspoon lemon juice
Cobbler Topping:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons shortening
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon in a saucepan and whisk to mix. Stir in sliced peaches (see Editor's Note) and lemon juice, tossing until peaches are evenly coated.
Cook filling over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils. Boil 1 minute. Pour mixture into an ungreased 2-quart casserole dish. Keep mixture hot in oven while you make the topping.
In a medium bowl combine flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix thoroughly, then cut in shortening until mixture looks like fine crumbs. Add milk and stir until mixture is evenly moistened.
Remove peach filling from oven and drop dough onto peaches in 6 equal-size spoonfuls.
Return cobbler to oven and bake until topping is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
