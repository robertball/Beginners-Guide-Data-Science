Ingredients:
3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, cut into small pieces
1 pound ricotta cheese
1/3 cup honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Place chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Allow to cool slightly.
Combine melted chocolate, ricotta cheese, honey, and vanilla extract in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour into dessert cups or glasses and let chill completely.
