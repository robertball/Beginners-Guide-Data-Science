Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can butter beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can lima beans, drained
1 (16 ounce) can pork and beans, drained
1/2 pound bacon, cut into small pieces
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup vinegar
1/4 cup molasses
1 teaspoon dry mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place kidney beans, butter beans, lima beans, and pork and beans in a 2-quart casserole dish.
Heat a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir bacon, onion, and garlic until bacon is browned, about 10 minutes. Pour off excess fat.
Whisk brown sugar, ketchup, vinegar, molasses, and mustard into bacon mixture; simmer until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Pour sauce over beans in the casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, 1 hour 15 minutes.

Description: 
Four different kinds of beans baked with molasses. I have substituted different kinds of beans and enjoyed all of the results. Use whatever kind of beans you like! I have also used Canadian bacon instead of regular bacon.
