Ingredients:
1  tablespoon olive oil
1/2  cup chopped yellow onion
1  teaspoon minced garlic
1-1/2  cups dry orzo pasta
1/4  cup dry white wine, optional
4  cups low-sodium chicken broth
1  cup Birds EyeÂ® Baby Sweet Peas, thawed
1/2  cup grated Parmesan cheese
1  tablespoon butter

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a 2-quart nonstick saucepan over MEDIUM-HIGH heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until soft, about 3 minutes.
Add orzo and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add wine and cook, stirring, until wine evaporates, about 1 minute.
Add chicken broth; bring to a boil, reduce heat to MEDIUM and cook, stirring frequently, until the orzo absorbs the broth, about 20 to 25 minutes.
Add peas, cheese, and butter; reduce heat to LOW and cook until cheese melts, about 3 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper, if desired.
