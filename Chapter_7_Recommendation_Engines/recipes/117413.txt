Ingredients:
1 large sweet red pepper
2 (15 ounce) cans white kidney or cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 medium red onion, sliced and separated into rings
1/4 cup minced fresh basil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Cut red pepper in half; remove seeds. Place pepper halves cut side down on a rack in a broiler pan. Broil 4 in. from the heat until skin blisters, about 8 minutes. Immediately place peppers in a bowl; cover and let stand for 15-20 minutes. Peel off and discard charred skin. Cut peppers into strips; place in a large bowl. Add the beans, onion and basil.
In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the vinegar, oil, salt and pepper; shake well. Pour over bean mixture; toss to coat.

Description: 
'I've had this recipe quite a long time, although I have changed it somewhat from the original,' comments Alden Thornton from Warrenton, Oregon. 'It's always been popular, particularly when served at picnics and potlucks.' Tip: If you are crunched for time, instead of roasting the pepper yourself, use roasted red peppers sold in jar, often near the pickles and condiments.
