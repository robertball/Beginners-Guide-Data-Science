Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups rice flour
1 cup millet flour
3/4 cup tapioca flour
3/4 cup date sugar
1/2 cup arrowroot starch
2 1/2 teaspoons xanthan gum
2 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 2/3 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground ginger (optional)
2 cups buttermilk
5 eggs, separated
1 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons honey
2 cups fresh blueberries (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin tin or line with paper liners.
Sift rice flour, millet flour, tapioca flour, date sugar, arrowroot starch, xanthan gum, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, and ginger together in a large bowl.
Mix buttermilk, egg yolks, vegetable oil, and honey together in a separate bowl. Pour over the rice flour mixture and mix until all the flour is incorporated. Fold in blueberries.
Beat egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer until almost stiff. Fold into the batter gently; batter should be very porous. Pour batter into muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
While experimenting with a gluten-free diet, I realized I needed my muffins. It took a few tries, but I honestly think that these are just as good as the original. The tops always come out pretty too. This is gluten free and can be corn free. Feel free to experiment and add whatever fruit you like, or even nuts. Happy cooking and good eating.
