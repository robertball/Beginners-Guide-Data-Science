Ingredients:
1/2 lb. raw shrimp (peeled and deveined)
2 tsp. extra virgin olive oil
1 lemon, cut in half
2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1/2 - 1 tsp. Creole seasoning
salt and fresh ground pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven on broiler setting.  If you need to set temperature, set to 400 degrees fahrenheit (200 degrees celsius).  Move oven rack to be as close to broiler heat as possible.
Pat shrimp dry with paper towel to remove any excess moisture (particularly if using thawed frozen shrimp).
Spray casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray or olive oil.  Place shrimp in small casserole dish, tightly packed in a single layer.  (The dish looks nice if you place all of the shrimp facing the same direction with the tails outwards.  Alternatively, place shrimp in individual casserole dishes.)  Ensure that the shrimp are in a single layer laid flat so that they cook evenly.
Drizzle olive oil evenly over shrimp.  Drizzle lemon juice evenly over shrimp.  Drizzle Worcestshire sauce evenly over shrimp.  Sprinkle Creole seasoning, salt, and pepper evenly over shrimp.
Broil for 7-8 minutes.  Shrimp will be pink and slightly firm to touch when finished.  Do not overcook!  Serve immediately.
