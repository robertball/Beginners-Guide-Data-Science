Ingredients:
2 pounds fresh grouper fillets
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup butter, softened
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 dash hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler.
Place the grouper fillets on a greased baking tray. Brush them with lemon juice. In a small bowl, stir together the Parmesan cheese, butter, mayonnaise, hot pepper sauce, salt and pepper. Set aside.
Broil the fillets for 4 to 6 minutes, until they can be flaked with a fork. Remove from the oven and spread the cheese mixture on top of fillets.
Return to the broiler for an additional 30 seconds, or until the topping is browned and bubbly.

Description: 
Fresh grouper is my absolute favorite.  It is a mild fish and this recipe may entice even those who don't like fish to make it a favorite. The recipe is super easy and can be served with a minimum preparation and cooking time.  Perfect for a warm summer evening supper. Garnish with lemon twists and parsley before serving.
