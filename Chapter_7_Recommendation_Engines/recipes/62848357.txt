Ingredients:
1 15-oz. can organic black beans
1/2c agave nectar
1 tiny scoop stevia (optional, but I use it)
3 large eggs
1/4c unsweetened cocoa powder (Dagoba works great)
2t vanilla
1/3c melted butter (or equal parts Earth Balance and coconut oil)
1 pinch sea salt
1/2c chocolate chips (optional, but come on now ... must have)
1/3c chopped pecans or walnuts (optional, but can get soggy)

Directions:
Dump all ingredients except chips and nuts (if you're using them) into a blender or Vita-Mix and blend for 2 minutes.
Fold in chips and nuts, if using.
Pour into 8-inch-square pan already coated in cooking spray.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.
