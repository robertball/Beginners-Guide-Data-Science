Ingredients:
1 (20 ounce) package JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE® Lean Ground Turkey
1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil
1/2 cup prepared chunky tomato salsa
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo or kidney beans, drained
4 cups shredded lettuce or spinach
2 tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup chopped yellow pepper
6 tablespoons shredded low-fat Cheddar cheese
6 tablespoons sliced green onion
plain low-fat yogurt (optional)
lime wedges (optional)
LEAN TORTILLA CHIPS
2 Cooking spray
6 (8 inch) MANNY'S® 8-inch Fajita Style Flour Tortillas
Garlic salt

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil until hot. Crumble in turkey. Cook until turkey is no longer pink, about 4 minutes; drain. Stir in salsa, vinegar, chili powder and beans; cook until heated through. On 6 plates, evenly divide and layer lettuce, tomatoes and pepper. Top with turkey mixture, cheese and green onion. Serve with lean tortilla chips, yogurt and lime wedges, if desired.
Lean tortilla chips: Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray two baking sheets with cooking spray. Brush six 8-inch flour tortillas lightly with water and sprinkle with garlic salt. Cut each tortilla into eighths. Place triangle-shaped pieces on baking sheets and bake until crisp and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
