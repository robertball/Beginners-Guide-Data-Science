Ingredients:
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 large eggs
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup coconut, shaved and sweetened, from a bag, not toasted
1/2 cup pecans, chopped, not toasted
Caramel or caramel syrup

Directions:
Put cream, milk, cocoa, and chocolate in a large sauce pan.  Heat over medium-low heat until it reaches 140 degrees.
Beat the eggs until they turn a lighter color.  Continue to beat the eggs and slowly add the sugar.  Mix in the vanilla.
Whisk the egg mixture while you slowly add one third of the cream mixture.  Mix thoroughly, then add the remaining cream and mix.
Return the liquid to the stove and heat until it reaches 175 degrees.  Hold it there for 30 seconds.
Chill cream mixture until it reaches 40 degrees.  Transfer to an ice cream maker and chill according to manufacturer's directions.
Layer a pre-chilled container with alternating layers of chocolate ice cream, coconut, pecans, and caramel.  Freeze until solid and serve.
