Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Healthy Request® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup
1 1/4 cups water
1 1/4 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into1-inch pieces
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning, crushed
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
1 cup instant mashed potato flakes
1 cup fat free evaporated milk
1/4 cup shredded 2% milk Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Stir the soup and 1/4 cup water in a large bowl.
Season the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, the onion powder and poultry seasoning. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned, stirring occasionally.
Add the chicken and vegetables to the soup mixture and stir to coat. Spoon the chicken mixture into a 2-quart round casserole.
Microwave the remaining water in a microwavable bowl on HIGH for 1 to 2 minutes or until hot. Add the potato flakes and stir until the water is absorbed. Stir in the milk and remaining black pepper. Loosely cover and microwave on HIGH for 2 minutes or until the mixture is hot. Spread the potato mixture over the chicken mixture. Sprinkle with the cheese.
Bake for 40 minutes or until the chicken mixture is hot and bubbling.
