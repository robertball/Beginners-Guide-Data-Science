Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups cornmeal
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped (with seeds)
2 eggs
1 cup buttermilk
3 tablespoons vegetable oil (I use canola)

Directions:
1.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  In a 8-10" cast iron skillet distribute 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Place skillet in preheated oven for 10 minutes.
2.  In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Stir in the diced jalapenos with seeds.
3.  In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, buttermilk and oil. Add to the dry ingredients and stir just until moistened.
4.  Remove hot skillet carefully from oven and distribute wet cornbread mixture evenly.
5.  Bake at 425 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cut into squares or wedges. Serve warm.

Description: 
Spicy and delicious---this is great served with any bean soup.  After dinner I drizzled a little honey over a buttered cornbread slice.  It was both spicy and sweet.Modified from: Jalapeno Corn Bread II
