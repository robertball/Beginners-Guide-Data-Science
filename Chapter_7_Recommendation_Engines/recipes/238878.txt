Ingredients:
Waffles:
1 1/2 cups sweet potato puree
2/3 cup milk
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon salt
Syrup:
1 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup cranberry sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Stir sweet potato, milk, egg, and butter together in a bowl. Whisk flour, brown sugar, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and salt together in a separate large bowl. Add potato mixture to flour mixture; stir until batter is just combined.
Ladle batter into the preheated waffle iron and cook until waffles are golden and crisp, about 3 minutes.
Stir maple syrup, cranberry sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until well-combined and heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour syrup over cooked waffles.
