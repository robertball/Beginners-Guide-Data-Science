Ingredients:
6 cups flour, 3 T sugar, 1/2 T salt, 1 1/2 T baking powder, 1 pkg quick-rise yeast, 2 cups warm water

Directions:
Mix together flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in a large bowl. Make a well in the flour mixture. Dissolve yeast in warm water. Pour the yeast mixture into well and mix together lightly and rapidly. Do not overmix or knead. The dough will be quite moist and soft. Allow mixture to rise about 15-20 minutes. With well-floured fingers, pinch off a lump of dough about 2 inches in diameter. Stretch it into a round, 5 to 6 inches in diameter working in more flour if necessary. Deep-fry in hot fat heated to 375 degrees for about 4 minutes or until golden-brown, turning once after about 2 minutes. Drain on absorbent paper. Repeat until the dough is used up.
