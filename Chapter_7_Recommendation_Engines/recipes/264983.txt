Ingredients:
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup lime juice
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup orange juice
1 small bunch cilantro, chopped, or to taste
2 tablespoons chili powder
4 cloves garlic, crushed
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons crushed coriander seeds
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
1 teaspoon finely chopped chipotle pepper
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
2 pounds flank steak
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Combine onion, soy sauce, lime juice, lemon juice, orange juice, cilantro, chili powder, garlic, cumin, oregano, coriander, hot sauce, chipotle pepper, black pepper, and sugar in a 1-gallon plastic zip-top bag. Add steak and seal. Marinate in the refrigerator, turning and massaging meat frequently, for up to 24 hours.
Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over high heat. Add steak and marinade. Cook steak until medium-rare to medium, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 to 140 degrees F (54 to 60 degrees C).

Description: 
I have used this recipe for a number of years, and most often marinate enough steak for a few meals. After the marinade time, the steak can be frozen in meal-sized portions for quick meals later. The flavor of this carne asada is much better, and the meat much more tender, than any I have had in Mexican restaurants. If cut in strips, this meat also works very well for fajitas. Serve with tortillas, Mexican rice, and beans.
