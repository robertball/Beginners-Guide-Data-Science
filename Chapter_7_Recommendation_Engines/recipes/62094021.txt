Description: 
Harvest your yard!!  A lovely and refreshing tea, usually only available in high summer to fall.  This uses **red sumac** from bushes growing wild.  ***Please:*** If you don't know how to identify this plant, please find someone who can before trying this recipe.   The finished product tastes a lot like Celestial Seasonings' Red Zinger.
