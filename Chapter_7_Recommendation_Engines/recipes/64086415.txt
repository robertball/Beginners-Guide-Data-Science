Ingredients:
1 cup organic cane sugar
1/2 to 3/4 tsp cardamom, to taste
1 tbsp corn starch
5 cups sliced peeled tart apples
1 cup fresh or frozen (unthawed) cranberries
1 can refrigerated biscuits
1/4 cup sliced almonds (optional)
Milk or half and half (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.  In a small bowl, combine sugar and cardamom.  Reserve 2 tablespoons and set aside.
In a 2 quart saucepan, stir together remaining sugar mixture, cornstarch, apples, and cranberries.  Heat to boiling over medium heat, stirring frequently.  Boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Reduce heat and cook until apples are tender crisp, stirring frequently.
Separate dough into individual biscuits.  Pour fruit mixture into a 2 quart casserole dish and top evenly with biscuits.  Sprinkle with reserved sugar mixture and almonds.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes until filling is bubbly and biscuits are deep golden brown.  Serve warm with milk or half and half.
