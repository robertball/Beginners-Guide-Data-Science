Description: 
Traditional cold rice salad considered fast food in Italy.  Used for picnics and lunches on the go.  Great for hot days when you don't want to heat up the kitchen. Add a few drops of your favorite hot pepper sauce for a dash of spice if you like. Many Italians add a few tablespoons of mayonnaise at the end.
