Ingredients:
1 lb lean (at least 80%) ground beef
1 small onion, chopped (1/2 cup)
1 medium green bell pepper, coarsely chopped (1 cup)
2 jars (14 oz each) pizza sauce

2 cups Original Bisquick™ mix
1 cup milk
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups shredded pizza cheese blend (6 oz)

Heat oven to 350°F. In 12-inch skillet, cook beef, onion and bell pepper over medium-high heat 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until beef is thoroughly cooked; drain.
Stir in pizza sauce, pepperoni and olives; heat until hot. Spoon into ungreased 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish.
