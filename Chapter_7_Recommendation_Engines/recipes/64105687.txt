Ingredients:
4tbsp of cold butter
2 cups of self-rising flour
2/3 to 3/4 cup milk

Directions:
the recipe is super easy! put 2 cups of self-rising flour in a bowl. cut 4tbsp of cold butter into small cubes and pinch it into the flour with your fingertips. basically smash it so it's in flat pieces, big and small. stir in cold milk until the dough comes together. about 2/3 to 3/4 cup. don't add it all at once. fold the dough onto itself twice then gently pat out onto a floured surface and cut. I get 6-8 depending on the size. bake at 425 on a buttered sheet pan and butter the tops before baking. bake 10-14 min. they should be lightly crisp on the bottom and flakey and buttery inside!
