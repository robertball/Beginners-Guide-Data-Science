Ingredients:
1 Tbsp canola oil
1 Tbsp butter
1/2 cup unpopped popcorn
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste

Directions:
Start by cutting a paper grocery sack in half.  This will serve as a makeshift serving bowl and it will absorb excess oil.
In a 2 quart pot, combine the oil, butter, salt and 3 kernels. Set over high heat, and constantly shake the pan back and forth. After the three kernels of corn pop, add the rest of the corn kernels and place the lid on the pot, and continue shaking (remove from heat 30 secs). When the popcorn starts to lift the lid up off the pan, remove it from the heat, and hold it over the paper bag until it stops popping.
Pour into the paper sack and season with half of the seasoned salt. Shake the paper sack to distribute the salt. Taste before adding more so you don't make it too salty. You can always add more salt.
