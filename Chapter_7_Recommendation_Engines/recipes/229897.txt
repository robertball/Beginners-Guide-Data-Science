Ingredients:
14 cups sliced apples
2 cups white sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons apple pie spice

Directions:
Place apple slices in a slow cooker. Stir sugar and apple pie spice with the apples.
Cook on High for 4 hours; stir. Remove cover and continue cooking until the apples are very tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
Scrape apple butter into a bowl; refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Blend apple butter with an immersion blender until smooth. Alternately, you can run the butter through a food mill or blend in a blender.
