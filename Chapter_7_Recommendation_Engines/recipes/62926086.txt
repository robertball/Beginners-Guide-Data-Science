Title:
Grain-Free/Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Blend together:
•5 Tbsp softened butter
•3 Tbsp honey
•splash of vanilla extract
•1 egg
In a separate bowl, mix together:
•1 1/4 cup almond flour
•1/8 tsp baking soda
•pinch of salt
•3 Tbsp cocoa powder
•dash of cinnamon
Add the dry ingredients to the wet ones and combine, then fold in some chopped dark chocolate (I chopped up about 3 squares, but didn’t measure) or chocolate chips of your choice.

Directions:
Drop by the spoonful on a parchment-covered cookie sheet, and bake about 12 minutes or until they’re not too wet-looking. They’ll “set” as they cool, so don’t worry if they’re a little squishy when you take them out.
Cool, then eat them

Description: 
Found this recipe when I went grain free, and I love it!! To me these are better than regular chocolate chip cookies and much healthier. You can take out the cocoa powder if you prefer. Usually I just grind up almonds in my food processor instead of buying almond flour. Excellent either way. Hope you enjoy these as much as I do.
