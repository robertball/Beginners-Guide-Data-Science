Ingredients:
2 slices pancetta or bacon, chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small red onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1 bunch kale, roughly chopped
1 bunch beet greens, roughly chopped
salt to taste
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained

Directions:
Microwave the chopped pancetta or bacon on high for 3 minutes. Drain the drippings, and set the crispy pancetta aside.
In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Cook onion in oil until soft. Add the crushed garlic cloves, and cook a minute more. Stir in chopped greens, and season with salt to taste (be conservative at this point - you can always add more!). Partially cover the pan, and cook until the greens begin to wilt. Stir in crispy pancetta and cannellini beans. Cook partially covered for 5 more minutes, until the flavors have combined and the greens are tender.

Description: 
Inspiration for this recipe came from my roomie. This is a forgiving recipe and a great way to get your greens! I eat it as a main dish, but this could easily be fit for four to six sides. Feel free to substitute different kinds of greens depending on what's in season, and use regular diced bacon instead of pancetta if desired.
