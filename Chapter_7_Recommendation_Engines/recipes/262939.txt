Ingredients:
1/2 cup red wine
1/2 sweet onion, roughly chopped
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons lemon juice
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon ground thyme
1 tablespoon dried rosemary
2 teaspoons ground basil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
1/4 cup tapioca starch
1 1/2 pounds sirloin lamb chops, room temperature

Directions:
Combine red wine and onion in a slow cooker.
Whisk honey, mustard, lemon juice, garlic, thyme, rosemary, basil, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl until well blended. Add tapioca starch and whisk until well combined. Let sit until mixture is thickened, at least 5 minutes.
Dip lamb chops in the mustard mixture and massage until fully coated.
Place chops in a single layer over the red wine and onion mixture in the slow cooker. Pour remaining mustard mixture on top.
Cover slow cooker and cook on Low until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop reads at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), about 4 1/2 hours.
