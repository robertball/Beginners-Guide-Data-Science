Ingredients:
1/2 (12 ounce) package NO YOLKS® Broad Noodles
1/2 pound lean ground chicken or turkey

1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup frozen corn kernels
2 teaspoons chili powder

1 cup canned no salt added black beans, drained and rinsed
3/4 cup sodium-reduced chicken broth
Shredded Cheddar cheese, chopped green onions and low fat sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Prepare the noodles according to package directions.
Meanwhile, brown the chicken with the onion, green pepper, corn, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper in a large, deep nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat.
Add the salsa, black beans, and broth to the skillet. Bring to a boil; simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the cooked noodles until coated. Serve with shredded Cheddar cheese, green onions, sour cream and additional salsa to garnish individual bowls at the table.
