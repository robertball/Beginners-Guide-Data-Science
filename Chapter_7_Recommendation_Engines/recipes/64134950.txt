Ingredients:
1 cup chunky almond butter, room temperature
1 cup coconut sugar
2 large eggs, whisked

1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place a piece of parchment paper on a large baking sheet.
In a large bowl, mix together almond butter and coconut sugar.
Add eggs and continue mixing until well combined.
Sift in cocoa powder, baking soda and baking powder (to prevent any lumps) and stir into the mixture.
Add in vanilla and salt then fold in chocolate chips and combine until all ingredients are incorporated.
The batter will be thick and cake like.
On your prepared baking sheet add 1 tablespoon of dough and make a round ball.  Place on your baking sheet then lightly press with a fork and make a criss cross.  (donâ€™t over press just slightly).
Bake for 8-10 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before moving them.
