Biscuits Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups of White Lily self-rising flour or King Arthur Pastry flour
1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder*
1 teaspoon kosher salt*
1/4 cup vegetable shortening or lard (still has less cholesterol than butter), cold
1/2-3/4 cup buttermilk
* Note:  If you are using self-rising flour, omit these two ingredients.

Directions:
Mix flour, baking soda, and kosher salt together until well-blended.  Cut in vegetable shortening (or lard) until shortening is distributed like small peas.  Start adding buttermilk and mix with a fork until the dough is very sticky and just pulling away from the sides.  DO NOT OVER-MIX!  (I cannot emphasize this point any stronger!)  Turn out on a flour-dusted surface and knead for three or four turns.  Roll out to 1/2 inch and cut biscuits out until all the dough is used.
Place biscuits in close proximity to each other on a shiny cooking sheet.  (Dark cookie sheets unevenly browns the biscuits.)  Place into preheated oven for 8-12 minutes until the surface is nicely browned.  Remove from the oven and serve as soon as possible.  Makes 5-8 two-inch diameter biscuits.
