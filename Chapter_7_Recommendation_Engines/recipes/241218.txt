Ingredients:
2 cups grated zucchini
1 pinch salt, or as needed
cooking spray
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup minced onion
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon dried sage

Directions:
Place zucchini in a colander or strainer set over a bowl and sprinkle a pinch of salt over the top; let liquid drain from zucchini for 1 hour. Press zucchini with a paper towel to remove any excess liquid.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a mini-muffin pan with cooking spray.
Stir zucchini, bread crumbs, Cheddar cheese, onion, eggs, black pepper, oregano, basil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, rosemary, garlic powder, and sage together in a large bowl. Spoon zucchini mixture into prepared muffin cups, filling each cup and flattening mixture to be even with the top of the muffin pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
