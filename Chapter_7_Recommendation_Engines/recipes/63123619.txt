Ingredients:
1 22 oz bag frozen beef or cheese ravioli
1/2 stick margarine
5-6 small button mushrooms, quartered
1/2 tsp salt
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp dried oregano leaves
1/2 tsp dried basil leaves
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp granulated beef or chicken bouillon (optional)
1/2 C Chardonnay or other white wine
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Start water for ravioli according to package directions.
In a small saucepan, melt margarine over medium-low heat.  Continue heating until foam starts to dissipate.
Add quartered mushrooms and salt and cook, without stirring much, until mushrooms release their liquid and start to brown.  Then, add garlic and continue to cook until mushrooms are browned well.
Meanwhile, once water is boiling, add ravioli and cook according to package directions.
Add oregano, basil, onion powder, bouillon if using, and wine.
Bring to a boil and reduce until sauce thickens - about 5 minutes.
Drain ravioli and transfer to bowl.  Toss with finished sauce and serve with slivered parmesan if desired.
