Description: 
This super-easy frittata will forever be our Christmas morning breakfast tradition.  As a recently-diagnosed type 2 diabetic, our old traditions (orange danish rolls or my husband's French toast) aren't an option for me anymore.  This carb-friendly dish is absolutely family-approved (from the 3-year-old to the 30-somethings...).  It bakes while we open presents.Modified from: Bacon Cheese Frittata
