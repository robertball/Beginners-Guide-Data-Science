Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/4 cup diced onion
1 cup white rice
2 tablespoons slivered almonds
2 cups water
1 cube beef bouillon
1 teaspoon dried parsley

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion until tender, about 5 minutes. Add rice and almonds, cooking and stirring until rice is lightly toasted, about 5 minutes more. Stir in water, bouillon, and parsley; cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until water is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and allow rice to rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
A delicious side dish for beef or chicken. A great change from plain rice or boxed rice mixes. I like to serve this with grilled chicken or with saucy cube steaks.
