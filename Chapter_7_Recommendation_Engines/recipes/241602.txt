Ingredients:
Black Beans and Rice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onions, finely chopped
1 green bell pepper, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 1/2 cups water
2 (16 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
2 cups brown rice
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 bay leaf
ground black pepper to taste
Mango Salsa
2 cups chopped fresh mango
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
2/3 cup chopped green onion
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
Taco Filling:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1 (8 ounce) package flour tortillas

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook onion and green bell pepper in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes; add garlic and cook another 3 minutes. Stir water, black beans, rice, cumin, salt, and paprika with the onion mixture; add bay leaf. Bring the liquid to a boil, cover saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, reduce heat to low, and cook until the rice is tender and the moisture is absorbed, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaf.
While rice cooks, mix mango, red bell pepper, green onion, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, lime juice, and olive oil together in a large bowl; refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef with chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, oregano, and paprika in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Stir mango salsa before serving along with the black beans and rice, seasoned ground beef, tortillas, and your preferred taco fillings.
