Ingredients:
3 ounces unsweetened chocolate
1 cup low fat milk
1/4 cup egg substitute
1/2 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons orange liqueur (Grand Marnier, Curacao, Triple Sec, or brandy)*
1/2 cup heavy cream
3 cups sliced strawberries

Directions:
Place chocolate and milk in a medium saucepan.  Heat over medium heat until chocolate melts.  Set aside.
Stir together egg substitute, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, cornstarch and Grand Marnier in a small mixing bowl.  Add to chocolate mixture.  Stir constantly.  Cook over medium heat while stirring constantly, until mixture begins to thicken (approx. 3-4 minutes).  Remove from heat and pour into the bowl of a blender or food processor.  Blend or process briefly (10-20 seconds) to make a more creamy texture.  Pour into medium bowl and cover.
Refrigerate chocolate mixture approx. 2-3 hours or until cool.  Whip cream until stiff and fold into chocolate.  Refrigerate overnight to set.  Will keep refrigerated for 3 days.
To serve, layer strawberries and mousse in 6 all- purpose wine glasses.
