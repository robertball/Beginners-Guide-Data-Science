Ingredients:
1	Pound Hamburger
1	to 2 tablespoons butter or margarine, if necessary (if you buy low fat beef you will need to add butter)
2 to 4 tablespoons flour (approximately)
2-4	cups milk
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1.	In a large saucepan or large saut√© pan, cook and crumble Hamburger.   When hamburger is fully cooked, add butter if necessary; and seasoning, after butter melts, add flour little by little stirring to combine flour with fats in pan.  Adding a little flour at a time until all the fats are soaked up.  Thick paste Not dry paste consistency. Let flour cook stirring a bit for about 1-2 minutes.
2.	start adding the milk.  Just enough to almost cover all Hamburger in pan, but not covered.  Stirring constantly.  The gravy will start too thicken after the milk warms up.  Just keep adding after a little at a time maybe a half cup to a cup until the gravy is the consistency you like.   Taste to check seasoning and add more if necessary.
