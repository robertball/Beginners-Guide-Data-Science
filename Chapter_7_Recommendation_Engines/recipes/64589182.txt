Ingredients:
6 hard boiled eggs
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup water
6 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon dry minced onion
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil

Directions:
How to hard boil eggs. Place the six eggs into a saucepan. Cover the eggs with cold water. If the eggs are fresh add a quarter teaspoon of baking soda to them. This helps to keep the shells from sticking too the eggs. Put pan on high heat.
When the water comes to a boil cover the pan with a lid, turn off the heat and set the timer 10 minutes, do not open the lid during this time.
When timer is done, drain and cover eggs with cold water. Remove shells and place eggs in a container. A quart mason jar works well.
To make the brine add the rest if the ingredients to a saucepan. Heat the liquid just until the sugar dissolves.
Cool slightly and cover eggs with the solution.
Place in the refrigerator 6 hours, overnight is best before eating. The longer the eggs sit the more flavor they'll have. These are great on salads,  or just as is.

Description: 
We have a flock of laying hens and usually an abundance of eggs. I'm always trying to find new ways to prepare them. I came across this recipe and oh man are they good ! It's a unique twist to the more traditional pickled egg recipes out there.
