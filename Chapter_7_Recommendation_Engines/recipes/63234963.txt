Ingredients:
Gnocchi:
1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese
2 eggs
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
Sauce:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 28 oz can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes, drained and pureed in a blender
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
6 basil leaves, finely shredded
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar

Directions:
Stir together the ricotta cheese, eggs, Parmesan Cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a large bowl until evenly combined. Mix in 1 cup of flour. Add additional flour if needed to form a soft dough.
Divide the dough into 3 or 4 pieces, and roll into 1/2-inch-thick ropes on a floured surface. Cut each rope into 1-inch pieces, and place on a lightly floured baking sheet. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic, and cook until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in pureed tomatoes and red pepper flakes and sugar and salt; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cook for 10 minutes. Stir in shredded basil and season to taste with salt and pepper.
While sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Boil the gnocchi until they float to the surface, 5 to 6 minutes, then drain.
Scoop out gnocchi with a slotted spoon and dump into tomato sauce.
