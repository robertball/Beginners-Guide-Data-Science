Ingredients:
1 corned beef brisket, approximately 3.5 lbs
spice packet included with brisket
2 bottles of guiness (or other preferred dark beer or porter)
1 large onion (prefer vidalia for sweetness)
4 stalks celery (leaves included)
3 bay leaves
3 large cloves garlic
2 carrots
1 teaspoon pepper corns
Water to cover

Directions:
Remove brisket from package and place in large stew pot, fat side up.  Do not rise brisket first, as juices in package impart flavor.
Add onion, carrots, celery and garlic, all corsely chopped (these are for seasoning, and should not be eaten).
Add beer and the contents of the spice packet, bay leaf and additional peppercorns if desired.
Add water until entire brisket is covered.  Bring to a low boil.
Cover and allow to simmer for 3.5 hours (or 30 min for each half pound).  Take off heat and allow to sit in broth another 20 min.
Place on platter, cut in thin slices against the grain.  Serve with horseradish sauce or mustard.  (Do NOT serve any of the vegitables added to the broth for flavor).
If desired, take small white potatos, carrots, and cored and sliced cabbage, and boil in broth for 20 minutes to serve with main dish.
