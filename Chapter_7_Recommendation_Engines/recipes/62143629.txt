Ingredients:
1 lb. good, smoky bacon
2 Broccoli crowns
1 Red onion
2 C. Shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 C. Miracle Whip
1/2 C. sugar
1 tsp. vinegar

Directions:
Fry bacon crisp and drain on paper towels.  In food processor, chop the broccoli crowns fine (tops only).  Remove to mixing bowl.  Chop onion in processor until fine and add to broccoli.  Chop bacon with knife into small pieces and add to broccoli along with cheese.  Combine Miracle Whip, sugar and vinegar until well blended and add to salad and toss well.  Cover and let sit in refrigerator for at least an hour.
Note:  You can chop the bacon in the food processor but only if you add it while you are chopping the broccoli.  It will get gummy if you try to chop it by itself.
