Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 small onion, grated
1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed
4 tomatoes, pureed
2 yellow potatoes, peeled and cut into wedges
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch white sugar (optional)
water to cover

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and stir in onion. Cook until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Add green beans and stir to coat in the oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Add pureed tomato, potatoes, salt, pepper, and sugar. Stir well, then add water until beans are barely covered.
Bring to a simmer, partially cover with a lid, and cook gently over medium-low heat until green beans and potatoes are soft, 25 to 30 minutes. Uncover towards the end of cooking to reduce sauce if it is too watery.

Description: 
Fasolakia are Greek green beans stewed with olive oil and tomato, with a few pieces of potato added for good measure. This is a main dish in Greece, not a side dish, and a prime example of plant-based eating! Good crusty bread is essential for mopping up the sauce and I always need to have a healthy chunk of feta on the side. Serve fasolakia warm or at room temperature for best flavor.
