Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1 cup grated carrot
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 eggs
1/2 cup water, or as needed
salt and pepper to taste
8 cups cubed white bread
5 pounds veal breast
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook for 1 or 2 minutes until they begin to soften. Add the carrot, celery, and onion; cook and stir until the carrot begins to soften, 5 to 10 minutes. Turn the heat off, and stir in the garlic and parsley; set aside.
Beat the eggs and water with salt and pepper in a large bowl. Fold in the bread cubes until they absorb the egg mixture, then fold in the cooked vegetables; set aside. Cut a deep pocket into the veal breast with a long, narrow knife. Stuff the veal with the bread and vegetable mixture, and season with paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Place onto a roasting pan, and cover loosely with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven for 3 1/2 hours, then remove the foil, baste with pan drippings, and continue cooking 30 minutes more. When done, tent with aluminum foil, and allow the veal breast to rest for 15 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This is a really old fashioned recipe that is really a Jewish eastern European dish. We serve this for holidays and on the Sabbath. It is really impressive looking and the taste is amazing. My family loves this. Once you get the hang of it it's really easy to make.
