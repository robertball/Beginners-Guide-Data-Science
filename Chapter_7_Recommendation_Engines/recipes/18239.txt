Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds potatoes
1/2 cup vinegar, boiling
4 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup heavy cream
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped onion
2 teaspoons dry mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch ground cayenne pepper

Directions:
Peel the potatoes and add to a large pot of boiling salted water. Cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and cube.  Place into a large bowl and set aside.
In a double boiler, bring vinegar to a boil.  Gradually beat in eggs and cook over simmering water until thickened.  Stir in butter and cook 1 minute.  Whisk in cream, parsley, onion, mustard, salt, pepper and cayenne.  Pour over hot potatoes and combine.  Cool, sprinkle with parsley and refrigerate until serving time.
