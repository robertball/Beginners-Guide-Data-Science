Ingredients:
1 Tbs. olive oil, 1 Tbsp butter
3 onions (yellow is best, white is also good), sliced
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1/2 tsp. sugar
Fresh thyme (4-6 sprigs)
Salt and pepper to taste
4 cups (1 quarts) vegetable broth
1 cup sliced mushrooms (baby Portobello)
1/4 bottle red wine
1 Tbsp flour
1 Tbsp. herbes de provence
3 Slices of bread (sprouted wheat, french baguette, etc)
Sliced gruyere or swiss (swiss is more budget friendly and tastes great with this)

Directions:
In a large pot, heat up olive oil  and sliced onions on medium heat. Add garlic, sugar, thyme, salt and pepper.  Cook the onions covered for 30-40 minutes until they caramelize.
Add the red wine (after 30-40 minutes). Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the wine has evaporated, (about 5 minutes).
Sprinkle the onions flour and give them a stir. Turn the heat down to medium low and cook for 5 minutes.
Add the broth and sliced mushrooms, bring the soup back to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes.
Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.
When the soup is done, toast bread slices in the oven with sliced swiss or gruyere until cheese melts. Also consider sprinkling 1-2 Tbsp of shredded cheese on top of the soup as a tasty garnish that will melt into the soup. Enjoy!

Delicious vegetarian spin on a traditional french onion soup - first made this on a hot summer night in the south while missing the warm savory soups of the winter.
