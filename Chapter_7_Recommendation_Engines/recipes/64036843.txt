Ingredients:
4 teaspoons curry powder
4 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon kosher or coarse salt
2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more olive oil for oiling the baking sheet
3 1/2 to 4 pounds chicken parts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425F.  Place a rack in the lower third of the oven.  SPray a large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or lightly oil it with olive oil.
Combine the curry powder, chili powder, cumin, allspice, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl.
Using your hands, rub the chicken pieces with the olive oil. Coat each piece with the dry rub.
Arrange the chicken pieces on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer skin side up with at least 1/2 inch between each piece.
Bake the chicken until fully cooked and the juices run clear when you cut into ta piece, 35 to 50 minutes, depending on the size and thickness of the pieces.  If the skin need a bit more crisping, place the chicken under the broiler for a few minutes.  And you should let the chicken sit for at least 5 minutes before serving so the juices can regroup back into the meat.  Serve the chicken hot, warm or cold
