Ingredients:
4 leeks (or 8 green onions plus 1 small white onion)
2 heads fresh broccoli
1 tbsp butter
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper
1/4 tsp ground coriander
1 litre (46oz) of low sodium chicken stock (1 carton)
1 can condensed skim milk

Directions:
1. Wash the leeks, making sure to remove sand from between layers. Chop both white and green sections coarsely. (If using green onions, do same. Also chop white onion coarsely).
2. In a large pot melt butter over medium heat. Add leeks and cook until translucent (about 5 minutes. Add salt, pepper, and coriander.
3. Chop broccoli heads, including stems. Reserve about 1/4 cup  of small florets. Add rest of broccoli to onions and cook for another 5 minutes.
4. Add chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes (until broccoli is very tender).
5. Blend soup using a submersion or regular blender until is is very well blended. (If using a regular blender you may want to wait for the soup to cool first, as hot liquids can explode out of a regular blender).
6. Return blended soup to heat and add reserved florets. Bring slowly to a boil, stirring frequently, then reduce heat and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes until florets are cooked.
Remove from heat and keep warm until serving time.
7. Before serving stir in can of condensed skim milk. Serve and enjoy.
