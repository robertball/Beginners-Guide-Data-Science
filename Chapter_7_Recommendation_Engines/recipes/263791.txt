Ingredients:
1 cup crumbled Cotija cheese
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup Mexican crema
1/4 cup Korean red chili pepper paste (gochujang)
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons cooking oil
4 ears corn
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 tablespoons melted butter
4 lime wedges

Directions:
Mix Cotija cheese, mayonnaise, crema, chili pepper paste, cilantro, and garlic in a large bowl. Cover and chill in the refrigerator.
Carefully peel back the husks of each ear of corn 3/4 of the way. Remove as much silk as you can without pulling the husks off. Pull the husks back up.
Heat cooking oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add ears of corn, rotating when sides are charred, about every 5 minutes. Sprinkle each side under the husks with salt and pepper.
Mix melted butter into the chilled cheese mixture. Peel corn husks back without detaching. Use a spoon to coat the corn with the cheese mixture on all sides. Serve with lime wedges.

This is a fusion between Mexican street corn and Korean gochujang (red pepper paste). You can skip the gochujang for ancho chili powder for a more traditional taste.
