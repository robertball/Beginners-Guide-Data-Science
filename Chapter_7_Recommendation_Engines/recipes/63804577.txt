Chicken Cacciatore Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
6 boneless skinnless chicken breasts
28-30 oz Stewed Italian Tomatoes
8 oz can Tomato Paste
2 Green Peppers
1 tsp dried Basil
1 tsp dried Oregano
1 Yellow or Sweet Onion
3 Tbsp. Brown Sugar
6 Tbsp Olive Oil (Divided equally)

Directions:
1. Finely chop onion and green pepper and saute in a large pot (preferably with a thick bottom) over medium heat. Cook until onion is soft but not caramelized.
2. Blend the spices, tomato paste, and stewed tomatoes in a blender until combined. Stop when the mix is a thin sauce but there is still some chunk to the tomatoes.(Approximately 20 seconds of pulse)
3. Add the tomato mixture to the onions and green peppers and add the brown sugar. Cover and cook over the lowest heat for 60 minutes. Don't fall into the trap of thinking this is like making Spaghetti Sauce. Cacciatore is thinner and has more vegetable chunks in it.
4. At the 45 minute mark, coat chicken breasts in flower and pan fry in 3 Tbsp of olive oil. Brown on both sides for 5-7 minutes each over medium high heat.
5. Add the sauce to the frying pan and continue cooking uncovered for 30 minutes. Serve immediately over rice.
