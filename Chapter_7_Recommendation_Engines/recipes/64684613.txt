Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon Italian Seasoning
3/4 Teaspoon Red Pepper
24 oz Jar of Marinara Sauce (no preservatives)
1 lb Ground Turkey or Beef
2 Teaspoons Oil
1 Small Red Onion, Diced
3 Cloves Garlic, Minced
1 Butternut Squash
Cashew Cheese (made a day ahead)

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees.
Heat Oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Toss in onions and garlic. Cook until garlic is fragrant.
Add the Italian Seasoning, Red Pepper and ground meat.  Cook until ground meat is browned or cooked thoroughly.
Cut the bottom of the squash off to sturdy it and peel with a strong potato peeler. Cut the squash where the round part and neck meet.  Begin cutting squash at the top into round  1/4 inch planks.
Using a 9Ã—9 baking dish, spread a small layer of Marinara sauce evenly on the bottom.
Lay an even layer of Squash planks, doing your best to not overlap.
Scoop on a layer of meat.
Add a layer of sauce on top of the meat and then another layer of Squash Planks.
Scoop on another layer of meat and top off with remaining sauce.
Cook for about an hour or until squash is tender, but still a little firm (use a fork to test after 45 minutes).
Remove Lasagna from the oven,  spread an even layer of cheese on the lasagna, and cook for another 10 minutes.
