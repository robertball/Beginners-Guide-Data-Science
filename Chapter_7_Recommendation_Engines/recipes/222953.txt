Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 shallot, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup dry white wine (optional)
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1/2 tablespoon dried basil
1 pinch ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir shallot and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add red pepper flakes; cook and stir to release flavor, about 1 minute. Stir fire-roasted tomatoes and tomato paste into the shallot mixture. Thin the sauce by stirring white wine into the mixture; cook and stir until sauce becomes thick and bubbly, 4 to 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Add shrimp to the tomato mixture; cook and stir until shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Season with parsley, basil, and black pepper.

Description: 
A thick, spicy sauce of garlic, olive oil, and fire-roasted tomatoes is sauteed with shrimp or your favorite seafood. Legend has it that it was named for Michele Pezza, also known as 'Fra Diablo' (Friar Devil), who helped push Napoleon's forces out of Naples. Serve the sauce over hot pasta, or, my favorite, hot couscous cooked with olive oil and garlic.
