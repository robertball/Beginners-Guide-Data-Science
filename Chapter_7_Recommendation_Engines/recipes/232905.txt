Description: 
I love to have tea parties, and this cold soup is the perfect first course! I make it a day or two in advance so I'm not rushed the day of the event. Serve in small bowls or even punch cups for just a taste so that your guests don't fill up, but have room for the rest of the small servings a tea party is noted for.
