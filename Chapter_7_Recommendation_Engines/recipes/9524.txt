Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
salt to taste
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F (175 degrees C).
Cream together the butter, shortening, sugar and vanilla.
Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt. Add to sugar mixture and mix well, being careful not to over mix.
Drop heaping teaspoonfuls of dough on ungreased cookie sheet and flatten each with the tines of a fork (dip fork into small bowl of water so that dough doesn't stick to fork). Do this once or twice, depending on the size of cookie and fork.
Bake for 13 to 15 minutes. After each pan is removed from oven, carefully place 5 or 6 chocolate chips on top of each cookie while they are still hot. When chocolate is glossy and soft, spread with knife.

Description: 
This recipe has become a cherished family favorite, and it all began in 1965 with my older brother's 2nd grade teacher sharing it with our mother. Melt-in-your-mouth good! At holiday time, add festive sprinkles on top while chocolate is still soft. Enjoy!
