Ingredients:
2 slices bacon
1 TBS room temperature butter
2 slices bread
1/2 C shredded jack and cheddar cheese
2 TBS room temperature guacamole
1 TB crumbled tortilla chips (optional)

Directions:
Cook the bacon until crispy and set aside on paper towels to drain off the excess grease.
Butter one side of each slice of bread, sprinkle half of the cheese onto the unbuttered side of one slice of bread followed by the guacamole, bacon, chips, the remaining cheese and top with the remaining slice of bread with the buttered side up (all butter sides should be facing out).
Place in a skillet and grill until golden brown and the cheese has melted, about 2-3 minutes per side.
Slice the sandwich in half and watch the cheese ooze out...the best part!!
