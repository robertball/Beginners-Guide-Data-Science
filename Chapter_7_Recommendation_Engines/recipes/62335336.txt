Ingredients:
1 30-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup tahini
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons low-salt chicken broth
2 tablespoons lemon juice
3 cloves garlic
12 ounces roasted red pepper (either your own or store-bought)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a blender or food processor and puree until smooth.

Description: 
In this version, I substituted some of the oil that would normally be used with from-scratch chicken stock to reduce the fat and added in some roasted red peppers for flavor. It came out wonderfully, and a tablespoon is only 38 calories with 2 grams of fat and 1 of fiber.
