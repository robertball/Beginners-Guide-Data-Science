Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed and softened
8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 cup chopped cherry tomatoes
3/4 cup chopped boneless ham steak
1/2 cup sliced black olives, drained
1/2 cup marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
3 ounces crumbled feta cheese
3 cloves garlic, pressed
1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning

Directions:
Combine cream cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, cherry tomatoes, ham steak, olives, artichoke hearts, feta cheese, garlic, basil, and Italian seasoning in a bowl and mix well. Pour into a 1 3/4-quart round glass baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.
Pour 1 cup water into the insert of a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Set the metal trivet inside and place baking dish on top. Close and lock the lid. Select manual pressure and set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir and serve immediately.
