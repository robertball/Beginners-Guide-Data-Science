Ingredients:
2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup cold water
2 1/4 pounds seedless green grapes
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 cup sour cream
4 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar and melted butter until well blended. Reserve 1/4 cup of crumb mixture and set aside. Press remaining mixture into a 9 inch deep dish pie pan. Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Allow to cool.
In a saucepan, dissolve cornstarch and 2/3 cup sugar in 1/4 cup cold water. Stir in grapes and bring to boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice. Allow to cool. Spoon filling into the baked and cooled crust.
In a small bowl, combine sour cream, 4 teaspoons sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Mix well and spread over pie. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture.
