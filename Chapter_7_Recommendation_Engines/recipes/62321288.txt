Fabulous Fargozas Recipe

Ingredients:
2 Cups flour
3 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon dried rosemary
1 1/2 cups shredded cheese, either mozzarella, cheddar or Monterey Jack or any combo of.
1/4 cup grated or shredded Parmesan cheese
1 small onion, minced
2 teaspoons fresh crushed or minced garlic, about 4 small cloves
1 egg, beaten
1 cup milk
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 (or 400 if using dark coated muffin pan). Grease or spray muffin tins with cooking spray. You can use paper muffin cups, but it is recommended to bake directly in tin without paper cups. This allows the muffins to develop a nice tender crisp outside. In large bowl mix together the flour, salt, sugar, baking powder and rosemary. Toss into the flour mixture the onion, garlic and cheeses. In separate mixing bowl combine the beaten egg with the melted butter then stir into milk. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour the liquid ingredients into the well. Stir just to moisten, about 12 - 15 full circular strokes that scarp the bottom of the bowel; the batter will look lumpy. Fill greased muffin tins 2/3 full with the batter. Bake for about 25 minutes or until well browned. Cool in pan for 5 minutes then carefully remove. NOTE: A pebbly surface, feathery texture, and medium-coarse grain indicate a good muffin.
