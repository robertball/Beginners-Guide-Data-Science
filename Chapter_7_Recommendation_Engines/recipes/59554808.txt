Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup orange juice
1 pound Bing or other dark, sweet cherries, rinsed and pitted (or use frozen pitted cherries)
1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
1/4 teaspoon cherry extract (or almond extract)
1/4 cup brandy
3 cups vanilla ice cream

Directions:
Whisk together the sugar and cornstarch in a wide saucepan.  Stir in the water and orange juice; bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking until thickened.  Stir in the cherries and orange zest, return to a boil, then reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.  While the cherries are cooking, spoon the ice cream into serving bowls.
Remove the cherries from the heat, and stir in the cherry extract.  Pour in the brandy, and ignite with a long lighter.  Gently shake the pan until the blue flame has extinguished itself.  Spoon the cherries over the bowls of ice cream.

Description: 
This is a great, refreshing dessert especially after a hearty meal.  This does have to be prepared immediately before serving, but does not take a lot of time.  Your guests will enjoy the blue flames when the brandy is ignited!Modified from: Classic Cherries Jubilee
