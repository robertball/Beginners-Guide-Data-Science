Ingredients:
16 oz. Hellman's mayonnaise
10 oz. sour cream (not light)
3 oz. milk
4 oz. crumbled blue cheese ( you can use more if you like.  5 or 6 oz. work if you like a lot of blue cheese)
splash of tobasco or hot sauce
1/8 tsp prepared horseradish (I usually use 1/4 to 1/2 tsp as I like horseradish)
garlic powder - a few shakes

Directions:
Mix together and refrigerate.  Should sit in fridge 1 to 2 hours before serving to let flavors mix.

Description: 
This family recipe comes from a small town restaurant owner who was known for his sauces/dressings.  I made a few tweaks.  It's amazing!
