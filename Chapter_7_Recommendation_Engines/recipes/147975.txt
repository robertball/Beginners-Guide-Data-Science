Ingredients:
1 Reynolds® Handi-Vac™ Vacuum Sealer
1 Reynolds® Handi-Vac™ Vacuum Freezer Bag, Gallon Size
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cut in 1-inch chunks
1/2 cup prepared pesto, divided
1 tablespoon flour
1/2 pound hot cooked linguine
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place chicken in an even layer in Reynolds Handi-Vac Vacuum Freezer Bag.  Pour 1/4 cup pesto over chicken; squeeze freezer bag to coat both sides of chicken.  Arrange chicken in an even layer with food touching the textured layer inside the bag. Seal bag.
Vacuum bag with Vacuum Sealer until bag tightens around chicken.  Freeze immediately.  When ready to cook, defrost completely in refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Shake flour in a large size Reynolds(R) Oven Bag; place in 13x9x2-inch baking pan.  Add remaining pesto; squeeze bag to blend in flour.
Add defrosted chicken mixture to oven bag; arrange evenly in pan.
Close oven bag with nylon tie; cut six 1/2-inch slits in top.
Bake 20 to 23 minutes or until chicken is done.  Stir chicken before serving. Toss linguine with sun-dried tomatoes. Top with pesto chicken and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese before serving.
