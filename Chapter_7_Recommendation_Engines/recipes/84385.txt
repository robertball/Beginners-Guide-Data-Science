Ingredients:
8 medium baking potatoes, peeled and diced
1/2 cup chopped onion
3 cloves garlic, sliced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup sour cream
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1/2 cup milk
12 drops yellow food coloring
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover by 1 inch. Add the onion, garlic, basil, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
Drain the contents of the pot in a colander, then transfer to a large bowl. Add the sour cream, butter, milk and food coloring, and beat with an electric mixer until light. Adjust milk if needed. Do not beat too long, or the potatoes will become stiff and pasty. Taste and adjust salt and pepper before serving.

Description: 
My two young boys would only eat boxed mashed potatoes, until I came up with this recipe. Little do they (and my finicky husband) know they are also eating their archenemy, onions!! This dish is different because you boil the seasoning with the potatoes instead of adding them later, thus a milder flavor. Serve piping hot with butter or homemade gravy although they don't need either. Enjoy!!!
