Ingredients:
1 lemon, halved
1 onion, halved
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 cup Old Bay â„¢ Seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1 pound small red potatoes
1 pound kielbasa sausages, cut into about 2-inch chunks
4 ears corn, husked and halved
1 pound unpeeled large shrimp

Directions:
Combine 3 quarts of water, onion, garlic, seafood seasoning, and salt in a large pot. Squeeze lemon juice from halves, and add both the juice and the lemon halves into the pot. Bring to a boil.
Place potatoes and sausage in the pot, and return to a boil. Simmer, partially covered, until potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes. Add the corn; cook until tender, about 10 minutes longer. Remove pot from heat, and stir in the shrimp; let stand, covered, until shrimp are pink, about 5 minutes. Drain off liquid before serving. It may be reserved for other uses, such as soup stock.

A one-pot meal, this crowd-pleaser is a wonderful weeknight dinner. The corn on the cob and red potatoes are cooked with the shrimp and sausage, making clean-up a snap.
