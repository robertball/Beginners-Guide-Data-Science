Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups soy milk
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons raw sugar
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Combine soy milk and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Mix together flour, sugar, cinnamon, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl, making a well in the center. Pour soy milk mixture into the well in the flour mixture, and mix until well combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
Seriously the best pancakes I have ever eaten in my life, WAY better than any pancake I have ever been served in a restaurant. I don't even have to use syrup with these but I have found it to be even better with syrup! 
No difficult-to-find ingredients, vegan, and super duper yummy to any and all who like cocoa and cinnamon!
