Ingredients:
3 tablespoons peanut oil
1 pound firm tofu, cubed
1  red onion, sliced
1  red bell pepper, sliced
1  green chile pepper, chopped
3 cloves garlic, crushed
â…“ cup hot water
3 tablespoons white vinegar
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

Directions:
Heat peanut oil in a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Toss the tofu into the oil, and cook until browned on all sides. Once browned, toss in onion, bell pepper, chile pepper, and garlic; cook until just tender, about 5 minutes.
In a small bowl, whisk together the hot water, vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, cornstarch, and red pepper flakes. Pour over tofu and vegetables, toss to coat, and simmer 3 to 5 minutes, or until sauce thickens slightly.

Description: 
Firm tofu, bell pepper, and red onion, all quickly stir fried in a sweet and sour sauce. A word of caution - this is VERY spicy! If you like milder dishes, decrease the amount of pepper flakes or omit them altogether.
