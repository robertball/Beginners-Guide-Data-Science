Ingredients:
18egg yolks
2.5 cup white sugar, divided
2 Tbs vanilla
8 cups heavy cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Beat egg yolks, 4 tablespoons white sugar and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl until thick and creamy.
Pour cream into a saucepan and stir over low heat until it almost comes to boil. Remove the cream from heat immediately.  Stir cream into the egg yolk mixture; beat until combined.
Pour cream mixture into the top pan of a double boiler. Stir over simmering water until mixture lightly coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes. Remove mixture from heat immediately and pour into a shallow heat-proof dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool to room temperature.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.
Preheat oven to broil.
In a small bowl combine remaining 2 tablespoons white sugar and brown sugar.  Sift this mixture evenly over custard.  Place dish under broiler until sugar melts, about 2 minutes.  Watch carefully so as not to burn.
Remove from heat and allow to cool.  Refrigerate until custard is set again.
