Ingredients:
1 LARGE PLASTIC CONTAINER W/ LID
8-10 14 OZ CANS CHICKEN OR TURKEY BROTH
1 LARGE BOTTLE OF APPLE JUICE
ENOUGH WATER TO FILL TURKEY CONTAINER
ICE
3-4 ORANGES
6-8 CELERY STALKS
3 ONIONS
1/2 CUP COARSE SALT (KOSHER, SEA, ETC)
1/8 CUP BLACK PEPPER
4 TBSP POULTRY SEASONING
6 STEMS EACH OF FRESH ROSEMARY, TYHME, AND 2 stems of SAGE (REMOVED FROM STEMS)
4 BAY LEAVES
2 STICKS OF BUTTER(SET ASIDE UNTIL BAKING)

Directions:
PLACE YOUR TURKEY (REMOVED FROM PACKAGING)FROZEN IN CONTAINER OVERNIGHT TO 12 HOURS PRIOR TO COOKING.
POUR ALL CHICKEN/TURKEY BROTH AND APPLE JUICE IN WITH THE TURKEY
CUT ORANGES IN HALF AND SQUEEZE JUICE IN AROUND THE BIRD AND DROP ORANGE HALVES IN CONTAINER
CUT THE CELERY AND ONIONS INTO BIG CHUNKY PIECES AND PUT IN
ADD ALL REMAINING INGREDIENTS TO CONTAINER.
I USE A 10 LB BAG OF ICE TO KEEP THE BIRD COLD WHILE IT IS SOAKING.
FILL THE REST OF THE CONTAINER WITH WATER ENOUGH SO THAT THE BIRD IS FULLY COVERED
KEEP ADDING ICE AS NEEDED TO KEEP THE TURKEY AT A SAFE TEMPERATURE FOR OVERNIGHT TO 12 HOURS
WHEN YOU GET READY TO COOK, PLACE THE TURKEY IN A ROASTING BAG AND STUFF IT WITH 2 STICKS OF BUTTER AND THE CELERY, ONIONS AND SEASONINGS FROM THE BRINE (EXCLUDING THE ORANGES)
COOK ACCORDING TO WEIGHT OF TURKEY BUT KEEP IN MIND A BRINED TURKEY COOKS FASTER THAN ONE THAT HASNT BEEN
EAT AND ENJOY!
