1 1/2 pounds lean Ground Chuck or Sirloin
1 1/2 tablespoons BBQ Sauce
1/2 cup minced Onions

Pack into a lightly greased bread pan or form into the classic “meat loaf” shape on a greased cookie sheet.
Cover with foil and back at 350 degrees for 30 to 45 minutes.
Remove from oven, remove foil and drain off the excess grease.
Mix tomato sauce and brown sugar together and pour over the meatloaf.
Place back in the oven to finish baking until done, about 30 minutes depending on the oven.
Allow to cool slightly and slice.
