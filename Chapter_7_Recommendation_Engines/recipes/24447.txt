Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons anise seeds
1/4 cup white sugar for decoration
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt; set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and 1 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time then stir in the vanilla. Gradually mix in the sifted ingredients and anise seeds until well blended. Cover and chill for several hours or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch in thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart onto cookie sheets. Sprinkle the tops with a mixture of the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and cinnamon.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until light brown. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely. Happy Holidays!
