Ingredients:
2 large Pork Chops (with or without bones)
1 tsp Paprika
1/2 tsp Salt
1/2 tsp Pepper
1/2 tsp Chili powder
1 tsp Oregano
2 tbsp Soy sauce
1 Bay leaf
3 cups Chicken, Beef, or Vegetable stock
2-3 cups Water
1 tsp Garlic powder
1/4 cup Flour
3 Potatoes, chopped small
1 Carrot, diced
1 Onion, diced
2 stick Celery, diced
1 cup Broccoli, chopped

Directions:
Put Pork chops and herbs/spices (all ingredients in list before flour) in a pot. Bring to boil, then simmer for 1hr, then cool.
Mix 3/4 cup of liquid with flour. Remove pork chops and separate (should fall apart easily), making sure to remove and discard any bones and fat. Add pork meat back to liquid.
Add vegetables, bring to boil, then reduce to simmer. Stir in flour/liquid mix, then simmer for 1hr.
Remove Bay leaf, then mash gently so potatoes crumble.
Serve fresh, with bread if desired.
