Ingredients:
Crust:
1/4 cup coconut oil
1 egg
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup ground almonds
1 1/4 cups rolled oats
Filling:
1 1/4 cups water
3/4 cup honey, divided
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 plums, pitted and sliced
1 cup ground almonds
3 eggs
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup fresh raspberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Combine 1/4 cup coconut oil, 1 egg, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until well combined. Add 1 cup ground almonds and oats gradually to the mixture; pulse until well combined and a dough ball is formed.
Roll out dough to fit a 9-inch pie dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until edge of crust is golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
Place water, 1/3 cup honey, cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Add plums; simmer over medium-low heat until softened, about 20 minutes.
Combine 1 cup ground almonds, 3 eggs, 1/2 cup coconut oil, and remaining honey in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour over pastry. Place plums and raspberries carefully on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This gluten-free plum and raspberry tart is our new favorite dessert recipe. It's made using an almond shortcrust pastry case that's not only super healthy and nutritious, but the honey adds a sweet flavor to it too. It tastes far too delicious to be good for you, but it really is. Serve with sea buckthorn powder.
