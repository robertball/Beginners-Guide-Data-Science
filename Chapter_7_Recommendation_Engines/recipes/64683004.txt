Description: 
From time to time I cook a pork shoulder and pull the pork to be used with a few different meals. This is a recipe I came up with that may not be a traditional tamale but the ingredients meet the criteria and it is a filling comfort food. There is no reason why you couldn't substitute shreeded chicken or ground beef for the pork.
