Ingredients:
Dough:
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup butter
1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (100 degrees to 110 degrees)
1/3 cup egg substitute
3 tablespoons SPLENDA速 Sugar Blend
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup SPLENDA速 Brown Sugar Blend
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup chopped pecans
3 tablespoons butter, melted
Sauce:
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons 2% reduced fat milk
1/4 cup SPLENDA速 Brown Sugar Blend
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Bring 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan; remove from heat and add 1/3 cup butter, stirring until butter melts. Let stand until mixture cools to at least 110 degrees  (about 10 minutes).
Combine yeast and 1/2 cup warm water in a glass measuring cup; let mixture stand 5 minutes.
Beat egg substitute, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, and salt at medium speed using a heavy-duty stand mixer. Add yeast mixture and butter mixture, beating on low speed until blended. Gradually add flour, beating on low speed until blended.
Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes). Place in a well greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and chill 8 hours or up to 3 days.
Combine SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend and cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside.
Spray  a 12-cup Bundt pan with vegetable cooking spray. Prepare sauce; pour sauce in bottom of prepared pan. Sprinkle with pecans.
Punch dough down and roll into 1-inch balls. Dip each ball into melted butter and into SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend mixture. Place in pan.
Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees ), free from drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F about 10 minutes prior to baking.
Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until done. Cool on a wire rack 5 minutes. Invert onto serving plate. Serve immediately.
Combine butter, milk, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend and cinnamon in a small saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend dissolves. Bring mixture to a boil over medium-high heat; boil 1 minute.
