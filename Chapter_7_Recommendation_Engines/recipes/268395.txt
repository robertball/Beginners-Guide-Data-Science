Ingredients:
9 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup white sugar
3 egg yolks, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 cup raspberry jam
Coconut Topping:
3 egg whites, at room temperature
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/4 cups shredded coconut
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease an 11x7-inch baking pan. Line with parchment paper, leaving an overhang over the edges.
Combine butter and sugar in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract.
Sift flour and baking powder together in a bowl. Fold into the creamed mixture until dough comes together. Press dough into the lined baking pan; prick all over with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 10 minutes. Spread raspberry jam thinly over the cake base.
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until soft peaks form. Add sugar 1 tablespoon at a time, continuing to beat until stiff, glossy peaks form. Gently fold in coconut and vanilla extract. Cover the jam layer with meringue.
Bake until the meringue topping takes on a soft pink or eggshell color, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan for 2 to 3 minutes, then carefully lift out using the parchment paper. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into squares.

Description: 
Louise cake is actually more of a slice than a cake and is always a special treat. The combination of coconut, jam, and meringue on a thin shortbread-style base is simply delicious. Traditionally, Louise cake is made with raspberry jam, but you can use any jam you please. The meringue will crack â€“ this is normal! Serve with freshly whipped cream.
