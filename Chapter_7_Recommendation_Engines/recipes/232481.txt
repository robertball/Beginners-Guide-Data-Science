Ingredients:
2 cups gluten-free all purpose baking flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons shortening
1 cup hot water

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut shortening into flour mixture until mixture resembles corn meal. Stir in hot water, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, until mixture forms into a ball. Knead dough until evenly combined.
Cut dough into 8 pieces; roll each piece into a ball. Press each ball into a flat tortilla-shape.
Heat a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each tortilla in the hot griddle until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

Description: 
My sons really miss flour tortillas since we have gone gluten-free. So I have tinkered with a bunch of wheat flour tortilla recipes to create one that fits our new diet. These aren't your traditional thin tortillas (basically because I press them by hand) but a nice thick and more chewy-style that reminds me of flat bread.
