2. Add 1 tablespoon butter and shallot to empty skillet and cook until softened, about 1 minute. Add wine, broth, and thyme to skillet. Simmer, scraping up any browned bits, until slightly thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Off heat, whisk in any accumulated steak juices and remaining butter and season with salt. Spoon sauce over steaks. Serve.

Description: 
This French dish of pepper-coated steak often results in a scorched skillet, underbrowned meat, loose peppercorns, and a lifeless pan sauce. We were after the real thing: a well-seared crust of pungent, cracked peppercorns complemented by a silky pan sauce.
