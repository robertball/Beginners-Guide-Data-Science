Description: 
This recipe is  packed with flavor and so easy to make  a perfect recipe!  You may be tempted to skip the broiling part of the recipe, but DON’T!  This final step makes the recipe. As for the fresh ginger,  if you don’t have it, it’s OK.  You can use ground ginger  about a teaspoon should do.
