Ingredients:
For the Cake Layer:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
4 eggs, room temperature
16 ounces chocolate syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup creme de menthe liqueur
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
6 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 13x 9-inch baking pan.
Cream 1/2 cup butter with 1 cup white sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing after each until fully incorporated. Stir in the chocolate syrup and vanilla. Mix in the flour and salt; stir until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a tester comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cake cool completely before frosting.
To Make Mint Layer: Combine the confectioners' sugar and 1/2 cup butter; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Pour in the creme de menthe syrup; blend until incorporated. Spread over the top of the cooled cake.
To Make The Chocolate Glaze: Melt the chocolate chips and 6 tablespoons butter together over low heat or in a microwave, stirring every 30 seconds. Let cool slightly, then spread over top of the mint layer. Chill cake for at least 3 hours or overnight. Cut into small blocks to serve. Keep cake refrigerated.
