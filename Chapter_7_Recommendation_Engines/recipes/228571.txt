Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cooked chicken breasts, shredded
1 onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 1/2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup cream cheese
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas
2 cups enchilada sauce
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken, onion, green bell pepper, garlic, cream cheese, and 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese in hot oil until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Stir tomato sauce, chili powder, parsley, oregano, salt, and black pepper into the chicken mixture.
Divide mixture evenly into tortillas, roll the tortillas around the filling, and arrange in a baking dish. Cover with enchilada sauce and remaining 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese topping melts and begins to brown, about 15 minutes.
