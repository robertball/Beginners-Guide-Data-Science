Ingredients:
4 cups bow-tie pasta (farfalle)
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup chicken broth
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir chicken broth, lemon juice, oregano, basil, and garlic into the butter. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to medium-low; cook until thickened to your desired texture, 5 to 7 minutes
Season sauce with salt and pepper. Stir cooked pasta into the butter sauce to coat.
