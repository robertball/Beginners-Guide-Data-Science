Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 carrots, sliced
1 onion, quartered (don’t bother to peel)
1 potato, sliced
1 celery stalk, chopped
2 or 3 cloves garlic (don’t bother to peel)
5 to 10 white mushrooms, halved or sliced
10 to 20 parsley stems or stems with leaves
1 tablespoon soy sauce
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
1. Put the oil in a deep skillet or broad saucepan or casserole over ¬ medium-¬ high heat. When hot, add the carrots, onion, potato, celery, garlic, and mushrooms. Cook without stirring for about 5 minutes, then stir once or twice and cook until the vegetables begin to brown. (If you have more time, brown them well, stirring only infrequently.)
2. Add the parsley, 6 cups water, the soy sauce, and some pepper. Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat so the mixture simmers steadily but gently. Cook for about 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are very tender. (Longer is better if you have the time.)
3. Strain, then taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more soy sauce or a bit of salt, before using or storing.
