Ingredients:
1 lb. ground pork breakfast sausage
1/2 lb. hot Italian sausage
1 stick butter, divided (plus more for buttering the pan)
2 c. chopped celery
2 c. chopped onion
2 cloves chopped garlic
1 (12 ounce) package herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing mix
2 apples - peeled, cored and cubed
1 cup chicken broth
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place ground pork breakfast sausage & Italian sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside.
Melt 2 Tbls. butter in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Stir in celery, onion and garlic. Cook and stir until tender. Add apples and cook additional 2 minutes. Remove from heat, giving it time to cool slightly before adding the egg.
In a separate, small saucepan, combine the rest of the stick of butter and chicken broth just until butter melts.
In a large bowl, pour in stuffing mix. Add sausage, onion/celery mixture and beaten egg; stir well. Add broth/butter mixture, stir well and let sit 8 minutes to let the liquid absorb. Add more chicken broth, if necessary
Transfer mixture to a buttered baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until lightly browned.
