Ingredients:
1 tablespoon beef tallow
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 onion, sliced
2 cups shredded leftover cooked pot roast
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened and cubed
1 cup beef broth
1/2 cup sour cream, or more to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
5 slices smoked Gouda cheese
1 pinch salt to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat tallow in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate. Add onion to the skillet and cook until charred, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Place leftover pot roast in the bottom of a baking dish. Top with mushrooms and onions.
Combine cream cheese, broth, sour cream, garlic, and onion powder in the jar of an immersion blender; puree until smooth. Pour over meat, mushrooms, and onions. Place Gouda cheese slices on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and cheese is melted and golden, about 30 minutes.
