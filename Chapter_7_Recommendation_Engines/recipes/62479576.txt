Ingredients:
9 (1-ounce) frozen mini-bagels, thawed
butter-flavored vegetable cooking spray
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper

Directions:
Cut each bagel crosswise into 4 slices. Place slices, cut sides up, in a single layer on a baking sheet. Lightly coat tops with cooking spray. Combine Italian seasoning and next 3 ingredients; sprinkle evenly over bagels.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 12 minutes or until crisp.

Description: 
This quick snack is a much healthier crunch than potato chips because they're baked and lightly flavored. Very easy to make at home!
