Ingredients:
450g/1lb plain flour, plus extra for dusting
4 tsp baking powder
85g/3oz cold butter, cubed
350ml/12fl oz milk, plus extra for glazing
250g/9oz assorted cheeses, crumbled into small pieces, plus extra grated cheese to sprinkle on top

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Sift the flour and baking powder into a large mixing bowl.
Rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips, until the mixture resembles coarse, fresh breadcrumbs.
Pour in the milk and mix with a wooden spoon to create a soft dough.
Add the crumbled cheese and ensure it is evenly distributed by gently kneading the dough with your hands.
Shape the dough into a rough round and place on a baking tray dusted with flour.
Press down on the top of the ball to flatten it slightly, then brush it with a little milk to glaze.
Grate some extra cheese over the top, then score a deep cross into the dough with a sharp knife to allow it to break into individual pieces when cooked.
Bake in the preheated oven for around 30 minutes, or until the cheese topping looks golden-brown and crisp.
Serve warm with your favourite chutney or pickle.
