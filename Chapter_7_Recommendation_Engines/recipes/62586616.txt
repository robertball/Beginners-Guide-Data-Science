Ingredients:
1/2 onion
1 16 oz bag of spinach
pinch of nutmeg
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 Parmesan cheese
4 eggs, cooked the way you like
2 English Muffins split and toasted

Directions:
sweat onion in butter with a bit of salt and pepper until soft. Add spinach and cook until wilted. When wilted, add nutmeg, stir, then add about 1/2 cup heavy cream (maybe can be done with milk, but will need to cook down considerably-perhaps before adding to greens) and cook until begins to thicken. Add Parmesan cheese. Taste for salt.
Place on top of toast and top with egg cooked to choice (I like over medium)
makes 4 very hearty servings
