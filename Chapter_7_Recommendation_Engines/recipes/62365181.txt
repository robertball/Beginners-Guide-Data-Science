Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds Chicken Breast meat, 1 inch cubes
4 cups Buttermilk, divided
1 cup soy sauce, divided
3 cups rice flour
1 half pint Sweet and Sour Jam(See Footnotes)
Frying pan and oil
4 -5 cups of Cooked Rice

Directions:
On a clean cutting board, cube chicken into 1 inch or smaller pieces.
Place chicken in a 1 gallon ziploc bag or dish with 2 cups of butter milk and 1/2 cup of soy sauce. Stir and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours or overnight.
Remove from refrigerator. Drain chicken from liquid mixture and discard liquid.
In one small dish place 2 cups of buttermilk with 1/2 cup of soy sauce. In another small dish place rice flour.
Heat oil in a pan for frying. around 350-425 degrees on the stove or in a "Fry Daddy" fryer. Let heat while you prepare the chicken to fry.
Take chicken, dredge into flour, coat well, then dip in liquid mixture and then back into rice flour. Coating completely.
Note: I do this an additional round due to the rice flour being so thin and fine. So for me, it's flour, liquid, flour, liquid, flour.
Fry chicken until nice and golden brown, or until the chicken floats to the top of the grease.
Spoon out of oil onto a toweled plate to drain off excess oil. Then transfer to a large bowl.
Heat Sweet and Sour Jam in a small sauce pan just until warm thoroughly through. Add to Chicken and toss thoroughly. Serve over rice. YUMMY!!!!
