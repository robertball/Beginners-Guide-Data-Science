Ingredients:
beef broth - 4 cups
petite diced tomatoes - 1 28 oz can (undrained)
red kidney beans - 1 16 oz can (rinsed and drained)
frozen mixed vegetables - 1 2lb bag
frozen broccoli cuts - 1 1lb bag
red skin potatoes - 4 medium, cubed
yellow onion - 1 medium, diced
minced garlic - 2 tablespoons
lean ground turkey - 1 lb
onion powder - 1 teaspoon
garlic powder - 1 teaspoon
1 bay leaf
salt and pepper to taste
1 bay leaf

Directions:
In a large stock pot, combine broth, tomatoes, drained kidney beans, potatoes, frozen vegetables, garlic and onion powder, and bay leaf.  In a large skillet, brown turkey with garlic and onion.  When no pink is left and onions are translucent, drain the fat of the turkey and add to soup.   Allow to simmer for 30 minutes to an hour.  Remove bay leaf before serving.  If freezing, make as directed without frozen vegetables, remove from heat, and stir in frozen vegetables to cool soup down quickly before putting into single serving containers and into the freezer.  Add salt and pepper just before serving.
