Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons culinary-grade lavender buds, roughly chopped
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, cubed
1 large egg, slightly beaten
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1/2 cup buttermilk
Icing:
1 cup loosely packed confectioners' sugar
5 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon culinary-grade lavender buds, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup cupcake tin with cupcake liners.
Whisk flour, chopped lavender, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Set aside.
Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in egg, lemon juice, and lemon zest.
Beat 1/3 cup of flour mixture into lemon mixture until just combined. Beat in 1/4 cup buttermilk, followed by another 1/3 cup flour mixture; add remaining buttermilk and flour mixture and stir to combine.
Spoon batter into the cupcake liners, filling each 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 16 to 18 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before transferring cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely.
Stir confectioners' sugar and lemon juice together in a bowl until smooth. Stir in lemon zest. Drizzle over cooled cupcakes and garnish with lavender.

Description: 
Delicious lemon cupcakes with a hint of lavender and creamy lemon frosting. These are not your Mama's cupcakes. Updated with a light, moist texture and just an 'ever-so-subtle' Provencal taste. My husband did not know there was lavender in them. He loved my 'secret' ingredient. Try to eat just one... I dare you!
