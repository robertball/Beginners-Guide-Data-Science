Easy Spinach Manicotti Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 package manicotti noodles
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
16 oz. container cottage cheese
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
10 oz. package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and excess moisture squeezed out
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp salt
1 26-oz can/jar of tomato pasta sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Cook the manicotti noodles in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, just to moisten them up a bit (they should still be very firm).  Rinse with cool water so you can handle the noodles.
Mix together 1-1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, cottage cheese, parmesan cheese, spinach and salt and pepper until combined thoroughly.  Put mixture into a large zipper storage bag.
In a large baking dish, pour about 1/3 of the jar of pasta sauce in the bottom of the dish.
Cut one corner off the zipper storage bag, just smaller than the diameter of the manicotti noodles; you'll use this like a pastry bag.
Fill each manicotti noodle with cheese/spinach mixture by squeezing the zipper bag and piping the cheese mixture loosely into each noodle.  Do not pack the mixture in.  Arrange filled noodles in a single layer in the baking dish.
Cover noodles with remaining pasta sauce and remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese.
Cover baking dish with aluminum foil tightly and bake in a 350-degree oven for about an hour.  Sauce should have thickened and noodles should be tender.

Description: 
This manicotti recipe is my husband's favorite meal that I make.  The bonus is that it's sinfully easy to put together but looks like an all-day effort!  You can do all the prep a day or two ahead and just keep the noodles in the refrigerator until you're ready to bake, too.
