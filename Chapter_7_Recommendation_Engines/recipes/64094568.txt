Ingredients:
1/2 recipe French bread dough
1 lb ground beef
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
2 cups grated mozzarella cheese
1 tsp Italian herb seasoning
1 Tbsp parsley, fresh chopped
4 cups Italian tomato sauce

Directions:
Prepare French bread dough.  Roll 1/2 of recipe into a 14 x 24 inch rectangle.
Brown ground beef, stir in remaining ingredients (not tomato sauce).  Spoon filling evenly onto dough, slightly pressing filling into dough.  Roll dough lengthwise like a jelly roll, and cut into 24 one inch slices.  Place on 2 greased cookie sheets.
Cover roll-ups and let sit for 10 minutes.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool and serve with tomato sauce.
