Ingredients:
2/3 cup water
1/3 cup quinoa
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup chopped kale
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon water, or as needed

Directions:
Bring 2/3 cup water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; saute kale and garlic in the hot oil until kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Stir quinoa into kale mixture and add sesame oil; cook until flavors blend, about 5 more minutes. Add 1 tablespoon water to mixture to keep from sticking.

Description: 
Great for a quick-but-healthy side dish. White cooking wine can be used instead of 1 tablespoon water at the end of cooking.
