Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups softened butter
3/4 cup sugar
1 T lemon extract
2 3/4 cup flour
1 1/2 cups almonds or pecans (I prefer pecans)chopped finely
1 14 oz. pkg Hershey Kisses
Powdered sugar
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 T shortening

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl beat butter, sugar and lemon extract until light and fluffy. Add flour and chopped nuts to butter mixture, beating at low speed until combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Heat oven to 375', while dough is chilling, unwrap kisses. Shape chilled dough into balls about the size of a large walnut (approx. 1 T of dough). Depress center with kiss and mold dough around, covering completely. Roll in hands to reform into a ball and place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 8-10 mins. or until set and bottom edges are lightly brown. Cool for 1 min on sheet before removing to cooling rack. Once fully cooled, lightly dust with powdered sugar. Melt chocolate chips and shortening in microwave in 15 sec increments, stirring after each heating, until smooth. Drizzle chocolate lightly over each cookie.

I found this in a magazine about 12 yrs ago. It's a bit time consuming but was always a huge hit at school or Boy Scout functions.
