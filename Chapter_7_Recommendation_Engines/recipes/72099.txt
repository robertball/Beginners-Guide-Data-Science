Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon superfine sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 egg white, beaten
3 tablespoons mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter or margarine and brown sugar until smooth. Mix in 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, baking powder, egg, and vanilla. Stir in flour by hand using a wooden spoon, as the dough will be stiff.
Roll out tablespoon sized pieces of dough into 6 inch long ropes. Curl up one end slightly to make the head, then curl the rest of the rope towards the head in a spiral shape to make the snail shell. Place cookies 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Brush cookies with egg white. Mix together the remaining cinnamon and superfine sugar in a small cup. Sprinkle this over the snails. Use chocolate chips to make eyes on the heads.
Bake cookies for 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bottoms are lightly browned. Let cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
