Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup Arborio rice
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
33 fluid ounces vanilla-flavored soy milk
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
2 cinnamon sticks
2 whole cloves
1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring water, rice, and grapeseed oil to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes; fluff with a fork.
Whisk soy milk, brown sugar, and salt together in a large bowl.
Pour rice into a casserole dish; pour soy milk mixture on top. Add cinnamon sticks, cloves, and vanilla. Cover.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove cinnamon sticks and cloves. Dust with ground cinnamon.
