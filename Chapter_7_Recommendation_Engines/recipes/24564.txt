Ingredients:
2 1/4 ounces pearl sago
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon baking soda
5/8 cup dark brown sugar
2 cups fresh bread crumbs
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup dried currants
1/2 cup chopped dates
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine sago and milk; cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
Grease a 6 cup pudding basin.
In a large bowl, stir together sago mixture and baking soda until soda is dissolved.  Stir in brown sugar, bread crumbs, raisins, currants, dates, eggs and butter until well combined.  Spoon into prepared basin.  Place a piece of waxed or parchment paper over the top of the basin and secure the lid.
Place the basin on a trivet or dish in a large pot and fill the pot with boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the basin.  Bring the water to a boil again, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer 3 1/2 to 4 hours, topping off water as necessary, until pudding is firm.

Description: 
Sago is a starch, very similar to tapioca, that is extracted from palm trees.  You can substitute tapioca in this recipe, if you don't have sago on hand.  Serve with brandy sauce or custard.
