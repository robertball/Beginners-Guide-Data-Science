Ingredients:
1/2 lb spinach linguine pasta
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons fish sauce
1 teaspoon of fragrant chili paste
(or a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes)
2 cloves garlic, diced or pressed
1/2 red or orange bell pepper
12 oil-cured black olives, pitted, halved
1 tablespoon capers
dried oregano, to taste
black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Boil a large pot of generously salted water.  Cook al dente according to package directions.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large pan over medium low heat.  Add fish oil, chili paste and lastly garlic and cook until garlic softens.
Add bell pepper, olives, capers and oregano.  Continue to cook until garlic is slightly browned. Do not overcook.
Drain pasta and add to sauce, stirring vigorously until well coated and combined.
Top with black pepper to taste.

Description: 
A delicious twist on a quick and easy italian classic that substitutes fish oil for finicky anchovy fillets. Serve with a generous green salad -- I like something with strawberries or asian pears -- and a glass of white wine.  Make it a full meal by topping with a dry-spiced chicken breast (I like a hint of fish oil and garlic spice blends to make a nice rub.)
