Flatten chicken breast with mallet to 1/4 inch or less. Dredge in flour mixture with salt and pepper. Heat butter on medium-high. Add sage and garlic. Cook garlic for 1 minute, then remove from pan. Add breast fillets, brown on each side for 1 to 2 minutes. When all are browned, pour in wine, cover and simmer on low for 15 to 20 minutes.
Move breast to heated platter and reduce sauce on high if desired. Pour over chicken. Sauteed mushroom may also be added before wine. Excellent served with wild rice.
