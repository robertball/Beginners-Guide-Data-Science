Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup water
6 tablespoons light corn syrup
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 cup pecans
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup crumbled, cooked maple bacon
1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Bring sugar, water, corn syrup, and maple syrup to a boil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. Heat to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball.
Stir pecans and vanilla into syrup mixture until mixture begins to turn brown; add bacon. Cook until bacon mixture turns light brown, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir baking soda into bacon mixture. Pour brittle out onto a sheet of parchment paper set on a heat-proof surface and cool brittle to room temperature before breaking into pieces, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
I adapted this recipe one night after having seen a peanut-bacon brittle on TV. It is sooooo good. I have trouble waiting for this stuff to cool before eating!
