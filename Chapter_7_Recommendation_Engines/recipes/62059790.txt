Ingredients:
2 salmon filets
1 sm zuchini
1 sm yellow squash
1/2 pound mushrooms
1/2 medium onion
2 roma tomatos
2 tbs butter
garlic salt
Lemon Garlic sauce - Lighthouse brand
Pasta, cooked

Directions:
Marinate filets in about 1/4 cup Lemon-garlic sauce 30 minutes to 2 hours.
While those are marinating, cut up all the vegetables. I like to make small, uniform sticks as it looks so much nicer in the finished dish.
Note - I have my own method of cooking pasta so I start the water (salted and with olive oil to prevent sticking) boiling for pasta now. I wait until it is boiling, add pasta, turn off heat and cover tightly. It is done in 10 minutes, but will hold beautifully until everything else is done.
In small non-stick pan place salmon, skin side down. Pour a little marinade over the top. Cover tighly and cook over medium heat.
Melt butter in non-stick skillet. Add onions, mushrooms and garlic salt. I use approximately 1-2 ts - your tastes may vary. Stir fry over high heat.
When onions and mushrooms begin to get soft, add rest of vegetables. Turn heat down a little and continue to stir fry.  Cover veggies until cooked. Check and stir to prevent sticking.
Place pasta in center of plate, top with veggies. Remove skin from salmon and place filet on top of veggies. Pour any sauce from fish pan over the top. Garnish.
Note - you can use lots of other combinations of veggies, depending on your preferences.  I like to add baby corn or bell peppers if they are handy.

Northwest salmon and mixed vegetables on a bed of pasta. Quick and simple fare, yet elegant enough for company. Add some warm fresh bread, and a small salad if you wish.
