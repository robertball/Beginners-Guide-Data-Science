Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 (16 ounce) package fusilli pasta
2 pounds extra lean ground beef
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 (24 ounce) jar mild salsa
1 (8 ounce) bottle ranch dressing
1 1/2 red bell peppers, chopped
6 green onions, chopped
3/4 cup chopped pickled jalapeno peppers
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives (optional)
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with water; pour in the olive oil and salt. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the fusilli, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Mix in taco seasoning mix, remove from heat, and cool completely.
Combine salsa, ranch dressing, bell peppers, green onions, jalapenos, and black olives in a medium bowl. Toss together the cooked pasta, cooled beef mixture, Cheddar cheese, and dressing mixture in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
I first made this for my husband to take for a guy's skiing weekend.  He didn't want a 'girlie' pasta salad, so this one has taco beef and cheese.  Very hearty, and a big hit with all the guys.  I have since brought it to a family reunion....now they request it every year!
