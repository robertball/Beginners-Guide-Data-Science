Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into 2-inch cubes
3 tablespoons minced garlic
1 ½ tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes
2 pinches black pepper
3 pinches salt
2 large potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
1 large onion, cut into eighths
3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
⅓ cup soy sauce
⅓ cup water

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add chicken, and cook until it begins to brown on the edges, but is still pink in the center, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt. Cook and stir until the garlic has begun to soften, and the chicken has become firm, about 3 minutes.
Stir in potatoes, carrots, and onion. Whisk hot pepper paste into soy sauce until dissolved, then pour into saucepan along with the water. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, and the potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes. Stir occasionally.
