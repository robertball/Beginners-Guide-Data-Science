Description: 
Makes excellent banana, coconut, or chocolate cream pie. This was given to me by a friend many years ago. For banana slice a layer of bananas in pie pan then fill half full with filling add more bananas then rest of filling. For chocolate, add 2 squares semi-sweet chocolate to hot milk and an additional 1/2 cup sugar. Good just to eat as pudding.
