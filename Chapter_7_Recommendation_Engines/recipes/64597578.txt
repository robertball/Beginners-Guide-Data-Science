Ingredients:
8 boneless skinless chicken thighs 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 tsp pepper 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 3 Tbsp olive oil 1 cup chicken stock 4 Tbsp capers, drained 3 Tbsp lemon juice

Directions:
Heat oven to 350Â°. Pound chicken with a meat mallet to 1/2-in. thickness; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place flour in a shallow bowl. Dip chicken in flour to coat both sides; shake off excess.
In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Brown chicken in batches, adding additional oil as needed. Transfer chicken to an ungreased 13x9-in. baking dish.
Add stock, capers and lemon juice to pan, stirring to loosen browned bits from pan. Whisk in butter, 1 Tbsp at a time, until creamy. Pour sauce over chicken. Bake 5-10 minutes or until no longer pink.
