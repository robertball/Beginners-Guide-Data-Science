Description: 
This is one of the easiest side dishes I've found. I don't even like most tomatoes, but I love these sweet little cherry tomatoes. This is the basic recipe, but you can also add slivered garlic to the roasting pan and/or chopped fresh basil and Parmesan cheese at the end. Very good with pasta!
