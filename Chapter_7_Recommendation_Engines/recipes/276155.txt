Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (16 ounce) package chicken tenders
1 teaspoon Greek seasoning, or to taste
3/4 cup apple juice
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Spray a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat.
Season chicken tenders with Greek seasoning and add to hot skillet. Cook chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a plate and cover to keep warm.
Pour apple juice and lemon juice into the hot skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned pieces off the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Cook sauce, stirring occasionally, until apple juice reduces and sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Add chicken to skillet and stir until evenly coated with sauce.
