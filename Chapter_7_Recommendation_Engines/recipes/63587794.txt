Ingredients:
1 prepared pastry dough for a double crust pie
3 cups blackberries
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
3 Tbs. cornstarch
1/2 cup half and half
3 Tbs. butter, melted
2 Tbs. sugar

Directions:
Place the blackberries, sugar, and water in a pan on the stove and bring to a boil.  Mix the cornstarch and the half and half until smooth and pour into the blackberries,  bring back to a boil and then turn off heat.   The mixture should be just starting to tighten, but don't let it sit and boil or it will tighten too much.   It should be sort of soupy when place it in the cobbler.
COOKING TIP:  Cobblers should have a lot of liquid to them before you start baking, because the two crusts will absorb and thicken that liquid.  If they do not have sufficient liquid, they will be too dry once you are finished baking them.  A dry cobbler is not a good cobbler.
