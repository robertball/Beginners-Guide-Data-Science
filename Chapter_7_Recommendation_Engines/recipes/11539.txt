Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups rolled oats
1 cup candy-coated milk chocolate pieces
20 lollipop sticks

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together white sugar, brown sugar, and butter. Add vanilla and eggs; mix well. Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into butter mixture. Finally, mix in rolled oats. Refrigerate dough for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll dough into 2 inch balls. Place balls on a cookie sheet, Press down slightly, and insert a lollypop stick into each one. These will spread a bit so don 't put too many to a pan. Bake 8 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool 1 minute then arrange small candies into a happy face design. The cookies will be chewy, but firm.
