Ingredients:
1 12 ounce package large shell pasta prepared and set aside in cold water
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound ground beef
3 links sweet Italian sausage with casings removed
1 small onion roughly diced
4 garlic cloves roughly chopped
1 small bunch basil(about 1/3 cup packed)
1 small bunch Italian parsley
1 1/2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning
3 big pinches of kosher salt
1 16 ounce container lowfat cottage cheese
16 ounces shredded mozarella divided
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 cup grated parmesan
1 egg beaten
fresh ground pepper
36 ounces marinara sauce (use your favorite)

Directions:
Brown beef and sausage in a pan with the olive oil and drain the fat off.  Add onion, garlic, basil and parsley to a food processor and pulse till minced.  Add to browned meat along with the Italian seasoning and salt.  Sautee about 5 mins.  Use a potato masher to crumble the mixture to a fine consistency and let cool slightly.  Add the parmesan and egg and mix well.  Blend the cottage cheese, 4 ounces mozarella, nutmeg and white pepper in the food processor till creamy.  Spread 1 cup marinara over the bottom of a 9x13 glass pan.  Fill each shell with the meat mixture then top with a big spoonful of the cottage cheese and place in the pan.  Repeat till the pan is full.  (You won't use all the shells).  Spoon a little sauce over each shell and top with 8 ounces of mozarella.  Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Remove cover and spoon remaining sauce over the shells and top with the last 4 ounces of mozarella.  Bake uncovered for 15 mins.
