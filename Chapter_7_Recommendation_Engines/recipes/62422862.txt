Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 extra large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cup all purpose flour
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 - 5 oz Hershey Bars or 1 package of 6- 1.55 oz bars -OR- 1 12 oz bag of mini chocolate chips.
1 to 1 1/2 cups Marshmallow Fluff Â®

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Line Two, 8 inch square baking pans with foil or parchment paper.  I prefer parchment because you don't have to grease it.  Grease the foil well if using that.
Cream together butter and sugars until light and fluffy.
Beat in egg and vanilla.
Add in flour, graham cracker crumbs, salt and baking powder.  Mix well.
Divide the dough into two equal portions.  Press one half into the bottom of one pan and put in the freezer.  Press dough in the other pan and continue with the recipe.
Place the Hershey Bars on top of the graham cracker layer. You may have to break up the 1.55 oz. bars to fit.
Spread the Fluff over the Hershey bar layer.  It helps to grease your spoon first.
Remove the pan from the freezer and lift out the hardened crust. Peel off Parchment paper carefully and place the smooth side up on top of the fluff layer.  Press into position gently but press down until firm and compact as to remove air pockets.
Place on a foil lined cookie sheet in case it spills over. Bake for approximately 40 minutes or lightly browned.
Cool completely before cutting.
Store covered and in a cool place.
