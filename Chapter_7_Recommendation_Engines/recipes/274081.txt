Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 whole cloves
1 (1 inch) piece cinnamon stick
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 pinches fennel seeds
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
3/4 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon curry powder (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 pinch salt to taste
2 cups water
1 cup red lentils
1 fresh curry leaves, or more to taste (optional)
1 pinch ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep pan over medium heat. Cook and stir cloves, cinnamon, bay leaf, cumin seeds, and fennel seeds in the hot oil for 15 seconds. Stir in garlic and cook until golden, about 1 minute. Add onion and cook until light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in garam masala, curry powder, turmeric, and salt.
Pour water and lentils into the pan and cover with a lid. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and cook until lentils are tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Season with curry leaves and pepper; remove from heat.
