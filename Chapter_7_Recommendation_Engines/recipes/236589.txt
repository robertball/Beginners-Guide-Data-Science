Ingredients:
2 cups elbow macaroni
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 pound lean ground beef
1/3 cup chopped onion
1 1/2 cups frozen corn
1 (6.5 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 cup grated Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot oil until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add corn, tomato sauce, ketchup, water, chili powder, sugar, and seasoned salt to the beef mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.
Stir macaroni into beef mixture; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese; remove from heat and let stand until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes.
