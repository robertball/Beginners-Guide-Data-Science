Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) salmon fillets
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 teaspoons canola oil
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
4 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
4 teaspoons brown sugar

Directions:
Sprinkle both sides of fillets with salt and pepper. In a large nonstick skillet, cook salmon in oil over medium heat for 10-15 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork, turning once. Remove and keep warm. Combine the water, vinegar, lemon juice and brown sugar; pour into skillet. Bring to a boil; cook until liquid is reduced to about 1/3 cup. Serve over salmon.
