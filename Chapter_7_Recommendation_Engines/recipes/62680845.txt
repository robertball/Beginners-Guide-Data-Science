Ingredients:
1 ½ lb. 	bulk Italian pork sausage
5 c.	frozen country-style shredded hash-brown
potatoes (from 30-oz. pkg.)
½ c.	sliced green onions
2 (4.5-oz) jar	sliced mushrooms, drained
1 (2 1/4-oz,) can	sliced ripe olives, drained
1 tbsp.	chopped fresh basil
12 oz. (3 c.)	shredded colby-Monterey Jack cheese
blend
8	eggs
1 ½ c.	milk
½ tsp.	salt
TOPPING
1 tbsp.	Olive or vegetable oil
1	garlic clove, minced
6	Italian plum tomatoes, chopped (2c.)
¼ tsp.	salt
2 tbsp.	chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Spray 13X12 inch glass baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.  Cook sausage in large skillet over medium-high heat until no longer pink, stirring occasionally.  Remove sausage from skillet; drain on paper towels.
In large bowl, combine potatoes, onions, mushrooms, olives, 1 tbsp. basil and 2 c. of the cheese.  Add sausage; mix lightly.  Spoon evenly into sprayed baking dish.,  Sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Beat eggs in same large bowl.  Add milk and ½ tsp. salt; beat well.  Pour over potato mixture.  Spray sheet of foil with nonstick cooking spray.  Cover baking dish with foil; refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
To serve, heat oven to 350* F.  Bake, covered, for 45 minutes.  Uncover; bake an additional 20-25 minutes or until center is set.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
I sometimes use fresh mushrooms and sauté them at the end of cooking the sausage.  This is a favorite at our tailgate breakfast.
