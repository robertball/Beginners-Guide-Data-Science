Ingredients:
1 pound lean pork shoulder, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons shortening
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
2 cups water
1 (16 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped
2 (7 ounce) cans chopped green chiles (such as OrtegaÂ®)
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon oregano

Directions:
Dredge meat in flour until evenly coated, shaking off excess.
Melt shortening in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add meat and cook until thoroughly browned on all sides, 5 to 6 minutes. Add onion and garlic and cook until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add water, tomatoes, green chiles, salt, and oregano.
Cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, 1 to 2 hours. Remove cover and simmer until green chili sauce reaches desired consistency, 5 to 10 minutes more.
