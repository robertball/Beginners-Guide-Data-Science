Ingredients:
2 teaspoons canola oil
1 pound chicken style seitan
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 large bell pepper, cut in strips
1 large onion, chopped
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks with juice
1 cup pineapple juice
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup cider vinegar
2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken style seitan, and cook until browned, stirring occasionally. Add the bell pepper, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until tender, but still crisp.
Stir in the pineapple juice, brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce and cornstarch. Reduce heat to low; cook and stir until thickened. Mix in the pineapple chunks just before serving.

Description: 
This is a tasty vegetarian version of a Chinese classic. You won't even be able to tell it isn't chicken! Seitan is made from wheat gluten and is very high in protein and low in fat. I recommend using a chicken-style variety.
