Ingredients:
Hollandaise Sauce:
* 2 egg yolks
* 1-1/2 Tbsp water
* 6 Tbsp melted butter
* juice of 1/2 a lemon
Salt, pepper to taste
2-4 large or jumbo eggs
2 quarts of water
2Tbsp white vinegar
1lb baby spinach
1-2 Tbsp olive oil
1-2 cloves garlic, minced finely
Salt and pepper to taste
2-4 slices Canadian bacon
2-4 slices multi grain bread, toasted
Dill for garnish

Directions:
1. Make the saut√©ed spinach. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil. Toss in the minced garlic and cook for a minute until it starts to turn golden. Add the spinach and stir, cooking 3-4 minutes until spinach is wilted. Season with salt and pepper. Set skillet aside.
2. Bring a large pot with the 2 quarts of water and vinegar to a boil.  Gently add eggs, 1 at a time, to pot careful not to break the yolks. Cook 1-2 eggs at a time, 3-5 minutes.  Gently remove to a warm plate with slotted spoon.
3.  In a small Saucepan, whisk 2 egg yolks with water until fully blended and slightly frothy. Place saucepan on burner set to MEDIUM and whisk egg mixture constantly until eggs begin to thicken.  Remove from heat, continuing to whisk and slowly drizzle in melted butter.  Once incorporated, add lemon juice, whisk and return to heat, continuing to stir until sauce becomes thick to desired consistence.  Remove from heat and keep warm.
4.  Assemble dish. Place 1 piece of toast down on a plate, layer with 1 slice of warmed Canadian Bacon, then spinach and poached egg on top.  Drizzle Hollandaise sauce on top and garnish with fresh or dried dill. ENJOY!
