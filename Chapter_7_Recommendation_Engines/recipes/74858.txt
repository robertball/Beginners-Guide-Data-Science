Ingredients:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup apricot preserves
3/4 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon crushed garlic
1/2 cup white wine
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
2 Cornish game hens, halved lengthwise

Directions:
In shallow dish, mix the soy sauce, apricot preserves, ginger, garlic, wine, and sugar. Place the hens in the dish, and coat with the marinade. Cover, and allow to marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Arrange the hen halves in a baking dish. Pour remaining marinade over the hens. Bake uncovered 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, basting frequently with the marinade, until hen juices run clear.

Description: 
These are wonderful to serve at a party. They look beautiful and taste even better. These should be marinated overnight; just place them into the oven before guests arrive and the work is done. Have the butcher cut the birds in half lengthwise for you, down the breast bone.
