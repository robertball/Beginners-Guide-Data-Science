Ingredients:
8 large portobello mushrooms, stems removed
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound ground beef
1 pound chorizo sausage
1/2 onion, diced
4 slices cooked bacon, chopped
1 egg
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon chili powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Scrape the gills out of each mushroom. Brush olive oil over each mushroom (top and bottom) and season with salt and pepper. Arrange mushrooms, gill-side up, on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 7 minutes.
Combine ground beef, chorizo, onion, bacon, egg, garlic, cilantro, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and chili powder in a large bowl just until mixed; shape into 8 patties. Place a patty on top of each mushroom.
Bake in the preheated oven until burgers are fully cooked, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
