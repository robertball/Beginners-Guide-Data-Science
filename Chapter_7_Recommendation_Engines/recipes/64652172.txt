Ingredients:
1 pound milk chocolate (you can either use a premium chocolate or a confectionery coating)
1 pound white confectionery coating
1 cup smooth peanut butter

Directions:
Melt the milk chocolate and white confectionery coating either on top of a double boiler over barely simmering water or very carefully in the microwave (stopping and stirring every 20-30 seconds) until completely melted and smooth; mix very well to combine together.
Add the peanut butter and mix until fully incorporated.
Spoon into small candy cups and allow to dry.
Enjoy!
NOTE: Prep time does not include drying time.
