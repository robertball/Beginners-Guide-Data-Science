Ingredients:
3 to 4 pounds of bone-in chicken pieces (drumsticks, breasts, thighs)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium sweet onion, sliced
8 large garlic cloves, halved
several sprigs fresh thyme
1 cup dry white wine (Sauvignon Blanc is good)
1/3 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
1. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium- high heat. Cook the chicken, skin-side-down, until the skin turns golden brown (about 4 minutes).
2. Combine the onion, garlic and thyme in a 5 to 6-quart slow cooker and season with salt and pepper. Top with chicken, skin-side-up. In a small bowl, whisk together wine and flour until smooth and pour it over the chicken and into the slow cooker. Cover and cook until the chicken is tender- 3 1/2 hours on HIGH or 7 hours on LOW.
3. Serve chicken topped with sauce. Serve over rice, couscous, polenta or potatoes.
