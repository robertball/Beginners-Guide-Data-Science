Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, diced
1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
4 cups chicken broth
2 cups water
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 carrots, chopped
2 large russet potatoes, quartered and thinly sliced
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Season chicken with seasoned salt and pepper.
Heat vegetable oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes.
Add onion to pot and cook until almost translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until slightly browned, about 2 minutes more.
Stir broth, water, celery, carrots, and potatoes into the pot. Cook until carrots and potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and cayenne.
