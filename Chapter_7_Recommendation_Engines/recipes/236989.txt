4 ounces fresh Dungeness crabmeat
1 tablespoon finely diced poblano pepper
1 tablespoon panko bread crumbs
2 teaspoons minced green onion

salt and ground black pepper to taste
⅓ cup mayonnaise

1 pinch paprika, or to taste

Directions:







Submitter: 
Chef John
Description: 
There is nothing exciting about sole. It's cheap, easy to find, has a mild, unremarkable flavor, and that's about it. Which means it's the perfect candidate for jazzing up by stuffing with crab. Serve with asparagus and lemon.
