Description: 
The leaves are changing, garden spiders are out, and your kids are counting down to Halloween!  Cooking-wise, nothing says fall more than the return of hot and hearty soups.  Our bacon + sweet potato soup is the perfect meal to pair with a roast, or as a meal in itself alongside warm, fresh baked bread.

This is also a perfect food for the baby in the household (minus the spices for wee-ones).  This soup is packed with vitamin A, C, niacin, and folate!  Talk about a super-duper food!
