Ingredients:
2 (7 ounce) packages shirataki noodles, drained
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (12 ounce) package tofu, cut into chunks
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons peanut butter
1 tablespoon sriracha hot sauce
2 eggs
1 (4.5 ounce) can mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped cashews, divided
1 cup bean sprouts
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Place shirataki noodles in a bowl of hot water; set aside.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir tofu until lightly browned and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer tofu to a plate, keeping skillet over heat.
Whisk soy sauce lemon juice, sugar, peanut butter, and sriracha sauce together in a small microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until peanut sauce is melted and smooth, about 20 seconds. Stir well.
Cook and stir eggs in the hot skillet until cooked through and scrambled, about 5 minutes. Mix mushrooms and tofu into eggs; add 1/2 of the peanut sauce and mix well.
Drain shirataki noodles and add to egg mixture; pour in the remaining peanut sauce. Sprinkle 1/4 cup cashews into tofu-noodle mixture and mix well. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce thickens, 5 to 7 minutes.
Transfer tofu-noodle mixture to a serving bowl and top with remaining cashews, bean sprouts, and lime wedges.
