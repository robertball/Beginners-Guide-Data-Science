Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons dried rosemary
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the chicken with the rosemary on both sides; cook the chicken in the hot oil until browned evenly, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil into the skillet. Cook and stir the garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, sugar, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes to the skillet; stir. Return the chicken to the skillet; cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes.
Stir the garbanzo beans into the skillet; continue cooking until the beans are heated, 2 to 3 minutes more.

Description: 
Every year on Christmas Eve my Nana makes a traditional Italian dish of baccala and chickpeas. I created this for a quicker and less-expensive version. It's even better the next day!
