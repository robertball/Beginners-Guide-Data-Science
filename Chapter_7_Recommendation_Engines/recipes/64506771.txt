Description: 
Salmon is my favorite kinds of fish. It has a unique flavor, high protein, vitamin B12 and omega fatty acid-- great with this ginger sesame marinade sauce and soaks up all the deep rich flavors before it cooks in the oven. 

A side of Saute green beans lights up a whole meal with a little hint of sesame flavor.
