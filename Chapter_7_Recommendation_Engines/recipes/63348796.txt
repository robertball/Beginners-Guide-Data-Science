Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups powdered/confectioners sugar
2 T + 1/2 tsp nonfat dry milk
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup light corn syrup
2 1/2 T water
2 T butter at room temp
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
orange and yellow food coloring

Directions:
Combine powdered sugar, dry milk, and salt in food process.  Pulse until mixture is well combined.
Combine granulated sugar, corn syrup, and water in a medium pot over medium heat.  Cover and cook 4 minutes. Add butter.  Clip on candy thermometer.  Bring mixture up to 230F (1-2min).  Remove from heat
Add vanilla and dry mix.  Stir with silicone spatula until thoroughly mixed. Pour onto baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Cool 10-15 min or until cool enough to handle.
Divide dough into 3 equal pieces.  Add 2-3 drops of yellow food coloring to one dough piece, kneading until color is throughout.  Add 2-3 drop of orange food coloring to second dough piece and repeat as for yellow.  Leave the last dough piece white.
Roll each dough piece into ~18" roll.  Cut each roll in half, and roll each again into a roll 22" long.
Lay 3 of the rolls side by side orange | yellow | white.  Press them together with your fingers. Cut into 4" pieces. Using a flat object, like a bench scraper, press each piece into a wedge, making the orange side taller and the white side come to a tip.
Using a bench scraper or knife, cut each wedge into candy pieces.  Lay on parchment to dry for 1 hour.  Store in airtight container.  They tend to taste better the next day.
