Ingredients:
Whole chicken
Kosher Salt
Freshly grinded black pepper
Cinnamon
Cup of maple syrup
1 lemon
2 chillis
2 table spoon butter

Directions:
Cut the chicken in halves, sprinkle generous pinch of salt, litlle bit of black pepper and cinnamon powder all over the chicken halves. Put into a baking pan, pour 1 cup of a drinking water in the pan and start roasting (375 F). In the mean time combine a maple syrup with squeezed lemon juice and finely chopped chillis. After 30 minutes take the chicken out, brush it with maple syrup mixture, pour all of the mixture over it and put it back to oven. Once the crust is lightly brown and chicken baked through brush it with the butter and let it bake for another 10-15 minutes. Delicious, juicy, interesting. Great with cous-cous&raisins&peeled almonds as a side dish.

Description: 
Our family eats a chicken every other weekend so sometimes it is challenging to find new ways of roasted chicken. This idea nailed it. Tummies were full and my daughter even asked for second serving - VERY rare.
