Ingredients:
1 lb. Fresh Green Beans, ends pinched off. Use either the whole green bean, or snap in 1/2.
1/2 cup to 1 cup diced onion
1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
Salt
2-3 strips of bacon

Directions:
Fry the bacon, and reserve a tablespoon of grease to quickly stir fry (on high) the above ingredients. Do not overcook beans. They should be crisp.
Or, you can also toss all the ingredients except bacon in a large pot, and boil for about 5 minutes, and drain the mixture. Don't use a colander with very large holes. You'll lose all the goodies. (If you use this method, fry the bacon, and set aside) Add bacon after.
Or, you can try microwaving the beans for a minute, like the cooks at Famous Dave's do.  Then add mixture to cooked onion and bacon with seasonings.
