Ingredients:
2 c. long grain white rice (I actually used extra long grain rice here. Mahatma is my preferred brand.)
2 c. water
1 3/4 c. vegetable stock, organic
1 c. parsley, flat-leaf, chopped
1/2 c. cilantro, chopped
1/4 c. garlic, minced
1/4 c. lime juice, fresh-squeezed
2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
1 tbsp. sea salt, finely ground
2 tsp. black pepper, freshly ground

Directions:
Place the water, stock and rice in the bowl of a rice maker and cook according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
Meanwhile, combine the parsley, cilantro, garlic, lime juice, olive oil, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Toss with a rubber scraper.
Once the rice is cooked, add it to the parsley mixture and toss until the rice is evenly coated. Serve immediately.
