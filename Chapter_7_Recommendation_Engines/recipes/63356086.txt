Ingredients:
Ingredients:
4-4 inch tarts shells, baked and cooled
3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut
1 egg + 1 egg yolk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
1/8 teaspoon coconut extract
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 tablespoon cornstarch {optional}
3 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 large ripe banana sliced

Directions:
Place milk and coconut into a small pot over medium heat. Bring to simmer.
In a small bowl, stir egg, egg yolk, sugar and flour together until combined. Slowly whisk hot milk into egg mixture. Place hot milk and egg mixture back into hot pot and bring to boil. Whisk while boiling filling, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and divide evenly between tart shells. Press plastic wrap directly over top filling and refrigerate until cold and plastic wrap comes off clean.
To complete tart, top with banana slices. Whisk cream together with cornstarch, sugar and vanilla until stiff peaks form. Divide evenly between the tarts, ensuring all bananas are covered. Sprinkle with toasted coconut, if desired. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
