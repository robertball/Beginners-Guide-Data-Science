Ingredients:
1 refrigerated pie crust
1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoons flour
3 eggs
1/2 cup dark corn syrup
1/2 cup light corn syrup
2 cups pecan halves
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoons melted butter
2 tablespoons butter, cold!

Directions:
Place refrigerated pie crust in deep dish pie plate.
Mix flour and sugars together and toss well.  Stir in eggs, whisking well after each addition.  Add the corn syrups, pecan halves, vanilla and melted butter.  Spoon filling into the pie crust.  Dot with firm butter, cut into tiny pieces.
Bake for 50 to 55 @ 350F minutes, using a pie shield to prevent the crust from overbrowning.  Remove when a knife inserted in the center comes out clean and the filling is slightly puffed and browned.
