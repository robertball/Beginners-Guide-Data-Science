Ingredients:
1-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup peanut butter
1-1/2 cups coconut milk
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoons coconut oil (canola or peanut oil may also be used)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400º F. Grease muffin pan or line with baking cups.
In a medium bowl mix together flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. In a separate large bowl, mix together peanut butter, sugar, coconut milk and oil until thoroughly combined. Gradually add flour mixture, and mix just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.

Description: 
I absolutely love peanut butter. I attribute this love to my late grandfather who loved it as well. He and my grandmother always had a magnet on their fridge that said, “Reach for the peanut butter instead!” Peanut butter contains calcium, fiber, iron, potassium, protein and vitamin E. Peanut butter is delicious on so many things such as apples, french toast, pancakes, waffles, noodles, etc. The combination, however, of coconut and peanut butter, for me, is a match made in heaven. These muffins are perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
