Description: 
My mother made rice pudding when I was a child.  Now I make it, and my children love it.  I usually make rice pudding from leftover rice after a meal.  Just be sure that your rice floats in the milk, and the mixture is soupy.  Rice absorbs very well.  It will cook to be golden and crusty on top.  Raisins are optional.
