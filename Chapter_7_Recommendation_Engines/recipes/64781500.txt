1 pound M&Ms
4 cups rice crispy cereal (optional, but I always put it in)

Directions:
1. In a very large bowl (I use a canner), mix all the ingredients in the above order.
2. Drop by scoops (tablespoon works well) onto cookie sheet and flatten somewhat.
3. Bake for 12 minutes at 350 degrees.
4.  To help the cookies bake evenly, rotate the pans from top to bottom shelve and vice versa
half way through the cooking time.
