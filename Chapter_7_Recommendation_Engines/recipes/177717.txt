Ingredients:
3/4 pound sweet Italian pork sausage, casing removed
10 cups Swanson® Chicken Broth (regular, Natural Goodness™ or Certified Organic)

4 ounces dried pinto beans
4 ounces dried navy beans
4 ounces dry kidney bean
6 sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and thinly sliced
Grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook the sausage in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until it's well browned, stirring frequently to separate meat. Pour off fat.
Stir the sausage, broth, black pepper, carrots, celery and beans in a 5-quart slow cooker.  Cover and cook on LOW for 7 to 8 hours.*  Stir in the tomatoes. Cover and cook for 1 hour or until the beans are tender. Sprinkle with the cheese.
