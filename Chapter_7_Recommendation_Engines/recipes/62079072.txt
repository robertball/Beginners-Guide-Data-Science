This recipe for a quick and easy spicy vodka cream sauce has made it into regular rotation in my house. It's easily halved and leftover sauce can be frozen. Spice levels are easy to adjust and you can throw in grilled chicken, mushrooms and/or spinach to change things up. It's always a winner with guests.
