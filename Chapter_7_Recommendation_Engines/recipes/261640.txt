Description: 
I hesitate to call this vegetarian egg-lemon soup avgolemono because purists will insist that soup must contain chicken, and this one does not. This incredibly simple, wonderfully quick, and surprisingly nutritious recipe is perfect to make on cold, wet weeknights. My 7-year-old loves this very lemony, creamy soup, and so do I. If you want a thicker soup, add another half-cup of rice. If you aren't vegetarian, you can saute a few shrimp to add to your bowl.
