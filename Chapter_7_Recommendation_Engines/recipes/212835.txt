Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (3 pound) boneless beef chuck roast
1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (16 ounce) can cranberry sauce
1 tablespoon prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon dry mustard powder
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup red wine

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place beef chuck roast into the skillet and sear until browned on each side. Remove from heat and set aside. Combine tomato sauce, cranberry sauce, horseradish, mustard, cider vinegar, and red wine in a large pot or dutch oven and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Place roast into the pot and cover. Reduce heat to low and simmer until beef is tender, 2 to 3 hours, basting and turning roast occasionally.
Place roast on a large platter. Cover the meat with two layers of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, increase heat to medium-high and allow the sauce to reduce to desired consistency. Slice the roast and serve with sauce.

Description: 
I make this for most of the Jewish holidays, but can work for any occasion.  Can be frozen and reheated.  Tastes even better the second day.
