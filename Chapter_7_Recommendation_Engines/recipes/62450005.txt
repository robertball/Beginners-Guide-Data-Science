Ingredients:
1 cup spinach
1 cup broccoli florets
1 cup peas
1 cup swiss chard
1 garlic clove - minced (optional)
2 Tbs lemon juice (optional - to maintain bright green color)

Directions:
Steam broccoli and swiss chard for about 5-6 minutes, then add other veggies and steam for additional 5 minutes or so.  Reserve 1/2 of the liquid, then drain.  Add steamed veggies and minced garlic to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth, adding reserved liquid (and lemon juice to maintain a brighter green color) needed to get a smooth puree consistency.  Let cool and freeze in 1/4 - 1/2 cup portions in small ziplock bags or freeze in ice cube trays. Pull one out of the freezer and add to recipes, when desired.
