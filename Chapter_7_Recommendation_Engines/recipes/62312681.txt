Description: 
Made these for a very special celebration! A little goes a long way. My husband and I learned how important these little gems are in Sicily...and just so.
“Cannoli were historically prepared as a treat during Carnevale season. Eventually it became a year-round staple throughout what is now Italy. Sicilian cannoli dates back to the time of Arab domination. Cannoli are sometimes called cannolis, however this is not the correct term. Cannolo is the correct terminology for a single pastry and cannoli is the name given to two or more pastries. Whatever the name... enjoy this Italian treasure.
