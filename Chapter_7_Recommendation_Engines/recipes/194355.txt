Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1 (3 ounce) package JELL-O Lime Flavor Gelatin
2 cups boiling water, divided
Ice cubes
1 cup cold water, divided
1 (3 ounce) package JELL-O Strawberry Flavor Gelatin
3 tablespoons miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips
4 ounces PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups thawed COOL WHIP Whipped Topping

Directions:
Mix 1/3 cup sugar and lime gelatin mix in medium bowl. Add 1 cup boiling water; stir 2 min. until completely dissolved. Add enough ice to 1/2 cup cold water to measure 3/4 cup. Add to lime gelatin; stir until ice is completely melted. Refrigerate 25 min.
Meanwhile, repeat Step 1 using strawberry gelatin mix and omitting the refrigeration step. Pour into 16 (3-oz.) paper cups. Freeze 20 min. Stir 1/2 tsp. chocolate chips into gelatin in each cup.
Beat cream cheese and remaining sugar with mixer in medium bowl until well blended. Stir in COOL WHIP; spread over gelatin in cups.
Pour lime gelatin over cream cheese mixture. Insert wooden pop stick into gelatin in center of each cup. Freeze 3 hours or until firm. Remove pops from cups just before serving.
