Ingredients:
1 egg
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®), undrained
1 sleeve buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®), crushed
1 teaspoon onion flakes (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat the egg in a mixing bowl, then add the ground beef, tomatoes, and crushed crackers. Season with onion flakes, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper. Mix until evenly combined. Pack into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
This meatloaf only calls for a few easy ingredients, no chopping whatsoever! If you wish to add ketchup on top, remove the meatloaf at 50 minutes, add ketchup, then return to oven for the remaining 10 minutes.
