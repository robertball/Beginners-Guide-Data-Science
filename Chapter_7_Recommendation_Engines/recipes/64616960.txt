Ingredients:
6 Bacon strips, diced
3 C cubed peeled potatoes
1 small carrot, grated
1/2 C chopped onion
1 TBL dried parsley flakes

3 C milk
8 ounces process cheese (Velveeta), cubed
2 green onions, thinly sliced, optional

Directions:
1. In a large saucepan, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp, stirring occasionally; drain drippings. Add vegetables, seasonings and broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, until potatoes are tender, 10-15 minutes.
2.  Mix flour and milk until smooth; stir into soup. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in cheese until melted. If desired, serve with green onions. Yield: 8 servings (2 quarts).
