Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup honey
1 tablespoon water
1 cup raw sesame seeds
2 teaspoons butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.
Combine sugar, honey, and water in a small, thick bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until a smooth slurry forms, about 3 minutes. Stir in raw sesame seeds.
Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, until mixture turns an amber-caramel color, 5 to 10 minutes. A candy thermometer should read 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Remove saucepan from heat. Stir in butter and vanilla extract. Pour mixture onto prepared baking sheet.
Cool until hardened, 15 to 20 minutes. Break into pieces.
