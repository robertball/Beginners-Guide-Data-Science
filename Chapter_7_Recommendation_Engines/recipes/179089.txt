Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into cubes
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup
1/2 cup Pace® Thick & Chunky Salsa
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 teaspoon chili powder
8 flour tortillas (8-inch), warmed

Directions:
Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.
Cook the chicken in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it's well browned and cooked through, stirring often. Stir in the soup, salsa, cheese and chili powder and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling.
Place the tortillas onto 2 baking sheets.  Spread about 1/3 cup chicken mixture on half of each tortilla to within 1/2-inch of the edge. Brush the edges of the tortillas with water. Fold the tortillas over the filling and press the edges to seal.
Bake for 5 minutes or until the filling is hot. Cut the quesadillas into wedges and serve with additional salsa.
