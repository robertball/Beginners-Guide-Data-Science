Ingredients:
4 lbs. short ribs
Salt and pepper
2 Tbsp. olive oil
1 Â½ cups chopped onions
1 cup chopped carrots
1 cup chopped celery
2 cups red wine
2 Tbsp. chopped garlic
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
12 oz. tomato paste
2 cups beef broth
28 oz can whole tomatoes
1 lb. fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 dried bay leaf
Parsley for garnish
Grated pecorino Romano

Directions:
Salt and pepper the short ribs.  In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, brown the short ribs in oil. Remove and set aside.  In the same pot, add the chopped onions, carrots, and celery.  Cook until onions are translucent.  Add the red wine, cook until some of the alcohol has burned off.  Add the garlic, rosemary, tomato paste, beef broth, canned tomatoes and bay leaf.
Return the browned short ribs, bring to a boil. Cover and lower heat to a simmer.  Simmer for three hours or until the meat is very tender.
Transfer the meat to a separate bowl, remove the bones, and pull apart the meat; return to the pot and add mushrooms. Give it a stir so all the meat is coated in the sauce.  Cook until mushrooms are ready, about 20 minutes.
Serve with pasta or over mashed potatoes.
*If omitting mushrooms, use only 6 oz. tomato paste.
