Ingredients:
3 quarts water
2 tablespoons salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
5 cups steel cut oats
2 pounds ground beef
2 pounds ground pork sausage
2 large onions, finely chopped
1/4 cup cooking oil

Directions:
Bring water, salt, and pepper to boil in a slow cooker set to High. Stir in steel cut oats, cover, and cook 90 minutes.
In a large bowl, mix beef, pork, and onions. Stir into the oat mixture, and reduce heat to Low. Cover, and continue cooking 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
Transfer the mixture to a medium baking pan, and cool until semi-solid. Turn out onto wax paper, and chill 1 hour in the refrigerator, or until firm.
Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium high heat. Cut the refrigerated mixture into thin slices. Cook slices one at a time in the heated oil until evenly brown.

Description: 
This is of German origin, and I have never seen it anywhere except in the Greater Cincinnati Metro area. I typically make this once a year when winter is coming. To serve, slice into thin slices and fry like bacon.
