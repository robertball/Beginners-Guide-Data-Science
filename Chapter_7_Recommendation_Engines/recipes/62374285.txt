Ingredients:
Cooking spray
1/4 cup plus 2 tsp all-purpose flour*
6 Tbsp fat-free buttermilk*
3/4 cup yellow cornmeal*
1/2 cup chopped walnut pieces*
1 1/2 tsp dried dill*
1 1/2 tsp lemon pepper seasoning*
1/2 tsp dried thyme*
1/2 tsp garlic powder*
1/2 tsp salt*
Four 5-oz skinless tilapia fillets, plus an onion sliced into rings and 4 scallops
Salt to taste

Directions:
* NOTE: Doubling this ingredient amount will make coating your fish, scallops and onion rings much easier -- the excess will be left in the bowls.
Instructions
Preheat oven to 375°F. Spray a large, rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray.
Using 3 shallow bowls, add flour to one, pour buttermilk into another and mix cornmeal, walnut pieces, dill, lemon pepper seasoning, thyme, garlic powder and salt in the third.
Dip a fish fillet in flour, coating both sides. Then dip in buttermilk, shaking off any excess. Next, press gently into cornmeal mixture to coat well on both sides. Place on baking sheet and repeat with other fillets, scallops and onion rings.
Bake until golden and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Season with salt, if desired.
Serving size: 1/2 fish fillet, 1 scallop and 2 onion rings
Notes
A few nuts mixed into the cornmeal give the coating an irresistible crunch. An easy weeknight dinner that only needs a salad on the side.
