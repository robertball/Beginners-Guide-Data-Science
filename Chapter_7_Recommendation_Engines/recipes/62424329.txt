Ingredients:
1-2 heads of endives
1/3 cup goat cheese
2 Tbsp. cream or half and half
1/4 tsp. herbs (orgegano, thyme, basil, or chives)
paprika to garnish

Directions:
Separate and wash the endive leaves.
Using the back of a small spoon, cream the cheese, cream, and herbs.
If the mixture seems too thick, add more cream.
Stuff the endives with the goat cheese mixture.
I found using a knife worked best for this.
Sprinkle paprika on to make it pretty.

Description: 
Busy divas, you will love this one. Despite its long name, this one is easy to make and delicious! After you cream the goat cheese and herbs, you can set it aside for hours until you are ready to serve. For herbs, I grow my own basil, oregano, thyme, and chives. Any will do.
