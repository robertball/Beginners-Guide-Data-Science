Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 stick celery, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 lb minced beef
1/2 lb minced pork (or pork sausage)
1/2 cup red wine
1 cup passata (or crashed tomatoes)
2 tablespoons tomato paste
salt, ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup full fat milk or cream

Directions:
Set Instant Pot on Sauté cycle. Add olive oil and chopped vegetables. Cook, stirring, until vegetables start softening. Add ground beef and pork, continue cooking until meat is no longer pink. When juices from the meat evaporate, pour in 1/2 cup wine and cook until liquid evaporates.
Add passata (or crushed tomatoes), tomato paste, salt, pepper. Set Instant Pot on Pressure Cook cycle for 1 hour (high pressure). After pressure is dropped, open the lid, add milk and stir until milk is absorbed into the sauce. Adjust seasonings to taste, as needed.
Toss with pasta and serve.

Description: 
Traditional Italian meat sauce (ragù) prepared in Instant Pot. When cooking in Instant Pot, the amount of liquid is minimal, so there is no additional water or broth required for this recipe. The final consistency is thick enough to toss with pasta, not too runny. Cooks much faster than traditional stovetop version!
