Description: 
I can see where a recipe title with the words 'fried' and 'butter' appearing one after the other may scare a few people off, but there's no reason to be alarmed. This pan-fried butter beans recipe is delicious, super-easy, and yes, good for you. You can substitute sherry vinegar for the white wine vinegar, if desired. You can substitute other fresh herbs for the rosemary, if desired.
