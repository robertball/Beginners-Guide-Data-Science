Ingredients:
30 baked miniature phyllo dough shells
1 1/4 cups Ghirardelli® 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips
1/4 cup whipping cream
3 tablespoons seedless raspberry jam
8 Ghirardelli Dark & Raspberry SQUARES™ Chocolate, cut in quarters*
Fresh red raspberries (optional)

Directions:
Bake phyllo shells according to package directions. Cool on a wire rack.
Meanwhile, in a medium microwave-safe bowl, combine Ghirardelli(R) 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips, whipping cream, and raspberry jam. Microwave on medium power (50 percent) for 1 minute. Remove and stir. If chocolate is not melted, return to microwave and repeat heating step, stirring every 30 seconds to avoid scorching. Stir until smooth.
Spoon the chocolate mixture evenly into the baked phyllo shells. Top each with a piece of Ghirardelli Dark & Raspberry SQUARES(TM) Chocolate. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour or until set. Enjoy immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days. If desired, garnish each with a fresh raspberry just before serving.
