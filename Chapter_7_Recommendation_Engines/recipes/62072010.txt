Ingredients:
2 eggs
bacon bits or crumbled bacon
onion flakes
four tortillas
1 slice cheese or shredded cheese
salsa
1/8 cup or about 2 T. water or milk
1 quart freezer zip type bags.

Directions:
The heavy-duty freezer bags are needed not the regular ones. In the bag put the eggs minus the shells. Add bacon, onion and salsa. Add water or milk.  Zip up the bag tight, removing most of the air and mixing up the ingredients well by fingering the bag. Everything in the bag should be scrambled together. Place bag into boiling pot of water until cooked. If there are no leaks use the heated water for hot chocolate or for clean up later. Scoop eggs into the flour tortillas, add cheese and fold. Makes filling for about 2 tortillas.
