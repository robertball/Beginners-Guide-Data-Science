Ingredients:
1 pound penne pasta
2 bunches fresh basil leaves
1 cup roasted red pepper
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot with lightly-salted water to a boil. Stir the penne into the water and return to a boil. Cook until the pasta is mostly tender but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Transfer the drained pasta to a large bowl.
Place the basil, red pepper, and Parmesan cheese in the bowl of a food processor; stream the olive oil into the mixture as it blends until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle the sauce over the cooked pasta and toss to coat.
