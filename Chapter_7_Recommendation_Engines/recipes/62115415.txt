Description: 
This stuff is addictive... healthy *and* addictive!  My friend Brooke makes it all the time and one time when I was on vacation I had to call her to get the recipe from her because it is that kid of thing that you crave suddenly!  It's great to bring to picnics or to seve with a Mexican meal alongside homemade guacamole!  The best thing is - you can eat as much as you want GUILT FREE!
