Grilled Buffalo Wings Recipe

Ingredients:
3 pounds chicken wings, separated at joints, tips discarded
1 cup Louisiana-style hot sauce
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle cola-flavored carbonated beverage (not diet)
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 tablespoon worchestshire
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 tablespoon crushed garlic
1 teaspoon grated ginger or ginger paste

Directions:
Preheat a grill to medium heat.
In a heavy duty aluminum foil pan, mix together everything but the wings.
Place the pan to one side of the grill, so the sauce comes to a simmer. Add the wings to the sauce. Simmer 10 minutes.
Use tongs to fish wings out of the sauce, and place them on the grill for 8 to 10 minutes. Then return to the sauce to simmer for 10 minutes. Repeat this process for about 60-80 minutes. The sauce will thicken. When the chicken is tender and pulls easily off of the bone, you have two options. You can dip one last time and serve for saucy style wings, or serve right off the grill for dryer wings.
