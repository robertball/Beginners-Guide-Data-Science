Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chopped macadamia nuts
2 eggs
1 1/3 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3 teaspoons lemon zest
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Spread macadamia nuts on cookie sheet and bake until lightly browned. Set aside and let cool.
In a large bowl, beat eggs until light and fluffy (this should take at least 5 minutes).  Gradually add sugar and beat well.  Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder and blend into egg mixture. Beat until smooth.
Mix in the lemon zest, lemon juice and nuts.  Mix until well blended.
Drop by teaspoonfuls about 3 inches apart on parchment paper lined cookie sheets.  Bake for 7 to 9 minutes until cookies are golden with dark edges.  Let cool on wire rack.

Description: 
Sweet and just a little tart, these cookies are a lovely little treat. For best results do not bake these cookies in hot and humid weather and be sure to line baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent these cookies from sticking.
