Description: 
Classic red beans and rice recipe. This recipe is best when not rushed, but in a pinch it can be done in an electric pressure cooker. The pressure cooker will allow you to skip soaking the beans, saving an hour or more. If cooking for kids, I recommend leaving out the cayenne and using a mild sausage, such as kielbasa, instead of the andouille. Serve over rice and garnish with scallions.
