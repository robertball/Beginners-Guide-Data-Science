Description: 
How adorable are these Avocado BLT salsa cups! All I did was take wontons and fit in cupcake tins and bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. You can use gluten free or make your own cups! You can also just serve in a bowl and serve with grilled chicken breast or any other way that may inspire you! Enjoy
