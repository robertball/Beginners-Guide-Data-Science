In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt butter.  Whisk in flour all at once to form a roux.  Whisk in milk, a little at a time, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring, until thickened.  Bring to a boil, stir in beef and cayenne, heat through and serve over toast.

Description: 
My mom used to make this recipe.  It can also be made with 3/4 pound browned, drained hamburger.  We called it SOS: Same Ole Stuff. Great comfort food! Either recipe is easy to make and tastes great with a cold beer.  Serve over toast.
