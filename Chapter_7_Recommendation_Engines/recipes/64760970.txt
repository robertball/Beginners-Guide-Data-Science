2 Pound Chuck Roast
1 Onion Sliced
1 Can French Onion Soup
2 Cups Beef Broth
2 Tablespoons Worcestershire Sauce
1/2 Teaspoon Salt
1 Teaspoon Pepper
1 Teaspoon Garlic Powder
6 Hoagies
6 Slices Provolone

Directions:
1. Season the roast with the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Add the olive oil to a large pan over medium-high heat. Sear the roast on all sides, then remove to a plate. Add the onions to the pan and saute until soft.
2. Add the roast and onions to the crockpot, along with the broth, soup, and Worcestershire sauce. Cook on low for 6-8 hours until meat is tender.
