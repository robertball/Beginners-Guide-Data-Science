Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs if you prefer dark meat)
1 chopped white onion
1 can condensed cream of chicken soup
2 tbsp butter
1 package refrigerated Pillsbury Grands Jr. biscuit dough
1 package frozen peas & carrots
1 large container chicken stock/chicken broth
ground pepper

Directions:
Place whole chicken pieces in the bottom of the slow cooker. Cover chicken with soup, butter and veggies. Add ground pepper to taste. Pour just enough chicken stock to cover all the ingredients and set on HIGH for four (4) hours or LOW for eight (8) hours.
Before the last hour is up (hour 3 or hour 7) break apart pieces of the raw refrigerated dough and toss into the crock pot. Let sit for one (1) more hour or until the dough in the center is no longer raw. They will be a little mushy if you keep them whole, or if you break them apart into quarters they will cook a little faster.
Serve over your favorite mashed potato recipe in a deep bowl and enjoy!
