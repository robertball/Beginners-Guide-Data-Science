Ingredients:
1/4 cup mirin
1/4 cup dry white wine
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chile paste
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1/2 cup miso paste
1/3 cup white sugar
2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed of fat
1/2 cantaloupe - peeled, seeded, and thinly sliced
1/4 small head napa cabbage, thinly sliced
2 shallots, thinly sliced
1 English cucumber - peeled, halved lengthwise, seeded. and thinly sliced
2 limes, juiced
1/2 bunch cilantro, roughly chopped
1/2 serrano chile pepper, seeded
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Bring mirin, wine, garlic, chile paste, and ginger to a boil in a saucepan. Add miso and stir to combine. Stir in sugar; cook until dissolved. Pour marinade into a large glass dish to cool. Add pork tenderloins and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate 4 hours to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place pork on a wire rack set over a sheet pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 150 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 25 minutes. Remove and loosely cover for 10 minutes.
Combine cantaloupe, cabbage, shallots, cucumber, and cilantro in a bowl for the slaw. Puree serrano chile, olive oil, and honey together in a blender for the dressing.
Toss slaw with the dressing and mound onto the center of each plate. Slice the pork and arrange around the slaw.

Description: 
This is an easy dish that people will think you slaved over. Marinate overnight for best results, but it works great with as little as 4 hours in the marinade. This is great for a dinner party as most of it can be prepared the day before.
