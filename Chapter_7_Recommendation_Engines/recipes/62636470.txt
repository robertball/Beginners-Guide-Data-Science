Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups buttermilk
2 eggs
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
Whisk together buttermilk and eggs. Sift dry ingredients together and add to buttermilk and eggs.  Add the oil.  Using a 1/3 cup measure for each pancake, pour batter onto a hot griddle preheated to 375 degrees. Grill until batter bubbles, then turn each pancake carefully. Use more buttermilk if thinner pancakes are desired.
