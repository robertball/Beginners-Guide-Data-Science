Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups crushed graham crackers
1/4 cup sugar
1/3 cup butter, melted

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the crumbs and sugar; add butter and blend well. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of an ungreased 9-in. pie plate.
Refrigerate for 30 minutes before filling, or bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until crust is lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack before filling.
