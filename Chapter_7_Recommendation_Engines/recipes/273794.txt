Ingredients:
4 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 dash hot sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound swordfish, cubed
1/2 pound medium shrimp
1/2 pound sea scallops
4 wooden skewers, or as needed, soaked in water
1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 large yellow onion, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 large yellow squash, cut into 1-inch pieces
10 small mushrooms
10 pepperoncini peppers
1 lemon, quartered

Directions:
Mix lemon juice, olive oil, mustard, Italian seasoning, hot sauce, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Add swordfish, shrimp, and scallops and toss.
Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat and lightly oil the grate.
Drain skewers and thread swordfish, shrimp, scallops, bell pepper, onion, squash, mushroom, and pepperoncini in an alternating fashion onto the skewers. Place a lemon piece on the end of each skewer. Brush skewers with any remaining oil mixture.
Cook skewers on the grill, turning every 5 minutes, until seafood is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes total.

Description: 
These seafood kabobs are great on the grill, but taste just as good broiled, which makes this a year-round meal! Serve with rice pilaf or grilled sweet potatoes!
