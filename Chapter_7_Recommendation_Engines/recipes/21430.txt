Ingredients:
2 pounds pork tenderloin
2/3 cup honey
1/2 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place meat in a large resealable plastic bag. In a medium bowl, mix together honey, Dijon mustard, chili powder, and salt. Pour marinade over tenderloins, seal, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
Prepare the grill for indirect heat.
Lightly oil grill grate. Remove meat from marinade, and discard liquid. Grill for 15 to 25 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

This is a quick, easy and very flavorful recipe. I've made it many times. Plan ahead because the pork needs to marinate.
