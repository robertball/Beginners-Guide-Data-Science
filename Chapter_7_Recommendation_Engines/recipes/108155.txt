Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
8 slices bread, toasted
1/4 cup guacamole
1/4 cup cream cheese
4 lettuce leaves
4 slices tomato

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.
Spread the guacamole on 4 slices of toasted bread and the cream cheese on the remaining 4 slices.  Arrange a lettuce leaf, tomato slice, and two pieces of bacon on top of 4 slices of bread and top with the remaining slices.
