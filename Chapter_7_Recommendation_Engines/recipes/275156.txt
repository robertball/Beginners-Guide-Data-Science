Skinny Low-Fat Chicken Enchiladas Recipe

NA
Ingredients:
1 large red onion, peeled
3 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 head garlic, peeled
1 (16 ounce) container low-fat cottage cheese
½ cup shredded low-fat Cheddar cheese
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 teaspoon ground cumin
⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (28 ounce) can red enchilada sauce
8  flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dice 1/2 of the red onion; leave remaining 1/2 whole.
Bring chicken, garlic head, and whole 1/2 of red onion to a boil in a large pot of water. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and shred chicken with 2 forks.
Mix cottage cheese, Cheddar cheese, and 4 garlic cloves together in a large bowl. Add diced onion, shredded chicken, and spinach; stir together.
Add cumin and cayenne to enchilada sauce in a bowl; stir well. Spread about 1/2 cup into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spoon about 1/3 cup of cheese-chicken mixture into each tortilla, roll tightly, and place into the dish. Repeat until all tortillas are filled. Pour remaining sauce over enchiladas.
Bake, covered, in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 25 minutes.
