Ingredients:
2 tbsp rapeseed (canola) oil
1 tbsp butter
4 scallions, sliced, including green
1 large carrot, grated
1 large garlic clove
1 tbsp chopped thyme
Zest of 1/2 orange
1 1/2 cups pin head (steel cut) oatmeal
3/4 cup white wine
6 1/3 cups chicken stock, heated to simmering
1/3 Desmond cheese (if not available, use Parmesan), freshly grated

Directions:
Preparation
Heat a large heavy saucepan and add the oil and butter. When the butter is foaming, turn the heat to low, add the scallions, thyme and grated carrot and cook for 4 minutes until beginning to soften. Add the garlic and oatmeal, and cook for a few minutes. Add
the wine and simmer for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and add the stock a ladleful at a time, stirring constantly until each ladleful is absorbed. The oatmeal should be creamy but firm to the bite. Remove from heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese and orange zest. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
