Description: 
This recipe does take a long time, but requires very little effort, and you'll be rewarded with a wonderful, richly-flavored sauce. The hardest thing will be getting some neck bones, but a quick conversation with your friendly neighborhood butcher should be all you need. You can use any prepared tomato-based pasta sauce in place of the tomato sauce, if desired.
