Ingredients:
3 eggs
3/4 cups vegetable oil
1 cup buttermilk (or 1 dry packet)
1 cup white sugar
1 cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 lb grated carrots
------------------------
3/4 cup butter, softened
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
3 cups powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius)
In a large bowl, beat together eggs, oil, sugars and vanilla. Mix in flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and spices. Stir in carrots. Pour into prepared pan.
Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
For frosting: In a medium bowl, combine butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla. Beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Frost the cooled cake.

I'm not a nut for nuts, nor do I pine for pineapple in my carrot cakes. But variety is the spice of life, so I bring you my modifications! :D
