3 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
6 cups water
6 cubes chicken bouillon
3 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 (16 ounce) can diced tomatoes
salt and pepper to taste
1 pound torn escarole
6 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the water, chicken bouillon, cannellini beans, and diced tomatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 30 minutes.
Stir in the torn escarole, and continue simmering until the escarole is tender, about 30 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 5 to 10 minutes more before serving.
