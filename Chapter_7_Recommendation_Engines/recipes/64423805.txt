Ingredients:
1 Cup Coconut Oil
1/2 Cup Natural Peanut Butter (Low Sugar)
2 Tbsp Heavy Cream
1 Tbsp Cocoa
1 Tsp Stevia Extract
1/4 Tsp Vanilla Extract
1/4 Tsp Salt (Kosher or Low Sodium Blend)
1 Serving of Roasted, Salted Peanuts, Chopped.

Directions:
In saucepan over low heat, melt coconut oil until liquid. Add Peanut Butter and stir until mixed. Then add Vanilla Extract and Heavy cream, and whisk in Cocoa, Salt, and Stevia Extract. Continue Whisking until combined.
Remove from heat, and poor into silicone muffin pan (or other suitable mold) situated on a baking sheet for easier maneuvering. Mixture should fill 12 normal size muffin molds to half full. Sprinkle equal amounts of chopped Peanuts into each mold. Place silicone muffin pan on baking sheet into freezer. Allow to set for at least 1 hour.
Remove muffin pan from freezer, remove cups from pan, and place in zip-top container or tupperware container and place into fridge or freezer (if you prefer harder ones).
When hungry or needing a fat-bomb (if you are on keto), eat one.
