Ingredients:
4 teaspoons half-and-half cream
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar or cider vinegar
1 tablespoon crumbled blue cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 pinch sugar
2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
4 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
Place the first eight ingredients in a blender; cover and process until combined. Gradually add oil in a steady stream, processing until smooth; set aside. Place the beans in a large saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, for 8-10 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain and place in a serving bowl. Drizzle with the blue cheese mixture and sprinkle with bacon.

Description: 
I was a little hesitant when I first tried this recipe. My sons usually don't care for green beans, and I thought they wouldn't be fond of the blue cheese. To my pleasant surprise, they loved every bite.
