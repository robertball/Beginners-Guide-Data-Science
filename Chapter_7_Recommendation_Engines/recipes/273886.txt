Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 ½ cups uncooked white rice
1 large onion, chopped
1  red bell pepper, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth
½ cup white wine
¼ cup water
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, chopped
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add rice and cook until golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer toasted rice to a bowl.
Add remaining oil, onion, red bell pepper, and garlic to the Dutch oven. Cook over medium heat until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Return toasted rice to the Dutch oven. Stir in broth, wine, water, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer until 1/2 the liquid has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.
Stir onion mixture, chicken, and tomatoes into the Dutch oven and cover with a lid.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes.
Stir in cilantro just before serving.

Description: 
Before I made this chicken breast recipe I had never cooked with cilantro. This is a great way to start. Now I am not afraid of sprinkling it into tacos, or any Mexican type of dish. This is also great to have for leftovers.
