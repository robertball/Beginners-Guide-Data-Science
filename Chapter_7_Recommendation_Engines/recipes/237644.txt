Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups water
2/3 cup quinoa
1 pound finely chopped cooked crabmeat
1 cup diced cucumber
1 cup sliced grape tomatoes
1 cup fat-free feta cheese, crumbled
1/2 cup Greek salad dressing
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool quinoa completely.
Mix crabmeat, cucumber, tomatoes, and feta cheese together in a large bowl; add quinoa and stir. Whisk Greek salad dressing, lemon juice, and balsamic vinegar together in a separate bowl; drizzle over the quinoa mixture and stir to coat.

Description: 
Great and healthy salad for lunch or dinner! Imitation crab is okay for this recipe. It's best if made the night before.
