Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 cup butter
4 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded
3 tablespoons cold water

Directions:
Mix the flour, parmesan cheese, garlic powder, basil, rosemary, and oregano in a large bowl.  Cut butter into small cubes, and add to flour mixture.  Use a pastry blender or 2 knives to cut the butter into the flour; continue until mixture resembles fine crumbs.  Stir in cheese.  Sprinkle water, 1 tablespoon at a time, over the flour mixture; mix lightly until dough is evenly moist and clings together.  You may not use all of the water.
Shape dough into a disc, and divide into 12 equal pieces.  Wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm.
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). On a floured surface, roll one piece of dough at a time into an 11 inch long roll. To shape into pretzels: Curve ends of each rope to make a circle; cross ends at top. Twist ends once, and lay over bottom of circle. Place on greased baking sheets. Place pretzels, 2 inches apart, on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks.
