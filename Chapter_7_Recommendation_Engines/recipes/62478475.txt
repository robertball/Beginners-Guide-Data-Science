Ingredients:
1 lb. whole wheat penne pasta
2 C extra sharp cheddar cheese
1 1/2 C diced ham
8oz. mushrooms, sliced
4 T white wheat flour
3 C milk* (divided)
1/4 tsp. pepper

Directions:
Begin by boiling the pasta according to package directions.
Then, mix together 1 C milk and flour in a large measuring cup.
Meanwhile, saute the mushrooms in a large skillet with a little olive oil, if necessary.
When mushrooms are cooked, remove from the pan and toss with diced ham.
In the same skillet, pour the milk mixture into the pan.
Stir constantly, adding additional milk to reach desired thickness (*You may need up to 3 C milk... I used 1 mixed with the flour, and then added a little over 1 C milk to make the sauce.  If it's still too thick to your liking, add additional milk, up to a total of 3 C.) while warming the mixture so that it thickens. Simmer about 3 minutes.
Add in the ham and mushroom mix, and simmer until ham warms.
Then, add in 3/4 of the shredded cheese.
Spread the pasta into a 9x13 glass baking dish.
Pour the cheesy sauce over the pasta.
Stir to coat. Then, sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Stick the dish into a warm oven... about 300 degrees, for 10 minutes, until the cheese on the top melts.
Serve warm with green veggies!
