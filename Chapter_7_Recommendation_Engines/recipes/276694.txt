Ingredients:
2 tablespoons harissa powder
3 cups low-sodium chickpeas, drained and liquid reserved
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, or more as needed
2 tablespoons tahini
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or more as needed
2 cloves garlic
8 Kalamata olives
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1/8 teaspoon harissa powder, or to taste

Directions:
Combine harissa powder and 1 teaspoon chickpea liquid in a bowl. Whisk until a smooth paste forms, adding more liquid as needed. Set aside.
Reserve about 1/2 cup of whole chickpeas for garnish. Add remaining chickpeas to the bowl of a food processor. Add 1/3 cup olive oil, tahini, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and garlic; blend until smooth. Mix in reserved harissa paste and more chickpea liquid if needed, to maintain a creamy consistency. Taste and adjust olive oil and lemon juice amounts until flavor is smooth and nutty with a kick, and not overpowered by any one element.
Transfer hummus to a serving dish. Top with reserved 1/2 cup chickpeas, olives, cilantro, harissa powder, and any remaining olive oil. Serve at room temperature.

Description: 
Need a last minute dish for surprise guests or dinner at a friend's house? Using pre-cooked chickpeas means making hummus in no time. Adding harissa powder leaves out the need to add any other spices and gives the hummus a nice kick of spiciness. Serve with flatbread or vegetables for an appetizer or potluck hit. Best if hummus is left to sit to allow the flavors to meld, but it can be eaten immediately. Store in the refrigerator.
