Description: 
Everytime I make something that has been marinated in this I get asked for the recipe.  I decided to post it here so instead of having to write it down all the time I can just say Go to allrecipes.com!  It is equally delicious on beef, chicken or pork.  Tenderizes less tender cuts of beef making sirloin taste like New York Strip.  Chicken is awesome when marinated in this and grilled. We love to top Caesar salad with this chicken.  Grilled pork chops also a hit.  Marinate several hours or overnight. Unused portion of marinade will keep for weeks in refrigerator.
