Ingredients:
For the dressing:
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup unseasoned rice vinegar (not the seasoned kind or it will be too salty. Can substitute regular white vinegar but the dressing will have more of a harsh flavor)
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon Asian sesame oil
1 tablespoon peanut butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon Sriracha hot sauce
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1 large garlic clove, minced
For the slaw:
4 cups prepared broccoli slaw (or shredded cabbage)
2 cups prepared shredded carrots (or grated in food processor)
1 red pepper, thinly sliced into bite size pieces
1 cup pre-cooked, shelled edamame (available fresh or frozen)
2 medium scallions, finely chopped
1/2 cup chopped salted peanuts
1/2 cup loosely packed chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Make the dressing by combining all ingredients in medium bowl. Stir with a whisk until peanut butter is dissolved. Set aside.
Combine all of the slaw ingredients in a large bowl. Add dressing and toss well. Let sit at least 10 minutes so vegetables have a chance to soak up the dressing. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve cold.
