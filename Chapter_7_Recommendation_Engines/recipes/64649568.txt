Ingredients:
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing salad mix
1 green onion, chopped
4 whole wheat flour tortillas
8  slices chicken or turkey lunch meat
chives *optional*

Directions:
Beat cream cheese, mayo, and ranch dressing mix in a small bowl. Stir in green onion.
Spread 2 tablespoons of cream cheese mix on each tortilla. Top with two pieces of lunch meat.
Roll tortillas up tightly to resemble scrolls. Tie with chives for that special effect if desired. If not, they will stay rolled after refrigeration.
Your local craft store will carry little lunch sized chests with a handle for your box. Use black olives for cannon balls, orange wedges with cupcake flags for your pirate boat, wheat crackers for treasure maps with red bell pepper x marks the spot, sword picks with cheese to go with your crackers, gold foiled chocolate coins, and a ring pop for that sparkle. Get creative and bring a smile to your little pirate's lunch!
