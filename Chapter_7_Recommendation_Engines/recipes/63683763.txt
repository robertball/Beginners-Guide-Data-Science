Ingredients:
1 md green bell pepper, diced
1 md onion, diced
salt
olive oil
1c frozen corn
1.5lb frozen yuca, cooked
1 16oz can black beans, well-rinsed
olive oil
10 6" yellow corn tortillas
10 toothpicks

Directions:
Combine the pepper, onion, and corn in an aluminum pan.  Add enough olive oil to coat the veggies and the bottom of the pan, but not enough to leave excess.  Add salt to taste.
Place on a grill for 10-20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes, or until the pepper is tender and the onion is translucent.  Then remove from heat.
Meanwhile, combine the yuca and black beans in a large mixing bowl.  Mash until mostly smooth and well-blended, adding olive oil as needed to achieve the desired doughy consistency.
Combine the veggies with the mashed beans & yuca.  Mix well, kneading with your hands if necessary.
Warm the tortillas in a microwave for 30 seconds to a minute.
Place equal amounts of mixture in each tortilla.  Fold each tortilla in half over its portion of mixture, and place a toothpick in it.  Paint the top of each tortilla with olive oil.
Place the tortillas on a grill topper on the grill.  Grill for about 5 minutes, then remove from heat and remove the toothpicks.
