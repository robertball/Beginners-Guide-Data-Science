Ingredients:
1 (14.5 ounce) can whole tomatoes with juice
1 tablespoon chopped jalapeno peppers
4 medium garlic cloves
1 tablespoon olive oil
3/4 cup diced onion, divided
1 (15 ounce) can BUSH'S速 Black Beans, drained and rinsed
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 pound cooked, shredded chicken breast
4 cups baby spinach leaves
Salt and pepper, to taste
6 cups crumbled tortilla chips
Garnish: sliced avocado and sour cream.

Directions:
Place tomatoes, jalapeno pepper and garlic in a blender or food processor. Puree until smooth.
Heat oil in a large saute pan. Add 1/2 cup of the onions, saute until golden brown. Add tomato puree; cook until reduced to a thick paste (like tomato paste, about 8-10 minutes).
Add beans and stock; bring to a simmer 1-2 minutes. Add chicken and spinach, stir to wilt. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Add tortilla chips and toss to coat. Once the tortillas have started to wilt, serve with the remaining chopped onions. Garnish with sliced avocado and sour cream, if desired.
