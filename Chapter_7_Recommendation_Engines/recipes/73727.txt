Ingredients:
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 dash cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 1/4 cups unsweetened apple juice
1 apple - peeled, cored and thinly sliced
2 slices whole wheat bread
1 tablespoon apple syrup
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
2 teaspoons light brown sugar

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, and apple juice; whisk until well blended. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer. Cook and stir for 5 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Store in an air tight container in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
Place apples in a microwave-safe dish and drizzle with apple syrup. Microwave on high for 1 minute, or until tender; set aside. Toast bread and arrange apple slices on top. Drizzle with syrup.
Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, watching carefully to prevent burning. Sprinkle with cinnamon, if desired. Serve immediately.
