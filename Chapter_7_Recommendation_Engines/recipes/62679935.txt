Ingredients:
6 cups fresh baby spinach
1/4 tsp sea salt
2 tbsp water
1 package of turkey or chicken stuffing mix
1/2 cup reduced-fat ricotta cheese
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 egg, stirred

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Heat water in a large non-stick skillet, and add the baby spinach.  Stir until wilted, about 3-5 minutes, and season with sea salt.
Transfer spinach and about 2 tbsp of the water from the pan to a bowl.  Cut up the spinach pieces.
Add about half of the stuffing mix, stirring well.  Add the ricotta and parmesan cheeses, then the rest of the stuffing mix.  Add the egg, stirring until all is combined.
Form into 2 inch balls and place on parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 15 minutes, and serve.  Enjoy!
