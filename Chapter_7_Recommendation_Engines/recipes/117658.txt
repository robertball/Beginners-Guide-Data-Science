Ingredients:
1 large whole dill pickle
4 ounces Cheddar or Colby cheese
8 hot dogs
4 teaspoons prepared mustard
8 bacon strips
8 hot dog buns

Directions:
Cut pickle lengthwise into eight thin slices.  Cut cheese into eight 5-in. x 1/2-in. x 1/4-in. sticks.  Cut hot dogs in half lengthwise; spread cut surfaces with mustard.  On eight hot dog halves, layer a pickle slice and a cheese stick; top with remaining hot dog halves.
Place one end of a bacon stop at the end of each hot dog; push a toothpick through the bacon and both hot dog pieces.  Firmly wrap bacon around each hot dog and secure at the other end with a toothpick.  Grill, uncovered, over medium heat for 8-10 minutes or until bacon is completely cooked, turning occasionally.  Discard toothpicks.  Serve in buns.
