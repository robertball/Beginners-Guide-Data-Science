Ingredients:
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1/4 cup rice flour
2 squares semisweet chocolate
1/2 cup sesame seeds
1 cup almond butter
1/3 cup hemp seeds
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1 scoop vanilla protein powder
2 tablespoons honey
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Melt coconut oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add rice flour; cook and stir until toasted, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chocolate and stir until just melted. Remove from heat.
Place sesame seeds in a small soup bowl.
Place almond butter, hemp seeds, cocoa powder, protein powder, honey, and salt in another bowl. Stir with a stiff silicone spatula. Add the rice flour mixture and stir to combine.
Measure out about 16 balls using a small ice cream scoop or 2 tablespoons. Roll between palms to shape balls; roll in the bowl of sesame seeds to coat. Roll again to secure the seeds. Place balls in a baking dish and cover with plastic wrap.
Refrigerate until firm, 2 to 4 hours. Serve chilled or at room temperature.

Description: 
I started making these protein energy balls when my doctor said I had low blood sugar and needed to add more protein to my diet. A great afternoon pick-me-up for kids and adults. You can take them to your gluten-free and raw friend's parties.
