4 poblano peppers (also known as chiles pasillas)
1 tsp salt
300 g (10.6 oz) Cotija whole milk cheese
1 c flour
2 eggs,separated
1/2 c frying oil

Directions:
Sear peppers over an open flame, making skin bubble.  It will pop when it bubbles, and it may appear burnt on the outside.
Blanch peppers by dipping in salted boiling water, then in ice water.  Skin should become very easy to remove.
Remove skin, veins, and seeds from each pepper.
Stuff peppers with cheese and secure closed with a toothpick.
Dip peppers in flour and set aside.
Add oil to a frying pan and preheat.
Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Add egg yolks and beat until mixed.
Dip floured peppers into egg mixture, then add to frying pan.
Cook until egg mixture is done and cheese is melted, flipping once.
Serve with salsa and a sprinkling of cheese.
