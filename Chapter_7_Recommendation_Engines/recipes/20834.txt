Ingredients:
1 1/8 cups water
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select Dough cycle; press Start.
Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into eight equal pieces and form into rounds. Cover the rounds with a damp cloth and let rest.
Roll dough into thin flat circles, about 8 inches in diameter.  Cook two at a time on preheated baking sheets or a baking stone until puffed up and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Repeat for remaining loaves.
