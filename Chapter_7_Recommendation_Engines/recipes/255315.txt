Ingredients:
1 pound boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1/3-inch pieces across the grain
2 tablespoons light soy sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 cup chopped onion
4 cloves garlic, chopped
2 eggs, beaten
3 tablespoons light soy sauce
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon ground white pepper
4 cups leftover cooked rice
1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions
1/4 cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Combine chicken thighs, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, brown sugar, and black pepper in a bowl. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight.
Heat a wok or very large skillet over high heat for 30 seconds. Pour in vegetable oil. Reduce heat to medium; add onion and garlic. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Increase heat to high and add marinated chicken to the wok; cook, stirring constantly, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes.
Push chicken mixture to one side of the wok; pour eggs into the empty side. Cook until just starting to set, about 2 minutes. Stir eggs slowly until scrambled. Mix into the chicken mixture. Season with 3 tablespoons soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper; stir for 1 minute.
Stir rice into the wok until evenly incorporated and heated through, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in green onion and cilantro. Mix gently until combined.
