Ingredients:
12 ounces pitted prunes
2 large potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
3 carrots, peeled and sliced into rounds
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons matzo meal (optional)

Directions:
Place the prunes in a large saucepan, and add water to barely cover while you peel and cut the potatoes and carrots. Add the potatoes, carrots, lemon juice, and sugar to the water, bring to a boil, and lower heat. Simmer the mixture until the carrots are very tender and the mixture is thick, about 1 hour, stirring every 20 minutes.
If a thicker tzimus is desired, stir in the matzo meal and simmer an additional 30 minutes.

Description: 
My Mom developed this recipe which has become a holiday tradition in our family. It's different from many tzimuses because it is not made with sweet potatoes.
