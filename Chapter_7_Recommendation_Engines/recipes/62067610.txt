2 cups water
1lb stew meat
2 tsp olive oil
3 baking potatoes, cut up

2 cups frozen corn
1 package Lipton Beef Onion Soup Mix
1 tsp cayenne pepper
salt/pepper to taste

Directions:
In a pan, heat olive oil and brown meat. (Don't cook all the way through or it will come out too dry.)
In a large pot, mix soup mix, V8, water, chopped onion, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper, potatoes, and carrots. Cook on medium heat. When meat is ready, add to mixture. Cover and simmer (stir occasionally) on medium/low heat until meat is cooked through and potatoes and carrots are soft. Add in broccoli, cauliflower and corn. Simmer for another 10 minutes.
If you don't like brocolli or cauliflower, it's ok to leave them out.
