Description: 
Original recipe from plainchicken.com  What?  Yep, that's right, 7up biscuits.  Some places on the internets call these Popeye's Biscuits - I guess they taste like the biscuits from the chicken place.  All I know is that these were the best biscuits that I've ever made - hands down!  They were light and fluffy.  They only have three ingredients - quick and easy!  We had them with dinner but I will make them again for breakfast.  Chicken Legs wants a biscuit with bacon and cheese - YUM!
