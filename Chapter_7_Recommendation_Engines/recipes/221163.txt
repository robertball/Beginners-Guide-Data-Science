Description: 
Brining pork chops is like upgrading to premium cable; once you do it, you can't go back to basic. Dissolve salt and molasses in water, toss in the chops, and wait. What do you get from such little effort? A pork chop that's seasoned from the inside out, with a firm, but very moist texture.
