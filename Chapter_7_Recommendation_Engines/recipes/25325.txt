Ingredients:
4 English muffins, split and toasted
1 avocado, mashed
1 cup alfalfa sprouts
1 small tomato, chopped
1 small sweet onion, chopped
4 tablespoons Ranch-style salad dressing
4 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
1 cup shredded smoked Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to broil.
Place each muffin open-faced on a cookie sheet.  Spread each half with mashed avocado; place halves close together.  Distributing ingredients evenly, cover each half with sprouts, tomatoes, onion, dressing, sesame seeds and cheese.
Place under broiler for about 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.

Description: 
A local restaurant used to serve a version of this sandwich but when they discontinued it, I experimented and made it better with the addition of dry roasted sesame seeds and using English Muffins instead of whole wheat bread.  Garnish each with a black olive, if desired.
