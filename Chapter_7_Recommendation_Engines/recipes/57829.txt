Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground venison or beef
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons monosodium glutamate (MSG)
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
2 teaspoons sugar-based curing mixture (such as Morton® Tender Quick®)
1 1/2 teaspoons barbeque seasoning
2 teaspoons water
2 teaspoons hickory-flavored liquid smoke
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine ground venison, salt, MSG, hot sauce, curing mixture, barbeque seasoning, water, liquid smoke, garlic powder, and pepper; mix thoroughly.  Cover, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Line food dehydrator trays with plastic wrap.  Pat meat mixture into a very thin layer on the trays.  Place in dehydrator set according to manufacturers directions.  Once the meat has firmed up, after about the first 2 hours, remove it from the plastic, cut into strips, and replace onto the racks.  Continue until the meat is done drying, about 5 to 10 hours total depending on machine.
When finished, blot off any grease with a paper towel.  Store in the refrigerator in a jar with a tight fitting lid.
