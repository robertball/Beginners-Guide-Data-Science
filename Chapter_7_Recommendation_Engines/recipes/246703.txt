Ingredients:
5 slices bread
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup crushed graham crackers
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
5 apples, peeled and cubed, or more to taste
1 pear, peeled and cubed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Toast slices of bread and cut into cubes. Place in a large bowl. Add brown sugar, graham crackers, almonds, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt; mix to combine.
Heat butter in a small saucepan over low heat until melted, about 3 minutes. Stir in almond extract.
Spread half the apples and pear in the bottom of a 9-inch baking dish. Top with 1/2 of the bread mixture. Drizzle 1/2 of the butter mixture on top. Repeat layers once more with remaining ingredients.
Bake in the preheated oven until apples are soft and bread topping is crunchy, about 1 hour.
