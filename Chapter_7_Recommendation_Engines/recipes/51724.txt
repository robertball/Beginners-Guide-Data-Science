Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
salt
1/2 cup butter
1 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Rub in the shortening until the mixture appears sandy. Stir in the buttermilk until the dough holds together.  Roll out on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thick.  Cut into 4-inch squares, then cut each square diagonally into triangles, and prick with a fork.
Bake the triangles in preheated oven on ungreased cookie sheets until dry and lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
