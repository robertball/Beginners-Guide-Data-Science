Description: 
Quick and easy idea for kids' lunch boxes. Especially good for kids who don't like sandwiches. Taste great hot or cold. I make these for my 4-year-old son's lunch box. He loves pizza and these can be kept in his lunch box for a few hours and eaten at room temperature. I like to mix the broccoli in with the sauce as it hides the taste a bit and he doesn't notice!
