Description: 
This delicious cream cheese-based appetizer is a great addition to any holiday party and is always a hit with guests due to its festive look! 

I have typically made this recipe for parties with the light or reduced fat options instead of regular and everyone has said it tastes great and looks even better. After the tree has reached desired firmness, set it on your serving platter and top the tree with lemon peel cut into the shape of a star. Serve with your choice of crackers. Triscuits® or Wheat Thins® work great!
