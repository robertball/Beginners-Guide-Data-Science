Remove membrane from back of ribs and dry ribs with a paper towel. Cut rack into 4 pieces. Mix olive oil and liquid smoke in a small bowl and rub on both sides of the ribs.
Combine brown sugar, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and chili powder in a bowl. Season both sides of the ribs generously with seasoning mix. Let ribs rest for 30 minutes to enhance the flavor.
Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place ribs bone-side down in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching; cook in batches if necessary.
