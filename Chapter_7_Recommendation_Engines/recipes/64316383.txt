Ingredients:
12 ounces white chocolate chips
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
3 cups Rice Krispies cereal
1 1/2 cups mini marshmallows
1/4 cup mini chocolate chips + 2 tablespoons for top

Directions:
Melt chocolate chips and peanut butter together over super low heat. Stir constantly until smooth.
Put Rice Krispies in a large mixing bowl and pour the white chocolate peanut over it. Stir until all the cereal is coated. Let cool for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Once cool, stir in mini marshmallows and 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips.
Transfer the mixture into a 9x9 pan and gently press down to make it all even. Press the remaining 2 tablespoons of mini chocolate chips into the top. Let set completely before cutting and serving.
