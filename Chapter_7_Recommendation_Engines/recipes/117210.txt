Ingredients:
1 (7.5 ounce) package refrigerated buttermilk biscuits
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
TOPPING:
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Separate biscuits into 10 pieces; place in an ungreased 9-in. round baking dish. Press onto the bottom and 1 in. up the sides, pinching edges together to seal. Bake at 350 degrees F for 5-7 minutes or until slightly puffed.
Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar, egg and flour until smooth; pour over crust. Combine topping ingredients; sprinkle over filling. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until filling is set and crust is golden brown.
Cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before cutting. Serve warm or chilled. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
Refrigerated buttermilk biscuits create the tender crust for these pretty slices sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. 'They can be served warm or chilled, and they're extra special with fresh fruit,' notes Betty Claycomb of Alverton, Pennsylvania.
