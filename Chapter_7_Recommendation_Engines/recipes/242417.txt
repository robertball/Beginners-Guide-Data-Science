Ingredients:
1/2 cup barbeque sauce
1/4 cup apple butter
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 (4 ounce) pork chops

Directions:
Whisk barbeque sauce, apple butter, brown sugar, black pepper, and garlic together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until sugar dissolves, about 30 seconds. Stir until sauce is smooth.
Place pork chops on a plate and pour sauce over chops. Refrigerate for flavors to soak into pork chops, 1 to 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook pork chops on grill until cooked through, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This was created after lots of thinking on how to tease the taste buds between hot and sweet. These, paired with grilled asparagus and a good red wine, make for an awesome meal that will have your taste buds screaming for more. When cooked right, the seasoning mixture will practically caramelize over the chops. This helps seal in the juices and gives delicious flavor. Hope you guys enjoy.
