Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 (15 ounce) can creamed corn
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Allow potatoes to cool, then peel and slice into 1/2-inch rounds.
Put a layer of potatoes in a casserole dish and season with salt and pepper. Spoon 1/3 of the creamed corn over the potatoes and spread evenly. Repeat layers twice more, ending with the corn. Sprinkle shredded Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe was given to my mother and father after they had it in a very small Scottish restaurant in the NC mountains. It was supposedly an 'old family recipe' of the family who owned the restaurant. It is excellent with most any beef or game.
