Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups white sugar
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Whisk sugar, flour, cocoa powder, and salt together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Pour melted butter into the mixture and stir to incorporate. Press dough into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan.
Bake crust in preheated oven until the sides are firm and the bottom bubbles slightly, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Tastes just like a chocolate wafer pie crust...but only has 5 ingredients as opposed to about 50! This is extremely easy and I promise you won't do more work than if you used chocolate cookies.
