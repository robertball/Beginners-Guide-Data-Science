Ingredients:
8 red (new) potatoes
4 Yukon gold potatoes
2 sweet potatoes
1/3 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 (220 degrees Celsius).  Peel and cube the Yukon gold potatoes and sweet potatoes.  Scrub the red potatoes and cut into cubes.
Place the potatoes in a large saucepan.  Add enough lightly salted water to cover the potatoes.  Bring to a boil and cook the potatoes for three minutes.  Drain thoroughly.
Spread the potatoes in a single layer on a large nonstick baking sheet.
Drizzle the potato mixture with olive oil and sprinkle with thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper.  Cook the potatoes until browned and crisp, about 25 minutes.  Transfer to a large dish and serve immediately.
