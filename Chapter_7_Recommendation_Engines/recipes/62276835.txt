Ingredients:
1 tablespoon (or as needed) extra virgin olive oil or avocado oil
1/2 cup sliced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 large or 2 medium basa (Vietnamese catfish) fillets
1/2 red bell pepper sliced
1/2 orange bell pepper sliced
1/2 yellow bell pepper sliced
4 ozs. shredded Pepper Jack cheese
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic; cook and stir until onions are almost soft.
Set aside.
Saute colored bell peppers until almost softened. Add to the previously set aside onions, etc.
Add the fish fillets to the pan using a bit of oil to prevent sticking, and cook for about 2 minutes per side. Pour in the bell pepper mixture, top with shredded cheese, cover the pan to allow cheese to melt.
Right before serving, sprinkle the cilantro and lime juice overtop.
Serve with rice and/or your favorite vegetable(s).
