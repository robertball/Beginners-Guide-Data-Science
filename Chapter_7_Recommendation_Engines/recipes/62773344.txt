https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 box Betty Crocker Pound Cake
2/3cup high quality orange juice
1/2 stick softened butter
2 eggs
2 oranges
1/2-1 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Combine cake mix, butter, orange juice and eggs.
Beat as directed on the mix.
With a fine grater, grate the outermost peel of one of the oranges and add to the cake batter.
Bake as directed.
In a glass bowl, grate the other orange peel in to the bowl, add the juice of both oranges and icing sugar until it is the consistency of honey. Set aside.
Once cake is done (read directions on box), remove and poke small holes deep in to the cake.  When you think you've poked enough holes, poke 20 more with a chopstick or toothpick.
Pour the glaze over the cake while it's still hot.  Allow to sit for 20 minutes and remove from pan to continue to cool.

Description: 
We first tasted this recipe at afternoon tea in a sea side resort in Barbados.

We've tried to make it from scratch, but we can't beat this semi-homemade version.
