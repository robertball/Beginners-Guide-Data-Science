Ingredients:
10 dates, pitted
8 tablespoons almond butter
6 tablespoons almonds
6 tablespoons brown rice syrup
4 tablespoons sunflower seeds
6 tablespoons roasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Combine dates, almond butter, almonds, rice syrup, and sunflower seeds in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until a thick paste forms. If paste gets too thick, add a bit more rice syrup.
Place sesame seeds in a small soup bowl. Shape paste into 1/2-inch balls and roll in sesame seeds to coat.

Description: 
I always have a batch of these almond energy balls around. They are super quick to make - just throw everything into the food processor, process, and roll into balls.
