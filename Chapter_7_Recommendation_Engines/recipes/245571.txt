Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups coconut sugar
1 cup dark chocolate chips
1 cup cocoa powder
1/4 cup coconut flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups buttermilk
4 eggs
3/4 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffin pans with paper liners.
Combine gluten-free flour, coconut sugar, dark chocolate chips, cocoa powder, coconut flour, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt in a bowl; mix well to combine.
Whisk buttermilk, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in another large bowl until combined. Add flour mixture; fold in with a spatula until completely blended. Divide batter evenly among muffin cups, filling each about halfway.
Bake cupcakes in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in pans 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Deep, dark, satisfying, and seriously addictive. They are best when cooled down to firm up the chocolate chips inside to give a burst of flavor. Our co-op grocer sells stevia-sweetened dark chocolate chips which are very good. Freeze some cupcakes for a fast snack on the go.
