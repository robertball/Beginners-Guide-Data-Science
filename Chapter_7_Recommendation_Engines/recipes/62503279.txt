Chicken a la King Recipe

Ingredients:
½ c. butter
½ c. red bell pepper, chopped
½ c. green pepper
½ c. flour
2 small cans mushrooms and juice
3 c. chicken broth
1 c. cream
5 c. cooked chicken, shredded (Rotisserie chicken works beautifully!)
salt and pepper
(Add ¼ c. milk to thin if needed.)
Wheat or white bread

Directions:
Saute peppers and then add flour to make a roux. Let it bubble. Add mushrooms, juice and broth and bring to a boil to thicken. Add chicken and cream. Don’t boil after adding cream.
Salt and pepper. Add milk if needed. May cook longer in a crockpot.
To make the ‘crowns’: Buy wheat bread at the store – not whole wheat, just the cheapo wheat kind (or white if you prefer.) Get out your muffin tin. Place a slice of bread over a muffin hole. Push in on the four sides and push down into the muffin hole. Don’t squash the bread, but use enough force so that it stays down in the muffin hole. The four corners should be sticking up. Bake at about 250 until toasted and dry. Keep checking them every 5 minutes. When done, the bread will be like toast, and you will be able to lift the crowns out of the muffin tin and they will hold their crown shape.
Place one or two bread ‘crowns’ on your plate and ladle the chicken gravy over the crowns. Using a fork or a knife, cut the crown into pieces and eat with the chicken gravy.
