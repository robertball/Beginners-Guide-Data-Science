Ingredients:
5 pounds apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Layer apples into a slow cooker. Sprinkle cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg over the apples.
Cook on High until apples are soft, 4 to 5 hours. Whisk apples vigorously for a chunkier-style applesauce. Puree with an immersion blender for a smoother applesauce.

Description: 
This spicy applesauce requires no added sugar because the apples and spices are sweet enough on their own. The smell of the apples cooking with the spices makes the entire house smell like apple cider!
