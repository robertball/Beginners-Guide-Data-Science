Ingredients:
1/2 cup maida flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup semolina flour
1/2 cup mango puree
1 tablespoon mango puree
1/4 cup plain yogurt
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
Frosting:
1/2 cup chilled mango puree
1/4 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Sift maida flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a bowl. Sift a second time. Add semolina flour and mix well.
Combine 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon mango puree, yogurt, sugar, olive oil, and cardamom in a large bowl; beat well. Add flour mixture and mix well. Transfer batter to the prepared muffin tin, filling cups 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove cupcakes from tin and allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Frost cupcakes with chilled mango puree, sprinkle almonds on top, and serve.
