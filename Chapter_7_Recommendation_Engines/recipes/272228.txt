Ingredients:
1 tablespoon cornmeal
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1 1/2-inch cubes
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1 pinch sea salt, or to taste
2 tablespoons sour cream, or to taste

Directions:
Mix cornmeal and cumin together in a bowl. Add sweet potatoes and toss until coated.
Heat olive oil and butter in a large, non-stick frying pan over medium heat until the butter is melted and starts to bubble.
Add the sweet potatoes to the frying pan and ensure that they are evenly distributed.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover the frying pan with a lid and cook, covered, for 5 minutes.
Uncover and flip the sweet potatoes. Continue cooking until easily pierced with a knife, about 3 minutes.
Remove from the pan with tongs and onto a plate. Sprinkle with sea salt and serve with sour cream on the side.
