2 tablespoons butter
1/4 teaspoon salt

1/2 pound spaghetti
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Add the garlic and stir for 1-2 minutes.
Add butter and melt, stirring constantly.
Add salt, pepper, and 3 cups chicken broth.  Bring to a boil.  Add the pasta and cook according to box directions.
Add a little more chicken broth if the noodles start to stick to the bottom and burn.
Add the cheese, cream, and parsley when the pasta is cooked to your desired tenderness and mix thoroughly.
Serve immediately.
Optional - Add Prawn and/or Scallops to make an amazing seafood Alfredo.
