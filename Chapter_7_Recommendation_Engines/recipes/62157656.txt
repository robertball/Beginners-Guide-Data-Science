Ingredients:
2 cups hot water
2 Tbsp baby shampoo
1 Tbsp mineral oil
1/2 tsp Lavender oil
1/2 tsp Tea tree oil
Paper towels
Air-tight container (large enough to fit half a roll of paper towels)

Directions:
Cut the roll of paper towels in half so you have two even rolls.
Place one half in the air-tight container.
In a separate bowl, mix the water, shampoo and oils.
Pour the solution slowly into the container with the paper towels.  Seal the container and wait for the towels to absorb the liquid, approximately 5 minutes.
Remove the center cardboard and remove the towels from the center, tearing off the desired size.
