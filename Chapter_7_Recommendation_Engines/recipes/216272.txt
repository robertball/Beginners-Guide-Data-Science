Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
4 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled
1/2 cup prepared caramel sauce
1/2 (17.3 ounce) package Pepperidge FarmÂ® Puff Pastry Sheets, thawed
Vanilla ice cream

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Stir the cinnamon and sugar in a shallow bowl.  Beat the egg and water in a small bowl with a fork or whisk.  Using a melon baller, scoop the cores out of the apples from the top, making sure to leave the bottoms intact.
Coat the apples with the cinnamon mixture.  Spoon 2 tablespoons caramel sauce into each apple.
Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface.  Roll the pastry sheet into a 10x9-inch rectangle.  Cut into 9 (1x10-inch) strips  Press the ends of 2 pastry strips together to make 1 (1x20-inch) strip.  Repeat with 6 of the remaining pastry strips.  Cut 8 leaf shapes from the last pastry strip.
Starting at the bottom, wind 1 pastry strip around 1 apple, slightly overlapping the edges of the pastry.  Repeat with the remaining pastry strips and apples.  Top each with 2 pastry leaves.  Brush the pastries with the egg mixture.  Place the pastries onto a baking sheet.
Bake for 25 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown.  Serve the pastries with the ice cream.
