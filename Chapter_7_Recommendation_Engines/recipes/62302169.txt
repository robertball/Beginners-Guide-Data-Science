Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter, cold
1/2 cup + 1 tablespoon milk
1 1/2 tsp vinegar
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon peel
Glaze
1/3 cup butter, melted
2 cups powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoons vanilla
2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
2-4 tablespoons water

Directions:
Preheat oven at 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add milk, vineger, lemon juice, and lemon Peel. Stir just until mixed.
Turn onto a floured surface, knead a few times. Do not over-knead. Shape dough into a ball and flatten into a large round about an inch thick.  Cut round into 10 wedges. Place each wedge on a baking sheet seperating so each wedge has at least an inch of space. Press the tip down of each wedge so the thinest part has a downward slope.
Bake for 11-14 minutes of until bottom edges are lightly tan. Allow 15 minutes to cool before preparing Glaze
For Glaze: Stir butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and lemon juice until smooth. Add water 1 tablespoon at a time until desired consistency.
Once scones have cooled and are only slightly warm to touch laddle glaze over scones with large spoon or wire whisk.
