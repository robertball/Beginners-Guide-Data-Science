Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 egg white
2 tablespoons milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups mashed bananas
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift flour, baking powder, soda, salt and allspice together and set aside.
In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs and egg white and beat well. Add the mashed banana, vanilla and milk. Add the flour mixture and mix until well blended.
Divide batter into two 9 inch pans. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool completely and frost with Cream Cheese Frosting.

Description: 
I developed this recipe after trying many versions and I like this one the best. It's moist and has a sponge-like consistency and is very simple to make.  It can also be used in a 9x13 pan.
