Ingredients:
2 semi-ripe mangoes, diced
3 limes, juiced, divided
1 orange, juiced
4 tomatillos, peeled and diced, or more to taste
1 small red onion, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste
6 (6 ounce) fillets boned, skinned swordfish
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place mango pieces in a bowl. Scoop out 1/4 of the pieces and place in a blender with the juice of 2 limes and orange juice. Blend until smooth.
Place tomatillos, red onion, jalapeno pepper, and cilantro in the bowl with the diced mangoes. Sprinkle salsa with salt and freshly ground pepper.
Pour the pureed mango mixture over the salsa and mix well.
Lay swordfish on a plate and sprinkle with the remaining lime juice, olive oil, salt and black pepper.
Place swordfish on the hot grill and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side. Spoon salsa over fish.
