Ingredients:
1 cup pearled barley
Water
4 cups shredded white cheddar cheese (I used low-fat but you don't have to)
1 slicing tomato
About 1 head broccoli and 1 head cauliflower
To taste:
Marjoram
Thyme
Savory
Rosemary
Salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400ยบ F.
Place the barley and 3 cups water in a sauce pan.  Bring to a boil, then bring down to a simmer.  The barley will be done when all the water is absorbed, which should take 45 minutes to an hour.
Meanwhile, chop the cauliflower and broccoli.
Place them in a pot and pour water in until they are just covered.  Boil these until they are cooked but not too soft.
In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked broccoli, cauliflower, and barley, as well as the cheese and seasonings.
Spread the  mixture in a casserole dish.
Slice the tomato and place on top of the mixture in the casserole.  Bake for 10-20 minutes.
Let sit until the cheese is not runny.
Serve from the casserole dish.
