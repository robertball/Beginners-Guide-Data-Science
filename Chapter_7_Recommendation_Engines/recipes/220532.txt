Description: 
This recipe turns out with the best flavour if you make it ahead and let it chill for 24 hours before serving. If you'd rather not serve it over crushed ice, chill the glass while you prepare the drink. Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to two months in an airtight container. If the Irish cream has been sitting in the refrigerator, shake it before serving.
