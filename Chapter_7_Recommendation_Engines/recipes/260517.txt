Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (8 ounce) package buttery round crackers (such as RitzÂ®)
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
1 (4.25 ounce) can black olives, drained
1/2 bunch fresh chives, cut into 2-inch pieces

Directions:
Spread cream cheese onto crackers. Make an incision in the cherry tomato halves, but don't cut all the way through, to form wings. Place tomato wings on each cracker and an olive as the head. Trim olives so they point upwards if necessary. Stick 2 chives into each olive as antennae.
