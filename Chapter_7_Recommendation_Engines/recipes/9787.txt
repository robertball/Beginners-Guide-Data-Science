Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
3 ½ tablespoons light cream
1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon butter, softened
½ teaspoon vanilla extract
1 drop food coloring
1 tablespoon light cream
⅓ cup granulated sugar for decoration

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Cut the 6 tablespoons of cold butter into  the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs.
Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of cream over the mixture and toss gently with a fork.  Repeat with the remaining cream until all is moistened.  Form into a ball.
Roll the dough to slightly less than 1/8 inch thick.  Cut into rounds with a 1 1/2-inch cookie cutter.  Sprinkle one side of each round with sugar and place on an  ungreased cookie sheet, sugar side up.
Prick each round in four  parallel rows with a fork.
Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the edges just begin to brown.  Remove to a rack and cool completely.
Make filling as follows.  Stir together the powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon softened butter,   vanilla, food coloring, and enough of the 1 tablespoon cream to make it spreadable.
Spread 1/2 teaspoon of the filling on the flat side of half of the cookies.  Top with the remaining cookies, flat side down.
