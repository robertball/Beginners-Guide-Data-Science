Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
1 egg
1 cup molasses
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup hot water
Sauce
3/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup molasses
1/3 cup butter
2/3 cup evaporated milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 8 inch square pan.
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Beat in the egg, and mix in the molasses.
In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. Blend into the creamed mixture. Stir in the hot water. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake 45-55 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Sauce
In a small saucepan combine the sugar, molasses, 1/3 cup butter, and evaporated milk. Cook over medium heat and bring to boil. Turn heat down and simmer for 5 minutes, until thickened slightly, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. Pour the sauce over individual servings of warm cake.
Top with vanilla bean ice cream.

Description: 
This may have become my new favorite fall dessert. It certainly rivals my favorite pumpkin cheesecake. Serve it warm, topped with vanilla ice cream.Modified from: Favorite Old Fashioned Gingerbread
