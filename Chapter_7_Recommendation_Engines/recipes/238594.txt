Description: 
This colorful 7-layer salad has made numerous appearances at our family gatherings over the years. My Nana has no shortage of delicious recipes from appetizers to desserts that she has passed down to me since I began cooking. This salad is not only yummy, but it's so quick and easy to prepare and definitely one of my all-time favorites!
