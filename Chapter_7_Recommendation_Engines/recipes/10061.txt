Ingredients:
8 ounces almond paste
1 ½ cups butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
4  eggs, separated
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon almond extract
¼ teaspoon salt
4 drops red food coloring
4 drops green food coloring
1 ½ cups apricot jam
1 pound semisweet chocolate, chopped

Directions:
Grease 3 - 13 x 9 inch pans.  Line with wax paper.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Combine almond paste, sugar, butter, egg yolks and almond extract.  Beat for 5 minutes until light and fluffy. Beat in flour and salt.
In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form.  With a wooden spoon, fold into the almond mixture.
Divide dough into 3 -1 1/2 cup portions.  Add red coloring to one of the portions, and green to the another. Spread the batter in the 3 separate prepared pans (keeping the colors separate).
Bake for 15 minutes, or until edges are golden brown.  (Each layer will be 1/4 inch thick). Remove cakes from pan immediately.  Cool thoroughly.
Stack layers in a 9 x 13 inch pan, spreading apricot jam between layers (no jam on top layer). Place second 9 x 13 inch pan on top and weigh down with two 5 pound bags of sugar or flour.  Refrigerate overnight.
Melt chocolate over hot water and spread over cake.  Allow to set.  Trim edges and cup into 1 inch squares.
