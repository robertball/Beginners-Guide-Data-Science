Ingredients:
4 chicken breasts, shredded
1/4 cup olive oil
1 med onion, coarsely chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
1 red pepper, chopped
2-4 cloves garlic, crushed and chopped
1-2 jalapenos, finely chopped
2 tsp cumin
2 tsp chili powder
1 tsp dried oregano
few dashes cayenne pepper, or hot sauce
3 cups chicken stock
2 cans (540ml) white kidney beans
2 cups grated old cheddar
1 1/2 cups sour cream
Freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat half the olive oil in large pot over medium high. Brown chicken breasts until golden. Let cool and then shred.
To same pan, add the rest of the oil; sauté onions and red and green peppers just until onions become translucent, about 8-10 minutes. Add garlic, jalapenos, cumin, chili powder, oregano and cayenne or hot sauce and sauté another minute or two. Add chicken stock and bring to a boil. Use wooden spoon to scrape up and dissolve any caramelized bits from the bottom of the pan.
Return cooked, shredded chicken to the pot. Add beans. Gently stir to combine and reduce to simmer. Add sour cream and cheddar cheese, stirring gently until cheese melts. Let simmer for at least half an hour.

We adore this recipe! We do leave the cheese out and serve ourselves, since my husband is not a lover of cheese.
