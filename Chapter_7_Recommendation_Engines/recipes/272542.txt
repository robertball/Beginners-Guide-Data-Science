Ingredients:
⅓ cup water
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons vinegar
1 ½ tablespoons soy sauce
1 ½ teaspoons sesame oil
1 teaspoon garlic paste
1 teaspoon fish sauce
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
2 teaspoons tapioca flour
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1  green bell pepper, sliced into strips
4 ounces portobello mushrooms, sliced
1 small onion, cut into wedges
8 ounces skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
2 cloves garlic, sliced
½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger

Directions:
Combine water, brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic paste, fish sauce, and oyster sauce in a bowl. Dissolve tapioca flour in soy sauce mixture to make the sauce. Set aside.
Heat sesame oil in a large wok. Add bell pepper, mushrooms, and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook until chicken is no longer pink inside and juices run clear, about 5 minutes. Add sliced garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in sauce. Cook and stir until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This stir-fry is flavorful and full of assorted vegetables. I use the Better than Bouillon(<sup>&reg;</sup>) garlic paste in my sauce, but feel free to use a different brand. Serve with cooked rice or chow mein noodles.
