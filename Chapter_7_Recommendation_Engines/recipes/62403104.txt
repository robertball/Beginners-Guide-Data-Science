Ingredients:
1 pound shrimp
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon pepper
pinch of parsley, finely chopped

Directions:
2 hours prior to grilling, prepare the marinade. Mix olive oil, lemon juice, pepper, parsley, and garlic. Place marinade in large freezer bag.
Rinse and dry thawed shrimp. Add to marinade and place bag in refrigerator until ready to grill.
Remove shrimp from marinade and discard marinade. If using metal or steel skewers, lightly coat them with oil. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 15 minutes, this will prevent the skewers from catching on fire on the grill. Place shrimp on skewers (about 5 per skewer).
Spray the grill lightly with cooking oil to prevent sticking. Add shrimp kebabs. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until shrimp turns pink. Do not overcook.
Serve shrimp kebabs over a bed of rice with fresh lemon wedges.
