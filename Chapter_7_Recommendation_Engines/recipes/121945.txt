Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter (no substitutes), softened
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add flour and extracts. Mix until dough forms a ball and pulls away from the side of the bowl. Stir in lemon peel if desired. Press into an ungreased 9-in. square baking pan. Score with a sharp knife into 16 squares. Prick each square twice with a fork. Sprinkle with pecans; press firmly into dough. Bake at 325 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned and pecans are toasted. Cool for 5 minutes. Cut along scored lines. Cool completely in pan on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container.
