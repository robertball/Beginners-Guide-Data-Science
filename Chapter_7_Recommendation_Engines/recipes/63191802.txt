Ingredients:
2 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
1 bottle buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's Original Buffalo Wing Sauce)
1/2 package dry Hidden Valley fiesta ranch dressing mix
1/2 cup light ranch dressing
4 slices light pepper jack cheese
4 slices light sharp cheddar
1/2 cup blue cheese (optional)
8 slices bread (I use whole wheat)
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, divided into 8 tablespoons

Directions:
Place the chicken breast halves on the bottom of a slow cooker.  Pour the bottle of hot sauce on the chicken.  Sprinkle the chicken with half the dry fiesta ranch dressing mix.  Cook on low for 4 or 5 hours.  Shred the chicken and place it back in the crockpot.  Mix in the light ranch dressing.
Meanwhile spread 1/2 the butter on one side of 8 slices of bread.  Place 4 slices of bread, butter side down, in a skillet over medium heat.  On top of each slice of bread, place 1 slice cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup chicken mixture, 1 tablespoon blue cheese (optional), and 1 slice pepper jack cheese and top with the other slice of bread, dry side down (butter side up).  Grill the sandwiches about 3 or 4 minutes on each side or until golden brown and the cheese has melted.
Enjoy!

Description: 
I combined buffalo chicken and fiesta ranch dressing with grilled cheese to come up with these awesome grilled cheese sandwiches.  If you like spicy foods, this is a great sandwich.  If you want to use regular ranch dressing mix that works great as well.
