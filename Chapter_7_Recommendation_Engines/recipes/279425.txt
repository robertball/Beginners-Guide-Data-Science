Ingredients:
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
10 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 ½ pounds frozen wontons
1 teaspoon dried parsley
½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 cups thinly sliced bok choy
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce (such as Bragg®)
4 medium (4-1/8" long)s green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:

Description: 
This is similar to wonton soup but is much quicker when using the Instant Pot® and store-bought frozen wontons. I've used chicken wontons but any protein will work. Great for those nights when you only have the time or energy to slice bok choy and chop ginger and garlic.
