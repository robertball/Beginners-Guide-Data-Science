Directions:
Put all ingredients into bread machine.
Set to dough cycle and run.
Cut dough into 24 pieces.
Roll each piece into a rope and make a knot with the dough, tucking the edges under so they don't "pop" when they bake.

Brush with mixture of egg and water.
Sprinkle with poppy seed or sesame seeds or leave plain.
Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
