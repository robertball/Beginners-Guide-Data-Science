Add the chicken broth plus 2 cups of water, stir and bring it to a boil over high heat.  Lower the heat and let the chili simmer, partially covered, for one hour.
Add the hominy.  Continue to cook until the turkey is tender, which takes approximately 15 minutes.
Taste and adjust the seasoning and serve with cilantro, scallions and sour cream as a topping.
