Here is a super simple honey garlic shrimp recipe, all done in the comfort of your skillet. It’s yummy, it’s healthy and oh so easy to make. Just five ingredient easy and less than 15 minutes cooking time easy. Shrimp cooks so quickly, it’s such a great fast fix for any meal of the day. I usually use jumbo peeled shrimp with tail on for these,but you can use whatever kind of shrimp you like or can easily get your hands on.
