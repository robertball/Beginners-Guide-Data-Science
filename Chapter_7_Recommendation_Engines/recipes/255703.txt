Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil, or as needed
5 cups unsalted cashews
1/4 cup dried rosemary
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 pinch garlic powder
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat; add enough olive oil to completely coat the bottom. Stir cashews into the hot oil until evenly coated and cover skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cashews are toasted and golden, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to low and gradually mix rosemary, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, and pepper into cashews until well coated. Cover skillet and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.

Description: 
This recipe is one that I love to make when the weather turns colder. This one I have to post but it's originally from my dad. It's quick and easy for gatherings or a healthy snack. Also a lot of fun to experiment with different seasoning combinations. This is also a great football party snack.
