Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon salt
6 egg whites
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1 cup grated unpeeled zucchini
1 cup grated carrot
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan with non-stick spray. Sift together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt in a large bowl until well blended.
Beat egg whites with a mixer until light and frothy. Stir in applesauce, brown sugar, zucchini, carrots, and vanilla until well combined. Mix in the raisins and pecans. Add the flour mixture, stirring just until blended. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Cool bread in pans for 10 minutes, then remove, and cool completely on a wire rack.
