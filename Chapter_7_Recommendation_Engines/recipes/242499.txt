Ingredients:
1 (8.8 ounce) package UNCLE BEN'S速 Ready Rice速 Long Grain & Wild
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup reduced-sodium black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup frozen sweet corn, thawed
2 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Prepare rice according to package directions.
Mix rice, shredded cheese, beans, corn, green onions, together in a bowl.
Place a quarter of the mixture on one side of each tortilla. Top with about 2 tablespoons of mild salsa. Gently fold each tortilla in half.
