Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package gluten-free elbow pasta
1 cup mayonnaise (such as Best Foods(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2 tablespoons chipotle ranch dressing (such as Wish-Bone(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2 (10 ounce) cans chicken breast, drained
Â½ cup chopped green onions
1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 (3.8 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
1 tablespoon celery seed
1 tablespoon dill
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon ground thyme
1 pint grape tomatoes

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add elbow pasta to the boiling water and cook, stirring for the first 2 minutes and occasionally thereafter, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes total or according to package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop cooking. Transfer to a large bowl.
Spread 1/4 cup mayonnaise on top of the cooked pasta and add chipotle ranch dressing. Mix throughout to keep pasta from sticking. Add chicken breast meat, green onions, mushrooms, olives, celery seed, dill, onion powder, and thyme. Gently stir together with the pasta. Add remaining mayonnaise to desired consistency. Add grape tomatoes and mix gently, being careful not to break any. Refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is perfect if you have IBS and have to be careful with what food goes into your body. Every ingredient in the recipe falls under the Low FODMAP foods. I have to eat gluten free, so I made my own version of pasta salad. I start with a whole box or bag, 12 or 14 ounces, of gluten-free pasta. This recipe can also be cut in half if you would like. Enjoy!
