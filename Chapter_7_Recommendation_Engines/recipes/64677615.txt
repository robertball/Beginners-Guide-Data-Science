Ingredients:
1-1/2 cups butter, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 whole eggs
2 egg whites
1 tsp almond extract
3-1/4 all purpose flour
3/4 tsp salt
1-1/2 cups cornflake crumbs
1 cup seedless raspberry jam

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Cream butter at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Add sugar and continue at medium speed about another 2 minutes.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add almond flavouring and mix well.
In a separate bowl, stir together flour and salt.
Stir flour mixture into butter mixture until well combined.
Beat two egg whites in a small bowl and set aside.
Roll cookies into balls, using about 1 - 1-1/2 tbsp per ball.
Dip each ball into egg whites, then roll in cornflake crumbs.
Place cookies on parchment lined cookie sheet and indent using finger or tip of thumb, or something similar sized (I used the tip of a coffee scoop).
Pour jam into a sealable sandwich bag.  Trim one corner and use to pipe jam into indent (I used about 1/2 tsp per cookie).
Bake for 18 minutes.  Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to cooling rack.
