Ingredients:
1 C balsamic vinegar
1/4 C honey
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp lemon juice

2. Preheat grill to medium high-heat.  Place naan flatbreads on grill; grill for 2-3 minutes, until there are slight char marks.  Remove from grill.
3. Spread ricotta or goat cheese on the charred side of he flatbread.  Top with peach slices and prosciutto.  Sprinkle with basil.  Drizzle with balsamic reduction.
