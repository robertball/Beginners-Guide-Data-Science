Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 a large onion, finely diced
4 cloves garlic, finely diced
1/2 t pepper
1 tsp salt
2 tsp Italian Seasoning
1/4 cup dry red wine
23 ounce bottle crushed tomatoes
28 ounce tin San Marzano type tomatoes, crushed with a fork
2 tsp fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Press the saute button and adjust the setting to low.
Place the ground beef in the instant pot and season with salt and pepper.
Cook until browned, drain and set aside.
Add the onions, garlic and Italian Seasoning and  saute until the onions are tender, about 5 minutes.
Turn the saute off and then turn it back on again but to high heat.
Saute for 4-5 minutes, stirring infrequently to allow the brown bits to form on the bottom of the pot.
Deglaze with the wine.
Add both tomatoes and meat , stir.
Place the lid on the pot and close the vent.
Use the manual setting and adjust time to 10 minutes.
Allow a 5 minute natural release and then release any additional pressure.
Add the lemon juice and simmer for 3-4 minutes
Note: You can use 1T each Basil, Oregano, Parsley and a pinch of Red Pepper Flakes if you don't have the Italian Seasoning.
