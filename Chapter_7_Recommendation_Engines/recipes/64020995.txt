Kale Tabbouleh with quinoa Recipe

Ingredients:
Serves 6 to 8
1 bunch curly parsley (or 2 if the bunch is small)
1/2 bunch curly kale
1 pint grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise
2 persian cucumbers or 1/2 english cucumber, diced
1 shallot, finely diced
1/4 cup quinoa
1/4 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice
1/4 cup good extra virgin olive oil ( I usually use 1/8th and add a bit more lemon juice)
Salt to taste

Directions:
Cook the quinoa as directed, then set aside to cool.
Wash the parsley and gather it back into a bunch. Starting at the leafy top, cut perpendicular to the stems in 1/2- or 1/4-inch cuts until you reach the point where there's nothing left but stems. Discard the stems. You will have a large, fluffy pile of parsley on your cutting board. There will be some stems in there too, but it's ok.
Repeat step 2 with the kale.
Chop the pile of greens on your board with a knife or cleaver until the pieces of parsley and kale are no larger than 1/4 inch. It should be pretty fine, but you don't want it to turn into a paste.
Move your greens to a large mixing bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Mix well. The salad can be eaten right away, or kept in the fridge for up to three days. If you make it in advance, toss the salad again before serving to redistribute the juices

I got this recipe from a good friend. I absolutely love it. 

It is a refreshing and surprisingly healthy salad. You can have it as a side dish or for a heartier meal,throw some grilled chicken on it and enjoy !!
