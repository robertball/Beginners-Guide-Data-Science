Ingredients:
Dressing:
1 cup grapes
1/2 cup fish sauce
2 tablespoons lime juice, or more to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon sweet chile sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
Salad:
1 teaspoon canola oil
1 pound jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 eggplant, diced
cooking spray
5 cups thinly sliced bok choy
1 1/2 cups pea shoots
1 cup shredded carrots
1/2 cup thinly sliced cucumbers
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1/4 cup chopped roasted peanuts
1/4 cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place grapes in a food processor or blender; process until pureed. Whisk pureed grapes, fish sauce, lime juice, garlic, chile sauce, and salt together in a bowl until dressing is well combined.
Spoon about 2 tablespoons dressing and oil into a bowl; add shrimp. Reserve remaining dressing for the salad. Refrigerate shrimp until chilled and marinated, 15 to 20 minutes.
Place eggplant in a roasting pan and spray with enough cooking spray to coat.
Roast eggplant in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes. Transfer eggplant to the reserved dressing.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove shrimp from marinade and discard marinade.
Cook shrimp on the hot grill until visibly pink on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip shrimp and cook until cooked through but not dry, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove shrimp from grill and allow to rest.
Combine bok choy, pea shoots, carrots, cucumbers, mint, cilantro, peanuts, and green onions in a large bowl; add eggplant with dressing and shrimp and toss well.

Description: 
This is the tastiest shrimp salad without any guilt: only a trace of oil makes it perfect for serving any dieter. If you want to feel healthy, but enjoy your food, this is the salad for you. You may want to garnish with additional green onions and chopped peanuts, but I find that placing the shrimp on the top is garnish enough.
