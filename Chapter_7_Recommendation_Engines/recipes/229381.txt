Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) package cherry-flavored gelatin (such as JELL-O®)
2 cups hot water
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, juice drained and reserved
3 bananas, sliced
1 1/2 cups cold water
1 cup miniature marshmallows, or as needed
3/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 egg
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Dissolve gelatin completely in 2 cups hot water and pour into desired mold. Mix crushed pineapple, bananas, and 1 1/2 cup cold water into gelatin mixture; top with miniature marshmallows. Chill until firm.
Whisk reserved pineapple juice, sugar, flour, and egg in a saucepan over low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture almost comes to a simmer and becomes thick, about 5 minutes. Mix cream cheese into sauce, transfer to a large bowl,  and cool to room temperature. Stir whipped topping into cream cheese mixture. Spread over gelatin. Chill thoroughly before serving.
