Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package firm tofu
1 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons maple syrup
2  green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons Korean red pepper powder (optional)
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
3 cloves minced garlic
1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
7 ounces vegan lo mein noodles
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1  onion, sliced
1 (10 ounce) package broccoli coleslaw mix
Â½ (8 ounce) package coleslaw mix
1 tablespoon coconut oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for 20 to 30 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated liquid. Dice into bite-sized cubes.
Combine soy sauce, 3 tablespoons sesame oil, maple syrup, green onions, red pepper powder, sesame seeds, garlic, and liquid smoke in a bowl. Fold in tofu and cover with plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator to soak for no longer than 1 hour. Drain tofu, reserving marinade. Spread tofu evenly on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lo mein noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.
Combine coconut oil and 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute onion until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add broccoli coleslaw mix and coleslaw mix; saute until wilted, about 3 minutes more. Reduce heat to medium-low; add cooked noodles, baked tofu, and reserved marinade. Simmer until heated through and all liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
