Ingredients:
1-2 tablespoons butter
2 cups fresh or canned corn
1-2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup yellow onion
1/4 cup bell pepper (or not)
1/4 cup green onions
1 jalapeno, diced (I only used 1/2 a jalapeno. I'm a wimp.)
1 clove garlic, diced
1/4 cup mayo
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1-2 handfuls monterey jack cheese
1-2 handfuls cheddar
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in pan.
Add corn. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for about 5 minutes, until corn starts to brown, stirring occasionally. Set aside.
Melt butter in pan and add onions and bell pepper. Cook for about 2 minutes, until onions are soft.
Add in the jalapeno, green onions, and garlic. Cook another two minutes, until softened.
Dump jalapeno and onion mixture into the bowl of corn. Add in 1-2 handfuls of monterey jack cheese, mayo, and cayenne pepper. Stir to combine.
Spread in a baking dish and cover the top with shredded cheddar cheese.
Bake for about 15 minutes, or until warmed through and the top has browned.
Serve warm with tortilla chips. Die happy.
