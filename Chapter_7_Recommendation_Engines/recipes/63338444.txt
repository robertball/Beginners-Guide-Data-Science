Ingredients:
1/2 lb ground pork
1/2 Tbs cooking oil
1 clove garlic, minced
4 cups squash - Can use cucuzza, opo, or summer/zucchini squashs
1 tsp salt
2 (15-oz) cans (or 1 quart homemade) chicken broth
2 cups water
2 (1oz) bouillon cubes/packets
1 1/2 tsp fresh minced parsley (or 1/2 tsp dried parsley)
Cooked white rice

Directions:
Fully peel squash (discarding all outer shell and all hard seeds), then cut pulp into 3/4" or so cubes.
In a wok (or heavy pot), heat oil.  Carefully add ground pork and very lightly brown ground pork, breaking up the meat as it cooks.
Add garlic and cook until just fragrant (~30 seconds)
Add squash and salt.
Cook on high heat (covered), for 2-3 minutes, lifting lid and stirring only 2-3 times.
Add chicken broth, water, and dried chicken bouillon packets - stir and bring to a boil on high heat (uncovered).
Lower heat to medium-low and simmer (about 18-20 minutes) uncovered until all pieces of squash are tender and mostly transparent, stirring occasionally.
Let cool for a few minutes, then de-grease top, as desired.
Stir in parsley, return to a boil, and then turn heat off
Serve immediately over warm cooked white rice..

Description: 
We used to have a cucuzza squash tree when I was little, and I loved this soup - yes, even as a little kid, this was good!  If you can't find these squash, you can use more common ones like summer or zucchini.
