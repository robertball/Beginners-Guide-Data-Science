Ingredients:
1lb tomatos, diced
1 medium yellow onion, finely diced
1 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp dried oregano or 2 Tbls fresh
Handful fresh basil, chopped
1/2 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs
4 large zucchinis
1/2 cup cheddar jack, shredded

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large bowl, stir together first six ingredients until just combined.
Halve the zucchinis length-wise to create 6 "boats".
Foil a rimmed baking sheet and lightly coat with cooking spray.
Stuff each of the zucchini boats with equal amounts of the tomato filling and place filling-side up on the baking sheet.
Bake for 20-30 minutes or until zucchini is tender when tested with a fork.
Sprinkle shredded cheese evenly onto boats and return to oven for 5 more minutes to melt cheese.

Description: 
If your bumper zucchini crop is overwhelming you, went overboard at the farmer's market, or trying to find a way to use these often-gifted squashes, utilize this recipe for a quick and hot veggie main dish. Try serving as a side dish to any grilled meat or as a sneaky healthy kid-friendly entree.  Switch up the cheese topping to shredded smoked Gouda or any shredded cheese. Great for the slightly overgrown or ugly zucchini.  The same recipe works for yellow summer squash, too.
