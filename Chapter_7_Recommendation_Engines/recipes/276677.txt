Ingredients:
2 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup shredded coconut
1 cup pumpkin puree

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper.
Mix together flour, baking powder, ginger, cloves, baking soda, and nutmeg in a bowl.
Combine butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until butter is incorporated and mixture is smooth. Add eggs and beat on medium speed until light and creamy. Add coconut and pumpkin puree and mix until blended. Add flour mixture and mix until smooth.  Drop teaspoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on top, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
