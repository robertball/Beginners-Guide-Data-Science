1 C. mayonnaise
1 C. sour cream

1/4 C. mushrooms (rinsed and sliced into 1/4-inch pieces)

Directions:
Combine remaining ingredients, except tomatoes in food processor. Blend well at low speed. Add tomatoes and slowly mix by hand for about 1 minute. When ready to serve, heat through in microwave oven. Remove from microwave and sprinkle with Asiago cheese. Put in broiler and heat until cheese browns.
Squeeze all water out of tomatoes, then julienne cut into fine strips. It is important that all water be removed from tomatoes, and they must be added last, or dip will discolor. Served with crostini or crackers.
