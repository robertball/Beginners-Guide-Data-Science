Ingredients:
2 lbs pork fat ground
2 lbs ground pork
2 onions finely chopped
1 tsp clove
3/4 tsp nutmeg
salt & pepper to tast

Directions:
Put all ingredients into a good size pot cover with water, bring to boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.  The longer you simmer the gorton, the better the flavor will be.  Every so ofter, use a potatoe masher to mash the ingredients.  Add more water as needed during the simmer time.  When you're ready to stop cooking, let all liquid reduce as much as possible with letting it burn.  Place gorton in a container in the fridg overnight.  Left over fat will solidify at the top by morning and can be scraped and removed.

Description: 
French Canadian pork spread for toast and crackers....This was my memere's recipe and so far I have ever had any better.  Very simple to make :)I guess from what I read, Croton and Gorton are almost the same, Gorton being the New Englander translation :) Enjoy
