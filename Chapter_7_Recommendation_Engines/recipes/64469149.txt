Description: 
A family favorite of ours, since the days of the dinosaurs, we now substitute almond milk for triceratop milk. We are still amazed that our ancestors had mites similar to those of today, and actually shaped these no-bake cookies to look like the mite  which of course, was a nuisance, even back then, making it enjoyable to eat a mock look-a-like!
