Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 large banana, mashed
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg white
2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup black sesame seeds
1/3 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.
Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl. Mix banana, white sugar, brown sugar, egg white, milk, canola oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture just until batter is moistened. Fold sesame seeds and walnuts into batter; pour into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in pan before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
