Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked white quinoa
1/2 sweet potato (peeled & grated, about 1 cup total)
1 1/4 cup water
1/2 cup corn kernels (canned, drained)
2 T. Energ-G (or 2 1/2 T. corn starch, or 2 1/2 T. ground flaxseeds)
1 t. red Tabasco sauce (or to taste)
1 1/2 T. Chipolte mustard (or flavor of choice)
3/4 to 1 cup water

Directions:
Put quinoa and sweet potato into pot with water. Bring to boil, cover, let simmer for 20 minutes (until the water is gone). Turn off heat and let sit for 5 minutes (still covered). Uncover, let cool to room temperature.
Add quinoa & sweet potato mixture to blender or food processor (preferred). Pulse the mixture a few times.
Add rest of the ingredients, with the water added in between pulse blends, gradually increasing processing until a smooth pancake-like batter is achieved.
