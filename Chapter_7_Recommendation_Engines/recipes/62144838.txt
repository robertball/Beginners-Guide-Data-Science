Title:
Zesty Shrimp Dip with Light Horseradish Sauce Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
12 oz. salad shrimp
1/4 cup [fat-free] mayonnaise
1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
2 tsp. minced onion
Splash of vegetable oil or olive oil
1/4 cup cocktail sauce
1 tsp. fresh horseradish
1 box of your favorite snack crackers

Directions:
Briefly pulse shrimp in food processor.
Stir in mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, and onion. I usually go a little light on the mayo.
Pack into mold. To prevent sticking, you can line the mold with a thin coat of vegetable oil or olive oil if desired.
Cover and refrigerate for one hour.
Mix a small amount of cocktail sauce (however much you need to cover the mold - 1/4 cup should be more than enough) with a tiny amount of horseradish. Because some people hate horseradish, adjust this amount to taste.
After one hour, flip mold upside down and remove shrimp dip. Cover with cocktail sauce mixture.
Serve with light, buttery crackers and enjoy. We usually use Club or wheat crackers, but whatever you have on hand will do.
