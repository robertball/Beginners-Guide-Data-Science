Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup sugar
1 head romaine lettuce
1 (14 oz) bag baby spinach
Seeds from 1 pomegranate (1 cup)
2 ripe pears that are still a little firm
Juice of 1 lime
4 oz. crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Spray a sheet of aluminum foil with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.
Combine pecans and sugar in a small nonstick skillet. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar melts and coats the nuts (about 15 minutes). Place on the prepared foil and set aside.
Toss together lettuce, spinach, pomegranate seeds, pears, lime juice, and cheese, adding the candied pecans right before serving. Drizzle vinaigrette over salad and serve.
