1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
1 cup NESTLE® TOLL HOUSE® Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels
1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups NESTLE® TOLL HOUSE® Delightfulls Cherry Flavored Morsels, divided
1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds
Cream Cheese Topping:

To serve, coarsely chop remaining 1/4 cup DelightFulls Morsels.  Spoon 1 teaspoon of Cream Cheese Topping onto each brownie bar.  Sprinkle with chopped DelightFulls morsels.
