Ingredients:
1 refrigerated ready-to-bake pie crust
Crumb Toppiing
1/2 cup plus 2 T all-purpose flour
1/3 cup each packed light-brown sugar and granulated sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1 stick cold butter, cut in small pieces
Fillling
7 medium to large tart apples (about 3 1/4 pounds), such as Granny Smith
1 T lemon juice
1/2 cup granulated sugar
4 T all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
1. Have ready a 9-inch pie plate and a baking sheet. Place oven rack on lowest rack position in the oven. Heat oven to 450 degrees.
2. Line pie plate with pie crust as package directs. Flyte or crimp edge.
3.  Topping: Mix flour, brown and granulated sugar, and the cinnamon in a medium bowl. Cut in butter until mixture forms moist, coarse crumbs that clump together easily.
4. Filling: Peel, halve and core apples. Cut in 1/8-inch-thick slices by hand. Place in a large bowl, add lemon juice and toss to coat. Mix remaining ingredients in a small bowl, sprinkle over apple slices and toss to coat.
5. Layer apple slices in pie shell, mounding them higher in center. Gently pat topping evenly over apples to form a top crust. Place pie on the baking sheet to catch any drips.
6. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce over temperature to 350 and bake 45 minutes longer, or until a skewer meets some resistance when center of pie is pierced and topping is golden brown. Cool pie completely on a wire rack
