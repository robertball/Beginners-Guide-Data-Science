Ingredients:
cooking spray
Crust:
1 cup rolled oats
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 cup shredded sweetened coconut
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup maple syrup
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Filling:
3 cups sliced fresh strawberries
3 tablespoons maple sugar, or as needed
1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon orange juice
1/4 teaspoon grated orange zest

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with enough parchment to have overhang on all sides. Lightly grease parchment with cooking spray.
Stir together oats, whole wheat flour, coconut, almonds, ginger, and salt in a large bowl. Add 1/2 cup maple syrup, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Stir until mixture is thoroughly combined. Reserve 1 cup of the crust mixture to use as the topping. Press the rest of the crust mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Combine strawberries, 3 tablespoons maple syrup, cornstarch, orange juice, and orange zest in a bowl. Toss to combine until there are no longer any dry lumps of cornstarch. Pour strawberry mixture evenly over the crust.
Sprinkle reserved crust mixture over the strawberries and lightly press down into strawberry mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven, until the top is golden brown and strawberries are bubbling, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool completely in pan. Remove from pan using parchment "handles" and slice into bars.

Description: 
A strawberry-orange filling, combined with a coconut-almond-oatmeal crust, makes for fruity and flavorful bar! Adjust the amount of maple syrup used in the filling according to the sweetness of your strawberries--and feel free to use brown sugar instead of maple syrup, if you prefer.
