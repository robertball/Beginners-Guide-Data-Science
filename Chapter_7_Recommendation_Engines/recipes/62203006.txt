Ingredients:
1 7 pound bone-in ham. Butt or Shank will do
1/2 cup Light corn syrup
1/2 cup Honey
1/4 cup Molasses
1/4 cup unsalted Butter

Directions:
Start out by scoring the ham about 1/4 inch deep, if your ham is a spiral cut there is no need for this step unless you prefer the look of a "diamond" cut ham. The oven should be preheated to 325 degrees and the cooking time is 10 minutes per pound. Heat butter right to the point of partial liquid state. Then mix all ingredients in a medium mixing bowl until well blended with a smooth light-brown appearance. Then baste the ham with a brush until completely covered. Place in a cooking pan at least 1.5 inches deep at its deepest point and cover with aluminum foil (shiny side up!). Place in the oven. Remove ham every 20 minutes to baste, repeat this until cooking time depletes. Once cooking time depletes remove the aluminum foil cover, turn oven setting to broil and return ham uncovered to oven. Broil for 4 minutes or until you notice the glaze on the ham slightly darken in color. Remove from oven and let stand for 10 minutes before carving, serving and enjoying!

Description: 
I created this glaze this past Thanksgiving holiday to cover a ham. My usual recipe called for brown sugar which I neglected to buy when doing my holiday grocery shopping. In my compromise I created a glaze so amazing it would be a crime not to share it with the world.
