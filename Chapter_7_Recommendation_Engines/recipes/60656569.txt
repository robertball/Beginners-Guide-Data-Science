Ingredients:
1/2 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 tablespoon butter, melted
3 apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
3/8 cup all-purpose flour
3/8 cup chopped blanched almonds
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons butter, chilled
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 egg yolks
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/3 cup dry Marsala wine

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix flour, almonds, 1/2 cup sugar, and cinnamon together.  Add chilled butter and vanilla extract.  Cut together with a pastry blender until small crumbs form.
Unfold pastry and cut into a 10 inch circle.  Place on a large, ungreased baking sheet.  Brush with melted butter or margarine.  Arrange apples in the center of the pastry, leaving a 1/2 inch wide border of pastry.  Spoon almond topping gently over the apples, being careful it doesn't spill over the edges of the pastry.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
Place egg yolks and 3 tablespoons sugar in the top of a double boiler over simmering water.  Beat mixture constantly with a portable electric mixer.  When foamy, add the marsala; continue to beat until the mixture begins to thicken.  Do not overcook, or the mixture will curdle.  Remove from heat. Serve warm over the apple crumble.
