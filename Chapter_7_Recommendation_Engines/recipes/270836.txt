Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 red onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound ground beef
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained

Turn off Instant Pot(R).
Stir in kidney beans, pinto beans, black beans, diced tomatoes, beef stock, tomato paste, chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, oregano, cumin, and paprika. Close and lock the lid.
