Description: 
We buy cheaper (and tougher) cuts of meat to help save money.  I ended up throwing this together one day and it turned out wonderfully fork tender.  It's a versatile recipe - add or subtract whatever you want, but make sure you seal the foil pack tightly to assure the steam released helps slow cook the steak.  Note, if adding mushrooms - used CANNED, fresh will make this watery.
