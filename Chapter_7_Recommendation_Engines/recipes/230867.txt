Ingredients:
1 pound ground chicken
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg
1/4 cup hot wing sauce
1/2 cup warm water, or as needed
12 slider-size burger buns

Directions:
Mix ground chicken, bread crumbs, egg, and wing sauce together in a large bowl. Add enough water to the chicken mixture so it is a little sticky; shape into patties about 3 inches in diameter.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in hot skillet until burgers are hot and no longer pink in the middle, about 4 minutes per side. Serve on buns.

Description: 
These burgers are soft and moist. They can also be formed to make larger burgers. Serve with blue cheese dressing for a nice touch. Use more wing sauce for a hotter, more spicy burger.
