Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 pound anduie sausage (such as ConecuhÂ©), cut into 1/4-inch thick slices
1 large onion, chopped
1 cup chopped celery
salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning, or to taste
11 1/2 cup uncooked white rice

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Stir in the sausage, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the onion and celery; season with salt and Cajun seasoning. Cook and stir until the vegetables are soft, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the rice until evenly coated in the vegetable mixture, then pour in the tomatoes with juice, garlic, chicken broth, bay leaves, and thyme leaves. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes.
Remove the pot from the heat, and let stand 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaves before serving.
