Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup granulated sugar (or splenda)
1 cup slightly beaten egg whites (around 7 or 8 egg whites)
1/2 cup plain greek yogurt
1/2 cup canola oil
3 cups finely shredded carrot
2 cups powdered sugar
8 ounces reduced fat cream cheese, softened
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/2 tsp lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Coat a 15-by-10-inch baking pan with cooking spray.  Set aside.
In a medium bowl, stir together flours, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Set aside.
In a large bowl, stir together sugars, egg whites, yogurt and oil.
Stir dry flour mixture into wet egg mixture just until combined.  Do not overmix.
Stir in shredded carrot.
Spread batter in the prepared pan.  Bake until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 25-30 minutes.  Cool completely on a wire rack.
In another medium bowl, using an electric mixer, beat together sifted powdered sugar, cream cheese, vanilla and lemon juice until smooth.
Spread frosting over cooled carrot cake.  Slice into 36 bars.
