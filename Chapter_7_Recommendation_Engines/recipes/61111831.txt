Mark's English Sausage Rolls Recipe

Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package Italian sweet sausage (casings removed)
1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1 cup onion, small dice
1 teaspoon Mrs. Dash. Garlic and Herb Seasoning
1 beaten egg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Sprinkle Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb Seasoning over the loose sausage. In a large high sided skillet over medium-high heat add the sausage meat and onion and cook for 5 to 7 minutes or until sausage it lightly browned; drain and set aside.
Unfold the puff pastry sheets, and cut along the fold lines of each sheet to form 6 equal squares for a total of 12 squares. Brush each square with mustard. Divide sausage into 12 eben stacks; place one stack on each square. Roll dough around the sausage, and seal with a bit of beaten egg. Place rolls onto an ungreased baking sheet, and brush the tops with the rest of the egg.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the rolls are puffed and golden. I usually watch after 10 minutes or so to make sure they don't burn.  These freeze (unbaked) very well.
