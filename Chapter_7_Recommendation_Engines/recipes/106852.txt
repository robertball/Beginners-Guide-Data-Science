Description: 
Mmmmm!! My mouth waters just thinking of this! An Israeli Jewish lady taught this to my grandmother several years ago, and our entire family fell in love with it. It was so good, we served it for a small catered event,  and it was a hit. This is for you if you enjoy Middle Eastern cuisine.
