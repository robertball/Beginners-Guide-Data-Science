Ingredients:
4lbs lean ground beef
1 ½ white chopped onions
4 TBLs minced garlic
1/3 cup chopped pickled jalapenos + ¼ cup juice off the peppers
1 pkg taco seasoning
1 sm can tomato sauce
1 tsp salt
White corn taco shells
½ cup cooking oil

Directions:
Brown ground beef (do not drain).  Set oil and corn shells aside and add remaining ingredients.  Stir well, lower heat, cover and simmer 1 hour.  Stir half way through.  Drain excess juice off meat but keep enough to ensure meat stays moist and juicy.  Fill shells with ¼ cup beef.  Top with your favorite veggies, salsa, avocado, sour cream or whatever else excites your taste buds.
For taco shells: Use a small skillet to heat oil over medium high heat.  Corn shell should sizzle immediately when put into the pan. With two tablespoons to shape shells, move the shell around the pan for 15 seconds and turn, repeat for another 15 seconds and then fold the shell in half.  Spooning the hot oil over the shell, cook for another 15 seconds on each side.  Remove and place shell on paper towel, mouth side down to drain.
