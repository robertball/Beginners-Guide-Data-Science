Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup peanut butter
1 1/4 cups packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups mini candy-coated chocolates

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream butter or margarine, peanut butter, and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in egg and vanilla.  Combine flour, baking soda, and salt; blend into creamed mixture. Stir in 1 1/3 cups mini candy-coated chocolates.
Shape dough into 1 1/4 inch balls.  Place about 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.  Gently flatten to about 1/2 inch thickness.  Place 7 to 8 of the remaining candies on each cookie; press in lightly.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes, or until edges are light brown.  Do not over bake!  Cool about 1 minute on cookie sheets; transfer cookies to wire racks to cool completely.
