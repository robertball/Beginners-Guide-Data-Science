Ingredients:
5 1/2 cups chicken broth, divided
1 cup golden raisins
6 tablespoons butter or margarine, divided
1 cup uncooked wild rice
1 cup uncooked brown rice
1 cup slivered almonds
1/2 cup minced fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a small saucepan, bring 1/2 cup broth to a boil. Remove from the heat; add raisins and set aside (do not drain). In a large saucepan, bring 3 cups of broth and 2 tablespoons of butter to a boil. Add wild rice; cover and simmer for 55-60 minutes or until the rice is tender (drain if necessary).
Meanwhile, in another saucepan, combine the brown rice, 2 tablespoons butter and remaining broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 35-40 minutes or until rice is tender (drain if necessary).
In a skillet, saute the almonds in remaining butter until lightly browned. In a serving bowl, combine the wild rice, brown rice, raisin mixture, almonds, parsley, salt and pepper.

Description: 
Made with both brown rice and wild rice, this popular pilaf has a hint of fruity sweetness, thanks to golden raisins. I prepare the casserole the morning of the party, then refrigerate it in an ovenproof dish to heat through later. -Mark Trinklein, Cedarburg, Wisconsin
