Ingredients:
2 bags microwave popcorn
1 1/2 sticks butter
1 1/2 cups brown sugar, packed
6 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Make popcorn according to package directions.
Meanwhile, melt butter, sugar, syrup and salt in large saucepan over medium heat and stir until combined.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.  Boil for 5 minutes, without stirring.
Preheat oven to 325.
Place popcorn in a large roasting pan.  When caramel is done boiling, remove from heat and stir in baking soda and vanilla.  The caramel will thicken and get lighter.  Pour over popcorn and stir with a rubber spatula to evenly coat popcorn.
Bake at 325 for 15 min.  Remove from oven and stir to evenly coat popcorn with caramel.  Bake for an additional 5-10 min. and stir again to evenly coat.  Let cool slightly and separate on counter or into a bowl.  You may need to separate again after cooled completely, to keep it from all clumping together.
