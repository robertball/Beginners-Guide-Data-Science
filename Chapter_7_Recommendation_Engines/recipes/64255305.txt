Ingredients:
2/3 cup dried, minced onion
3 tsp Parsley flakes
2 tsp Onion powder
2 tsp Turmeric
1 tsp Celery Salt
1 tsp Sea Salt
1 tsp Sugar
½ tsp Ground Pepper

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a jar, then give the jar a good shake.
I’d recommend shaking the jar to mix the ingredients well before each use.
Use 4 TBSP in a recipe in place of 1 packet of Onion soup mix.
