Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, cut in pieces
1 medium yellow, or white onion, chopped
2 pounds yellow summer squash, sliced crosswise about 1/2" thick
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Fry the bacon in a large skillet until very crisp.
When the bacon is almost crisp, throw in the onions and cook them in the drippings along with the bacon.
Add the squash to the skillet with the bacon and onions, and stir.
Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir.
Cover and cook over low heat for about 25 minutes, or until it is as tender as you want it.  If it becomes too dry while it's cooking, add a little water.

Description: 
The good old-fashioned country way.  This is definitely NOT diet food.  You don't drain the bacon fat off after you brown it.  If you really have to, you can substitute butter, but it won't be the same.  You can also use this recipe with a combination of yellow and pattypan squash.
