3 1/2 (16 ounce) packages confectioners' sugar
1 cup butter, melted

2 tablespoons shortening

Directions:
Blend together the peanut butter, sugar and  melted butter. Allow to chill in refrigerator.
Roll into 1 inch round balls and return to refrigerator.
In a double boiler over medium heat, melt the chocolate and shortening. Whisk together until smooth.
With a toothpick inserted in the balls, dip them into the chocolate so they look like buckeyes. Place on waxed paper and allow to set in refrigerator.
