Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
4 cups canned tomatoes
3 slices bread, cubed
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter
2 cups chicken broth
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a Dutch oven or heavy stockpot over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes to onion mixture, crushing with a potato masher. Stir bread, basil, and brown sugar into tomato mixture and simmer until bread is completely saturated and starts to break down, about 10 minutes.
Pour tomato mixture into a blender no more than half full; add butter. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return pureed soup to Dutch oven over medium heat; add broth and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season soup with salt and pepper.
