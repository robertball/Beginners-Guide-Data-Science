Ingredients:
6 ounces sliced jalapeno peppers
1 tomato, diced
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chile peppers
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 onion, diced
1 1/2 tablespoons hot sauce
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 pound ground beef
1 (1 ounce) package burrito seasoning
1 (14 ounce) can refried beans
6 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1 (10 ounce) bag shredded lettuce
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Mix jalapeno peppers, tomato, green chile peppers, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, onion, hot sauce, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl.
Cook beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring to break up clumps, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease. Add jalapeno pepper mixture and burrito seasoning; cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
Pour refried beans into a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Warm each tortilla in the microwave until soft, 15 to 20 seconds. Spread a layer of refried beans on top. Divide beef mixture among tortillas. Top with lettuce, sour cream, and Cheddar cheese. Fold in opposing edges of each tortilla and roll up into a burrito.
