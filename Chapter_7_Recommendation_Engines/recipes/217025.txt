Ingredients:
2 cups shredded coconut
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
3 eggs at room temperature
2 egg yolks at room temperature
1 tablespoon grated lemon zest
1 1/2 pints fresh raspberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread the coconut onto a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until lightly toasted and golden, about 10 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Mix the coconut and 1/2 cup melted butter in a bowl, and chill until it begins to firm, about 15 minutes. Pat the coconut mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie dish. Chill until set, at least 30 minutes.
Place sugar, 1/2 cup of butter, lemon juice, eggs, and egg yolks in a saucepan. Place over low heat, and whisk constantly until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Do not boil. Strain the custard through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, and stir in the lemon zest. Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the custard, and chill thoroughly.
Spoon the lemon custard into the coconut crust, and top with fresh raspberries.

I am a pastry chef and I have developed many desserts that can be served at Passover. This shouldn't be prepared just for the holiday - it's great all year long!
