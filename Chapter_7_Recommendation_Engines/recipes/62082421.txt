Ingredients:
4 1/2 - 5 cups bread flour (all purpose flour may be used)
1/4 c. sugar
1 1/2 t. salt
2 packages active dry yeast
1 c. milk, scalded to 125 deg and cooled
6 tbs butter melted, divided (4 + 2)
2 eggs, lightly beaten
GLAZE:
1 egg
1 tbs milk

Directions:
- Combine flour, sugar, salt & yeast.  Mix well.  Stir in milk, 4 tbs melted butter & eggs.
-  Using a heavy duty stand mixer with dough hook or on a lightly floured surface, knead dough until smooth and elastic, about 5-10 minutes.  Shape into a ball.
- Grease large bowl with olive oil, place dough in bowl and turn to coat.  Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, approx. 1 - 1 1/2 hrs.
Shaping Rolls:
- Preheat oven to 400 (if baking same day).  Grease 24 muffin pan cups.  Punch down dough with fists, divide in half.
- On lightly floured surface, roll one dough half to an 1/8" thick rectangle to measure 9"x18".  Brush with half of the reserved 2 tbs of butter.
- Cut dough into 1 1/2" wide strips.  Stack 6 strips on top of each other.
- Cut the dough stacks into 1 1/2" pieces.
- Place pieces cut sides up in muffin pan cups.  Repeat with 2nd half of dough.
- Cover and let rise 15 min. in warm place or cover with damp towel and let rise in the fridge for 8-24hours then remove from fridge when ready to preheat the oven.
-  Mix 1 egg & 1 tbs milk for glaze and brush on tops of rolls.
-  Bake 12-15 until golden.  Cool slightly on wire racks, serve warm.

Description: 
These rolls always disappear quickly.  They back to a nice golden color and are soft and buttery.  Well worth the effort it takes to make them.  Kids love to knead the dough.  
This bread can be made through the shaping stage and placed in the fridge for 8-24 hours for the second rising. These rolls freeze well for up to 3 months.  You can also add herbs, garlic, or cheese to the layers to change the flavor.  We love the basic recipe as it is.
