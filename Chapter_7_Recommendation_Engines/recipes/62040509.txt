Ingredients:
3 c. All Bran cereal
1 c. boiling water
2 1/2 c. whole wheat flour
1 cup brown sugar(scant)
2 1/1 ts.p baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
3/4 c. apple sauce
1/2 c. egg substitute (I use 3 egg whites)
2 c. skim milk

Directions:
Set oven for 375 deg.
Pour boiling water over cereal and set aside.  In another bowl combine the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt.
In third bowl combine the apple sauce, egg substitue and milk
Add to softened cereal
Add flour mixture to all the above. Mix until combined.
Bake in non stick muffin tins for 15-20 mins. (I say 20-20 mins.)
This makes a lot of  good sized muffins.  Batter may be kept in fridge up to three weeks.

Description: 
This is the best Weight Watcher muffin I have found and believe me I've tried a number. I add 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla just because my mother said you always should!!  Dates and or raisins are a great addition. Fresh cranberries & a squirt of orange juice is good also. 
Hard to believe a large muffin is only 1 pt.  Enjoy
