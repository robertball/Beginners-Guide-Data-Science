Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts
5 medium carrots, peeled and chopped (1 3/4 cups)
1 medium yellow onion, chopped (1 1/2 cups)
4 stalks celery, chopped (1 1/4 cups)
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons olive oil
6 cups low-sodium chicken broth (3 - 15 oz cans)
1 cup water
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
2 bay leaves
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 cups uncooked whole wheat egg noodles
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Saltine crackers, for serving (optional)

Directions:
In the bowl of a slow cooker combine the raw chicken, carrots, onion, celery, garlic, olive oil, chicken broth, water, thyme, rosemary, bay leaves, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and cook on low until the chicken is cooked through, about 6 hours. You can also cook on high for about 3 1/2 hours.
Remove the cooked chicken to a cutting board an let rest for 10 minutes. Cut into bite-sized chunks. Add the egg noodles and parsley to the slow cooker, increase temperature to high, cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the noodles are tender. Stir in the lemon juice and return the chicken to the slow cooker. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary. Serve hot with saltine crackers, if desired.
