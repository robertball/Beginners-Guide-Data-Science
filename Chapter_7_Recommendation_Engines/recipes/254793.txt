Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package low-fat cream cheese
1/3 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree, divided
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust

Directions:
Place a bowl and beaters for a hand-held electric mixer into the freezer to cool, about 15 minutes.
Mix cream cheese and sugar together in a bowl; stir in lemon juice and vanilla extract. Fold in half of the pumpkin puree; add cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.
Remove the bowl and beaters from the freezer. Attach beaters to an electric mixer; pour cream into chilled bowl. Beat until stiff peaks form and cream stays in place when the bowl is tipped on its side.
Fold remaining pumpkin puree and whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Spread evenly into crust; cover with plastic wrap.
Chill in the refrigerator until set, 3 to 4 hours.
