Ingredients:
aluminum foil
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
6 medium unpeeled potatoes, washed and cut into thick slices
1 onion, sliced
1 green bell pepper, cut into long strips
2 teaspoons garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; close cover. Lay out three 18-inch long pieces of aluminum foil on a work surface, dull side facing up.
Smear 1/2 tablespoon butter in the middle of the first piece of foil. Add 1/3 of the potato slices, onion, and bell pepper. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the garlic powder; season with salt and pepper. Fold up the edges of the foil over the vegetables to create an almost leak-proof packet, making sure to seal the edges. Repeat with last 2 pieces of foil and the remaining ingredients to make 2 more packets.
Reduce the heat of the grill to medium. Place foil packets on the grate; cook until potatoes are tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
