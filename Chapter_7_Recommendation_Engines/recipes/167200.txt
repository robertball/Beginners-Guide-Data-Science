Ingredients:
1 cup grated orange zest
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons melted butter
1 1/4 cups milk

Directions:
Place the orange zest into a saucepan and add water to cover; bring to a boil and cook 5 minutes. Strain the zest through a mesh strainer and return to the saucepan along with 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup of water. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring constantly, until the water has evaporated. Allow to cool until lukewarm.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Whisk the egg and 1 cup of sugar in a bowl. Stir in the butter, milk, and cooled orange zest until blended; stir in the flour mixture until just moistened then pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
Grandma-Ag's Orange Bread - This bread is a fond memory of my childhood, visiting Agnes Frances Primm, my Grandma-Ag. As a young adult, I tried to duplicate the recipe, and unable. I went back and begged her for the secrets of it. When I asked her how long it had taken to develop the tricky recipe, she flattened my ego by telling me she'd gotten it out of a magazine years before! I like to make it for Christmas.
