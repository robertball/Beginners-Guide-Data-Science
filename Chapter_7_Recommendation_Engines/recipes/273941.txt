Description: 
I've always found plain hummus rather bland. Adding harissa (preferably homemade, many brands add vinegar to it which I find unpalatable and it's not authentic), roasted carrots and sun-dried tomatoes however is a whole different story. Removing the skins from the chickpeas takes time but it is worth it, the hummus is much creamier even without adding lots of tahini.
