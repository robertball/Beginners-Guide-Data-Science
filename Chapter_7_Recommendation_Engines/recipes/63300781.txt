Ingredients:
•6 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
•3 bay leaves
•5 fresh thyme sprigs
•4 garlic cloves, peeled
•1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
•1 cup chopped carrots
•1 cup chopped celery
•3 tablespoons olive oil
•2 tablespoons butter
•3 garlic cloves, minced
•2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
•1 cup frozen peas
•1 rotisserie chicken, shredded
•1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
DUMPLINGS:
•2 cups all-purpose flour
•1 tablespoon baking powder
•1 teaspoon salt
•1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
•1 cup buttermilk
•2 eggs, lightly beaten
•1/4 cup minced chives

Directions:
•In a large saucepan, combine the first five ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Strain and set aside.
• In a Dutch oven, saute carrots and celery in oil and butter until tender. Add minced garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Stir in flour until blended; gradually add prepared broth. Bring to a boil; cook 2 minutes or until thickened, stirring frequently.
• Add peas; return to a boil. Cook 3 to 5 minutes or until peas are tender. Stir in chicken and cream; heat through.
• For dumplings, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and cayenne in a large bowl. In another bowl, combine buttermilk and eggs; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.
• Drop by tablespoonfuls onto simmering chicken mixture. Cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in a dumpling comes out clean. Garnish with chives before serving. Yield: 6 servings.

Description: 
After a very long week, I needed some comfort food, so I made this meal on a whim. Rotisserie chicken drastically cuts the prep time, so we don't have to wait long for dinner to be ready.
