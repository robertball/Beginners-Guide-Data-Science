Ingredients:
10 slices lean bacon, diced
1/2 cup mayonnaise
3 Tablespoons butter, room temperature
2 1/2 cups extra-sharp cheddar cheese, grated
4 Tablespoons grated onion  (more if desired)
pinch of cayenne pepper
6 ripe roma tomatoes, seeded, chopped
4 Tablespoons fresh basil, chopped
Balsamic vinegar
salt and pepper, to taste
2 French bread baguettes, sliced into 3/4" thick sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a small skillet, fry the bacon until crisp, drain on paper toweling.  In a medium bowl, combine the mayonnaise and butter; blend until smooth.  Stir in cheese, onion and cayenne pepper; blend well. Spread a bit of the cheese mixture on each of the baguette slices and place on a buttered baking sheet.  Bake for 10 - 15 minutes or until cheese is bubbly and bread is golden brown.
While bread is baking, combine the tomatoes with the basil.  Add enough balsamic vinegar to moisten.  Season with salt and pepper.
When bread comes out of the oven, top each slice with a bit of the tomato mixture and serve.
Buen Provecho!
