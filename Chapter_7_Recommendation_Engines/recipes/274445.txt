Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest
1 cup whole milk ricotta cheese
1 large egg
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups fresh blueberries
1/4 cup turbinado sugar (such as Sugar in the RawÂ®) (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with extra-large paper cupcake liners.
Beat white sugar, butter, and lemon zest together using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in ricotta cheese, followed by egg, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.
Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir into butter mixture until just combined; batter will be thick. Carefully fold in blueberries.
Divide batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of turbinado sugar over each muffin.
Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are golden on top and a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out mostly clean with some crumbs, 26 to 28 minutes. Remove muffins from the oven and carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool, 15 to 20 minutes.
