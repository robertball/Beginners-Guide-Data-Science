Ingredients:
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle dark beer (such as Goose IslandÂ® Oktoberfest)

Description: 
A very nice substitute for regular maple syrup. It can also be used to flavor cocktails as well. Use your favorite craft beer to make this delicious syrup. Darker beers, like nut brown ales, porters, and stouts work best.
