Ingredients:
1 bag  (1 lb. - 20 oz. ) dried split peas
1 - 2 lbs.  shoulder pork chops or short ribs or any other pork meat with bone (Smoked Ham Hock works great!)
2-3  medium size leeks, halved, sliced and washed
2 large onions, sliced
4 to 6 beef bouillon cubes
1 smoked sausage or Polska kielbasa
Sambal Oelek to taste

Directions:
Put meat and 4 bouillon cubes in large pan, with water (about 12 cups), and boil until meat is tender (about 2 hours).
Remove meat & bones, and cut meat into 1 inch cubes.
Return to water, and add split peas, leeks and onions.
Let simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally
Add more bouillon to taste if necessary (will make soup more salty)
Slice smoked sausage and add to soup
Allow to simmer for a few minutes more, and serve with Sambal Oelek to taste
