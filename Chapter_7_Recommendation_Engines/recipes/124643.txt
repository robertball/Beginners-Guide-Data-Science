Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
2/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 cups milk
3 egg yolks
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup flaked coconut
CHOCOLATE LAYER:
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
3 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons milk
MERINGUE:
3 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
6 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
Bake pie pastry. Cool.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch and salt; stir in milk. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until thickened and bubbly. Reduce heat; cook and stir 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat. Beat egg yolks lightly. Stir a little of the hot mixture into the yolks; return all to saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil. Cook and stir 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat. Stir in butter and vanilla. Pour 1-1/2 cups mixture into small bowl; add coconut to bowl and set aside.
Combine chocolate layer ingredients; blend into remaining mixture in saucepan. Return to heat; cook and stir until mixture begins to boil. Remove from the heat; spread 1 cup over bottom of pie crust. Top with coconut mixture and finish with remaining chocolate mixture.
For meringue, beat egg whites with cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually add sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Spread over hot filling, sealing to edges of pie crust. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool to room temperature; chill several hours before serving.

Description: 
This pie takes some time to prepare, so I don't make it as often as my family'd like. On weekends, I enjoy baking and spending time with my granddaughters.
