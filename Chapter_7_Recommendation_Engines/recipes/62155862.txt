Ingredients:
1 1/2 C. butter or butter-flavored shortening
2 1/2 C. real cane brown sugar (C & H brand is my favorite)
2 T. real vanilla
4 T. sour cream (may substitute buttermilk, milk or yogurt - plain or otherwise)
2 large eggs
4 C. flour
2 t. salt
1 1/2 t. baking soda
2 C. baking chips: butterscotch, white-chocolate, or both (optional)
1 C. pecans, coarsely chopped  (optional)
1/3 C. dates, finely chopped (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Cream shortening or butter together with brown sugar.
Add real vanilla and milk and beat until light and fluffy.
Incorporate eggs.
Mix in half of flour and all of salt and baking soda.
Add remaining flour and mix just until incorporated.
Add chips and nuts if desired or enjoy the amazing cookie without any embellishment!  You will be glad you did!
Spoon or scoop 1 oz. (rounded teaspoon) portions to prepared baking sheets.
Bake for 9 minutes, or just until the shininess leaves the cookie.  They will have a lightly golden matte finish.  Bake 2 minutes longer for a crispier cookie.
Remove immediately to paper towel-lined cooling rack.
Enjoy!
