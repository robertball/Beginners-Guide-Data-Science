Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 medium onion, chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/4 cups steak sauce (such as Heinz 57Â®)
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 1/4 teaspoons liquid smoke
1 (3 pound) lean boneless pork tenderloin, or to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, chili powder, and pepper until blended; cook until garlic has softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add steak sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and liquid smoke. Stir and bring to a light boil.
Put pork tenderloin into a slow cooker and pour the sauce on top. Cook until the pork falls apart when touched with a fork, 5 to 6 hours on High or 10 to 12 hours on Low.
Place pork on a plate and shred it using 2 forks. Put the pork back in the sauce until ready to serve.

Description: 
Tangy with a hint of sweet. The longer you cook it, the better it gets. I like to make this the day before. Serve on warm buns.
