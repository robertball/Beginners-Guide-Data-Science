Ingredients:
Custard:
6 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup half-and-half
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 tablespoons superfine sugar
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
Toast:
1/2 cup butter
1 1/2 cups maple syrup
1 cinnamon stick
8 thick-cut slices panettone

Directions:
In a large shallow dish, whisk up the eggs, salt, half-and-half, vanilla, almond extract, sugar, and nutmeg.
Heat a large griddle over medium heat.
In a small pan, melt the butter. In a small pot, gently warm the syrup with the cinnamon.
Paint the griddle with the butter. Soak 4 slices of bread at a time in the egg mixture, turning and draining off the excess. Cook each slice slowly for 7 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally, until deeply golden. Remove to a wire rack-lined baking sheet and repeat with the remaining 4 slices of bread.
Brush the toast with melted butter and serve, spooning the warm syrup over the top.

Description: 
We make this on Christmas morning and as we buy and receive lots of candied citrus cake--panettone--we make it for guests over many holiday weekend brunches. The recipe is equally delicious prepared with thick-sliced brioche or challah bread. We serve this with a petite smoked ham, sausage patties, or bacon.
