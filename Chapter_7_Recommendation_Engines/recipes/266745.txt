Ingredients:
vegetable oil for frying
1 cup gram flour (besan)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric
salt to taste
water, or as needed
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
2 tablespoons chopped fresh spinach
1/2 cup sliced potatoes
1/2 cup cauliflower florets
1/2 cup red onion, sliced lengthwise

Directions:
Heat oil in a wide skillet over medium heat.
Combine gram flour, cumin, cayenne pepper, turmeric, and salt in a bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of the hot oil and mix well. Add water, a little at a time, until a very thick batter forms. Stir in cilantro and spinach.
Dip potatoes and cauliflower in batter and add to the hot oil in batches without crowding. Turn and fry until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add onions to remaining batter all at once; scoop onion-batter into the oil and fry until golden, 3 to 5 minutes.
