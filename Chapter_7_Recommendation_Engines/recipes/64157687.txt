Ingredients:
1 Egg (lightly beaten)
1 cup onion, diced (about 1 medium sized onion)
2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded
1 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
2 Tablespoons basil leaves (10 -12 leaves) snipped or 2 teaspoons dried basil
1/2 cup sundried tomatoes, sliced
1 cup ketchup plus extra for top
1 cup seasoned breadcrumbs or oatmeal
2 pounds ground beef

Directions:
The instructions for the Best Ever Meatloaf Recipe assume that you will be assembling two meatloaf tins. But, you will follow the same instructions if you are going to make smaller portions or meatballs and package differently in step 3.
Yield: Two meatloaf tins. Each meatloaf tin serves 6.
1.	Add all of the ingredients except the meat to a large bowl and thoroughly combine with a spoon. (Note: by combining everything except the meat first, the ingredients will be more uniformly distributed throughout the meatloaf.)
2.	Combine ground beef with the mixture. (Tip: use a pair of plastic gloves during this step.)
3.	Divide the mixture between two loaf pans lightly sprayed with cooking spray. You can also press the mixture into large cupcake tins, smaller loaf pans or make some of the mixture into meatballs.
4.	Press mixture into pans and smooth top.
5.	Spread additional ketchup on top, if desired.
6.	See cooking directions below to enjoy this recipe now.
7.	Wrap any portions you are going to freeze. Place lids on pans or encase with aluminum foil and then fully encase the covered pans in plastic wrap.
