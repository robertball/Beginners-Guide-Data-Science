Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef 80% lean
1 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
4 slices cheddar cheese at least ¼ inch. thick
24 oz jar pasta sauce (ex. Ragu or Classico)
4 slices green bell pepper, cut in full enclosed circle cut ¼- ½ in thickness
4oz. chopped mushrooms  Optional
Cooked long grain white rice for four

Directions:
Cook rice according to package directions, set aside keeping warm while preparing hamburgers.
Combine ground beef, minced garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well. Form 8 1/4 lb. patties from the beef. Each patty should be slightly larger than the slice of cheese that you’ll place in the middle.
Cut 4 slices of cheese; at least ¼ in. thick. Place the slice of cheese between 2 ground beef patties. Pinch edges of hamburger together to tightly seal the cheese within the meat. Repeat with the remaining cheese and patties.
Preheat a heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Cook burgers on each side until brown, about 2- 3 minutes…lifting slightly with spatula so they don’t stick.
After both sides are browned, pour pasta tomato sauce over the top of the burgers, slightly lift each burger to allow the sauce to ooze under the burger. If desired add chopped mushrooms to sauce mixture. Top each burger with a slice of green bell pepper. Cover the pan with a lid and allow cooking over medium heat until bubbles and then turning to simmer on med/low heat and let simmer about 10 - 15 minutes longer. Some of the cheese may ooze out, but that is okay, makes the sauce taste even better.
You can place more cheese in each slice of bell pepper if you really love cheese...and it looks good, just cover with lid until cheese is melted, with heat off.
Serve each patty over a bed of rice, scoop more sauce over the rice from pan, then add the burger for better presentation.

Description: 
This is a recipe my husband's mother made for her family often when he was growing up. A hamburger stuffed with cheese then simmered with tomato sauce and a green bell pepper. Served over a bed of rice, sort of has that cooked stuffed pepper taste, but lots more sauce and cheese.
