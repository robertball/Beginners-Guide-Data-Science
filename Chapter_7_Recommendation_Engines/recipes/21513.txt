Description: 
This is a family favorite that my dad taught me long ago.  It's very filling and if company arrives unexpectedly for breakfast, just add more flour and milk.  This recipe works best with a cast iron skillet as it holds heat so well.  And besides, it makes the meal more authentic!  Serve over buttermilk biscuits.  If you can, avoid using dried herbs.  Fresh herbs add much more flavor.
