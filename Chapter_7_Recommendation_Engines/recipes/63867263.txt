Ingredients:
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves or allspice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup orange juice
4 egg whites, beaten to froth
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 (12 fluid ounce) can fat-free evaporated milk
whipped cream, to garnish (optional)
1 tablespoon sugar per container after baking if you are going to brulee them (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place 6-8 custard cups in a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bring a kettle of water to the boil.
Beat egg whites until frothy and then combine the brown sugar, spices, vanilla extract, orange juice, pumpkin and evaporated milk until well blended.
Carefully ladle the custard into each cup, dividing the mixture evenly - about 1 cup each.
Pour boiling water around the cups to a depth of at least 1 inch.
Bake the custards in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the custard comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
Carefully remove the pan from the oven; allow to cool.
Remove the custard cups from the water bath and cool completely on a wire rack.
Refrigerate before serving for 1-2 hours until totally cool.
Serve garnished with a tablespoon of real whipped cream, if desired. (Highly Recommended)
Can add a tablespoon of sugar to each cup and then brulee under a broiler for 1-2 minutes or with a kitchen torch (optional)
