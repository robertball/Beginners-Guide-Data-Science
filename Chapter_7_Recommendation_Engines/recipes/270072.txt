Description: 
Hummus shakes are becoming increasingly popular, so I decided to make my own at home. Unlike traditional savory hummus with ingredients like salt, garlic, and lemon, this vegan and dairy-free shake is naturally sweetened with dates and is high in protein and fiber. And no one will be able to guess what's in it! Adjust the sweetness by adding more dates, if desired.
