Description: 
This is the perfect homemade Miracle Whip® copycat free of soy, gluten, and preservatives. This recipe makes a small batch because it will only keep for about a week in the refrigerator, and we don't use enough to need anymore than that at a time. It is easily doubled, if you need a larger batch. Made as directed, this recipe is paleo-diet friendly, soy-free, gluten-free, grain-free, corn-free, and dairy-free. Enjoy! Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.
