Ingredients:
1 medium shallot(s) or 1/4 small red onion, minced
1/2 tablespoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
3/4 pounds carrot(s), baby
1 tablespoon vinegar, balsamic
pepper, black ground to taste
1 teaspoon sugar substitute
salt to taste
1 tablespoon chives, fresh chopped, optional

Directions:
In a large nonstick saucepan, combine the shallots and oil. Add the carrots, vinegar, pepper to taste, and 1/3 cup water.
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 20 minutes.
Uncover the pan, stir in the sugar substitute, and cook until the liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and let sit for 2 minutes. Season with salt to taste and stir in the chives (if using). Serve warm.
