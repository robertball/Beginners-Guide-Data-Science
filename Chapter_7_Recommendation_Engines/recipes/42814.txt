Ingredients:
1 egg
1 1/2 cups beer
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound cod fillets
2 cups crushed cornflake crumbs
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1 quart oil for frying

Directions:
In a medium bowl, beat together egg, beer, flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Place cod in the bowl, and thoroughly coat with the mixture.
In a separate medium bowl, mix the cornflake crumbs and Cajun seasoning. Dip the cod in the crumb mixture, and thoroughly coat all sides.
In a large, heavy skillet or deep fryer, heat the oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Fry the fish until golden brown, and flesh is easily flaked with a fork.
