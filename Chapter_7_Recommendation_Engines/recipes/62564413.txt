Ingredients:
1 small onion, slivered
1 small zucchini, thinly sliced
1 small yellow squash, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
8 whole wheat tortillas
1 can vegetarian refried beans
1/2 cup reduced-fat shredded cheddar cheese
1 cup salsa

Directions:
Heat a little oil in a nonstick skillet, or spray with nonstick spray.  Add onion, zucchini and squash.  Cook, stirring occasionally, about five minutes.  Add garlic.  Continue cooking about 2 more minutes, until vegetables are tender.
Spread beans evenly over tortillas (a scant quarter cup each).  Put 4 tortillas aside to be the tops of the quesadillas, the remaining four are the bottoms.  Spoon 1/4 of the vegetable mixture over each bottom tortilla, then sprinkle 2 tablespoons of cheese over each.  Top with the remaining bean-covered tortillas.
* They can sit in the fridge for several days in this state, finish just before serving. *
Wipe skillet out with a paper towel.  Heat a little oil in it over low heat, and add a quesadilla.  Cook about 5 minutes, turning once, until browned and heated through.  Serve with about a quarter cup of salsa each.

Description: 
These are delicious and very filling!  This small amount of cheese really goes a long way - they taste cheesey but aren't oozing and loaded with fat.  They also contain about 20 grams of fiber each.  For a very nutritious and yummy meal, I eat half of one, plus a salad with avocado, and an orange.
