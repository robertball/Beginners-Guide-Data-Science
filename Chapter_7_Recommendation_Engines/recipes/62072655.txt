3 small (celestial seasonings) peach tea bags
1 envelope unsweetened raspberry koolaid
2/3 splenda

Microwave or heat the 2 quarts of water to almost the boiling point, but do not boil.  Add all tea bags and steep for 5- 8 minutes.  In pitcher, add unsweetened raspberry tea, splenda, and 2 quarts water.
