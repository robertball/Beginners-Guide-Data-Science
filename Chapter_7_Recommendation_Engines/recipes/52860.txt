Ingredients:
4 whole green apples, cut into eighths
2 1/2 cups Apple Flavor LIBBY'S速 JUICY JUICE速 100% Juice
6 red potatoes, peeled and grated
1 onion, peeled and grated
1 egg
10 tablespoons corn oil, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Simmer apples (not peeled, cored or seeded) in apple juice for 30 minutes or until very soft. Drain, reserving the liquid. Push apple through sieve and discard peel and seeds. Simmer liquid to reduce by half and stir into applesauce.
In a large mixing bowl, combine potato and onion. Beat egg with 2 tablespoons of the corn oil and salt; combine with potato mixture.
Pour enough of the remaining corn oil into a saute pan to cover bottom with about 1/16 inch of oil. Heat to very hot but not smoking, and drop potato mixture in by heaping tablespoons. Flatten immediately so pancakes are about 4 inches in diameter (smaller pancakes will burn). Try to keep them neatly round. Fry until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes, flip and brown other side. Drain on paper towels. Serve with applesauce and sour cream.
