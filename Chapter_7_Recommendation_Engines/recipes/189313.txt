Ingredients:
1 potato
8 slices white sandwich bread
2 cups milk
1/2 cup carp roe
1 small onion, chopped
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup olive oil, or more if needed
2 Greek olives (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Prick the potato in several places with a fork and place on a baking sheet.
Bake the potato in the preheated oven easily pierced with a fork, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Cool completely in refrigerator. Peel and chop.
Place the bread slices in a shallow dish; pour the milk over the bread to cover completely. Allow to soak a few minutes before squeezing as much moisture as possible from the bread, discarding the milk.
Blend the bread, potato, carp roe, onion, lemon juice, and olive oil together in a food processor until fluffy, about 1 minute. Add more olive oil if needed to reach a desired consistency; chill. Garnish with the Greek olives to serve.
