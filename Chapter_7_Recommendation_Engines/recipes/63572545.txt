Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 c whole milk
3/4 c half and half
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 3/4 cups mashed bananas
3/4 c. chopped pecans
frosting
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
4 cups confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 c coconut
3/4 c chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. In a small bowl, mix mashed bananas with lemon juice, set aside. In a medium bowl, mix flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside. Mix milk and half and half with 2tsp lemmon juice and let sit for 6 minutes.
In a large bowl, cream 3/4 cup butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milks and lemmon juice mixture. Stir in banana mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove from oven and place directly into freezer for 45 minutes. This will make the cake very moist.
For the frosting: In a large bowl, cream 1/2 cup butter and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in 2 teaspoons vanilla. Add confectioners sugar and beat on low speed until combined, then on high until frosting is smooth. Spread on cooled cake.
Sprinkle coconut on top and press into frosting. Sprinkle pecans on top
