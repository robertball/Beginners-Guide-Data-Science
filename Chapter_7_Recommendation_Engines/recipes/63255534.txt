Ingredients:
FOR THE AVOCADO MANGO SALSA
half a large avocado, peeled and diced (Canyon Ranch uses 1/3 cup fresh blueberries)
1/3 cup peeled, diced mangoes
2 tablespoons minced red onions
2 tablespoons minced red bell peppers (we substituted tomatoes)
1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
½ teaspoon minced jalapeno peppers
(Canyon Ranch adds 2 teaspoons evaporated cane juice or organic cane sugar  we omitted sugar completely)
¼ teaspoon sea salt
FOR THE SALMON
½ teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
four 4-ounce salmon fillets
pinch sea salt
pinch freshly ground pepper

Directions:
Combine the avocado (or blueberries), mangoes, onions, tomatoes (or bell peppers), cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt (and sugar, if using) in a medium bowl. Lightly crush with a fork to release the juices. Set aside. [Wear gloves when handling hot chile peppers, or wash your hands thoroughly before touching your eyes, nose or mouth.]
Heat olive oil in large saute pan over medium-high heat. Season the salmon with salt and pepper and sear for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through.
Serve each salmon fillet with ¼ cup Avocado Mango Salsa.
