Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups milk
1 egg
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 (10 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, drained and coarsely chopped
2/3 cup chopped almonds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.
Stir flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large mixing bowl.
Stir milk, egg, oil, and almond extract together in a small bowl until well combined. Add to dry mixture all at once. Stir until just moistened. Fold in cherries and almonds. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove loaf from the pan and cool completely on the wire rack, about 30 minutes. Wrap and store for 8 hours to overnight before slicing and serving.
