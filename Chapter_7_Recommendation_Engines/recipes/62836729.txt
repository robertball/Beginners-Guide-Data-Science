Ingredients:
1 Granny Smith apple
1 or 2 teaspoons cinnamon
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon splenda, brown sugar, or other bake-able sweetener

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a small bowl, mix together cinnamon, lemon juice, and sweetener.
Peel (if desired, I don't always), core, and thinly slice the apple.
Toss apple slices in cinnamon mixture.
Press apple slices into an oven-proof ramekin.  Pour any remaining cinnamon mixture over apple slices.
Bake for 10-15 minutes or until apple can be fork-pierced, but is still slightly crunchy.
Let cool and enjoy!

When it is cold outside and I feel like celebrating (I adore cold weather), but my math refuses to do itself, this is what I make.
