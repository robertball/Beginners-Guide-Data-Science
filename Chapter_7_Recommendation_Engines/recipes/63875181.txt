Ingredients:
For the pastry:
1 cup butter, softened
8 oz. Cream cheese, softened
2 1/2 cups flour
For the Filling:
1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
3 eggs
1 tbsp. vanilla
2 cups finely chopped pecans or walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees
In medium bowl, mix butter and cream cheese together until well blended and fluffy. Stir in flour, 1/2 cup at a time until a dough is formed.
Shape dough into half tablespoon size balls. Press dough balls into mini muffin pan cups, like a pie crust.
In a second bowl, cream the half cup of butter with the brown sugar until light. Stir in the vanilla, and beat in the eggs, one at a time. Stir in the nuts.
Fill the cups with about half a tbsp. of filling. Bake for 20-23 minutes, until lightly browned.
Cool in the pan, use a spoon to loosen any filling around the edges, then to lift each tart from the pan
I like to use walnuts. You can add 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips for an equal measure of nuts, for a different
taste. Makes about 5 dozen.
