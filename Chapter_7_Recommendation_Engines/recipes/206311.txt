Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/3 cup whole milk
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup honey
1 pinch salt
1 cup crunchy peanut butter
3 1/2 cups instant oatmeal, or more as needed

Directions:
Combine the butter, milk, white sugar, brown sugar, and honey in a large pot over medium-high heat; bring to a rapid boil for 90 seconds. Stir the salt and peanut butter into the mixture and remove immediately from the heat. Add the oatmeal quickly and mix to combine. Make sure the texture is thick with a little bit of sauce, but not too much sauce. If needed add extra oatmeal.
Drop rounded spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto aluminum foil or waxed paper; allow to sit 1 to 2 hours before serving.
