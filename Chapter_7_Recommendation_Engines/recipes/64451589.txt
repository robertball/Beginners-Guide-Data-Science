Ingredients:
12 chicken thighs and/or drumsticks
3 eggs + a little milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
salt and pepper to taste
paprika
Lemon Pepper
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place flour in a shallow plate or bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Put the bread crumbs in another shallow plate or bowl and beat the eggs and milk in another bowl.
Pat dry the chicken, coat each piece well with flour, shake off the excess, then quickly dredge though the egg,  then roll in bread crumbs to get a nice even coat. Let the breading "rest" for 30 minutes in fridge. Pour the melted butter into a 9 x 13 inch baking pan lined with foil. Add the chicken to the dish skin side down. (You may need to use 2 pans to be sure not to overcrowd the pan - The chicken has to have space between the pieces for oil and air to move or it will be soggy.) Sprinkle with paprika and lemon pepper seasonings to taste. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then turn pieces over and bake for another 30 minutes. Remove from oven and drain on paper towels. Enjoy!
