Ingredients:
4oz. very hot water
2 Lipton tea bags
Â½ oz. Absolut Pear Vodka
1 tablespoon spearmint leaves (approx), washed and packed down
Desired amount of sweetener of your choice, (ie., stevia, splenda or simple syrup)

Directions:
Steep tea until water is very dark in color. In a glass (approx 1-1/2 cup) put the mint in and stir well to bruise and break them up a little to release some of the oils. Add ice and tea. Stir. Pour in the pear vodka and garnish with a mint leaf on top.
* Simple Syrup Recipe - In a small saucepan, bring equal amounts of sugar and water to a boil; simmer until the sugar is dissolved, 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely.
