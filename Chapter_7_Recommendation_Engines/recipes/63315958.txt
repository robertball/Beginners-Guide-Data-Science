Ingredients:
8 Cups Oatmeal (regular, not the quick-cook kind)
1 1/2 Cups Wheat Germ
1 1/2 Cups Oat Bran
1 Cup Chopped Walnuts (ready-made bags make it easy)
1 Cup Chopped Pecans (ready-made bags make it easy)
1 Cup Slivered Almonds (ready-made bags make it easy)
1 1/2 Teaspoons Salt
3/4 Cup Brown Sugar
3/4 Cup Honey
1/4 Cup Maple Syrup
1 Cup Vegetable Oil (we've tried Canola - yuk)
1 1/2 Tablesppon Cinnamon
1 Tablespoon Pure Vanilla
1/2 Cup Shredded Coconut (optional)
2 Cups Raisins (or anykind of dried fruit)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  You will need to line two large baking pans with parchment paper.
Combine first 7 ingredients in a large bowl and set aside.
Stir together brown sugar, honey, syrup, oil, cinnamon, and vanilla in a pan. Over medium heat, bring to a boil.  Stir for an additional 30 seconds after mixture comes to a boil.  Then, pour hot mixture over the dry ingredients, and stir to coat.
Spread the mixture (EXCEPT FOR THE COCONUT, if you want to use it) out evenly on the baking sheets.
Bake EXACTLY 25 minutes. (If you are adding coconut, sprinkle on top of the granola during the last 10 minutes of baking to avoid burning.)
Cool. Then stir in the raisins or fruit.  Store in Ziplock bags or tupperware.  Can be frozen.
Enjoy!
