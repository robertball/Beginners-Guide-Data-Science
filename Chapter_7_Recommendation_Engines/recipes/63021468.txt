Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream, divided
3 tablespoons Kahlúa or other coffee liqueur, divided
2 tablespoons instant espresso powder plus additional for garnish
1 teaspoon (scant) ground cardamom plus additional for garnish
4 large egg yolks
1/2 cup (packed) golden brown sugar

Directions:
Combine 1 3/4 cups cream, 2 tablespoons Kahlúa, 2 tablespoons espresso powder, and 1 scant teaspoon cardamom in heavy small saucepan; bring to simmer. Whisk yolks and brown sugar in medium bowl. Gradually whisk hot cream mixture into yolk mixture; return to pan. Stir over medium-low heat until mixture is thick enough to coat back of spoon (do not boil), about 5 minutes. Strain through fine-mesh strainer into 2-cup measuring cup. Divide pudding among 6 demitasse cups. Refrigerate until set, about 5 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)
Whisk remaining 1/2 cup cream in medium bowl until peaks form. Whisk in remaining 1 tablespoon Kahlúa. Top each pudding with whipped cream. Sprinkle with additional espresso powder and additional cardamom.
