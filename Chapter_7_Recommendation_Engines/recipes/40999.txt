Ingredients:
2 large baking potatoes (8 ounces each)
3 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion
1/3 cup margarine or butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons snipped fresh dill
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
4 cups milk
3/4 cup shredded American cheese
3 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion
4 slices crumbled bacon crisp-cooked, drained

Directions:
Scrub potatoes thoroughly with a brush; pat dry. Prick potatoes with a fork. Bake in a 425 degree F. oven for 40 to 60 minutes or until tender. Let cool. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise; gently scoop out each potato. Discard potato skins.
In a large saucepan cook 3 tablespoons green onion in margarine until tender; stir in flour, dill, salt, and pepper. Add milk all at once. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. Add the potato pulp and 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese; stir until cheese melts. Ladle into bowls. Garnish each serving with the remaining shredded cheese, 3 tablespoons green onion, and bacon.
