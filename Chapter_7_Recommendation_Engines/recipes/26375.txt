Ingredients:
1 (4.5 ounce) package quick cooking wild rice and chicken flavor mix
2 boneless chicken breast halves, cooked and cubed
3 cups chicken broth
1 (16 ounce) package frozen pearl onions
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1 stalk celery, diced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup half-and-half cream

Directions:
Prepare rice mix according to package directions.
In a large pot, combine 1 1/2 cups prepared rice mix, cooked chicken, broth, onions, mushrooms, celery, parsley, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes.
For a thicker soup, stir in half-and-half and cook 5 minutes more.

Description: 
Using leftover chicken breasts and leftover packaged wild rice dinner, plus a few additions makes a great soup!  Pretty if garnished with some finely shredded carrots sprinkled on top along with a pretty sprig of parsley.
