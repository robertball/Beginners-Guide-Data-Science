Ingredients:
½ cup orange juice
¼ cup light soy sauce
2 tablespoons buckwheat honey
2 tablespoons hot sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger
2 teaspoons chopped fresh garlic
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch Italian seasoning
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
2  nectarines, sliced

Directions:
Mix orange juice, soy sauce, honey, hot sauce, brown sugar, ginger, and garlic together in a small bowl to make the sauce.
Season flour lightly with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Cut chicken breasts into 1/2-inch strips. Dredge chicken pieces in the seasoned flour; sprinkle more salt and pepper on top.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken strips and brown on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Pour in the orange sauce. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until sauce thickens and chicken is no longer pink in the centers, 8 to 10 minutes.
Plate the chicken and top with nectarine slices.
