Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 lb (2 sticks) butter, softened
1 cup dark brown sugar
1 cup sugar
1 cup extra crunchy Jiff (yes it has to be Jiff) peanut butter
2 large eggs
2 tsp vanilla
1 cup cocktail peanuts ground in food processor to resemble bread crumbs (approx 14 pulses)

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to low center position; heat oven to 350 degrees; Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in medium bowl.
Beat butter until creamy; add sugars; beat approximately three minutes, scraping bowl as needed; beat in peanut butter, then eggs, 1 at a time, then vanilla.  Gently stir dry ingredients into PB mixture.  Add ground peanuts, stir gently until just incorporated.
Scoop 2 tablespoons of dough into hand, roll into large ball.  Place 2 inches apart on a parchment-covered cookie sheet.  Press back of fork dipped in cold water into cookies twice, crisscross.  Bake until cookies are puffed and slightly brown on edges-not top.  (They won't look done.)  Cool on sheet until set ~4 minutes, transfer to rack.  Keep refrigerated or in airtight container up to 7 days (if they last that long!)
