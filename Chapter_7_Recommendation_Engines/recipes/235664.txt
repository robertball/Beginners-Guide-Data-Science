Description: 
I looked forward to having this every year when my partner's mother would come to stay with us during the holidays. She was a 'Paula Deen'-kinda woman, adding butter to everything, but everything was oh-so-delicious! May be sliced into any size serving. Keeps a good while, if your family doesn't eat it all right away!
