Ingredients:
10 sprigs fresh mint, plus extra for garnish
3 teaspoons green tea
3 tablespoons sugar (or more to taste)
4 cups water

Directions:
Boil the water and pour a small amount in the teapot, swishing it around to warm the pot.
Combine the mint and green tea and sugar in the teapot, then fill it with the rest of the hot water.
Let the tea brew for three minutes.
Set out glasses for the tea.
A shot-glass is close to the slender glasses used in Morocco.
Fill just one glass with the tea, then pour it back in the pot.
Repeat.
This helps to dissolve and distribute the sugar.
Pour the tea.
You want a nice foam on the tea so always pour with the teapot a high distance above the glasses.
If you do not have at least a little foam on the top of the first glass, then pour it back into the teapot and try again until the tea starts to foam up nicely.
Garnish with the remaining sprigs of mint.

Description: 
Mint tea isn't just a drink in Morocco. It is a sign of hospitality and friendship and tradition. Because this drink is so popular, it is served all day long, after every meal and with every conversation. Moroccans take great pride in their tea and will often ask a visitor who among their group of friends makes the best cup of mint tea.
