10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1 cups confectioners' sugar
Pinch table salt
4 ounces  semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled

Scrape down bowl and beat at medium speed until mixture is fully combined, about 15 seconds; scrape bowl, add vanilla and beat at medium speed until incorporated, about 10 seconds, then reduce speed to low and gradually beat in chocolate. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down bowl once or twice
