Ingredients:
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
8 fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 large ripe avocado, peeled and cubed
1 medium zucchini, diced
1 large tomato, seeded and chopped
1 medium red onion, sliced
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive or canola oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 garlic clove, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Place asparagus and 2 tablespoons water in a microwave-safe dish.  Cover and microwave on high for 3-6 minutes or until crisp-tender, stirring once; drain and cool.
In a large bowl, combine the asparagus, mushrooms, avocado, zucchini, tomato and onion; toss gently.  In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the remaining ingredients; shake well.  Pour over salad and toss gently to coat.  Cover and refrigerate until serving.
