Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground ham
1 1/2 pounds ground pork
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup milk
3/4 cup crushed saltine crackers
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix ground ham, ground pork, eggs, milk, crackers, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; form into a loaf. Transfer loaf to a loaf pan.
Mix brown sugar, cider vinegar, and dry mustard together; pour over the loaf.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Spread pineapple atop the loaf; continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
