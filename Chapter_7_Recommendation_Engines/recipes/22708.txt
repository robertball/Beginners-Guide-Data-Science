Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cornstarch
5 pounds white sugar
2 egg whites

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (93 degrees C).  Dust egg molds with cornstarch.
Place sugar in a large bowl, stir to get rid of lumps.  Make a well in the center and pour in egg whites.  Mix and knead with hands 5 minutes, until well blended.
Press firmly into mold with the heel of your hand.  Scrape off excess sugar with the straight edge of a knife.  Unmold at once and place on baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven 20 minutes, until hard.
