Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 clove garlic, minced
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 1/2 cups frozen corn
1 cup skim milk
1 tablespoon cornstarch, or more as needed
1 cup white beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; saute chicken, onion, red bell pepper, and garlic until chicken is no longer pink in the center and onion is tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chicken broth and corn to chicken mixture.
Whisk milk and cornstarch together in a bowl until dissolved; stir into soup. Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes. Stir white beans, Cheddar cheese, salt, and pepper into soup; simmer until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
