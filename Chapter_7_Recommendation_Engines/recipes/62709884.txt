Ingredients:
3 3/4 (30 oz)cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground ginger
2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons dark corn syrup

Directions:
Sift the flour together with the baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and cardamom in a mixing bowl.
Beat the butter together with the white and brown sugars in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Mix in the egg and corn syrup until smooth. Gradually stir in the flour mixture until evenly blended. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions and wrap tightly each with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, or overnight.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.
Using 1 portion at a time, work on a floured surface and roll out dough to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into shapes with cookie cutter, and place 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until set, about 5 minutes. Cool completely. Store in tightly covered tins.

Description: 
Paper-thin and spicy, these cookies are a beloved Swedish Christmas tradition. Thoroughly chilling the dough before rolling it out, and dusting cookie cutters with flour will make the cut-out process easier.Modified from: Traditional Swedish Pepparkakor
