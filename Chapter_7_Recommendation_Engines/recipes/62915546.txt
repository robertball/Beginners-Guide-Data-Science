Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 white onions, halved and sliced into 1/2 rings
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup lentils
2 cups water
1 cup fresh spinach
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 cloves garlic, crushed

Directions:
Heat oil in a heavy pan over medium heat.  Saute onion for 10 minutes or so, until it begins to turn golden.  Add minced garlic and saute for another minute or so.
Add lentils and water to the saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil.  Cover, lower heat, and simmer about 35 minutes, until lentils are soft ( this may take less time, depending on your water and the lentils).
Wilt spinach over the lentils.  Add salt and cumin to the saucepan.  Cover and simmer until all is heated, about ten minutes. Grind in plenty of pepper and press in extra garlic to taste.

Description: 
This is my own adaptation of an Indian recipe.   It doesn't look like much, but it is surprisingly yummy. Serve this for dinner over hot rice or a diced baked potato.  Pair with carrots, cauliflower, or a fresh sliced tomato for a full meal.Modified from: Lentils And Spinach
