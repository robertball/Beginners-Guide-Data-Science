Description: 
Timothy O'Toole's bar in Chicago, IL, a place with an undying loyalty to the Bears, features this big Irish whiskey-infused drink flavored with ginger ale and lime. The cocktail is named after Jameson® whiskey, aka 'Big Jamo.' 'There's a big pour, a solid 8-count of Jamo in there,' the bartender told us.
