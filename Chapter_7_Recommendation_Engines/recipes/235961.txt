Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 pinch onion powder, or to taste
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
1 dash Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
1 dash soy sauce, or to taste
1 pinch salt, or to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste
1 cup chopped cooked chicken
1 (16 ounce) package wonton wrappers
peanut oil for frying

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or deep, large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Stir cream cheese, onion powder, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add chicken and stir until completely incorporated.
Separate and place wonton wrappers onto work surface. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese filling onto the center of each wrapper. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water. Fold one corner of the wrapper over the filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press the edges together to seal.
Working in batches, cook wontons in hot oil until wonton is lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove to paper towel-lined plate to drain.

Description: 
I had everything to make crab Rangoon one night except the crab. So I used leftover roasted chicken. Needless to say my family fell in love with them. I'm sharing my recipe, because I think your family will, too! You can substitute turkey or pork for the chicken.
