Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs fresh spinach, washed
3 T. olive oil
1 small onion, minced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 small fresh chili, seeded and minced
1/2 C. risotto
1 1/4 qt. vegetable stock

Directions:
Place spinach in large pan with just the water that clings to the leaves after washing. Add large pinch of salt and heat gently until spinach wilts. Remove from heat and drain, reserving any liquid.
Chop spinach finely. Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add onion, garlic, and chili and cook for 5 minutes until soft. Stir in rice until well coated. Pour in stock and reserved spinach liquid.
Bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the spinach and cook 5-7 minutes longer, until rice is tender. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with Pecorino cheese.
