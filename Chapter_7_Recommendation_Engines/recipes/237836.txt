Ingredients:
3/4 cup walnuts
1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs
2 lemons, zested, divided
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 pinch salt, or as needed
1 (14.5 ounce) box Barilla PLUS速 Penne
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium leek, thinly sliced
1 1/2 cups (1-inch) sliced asparagus
2 cups fresh or frozen spring peas
1 large zucchini, julienned
1/4 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons julienned fresh mint leaves
2 tablespoons julienned fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Toast walnuts in oven for 5 to 8 minutes until the walnuts are lightly toasted.
In a food processor, pulse together bread crumbs, walnuts and zest from 1 lemon until well-blended.
Pour walnut mixture into a medium dish and toss with parsley and a pinch of salt. Set aside.
Prepare Barilla(R) PLUS(R) Penne according to package directions. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup (250ml) of the pasta cooking liquid. Return pasta to cooking pot.
Pour olive oil into a large saute pan while the pasta is cooking. Add leeks and asparagus, and saute over medium heat for about 4 minutes until they start to soften.
Add peas and zucchini; saute for another 5 minutes until all of the vegetables are slightly softened; season with salt and black pepper.
Add zest of second lemon and reserved cooking liquid; stir gently until combined.
Add vegetables to pasta; toss to combine. Gently stir in mint and basil. Taste and adjust seasoning, if needed.
Serve 1 cup of pasta mixture into individual serving bowls. Top with 2 tablespoons of the walnut mixture.
