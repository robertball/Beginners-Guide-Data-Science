Ingredients:
1 TBL. Olive Oil
8 oz Button Mushrooms (chopped)
4 green onions (chopped)
1 clove garlic (minced)
1 cup white wine (your choice)
1 cup cream (half and half-not whipping!)
salt and pepper
Parmesan for sprinkling on top

Directions:
Pour oil into saucepan.  Heat on medium and add mushrooms, garlic, onions.  Saute for about 2 minutes until mushrooms start to steam out their juice. Add wine and cook down to about 1/2 cup.  Add cream and cook down to about 3/4 cup. It should take total about 20-30 minutes of straight cooking from adding the wine.  (Perhaps a little longer or shorter, depending on your stove and it's heat.)
The sauce will be thin, so if you like thick sauce, do not cook this recipe! Salt and Pepper to your liking.
During the simmering, cook the pasta (I prefer to make my own, this site has some lovely recipes or you can wing it yourself like I do) Drain.  Add sauce ontop of pasta and add parmesan to the top. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This recipe is a great Italian pasta with a cream sauce.  I learned this an old Northern Italian woman.  It is quick and lovely. I prefer to make my own pasta for it, but I am sure it tastes fine with store bought as well. This is a thin white sauce, so if you are looking for a thick white sauce..move on!
