Ingredients:
6 large tomatoes
1 (19.76 ounce) package Johnsonville® Italian Sausage Links, casings removed
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
2 teaspoons minced garlic
3 tablespoons cooking sherry
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 egg, lightly beaten

Directions:
Using a sharp knife, slice 1/2-inch off the top of tomatoes; discard tops. Using a small knife and a spoon, remove pulp from tomatoes. Reserve 1 cup tomato pulp; chop coarsely and save for the filling. Invert tomato shells onto paper towels to drain.
In a skillet, cook and crumble sausage until no longer pink; drain and set aside. In the same skillet, cook onions in olive oil over medium-low heat until golden, stirring occasionally. Add the spinach, garlic and reserved tomato. Cook and stir over medium heat until spinach is wilted. Stir in the sausage, sherry and pepper. Cool slightly; stir in egg. Place tomato shells in a 2-quart baking dish. Fill shells with sausage mixture.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until hot.
