Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
Few good shakes of cinnamon
1/2 reduced fat cup sour cream
3 medium bananas, mashed or 2 large

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, stir together the melted butter and sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla, mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt, stir into the butter mixture until smooth. Finally, fold in the sour cream, walnuts and bananas. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool loaf in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
MUFFINS: 350 for 25 min.  Butter and flour muffin cups then dust with a cinnamon and sugar mixture.

Description: 
Sour cream guarantees a moist and tender loaf.  And bananas are sliced instead of mashed in this recipe, giving a concentrated banana taste in every bite.Modified from: Janet's Rich Banana Bread
