Description: 
This Russian tea recipe come from the Roebuck family by way of my grandmother. It has been a holiday staple at family gatherings as long as I can remember. This is a recipe in the 'old Southern' tradition, where almost nothing is exact and you just make sure it 'tastes right.' The longer everything simmers, the better the flavor. Serve hot.
