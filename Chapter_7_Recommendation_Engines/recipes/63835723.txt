Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (4 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 cup salsa
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 teaspoon cumin
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chili powder

Directions:
Place chicken breasts and tomato sauce in a medium saucepan over medium high heat.
Bring to a boil, then add the salsa, seasoning, cumin, garlic and chili powder.
Let simmer for 15 minutes.
With a fork, start pulling the chicken meat apart into thin strings.
Keep cooking pulled chicken meat and sauce, covered, for another 5 to 10 minutes.
(Note: You may need to add a bit of water if the mixture is cooked too high and gets too thick.)
