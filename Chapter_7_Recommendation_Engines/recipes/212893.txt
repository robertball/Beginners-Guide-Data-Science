Ingredients:
3 quince, unpeeled, washed, halved and cored
18 whole cloves
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup port wine
3 cinnamon sticks
1/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup heavy cream, whipped (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Press three cloves into each quince half. Place the fruit in a roasting pan cut-side down. Add the water, wine, and cinnamon sticks to the pan; sprinkle the sugar over the quince.
Bake the fruit in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 35 to 40 minutes. Turn the quince right-side up and bake until tender, about 10 more minutes.
Remove the pan from the oven and let the quince cool slightly. Transfer each quince half to a plate and drizzle with a tablespoon of juices from the roasting pan and a dollop of whipped cream.
