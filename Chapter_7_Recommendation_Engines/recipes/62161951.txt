Ingredients:
3 oz Cocktail Peanuts or dry roasted peanuts
2 tbsp Canola Oil
1 Tbsp 100% Pure Sesame Oil
1 tsp Chili Oil
2 tbsp Soy Sauce
4 tsp Lime Juice FRESH
1 Tb Sugar (or to taste)
1 tsp Chili Garlic Paste (more or less to taste)

Directions:
Heat your oven to 350 degrees F.
Pour out the peanuts in a single layer on a sheet pan. Break the whole ones up.  You're going to give the nuts a second toasting to amp up that toasty flavor and start releasing their oils.  Toast the peanuts for about 7 to 10 minutes, until they start looking more golden brown.  Watch them closely.  They can go from golden brown and toasty to burned very quickly.  When they are toasty, remove from oven.
Place peanuts into your food processor and pulse until they are a fine chop.  Add your other ingredients and then turn on the processor and let it go.  You're looking for a thick, paste consistency, not peanut butter.  When you taste the sauce, you should feel a little bit of texture in your mouth and the sauce should look a little grainy.
Serve along with satay, pad thai, spring rolls, noodles, or as a really tasty dip for chips!!
If you want to cut back on salt, use the unsalted peanuts.  Just be sure to taste the sauce and add some salt as you go.  This is one dish that needs salt, so you can only cut back so much.

Description: 
This is my hub's famous peanut sauce he makes for us.  He learned the basics for this recipe while working for a famous Chinese Bistro.  The key to this incarnation is that it uses whole peanuts instead of peanut butter. It makes a world of difference in taste and texture.
