Ingredients:
2 cups bacon fat (strained)
3 cups simple syrup
1/8 cup molasses
1 tbsp red pepper flakes
Simple syrup :
Bring 3 cups water and 1 cup sugar to a lie boil for 5 minutes

Directions:
In a small sauce pan, combine all ingredients. This is easiest when both the fat and the simple syrup are warm. Bring to a low boil, stirring frequently,  for 10-15 minutes, or until it is a thick syrup. If there is a layer of unincorporated fat on top as you stir, slowly add sugar directly until the layer is gone. Place the syrup in the freezer for an hour or two, slice into pieces, and wrap in wax paper.
