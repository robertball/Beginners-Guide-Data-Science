Ingredients:
8 ounces feta cheese
1 egg
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh oregano
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
freshly ground black pepper
2 large ripe tomatoes, sliced
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
Slice feta into 2x3/8 inch squares, about 8 slices. In a small bowl, beat the egg with the oregano. Dip each slice of feta in egg, shake off excess, and coat in flour.
Heat olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Quickly cook cheese in olive oil until golden, turning once. Pat dry with paper towels.
Arrange feta on a plate with thick tomato slices, season with black pepper, and garnish with lemon wedges.
