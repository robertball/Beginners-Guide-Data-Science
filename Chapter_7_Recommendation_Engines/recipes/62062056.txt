1 bottle Nutella (chocolate hazelnut spread) look for it next to peanut butter at your grocery store.
3 or 4 sliced bananas
1 can whipped cream

Directions:
Beat eggs and milk.  Stir in flou, salt and more milk if necessary (batter must be runny like tomato soup).
Mix in melted butter.
Put a non-stick crepe pan or regular pan over medium heat.
Pour 1/4 cup batter and swirl around to spread it thin.
Cook crepe until lightly browned on both sides.
Keep crepes warm by covering them with a clean kitchen towel.
Fill each crepe starting with chocolate Nutella spread, then sliced bananas and top off with some whipped cream.  Fold crepes in 4 to look like a triangle.  Arrange on serving dish garnish with chocolate syrup, powdered sugar and fresh berries if you wish.  Serve immediately.
NOTE:  The Nutella, Bananas & Whipped Cream is also great on Belgium style waffles!
