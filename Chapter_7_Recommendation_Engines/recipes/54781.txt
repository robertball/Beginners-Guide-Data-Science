Ingredients:
6 (1 pound) lamb shanks
1/4 cup all-purpose flour for coating
1 cup water
1 onion, finely chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup evaporated milk
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup

Directions:
Heat a large deep skillet over medium-high heat, and spray with cooking spray. Coat the lamb shanks lightly with flour, and brown on all sides in the hot pan. Drain off fat.
Add the water, onion, salt and pepper. Cover, and reduce heat to low, and cook until the lamb is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Turn shanks occasionally while cooking, and add more water if necessary. When shanks are done, stir in the evaporated milk and tomato soup. Cover and cook for an additional 10 minutes.
