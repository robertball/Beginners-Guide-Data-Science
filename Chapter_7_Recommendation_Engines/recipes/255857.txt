Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon white vinegar
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup vegetable shortening
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Mix milk and vinegar together in a small bowl. Let sit until milk curdles, about 5 minutes.
Combine flour, shortening, and salt in a large bowl; mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in milk mixture until dough comes together.
Roll dough on a floured work surface using a floured rolling pin.

Description: 
My Grandma Platt taught me how to make the perfect pie crust. No matter the humidity, how much you roll it out, or the temperature, it always comes out perfect and makes a wonderful flaky crust. I use it to make all my pies including the ones I sell at the local farmers market.
