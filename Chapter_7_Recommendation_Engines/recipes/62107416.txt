Ingredients:
Burgers:
1 lb ground chicken
3 T worchestershire sauce
1 egg
1 t garlic powder
1 t kosher salt
1 T parsley
3/4 c bread crumbs
2 T olive oil
1/2 c sliced onion
1 c shredded mozzarella
Biscuits:
2 1/4 c flour
1 T baking soda
1 t salt
1 T sugar
2 T chives (optional)
1/2 c shortening
1 c lowfat milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Heat oil in skillet on medium setting.
For burgers, simply combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and mush together with your hands.  This recipe is very forgiving; try seasoning to taste and experimenting with add-ins such as minced celery,  teriaki sauce, pineapple, or chili powder.  Shape into 5 patties, 3 inches across and 1 inch thick. "Grill" burgers in skillet 5-7 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.
After flipping the patties, throw in the onions and saute, sharing the pan with the burgers.
For biscuits, combine dry ingredients in mixing bowl with dough blade (or a wooden spoon and bowl will work fine.)  Cut in shortening.  Gradually add the milk; dough will start to pull from the sides of the bowl.  Turn out onto floured surface and knead for 2 minutes.  Flatten to 1 inch thickness.  Use a round cookie cutter or juice glass to cut biscuits, pushing straight down and pulling straight up to maintain fluffing capability while baking.  Cook at 425 for 13 minutes.
To assemble, cut biscuits open as buns.  Place burger, topped with onions and cheese.  Put top half of biscuits on burger; cheese will melt.
