Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped walnuts, or to taste (optional)
1/2 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips
1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 cup tapioca flour
1/4 cup sorghum flour
1/4 cup teff flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking pan.
Toss walnuts and chocolate chips with 1 teaspoon cocoa powder in a bowl until well coated; set aside. Mix tapioca flour, sorghum flour, teff flour, 1/3 cup cocoa powder, xanthan gum, and salt together in a separate bowl.
Beat butter and sugar together in a separate large bowl until creamy. Stir in eggs and vanilla extract. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture until fully incorporated. Fold in nuts and chocolate chips. Spread batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
I modified an old family favorite recipe upon going gluten-free. It is easy and super yummy and naughty. If you prefer to use a premade GF flour mix instead of the flours suggested, it will work just as well.
