Ingredients:
1/2 medium head of cauliflower, chopped and then minced fine in a food processor (about 1 3/4 cup minced)
1/4 cup water
6 scallions, chopped (green and white portions, about 2/3 cup chopped)
1/4 cup finely minced onion
2 eggs
salt to taste (1/4 teaspoon to start)
2 tablespoons coconut oil

Directions:
Bring the water to a boil over high heat in a medium saucepan. When it's boiling, place the cauliflower in, quickly stir it, cover the saucepan, and turn off the heat. Set a timer for 10 minutes to let the cauliflower steam. Afterwards, drain the cauliflower in layered cheesecloth, being careful to really squeeze out all the moisture.
In a large bowl, beat the eggs. Whisk in the scallions, onion, cauliflower, and salt.
Heat the coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Put all of the egg mixture in and spread it around. Let it cook for 5 minutes or until it's golden brown. Flip the pancake.
Cook it for another 3 minutes or so until its golden brown. Slide it out onto a wire rack to keep the bottom crispy and sprinkle over some extra salt to taste
