Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed, drained
1/2 cup water
1 (8.75 ounce) can whole kernel corn, very well drained
3/4 cup light dairy sour cream
3/4 cup shredded Co-Jack or Cheddar cheese
1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions
Crust:
1 (8.5 ounce) package corn muffin mix
3/4 cup shredded Co-Jack or Cheddar cheese
3/4 cup light dairy sour cream
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add ground beef; brown 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour off drippings. Stir in seasoning mix, beans and water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally; set aside.
Meanwhile in medium bowl, combine crust ingredients, mixing just until dry ingredients are moistened. (Batter will be stiff.) Using spoon dipped in water, spread slightly more than 1/2 the batter onto bottom and up side of 9-inch pie pan.
Arrange corn over batter; top with beef mixture. Spoon remaining batter over beef, along outer edge of pie. Carefully spread batter toward center, leaving a 3-inch circle uncovered. Bake in 400 degrees F oven 23 to 25 minutes or until top is golden brown.
To serve, dollop 3/4 cup sour cream over top; sprinkle with 3/4 cup cheese and 1/3 cup green onions. Cut into wedges.
