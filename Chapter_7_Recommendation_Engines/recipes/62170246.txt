Ingredients:
1 large Napa Cabbage
1 gallon water
1/2 cup coarse salt
1 small head of garlic, peeled and finely minced
1 walnut sized piece of fresh ginger, peeled and minced
1/2 cup Korean chili powder (if you want it spicy)
1 bunch green onions, cut into 1 inch(Use green part too)

Directions:
Slice the cabbage lengthwise in half, then slice each half lengthwise into 3 sections. Cut away the tough stem chunks.
Dissolve the salt in the water in a very large container, then submerge the cabbage under the water. Put a plate on top to make sure they stay under water, then let stand for 2 hours or longer
Mix the other ingredients in a very large metal or glass bowl.
Drain the cabbage, rinse it, and squeeze it dry.
Mix all ingredients together
Some recipes advise wearing gloves since the chili can burn if you touch your eyes.
Pack the kimchi in a clean glass jar large enough to hold it all and cover it tightly. Let stand for 2-4 days in a cool place, around room temperature.
Check the kimchi after two days. If it's bubbling a bit, it's ready and can be refrigerated. If not, let it stand 1-2 more days, when it should be ready.
Once it's fermenting, serve or store in the refrigerator.
