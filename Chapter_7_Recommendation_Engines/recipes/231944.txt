Description: 
My husbands favorite. Simple and delicious. A white macaroni and cheese with meat. I have also made with cooked drained Italian sausage. Leftovers are really good. The degreasing is an added step, but it really helps. I made it with out doing that the first time, it was so greasy I couldn't eat it.
