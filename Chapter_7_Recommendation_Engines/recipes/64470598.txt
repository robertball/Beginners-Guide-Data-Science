Ingredients:
3 cups all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup feta cheese
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
3/4 cup chopped KALE
1/4 cup minced fresh chives
1 1/4 sticks (10 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted
1/2 cup buttermilk

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the cheese, kale and chives to the dry mix and combine throughly.
3. Make a well center of the dry ingredients, and pour the butter and buttermilk into the well. With clean hands, combine the ingredients until all the dry mixture is wet, but do not kneed! (The fluffiness of Dino bones is a mite fragile.)
4. Scoop or pluck out tablespoon sized gobs of dough and place on a cookie sheet (just like kale cookies!) For extra mightiness, shape the gooey dough into your favorite dino-shape.
5. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned
