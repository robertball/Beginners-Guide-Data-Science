Ingredients:
5 teaspoons all-purpose flour, divided
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 pound boneless pork, cubed
5 tablespoons butter, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, halved and sliced
2 celery ribs, sliced
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 medium zucchini, halved and sliced
1 medium tomato, diced
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine 3 tablespoons flour, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Add pork; seal bag and shake to coat. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown pork in 3 tablespoons butter and oil; remove and keep warm.
In the same skillet, saute the onion, celery and mushrooms in remaining butter for 5 minutes. Add pork and zucchini; saute until meat juices run clear and vegetables are tender.
Stir in the tomato. Place the remaining flour in a small bowl; stir in the broth and vinegar until smooth. Add to skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with rice.
