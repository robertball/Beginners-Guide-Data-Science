Ingredients:
3/4 pound green beans, trimmed
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced (about ½ cup)
1/2 medium red bell pepper, thinly sliced (about ½ cup)
1/4 pound shitake mushrooms, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon red chili garlic sauce

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.
Add the green beans to the water. Cook the beans for about 4 minutes, or until they are bright green and still slightly crisp. Meanwhile, prepare a large bowl of ice water.
Drain the green beans in colander and quickly place them in the ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain the beans again in a colander before proceeding to the next step.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the onion, pepper, and mushrooms, and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly, or until the vegetables begin to brown slightly.
Add the green beans, garlic, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Cook for 30 seconds, or until the garlic is fragrant.
Add the red chili garlic sauce to the skillet and stir to coat the vegetables well. Remove from heat and serve
