Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup honey
2 eggs, slightly beaten
2 cups rice flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
2 teaspoons hemp seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Beat butter and honey together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add eggs and mix well. Mix rice flour, baking powder, and cardamom into creamed butter mixture until dough is just mixed. Roll dough into small balls, about 1 heaping teaspoon each.
Pour hemp seeds into a bowl and press each dough ball into the seeds, coating half of each ball. Transfer dough balls to the baking sheet, gently pressing to 1/4-inch thickness.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
In Ancient temples, they offered 'Honey Cakes' to the goddess. I Imagine that they were something like this! I adapted the rice flour for modern tastes, although you can try barley flour if you wish.
