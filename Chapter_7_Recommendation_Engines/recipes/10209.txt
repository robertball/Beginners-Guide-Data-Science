Description: 
For best results, mix your dough by hand.  Lightly oil mold  and blot with paper towel.  Lightly flour mold and  re-flour the mold before each cookie but DO NOT re-oil.  Press a piece of dough firmly and evenly into the mold.  Trim the back of the cookie so it's flush with the mold.  Tap the  dough from mold and place on a baking sheet in the top third of your oven until nicely browned - about 10 minutes.
