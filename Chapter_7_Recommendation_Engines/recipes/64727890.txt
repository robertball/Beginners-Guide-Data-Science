Ingredients:
2 Cups + 2 Tbs Flour
1 Tbs Cornstarch
1 tsp Baking Soda
2 tsp Cinnamon powder, divided
1/2 tsp Salt
1 tsp Ginger, Ground
1/4 tsp Clove, Ground
1/8 tsp Nutmeg, Fresh Grated
3/4 Cup Butter, Softened
3/4 Cup Brown Sugar, Light
1/2 Cup Granulated Sugar, Fine
1/4 Cup Molasses
1 lg Egg
2 tsp Vanilla Extract

Directions:
1. Preheat Oven to 350*and line two cookie sheets with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Set aside.
2. In a Medium Bowl whisk together Flour, Cornstarch, Baking Soda, 1 tsp Cinnamon, salt, Ginger, Clove and Nutmeg. Set aside.
3. In a small Bowl 1/4 Cup combine Granulated Sugar and 1 tsp Cinnamon for coating Dough Balls. Set aside
4. Using a mixer, cream the Butter, Brown Sugar and remaining 1/4 Cup Granulated Sugar until light and fluffy. Add Molasses, Egg and 2 tsp Vanilla until well combined. Slowly spoon in dry ingredients mixing and scraping sides and bottom of mixing bowl until fluffy.
5. Roll into 1" balls of dough and coat fully, with Cinnamon/Sugar mixture, (I use a dishing scooper). Place on the Cookie Sheets about 2" apart.
6. Bake for 10-14 minutes until cookies just begin to crack on top. If desired sprinkle more of the Cinnamon/Sugar while still hot for added sweetness. Move to a cooling rack.
7. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container for a week if they are not all gone.
Enjoy.
