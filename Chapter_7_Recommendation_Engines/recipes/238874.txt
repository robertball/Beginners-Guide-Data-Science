Ingredients:
Cake:
1 (18.25 ounce) package vanilla cake mix
1 cup water
3 eggs
1/3 cup oil
3 very ripe bananas, mashed
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
Frosting:
1 cup milk
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant banana cream pudding mix
1 (8 ounce) container low-fat frozen whipped topping (such as Cool WhipÂ® Lite), thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish.
Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and oil together in a bowl using a electric mixer until batter is smooth and well mixed, about 2 minutes. Mix bananas, cinnamon, and baking soda together in a separate bowl; stir into batter. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool cake completely.
Beat milk and pudding mix together in a bowl until smooth; fold in whipped topping until frosting is smooth. Spread frosting onto cooled cake.
