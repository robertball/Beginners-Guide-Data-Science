Ingredients:
6 cups fresh raspberries
1/3 cup sugar
3 cups fresh strawberries
1 1/2 cups SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1 cup cold water
1 (1.75 ounce) package no-sugar-needed pectin
1 pint blueberries

Directions:
Combine raspberries and sugar in a heavy bottomed pan.  Heat over medium-high heat.  Boil 10-15 minutes, stirring constantly.
Mash strawberries with a fork or potato masher.
Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and strawberries to raspberries.  Stir constantly and boil over medium-high heat for an additional 10-15 minutes.
Pour cold water into a small saucepan.  Whisk pectin into water, and let stand 2-3 minutes. Allow the pectin to absorb the water.
Boil water and pectin, then stir into fruit mixture and reduce heat to medium-low.  Add blueberries. Simmer and stir for 5-6 minutes, until pectin is thoroughly blended with the fruit.
Freeze in sterile canning jars.
