Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) salmon fillets, skin removed
1 tablespoon lime or lemon juice
1/2 cup panko (Japanese bread crumbs, available in the Asian food aisle), or substitute dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup flaked sweetened coconut
Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
Cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Place salmon fillets on a non-stick baking pan. Brush juice on salmon.
In a shallow dish, combine panko, coconut, salt and pepper. Dredge each fillet in the mixture and return to baking pan. Spread leftover crumbs on top of each fillet. Coat with cooking spray.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes. If desired, put under broiler until crust is golden brown.

Description: 
Many cooks are intimidated by cooking fresh fish and, as a result, miss out on the heart-healthy, brain-boosting, omega-3 fatty acids in salmon. Never fear, though; This fast fish recipe is foolproof.
