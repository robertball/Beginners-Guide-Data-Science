Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package Maple Flavor Jimmy Dean Pork Sausage
1/4 cup maple syrup
3 eggs
1/2 cup sliced green onions
2 apples, peeled and grated or finely chopped
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1/2 cup dried, sweetened cranberries (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 F. In large mixing bowl, lightly beat two of the eggs. Add uncooked sausage, syrup, onions, apples and flour; add cranberries if desired; stir well. Divide mixture in half; set aside.
Roll out each pastry sheet to an 11inch wide X 14 inch tall rectangle. Spoon half of sausage mixture down center third of each sheet. Lightly beat remaining egg with 2 teaspoons of water. Brush exposed edges of pastry sheets with egg mix. Use knife to make seven 45-degree diagonal cuts in exposed pastry on each side of filling-cuts should stop about 1 inch from filling. Fold resulting strips over filling, alternating sides until filling is enclosed. Brush pastry surface with remaining egg mix; sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Place on two baking sheets; bake 50 minutes or until braids are light golden brown and filling is set.
