Ingredients:
Marinara:
2 tablespoons butter
1 large onion (yellow), finely chopped
1/4 cup white wine
1 (28 oz) can diced tomatoes
1 (12 oz) can tomato paste
2 (15 oz) cans tomato sauce
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 cups water (filtered preferably)
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
3 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped
1/4 cup red wine (Cabernet)
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 bay leaf
sea salt (to taste)
parmesan cheese, fresh grated for garnish (optional)
fresh parsley for garnish (optional)
Meatballs:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 pound italian sausage
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 small onion (yellow), finely chopped
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons italian seasoning
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 3/4 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
3 tablespoons worcestershire sauce
2/3 cup skim milk
1 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup parmesan cheese, fresh grated
1/4 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped
3 tablespoon fresh basil, finely chopped

Directions:
Marinara:
In a large pot, melt butter and add onions with a dash of fresh ground black pepper and sea salt. Cook onions for 5 minutes on medium heat, stirring frequently. Then add the white wine, give a quick stir, cover and simmer on low heat for 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, uncover, turn the heat to high and stir the onions until they turn a caramel brown color. (Keep stirring to avoid burning!)
Once the onions are caramel brown, proceed to add the remaining ingredients to the pan by order, stir well, and bring to a boil. Then reduce to a simmer, cover and cook for 1 1/2 hours; stirring every 15-20 minutes.
Meatballs:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a large mixing bowl, combine all meatball ingredients and mix by hand, massaging the meat to blend all the ingredients well.
Using your hands, form your meatballs to your desired size and place on a baking sheet.
Bake for 30 minutes, turning them once after 15 minutes.
When meatballs are done, remove from baking sheet and add them to your marinara sauce.
Serve over spaghetti and garnish with parmesan cheese and fresh parsley.
