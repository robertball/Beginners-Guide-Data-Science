Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups sugar
2 cups grated coconut (I prefer unsweetened)
1/2 cup coconut milk/coconut cream
1 cup almond flour/almond meal
additional grated coconut for rolling (optional)

Directions:
Combine the grated coconut and coconut milk in a bowl; mix thoroughly.
Melt the sugar in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until it is completely liquid.  Remove from heat.
Add the coconut mixture and almond flour to the sugar and stir until well combined.
Let it cool.
When mixture is cool enough to handle easily, roll into bite-sized balls and roll the balls in additional grated coconut if desired.  The mixture will be gooey, but it will probably still be easier to roll than you might expect.  If it isn't, add more almond flour a little at a time till of rollable consistency.
Serve chilled.  These last a long time in the fridge and freeze well, too.

Description: 
Recently I was planning an African-themed party, and I came across a recipe for a Somali snack by this name.  The first version I tried was a little too sweet for me, and the consistency was all wrong for rolling into balls.  I made some adjustments in the proportions, and this is the result.  Yum!
