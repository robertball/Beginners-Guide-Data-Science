Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley, freshly chopped
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 pounds lean lamb meat, cut in 1-inch cubes
16 garlic stuffed green olives
16 cherry tomatoes
4 pita pocket bread, for serving
Cucumber Salad, recipe follows
Store-bought tzatziki sauce, for serving
Special equipment: 8 (10-inch) bamboo skewers, soaked in water for about 30 minutes
Cucumber Salad
1 large cucumber, peeled and diced into 1/4-inch cubes
1 medium onion, diced
1/4 cup feta cheese, crumbled
3 tablespoons zesty Italian dressing
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Light broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil and set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine oil, parsley, garam marsala, garlic salt, pepper, and cubed lamb, mix thoroughly to coat all lamb cubes.
To make skewers, alternate lamb, tomato and olives. Finish with a piece of lamb so that there are 3 cubes of lamb per skewer. Place skewers on prepared baking sheet. Broil 4 to 6 inches from heat source for 2 minutes per side for 8 total minutes.
Serve skewers hot with pita bread, Cucumber Salad and tzatziki sauce.
Serving Ideas: Rosemary skewers would be fantastic with these kebabs. Be sure to wrap exposed rosemary leaves with foil to keep from burning.
