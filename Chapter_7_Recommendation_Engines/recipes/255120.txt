Ingredients:
1 egg yolk
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon water
1 clove garlic, pressed
1 sheet frozen pre-rolled puff pastry sheet
1/3 cup CRACKER BARREL Shredded Habanero Heat Cheese, divided

Directions:
Heat oven to 400F.
Beat egg yolk, mustard and water until blended; stir in garlic. Roll pastry sheet into 14x10-inch rectangle on lightly floured surface; cut lengthwise in half. Brush lightly with some of the egg mixture.
Sprinkle 1 pastry piece with 3 Tbsp. cheese. Cover with remaining pastry piece, egg side down. Roll gently with rolling pin to seal; brush with half the remaining egg mixture. Starting at one long side, roll up tightly; cut crosswise into 24 slices.
Place, cut sides down, 2 inches apart on baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray; flatten slightly. Brush with remaining egg mixture; sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Bake 12 to 14 min. or until golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.
