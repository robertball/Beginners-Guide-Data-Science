Description: 
Chicken a la crema is one of my favorite recipes and one of the greatest chicken recipes of all time. It's simple to make, incredibly comforting, and gorgeous to look at. Sauteed mushrooms and onions are well browed to add extra flavor and give the sauce a beautifully rich color. Spoon this into a bowl alongside rice and top with a dollop of creme fraiche and a sprinkle of cilantro, or wrap it up in a fresh, warm tortilla and dunk it in the sauce--no matter how you serve it, this dish should be on every chicken lover's bucket list.
