Ingredients:
2 cups UNCLE BEN'S® Natural Whole Grain Brown Rice
1 cup diced onion
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
4 cups vegetable broth
1 small eggplant
1 cup plain yogurt
1 large tomato, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can navy beans
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a saucepan, saute the onion in the oil until it has lightly browned. Add the garlic, salt, pepper and turmeric. Add rice and broth, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover and cook for 30 minutes.
While the rice is cooking, peel and cut the eggplant into 1/4-inch slices. Sprinkle with salt and set aside for about 10 minutes. Rinse and pat dry.
Lightly salt the eggplant and spray with oil. Brown both sides in a hot skillet, set aside.
Once the rice is cooked, mix in yogurt and transfer mixture to a large shallow casserole dish. Spread the navy and garbanzo beans over the rice and then top with layer of eggplant and chopped tomatoes.
Bake uncovered in a preheated 350 F oven for about 20 minutes.
