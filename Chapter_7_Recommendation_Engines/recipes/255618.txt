Ingredients:
12 small purple potatoes, scrubbed and halved
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 ounces goat cheese
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 (3 ounce) package prosciutto, cut into 5 strips per piece

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Trim potato halves so they sit flat on a baking sheet. Scoop out flesh into a bowl.
Transfer potato skins to a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil on top; season with salt and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Add potato flesh; cook until soft, about 10 minutes.
Strain potato flesh into a bowl and mash with goat cheese, garlic, and rosemary. Fill potato skins with mashed mixture. Wrap a slice of prosciutto around each potato skin.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
