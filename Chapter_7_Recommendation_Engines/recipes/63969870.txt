Ingredients:
1 cups butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 3 - 8x4 inch loaf pans, then line with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time.  Beat in the flour alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated.
Pour batter evenly into prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.  After removing them from the oven, immediately loosen cake edges with a knife.  Allow to cool in pans for 10 minutes, then remove from the pans.  Strip off the parchment paper and cool completely on wire racks.
