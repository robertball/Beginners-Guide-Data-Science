Ingredients:
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vinegar
12 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and halved

1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons sour cream
1 tablespoon mustard

Directions:
Muddle thyme, sage, oregano, rosemary, garlic salt, and salt together with a mortar and pestle. Pour vinegar into mortar bowl and swirl around to mix with herbs.
Scoop egg yolks from eggs and transfer to a bowl; mash egg yolks using a fork until texture is very fine. Stir chives and black pepper into mashed egg yolks. Pour vinegar-herb mixture into egg yolks and mix well. Mix mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, and sucralose sweetener into egg yolk mixture until smooth. Spoon egg yolk mixture into egg whites using a teaspoon.

Description: 
I use the fresh herbs from my garden for this recipe, so all measurements are in leaves or pieces. I've approximated measures, where possible. Feel free to play around with measurements and tweak where needed. I rarely really measure, so these are approximate.
