Description: 
'A friend agreed to repair some plumbing in exchange for a home-cooked dinner, but he showed up before I could shop for groceries,' explains Lisa Robisch of Cincinatti, Ohio. 'A can of artichokes in the pantry inspired me to combine a favorite hot dip recipe with a chicken bake. The results were so delicious, he said he'd rush over anytime.'
