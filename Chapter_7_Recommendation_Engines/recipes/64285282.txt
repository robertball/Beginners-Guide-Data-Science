Ingredients:
3/4 cup  fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup  fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons  drained brine-packed green peppercorns, lightly crushed
1 teaspoon  butter
1 teaspoon  vegetable oil
2   (6-ounce) tilapia or sole fillets
1/4 teaspoon  salt
1/4 teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup  all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons  butter
Lemon wedges (optional)

Directions:
Combine first 3 ingredients.
Melt 1 teaspoon of butter with oil in a large nonstick skillet over low heat.
While butter melts, sprinkle fish fillets with salt and black pepper. Place the flour in a shallow dish. Dredge fillets in flour; shake off excess flour.
Increase heat to medium-high; heat 2 minutes or until butter turns golden brown. Add fillets to pan; saut√© 3 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Remove fillets from pan. Add broth mixture to pan, scraping to loosen browned bits. Bring to a boil; cook until reduced to 1/2 cup (about 3 minutes). Remove from heat. Stir in two teaspoons of butter with a whisk. Serve sauce over fillets. Garnish with lemon wedges, if desired.
