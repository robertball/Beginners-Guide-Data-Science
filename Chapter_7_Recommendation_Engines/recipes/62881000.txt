Ingredients:
1- 2.5 lb Beef Pot Roast
2 small yellow onions, medium diced
2 stalks of celery, roughly chopped
3 medium carrots, sliced 1/2 inch thick
1 lb fingerling purple potatoes, cut in half (small red potatoes can be substituted).
1 small bunch of Italian Kale, washed and stripped
1/4 cup of fresh Italian flat leaf parsley
3 cloves garlic, minced
1- 6 oz. can of golden mushroom soup
1/2 cup of red wine-preferrably Malbec.
2 Tbsp of Kosher salt
1 Tbsp course ground black pepper
1 bay leaf
4 Tbsp Olive oil

Directions:
In a heavy iron pot, heat olive oil until smoke point is reached. Season both sides of the roast with salt and pepper. Gently lay the seasoned pot roast into the iron pot, searing both sides well. Add onions, garlic, mushroom soup and kale. Lower heat and cover letting cook for 1 hour. Remove lid, and stir slightly before adding remaining vegetables wine and potatoes. Return cover and continue to cook for an additional 45 minutes to allow vegetables to cook until tender. Remove cover and taste for salt and pepper. Remove roast from pot and let rest for 15 minutes before service. The cooked vegetables make a fantastic side dish!! Serve with a crusty toasted french bread to absorb the rich sauce.

Description: 
I had a craving for Italian and American home cooking at the same time one afternoon. So I got in my kitchen and tinkered until I created this savory, rustic, and absolutely fabulous pot roast with Italian accents. Finished dish is rich, full-bodied, and stick to your ribs good.
