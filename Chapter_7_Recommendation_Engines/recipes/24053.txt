Ingredients:
12 plums, pitted and halved
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons tapioca
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 1/4 cups all-purpose baking mix
3 tablespoons white sugar
2/3 cup milk
3 tablespoons margarine, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a 2 quart baking dish, stir together plums, 1 cup sugar, water, tapioca and cinnamon. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. (You can also cook the plum mixture in the microwave for 15 minutes.)
Raise oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, stir together baking mix, 3 tablespoons sugar, milk and melted margarine to form a biscuit dough. Drop dough by spoonfuls onto plum mixture. Bake in preheated oven 10 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool slightly before serving.

Description: 
An old fashioned plum pudding that was passed down to me from my grandmother, with a modification of using baking mix instead of making the top from scratch.   I serve it with ice cream or what I call a Dip made from milk and flavored to taste with cinnamon and vanilla.  I let each individual pour on the amount of dip they would like from a small pitcher.
