Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil
1 large onion
1 jalapeno chile, finely chopped (I didn't use one because I don't like spice)
2 tbsp tomato paste
2 tsp curry powder
3 small plum tomatoes, cut into chunks
1 cup water
1 pound shrimp, peeled
1/4 sour cream
1 tbsp lime juice
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet, add onion, jalapeno, and salt. Cook until onions begin to soften. Afterwards, add tomato paste, curry powder, and ginger. Stir and let cook about 1 minute.
Add tomatoes to skillet. Cook, stirring until they begin to release juices (about 1 minute). Add the water, simmer until tomatoes begin to break down (3 or so minutes). Add shrimp and let them fry a little.
Add in sour cream and lime juice. Eat over rice.
