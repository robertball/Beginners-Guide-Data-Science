Ingredients:
12 oz Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast, cut into bite size cubes
1/2 cup Onion, diced
1 can (14.5 oz) Chicken broth
1 Cup Farro
6 oz Baby Spinach
1 can (14.5 oz) Diced tomatoes (I use basil, oregano & garlic), un-drained
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/ teaspoon parsley
salt and pepper to taste
Grated Parmigiana (optional)

Directions:
Cook chicken and onions with nonstick cooking spray in saut√© pan.
Once chicken is no longer pink and cooked through, remove chicken from pan.
Stir in chicken broth.  Bring to a boil.
Stir in Farro and cook covered for 15-20 minutes or until most of the liquid is absorbed.
Add the chicken back into the skillet. Add in the diced tomatoes, spinach, basil, parsley; season with salt and pepper to taste. Reduce heat and simmer covered for 5-7 minutes.
Remove from heat. Let stand 3-5 minutes, covered.
Serve topped with grated parmigiana and a side of bread/butter.

Description: 
I make a similar dish using rice and decided to substitute Farro. We all loved it! I serve this with a crusty bread and a salad.
