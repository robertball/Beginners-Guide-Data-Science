Ingredients:
10 oz frozen Brussels sprouts
8 oz frozen edamame
3 carrots
1 1/4 lb eggplant
sesame oil
5 pignoli
1 shallot
2 1/2 c water
1 c brown rice
To taste:
salt
pepper
sesame seed
ginger
basil

Directions:
Boil 2 c water and the rice.  Reduce to a simmer and let cook for about 30-40 minutes or until the rice has absorbed all the water.
While the rice cookes, partially defrost the Brussels sprouts.  Meanwhile, peel the eggplant and cut it into small, 1" pieces.  Peel the carrots and cut them into very thin (1/4" or smaller) disks on the diagonal.  Chop the shallot.
When the Brussels sprouts are mostly defrosted, cut each in half from top to bottom.
Combine the carrots, eggplant, and Brussels sprouts in a pan with enough sesame oil to coat the pan and about a half cup of water.  Stir until the eggplant has absorbed nearly all of the water.
Then place the pan on high heat.  Crush the pignoli and add them in, along with rice vinegar, salt, pepper, sesame seed, ginger, and basil, to taste.
When the eggplant is cooked, add the edamame.
When the edamame is hot, the dish is finished cooking.  Remove from heat.
When the rice is finished, add some sesame oil and salt, to taste, and stir.
Serve the vegetable mix over the rice.
