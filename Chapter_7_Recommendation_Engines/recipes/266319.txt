Ingredients:
Dough:
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 tablespoons vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®)
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup water
Apple Marinade:
2 yellow apples, peeled and sliced into eighths
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup water
4 tablespoons vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®), melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Whisk flour, vegan margarine, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl until fine crumbs form. Add water and mix to combine. Separate dough into 10 equal pieces.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Chop each apple eighth into 4 chunks. Place apple chunks in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook until soft but not mushy, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Combine brown sugar, water, vegan margarine, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until butter has dissolved, about 30 seconds. Stir marinade and pour over cooked apples in the saucepan. Let apples marinate for 10 minutes.
Flatten a piece of dough into a circle. Place 4 apple chunks in the center and wrap dough around; pinch to seal. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and apples; reserve remaining marinade.
Drizzle remaining marinade over dumplings on the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 30 minutes. Serve hot.
