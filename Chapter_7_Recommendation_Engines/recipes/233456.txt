Description: 
This is a delicious, easy, and quick recipe. Children love it. Best served with plain white rice and roasted or grilled  chicken. It reminds me of my childhood as my mother use to make it for us. My mam took this recipe from my grandmother. It's  a traditional Egyptian dish. The best part is that it is an all year recipe.
