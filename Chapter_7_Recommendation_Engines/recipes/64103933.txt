Ingredients:
2 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp regular butter
1/2 cup(s) uncooked chopped onion(s)
1/2 cup(s) fresh sliced mushroom(s)
1/2 cup(s) uncooked chopped bell pepper(s)
6 oz cooked skinless boneless chicken breasts cut into bite sized pieces
3 cloves minced garlic clove
1 tsp sugar
1/2 cup of pure maple syrup
1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
2 1/2 Tbsp curry powder
Cooked Penne noodles (gluten free option)

Directions:
In a deep skillet, heat the oil and butter on medium high heat.  Add onions, mushrooms, peppers and cook until softened.
Add garlic, sugar and maple syrup.  Reduce to medium-low heat.  Let it bubble, until reduced and almost caramelized, about 5 minutes.
Add the cooked chicken, whipping cream and curry powder.  Mix through and let it cook another 7-10 minutes to get the flavors through, or until it is thickened to your desired consistency.
Serve over cooked (gluten free) penne noodles
