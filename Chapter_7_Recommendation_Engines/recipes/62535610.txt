Ingredients:
26 chocolate wafer cookies (about 6 ounces), broken into pieces
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
2 quarts coffee ice cream, slightly softened
1/3 cup chocolate-covered coffee beans
2 1/4 cups chilled whipping cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
Milk chocolate shavings

Directions:
Blend cookies in processor until finely ground. Add melted butter; process until crumbs are moistened. Press crumb mixture onto bottom of 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides. Freeze until firm, about 10 minutes.
Place ice cream in large bowl. Finely chop coffee beans in processor. Add to bowl with ice cream; stir until well blended. Transfer ice cream mixture to crust-lined pan. Smooth top. Cover with plastic wrap. Freeze overnight.
Combine whipping cream and vanilla in another large bowl. Sift powdered sugar and cocoa over. Using electric mixer, beat until soft peaks form. Spread mixture over top of cake. Freeze until cream is set, at least 1 hour. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; keep frozen.) Sprinkle chocolate shavings over top of cake. Run knife between pan sides and cake to loosen. Remove pan sides. Using small metal spatula or knife, smooth cake sides. Let cake stand at cool room temperature 10 minutes before serving.
