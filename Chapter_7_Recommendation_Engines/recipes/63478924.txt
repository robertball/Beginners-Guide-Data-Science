Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked quinoa
1 1/2 cups water
1 1/4 lbs. ground turkey
2 Tbsp. olive oil
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp. fresh sage, minced
1 tsp. fresh rosemary, minced
1/2 cup Mizithra Cheese (or 1/4 cup ricotta and 1/4 romano would work as well)
Freshly ground Himalayan salt (or sea salt) and freshly ground Black Pepper to taste

Directions:
Rinse and drain quinoa then combine with 1 1/2 cups of water in a medium sauce pan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low and cover with lid.
When quinoa is finished cooking (15-20 minutes), set aside.
In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.
Add onion and red bell pepper with a large pinch of salt. Stir occasionally until onions and peppers are tender and starting to brown.
Generously salt and pepper the ground turkey and add it to the skillet and increase temperature to medium/high.
When turkey is almost browned, add garlic, sage and rosemary and stir to combine.
Continue cooking until turkey is browned.  Drain off excess fat then return to stove top and turn heat to medium/low.
Add quinoa.  When thoroughly combined and heated through, add the cheese and remove from the heat.
Taste and adjust the salt and pepper if needed.

Description: 
This was a dish I threw together last minute that was a success!  My husband and kids loved it and will be a dish we have often.  The cheese really compliments the dish and should not be left out.
