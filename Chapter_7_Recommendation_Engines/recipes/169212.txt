Ingredients:
8 ears fresh corn, husked
¼ cup butter
1  onion, chopped
1  green bell pepper, chopped
2  tomatoes, chopped
1 pound frozen peeled crawfish tails, thawed
3  green onions, sliced
1 ½ teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)

Directions:
Using a sharp knife, cut corn kernels from the cob into a large bowl. Into the same bowl, scrape the cobs with the dull side of the knife to release any juice left in the cob. Set aside.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper and tomatoes, and cook and stir until the onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Add the corn, crawfish, green onions, sugar, salt, black pepper, and cayenne and cook and stir until corn is tender, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This fresh corn dish is a Cajun favorite you won't see much outside of Louisiana. Every time I make this for people they love it. You can leave out the crawfish for a vegetarian side dish, or you can substitute fresh shrimp if crawfish is hard to find.
