Description: 
I RECEIVED this recipe years ago from a friend. It's a delicious new twist to a baked potato.     I recently served these potatoes to visiting relatives from Norway, and they were a big hit. I love to cook and even wrote my own cookbook several years ago. -LaVerna Mjones, Moorhead, Minnesota
