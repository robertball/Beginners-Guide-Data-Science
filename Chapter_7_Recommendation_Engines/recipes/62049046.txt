Mom's Spaghetti Recipe

Ingredients:
Sauce:
1 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes (NOT with basil)
1 green pepper, seeded and cut into large chunks
1 onion, peeled and cut into large chunks
2 cloves garlic
2 slices bacon
2-3 tablespoons sugar
salt and pepper
Spaghetti:
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons butter
1 pound ground beef
salt and pepper
1 pound #8 spaghetti

Directions:
1. To prepare sauce: Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan, cover, bring to a boil then cook over low heat for two to three hours. Taste occasionally for seasoning and adjust sugar, salt and pepper as needed; should be slightly sweet. After cooking, put mixture into a hand-crank food mill and crank through into a bowl until all that's left in the mill are skins and the puree in the bowl is thick.
2. To prepare spaghetti:  Cook spaghetti in boiling salted water until al dente, drain and rinse. Meanwhile, saute the onion in butter until translucent, then add the ground beef and brown, crumbling into small pieces, seasoning with salt and pepper. After browning, drain most (but not all) of the fat off and combine cooked spaghetti with the meat and onion mixture. Tastes better if left to rest for an hour or so to blend the flavors. Top with spaghetti sauce and serve.

Description: 
This is my all-time family favorite. My grandmother, Mom, would make this and I'd beg to be invited to dinner. It was one of the first things I learned to cook when I finally got interested. Different tomato sauce, a bit sweet, with the meat mixed with the spaghetti. You'll need a food mill to prepare this properly, and it's not an Italian taste, so I don't top it with Parmesan.
