Ingredients:
2 tbsp. olive oil
2 lamb shanks
salt and pepper
1 small onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
14 oz. diced tomatos, with juice
3/4 c. white wine
3/4 c. red wine
1 c. water
1 tbsp. Better Than Bouillon (chicken flavor)
1 tbsp. fresh rosemary
1 tsp. fresh thyme

Directions:
In a large frying pan, gently heat the olive oil, then add the lamb and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat over medium heat, turning the meat until it's browned on all sides (about 15 minutes). Then remove the meat from the heat and set aside.
Toss diced onions into the pan and cook until they're just translucent. Add the remaining ingredients and stir well. Then place the lamb back into the pan, ideally covering with the liquid (if the liquid doesn't cover them in full, don't worry... the recipe will still work).
Cover the pan, and let the meat simmer in the sauce for 2-1/2 to 3 hours, turning the mean every 30-45 minutes. The meat is done when it easily falls away from the bone.

Description: 
For years I've used Tom Valenti's recipe for Lamb Shanks and, if you want to impress, it's a great dish. But my husband and I wanted a lighter version, and just enough meat for two of us. So here's what I came up with.

Without meaning to brag, this is one of those dishes that you'd be thrilled to be served at a restaurant.
