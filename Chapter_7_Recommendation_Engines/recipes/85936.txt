Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup cottage cheese
1 cup milk
2 eggs
1/2 cup biscuit baking mix

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until no longer pink. Drain and stir in the tomato paste, salt, and Italian seasoning. Set aside a little bit of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses for the top; stir the rest into the ground beef. Set aside.
Spread cottage cheese into the bottom of a 9 inch pie plate. Spoon the ground beef mixture over the cheese. In a small bowl, stir together the milk and eggs. Blend in the biscuit mix until smooth. Pour over the top of the pie, covering completely.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top.
