Ingredients:
1 cup kimchi, chopped into bite-sized pieces, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons white vinegar
1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Heat a nonstick skillet to medium-high heat. Add kimchi. Saute until fragrant and slightly yellow, about 5 minutes. Add sesame oil; cook until kimchi is coated, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in vinegar to coat the bottom of the skillet. Increase heat slightly; bring vinegar to a boil. Add sugar. Reduce heat to low; cook until sugar dissolves and kimchi is browned, about 3 minutes.

Description: 
Kimchi is a popular Korean side dish featuring fermented cabbage. Other vegetables can be used and applied with the same fermentation process to produce a similar taste and different textures. In this recipe, I fry some kimchi to completely alter the taste and texture for a smoky doppelganger! It is so great with Korean barbeque and with plain old rice. It is certainly one of my favorites and so easy to make. Enjoy hot or cold! Sprinkle sesame seeds on top as a garnish.
