Rinse and pat dry the roast. Place in a glass dish and sprinkle with salt.

When ready to cook, place roast in heavy duty foil and pour 2-3 tsp white vinegar over the roast.  Sprinkle with black pepper.
Seal securely with foil.
Bake at 350 for 3 hours.  Let sit 15 - 30 minutes prior to opening foil.
Then I use the broth which has cooked from the meat to make some gravy.
