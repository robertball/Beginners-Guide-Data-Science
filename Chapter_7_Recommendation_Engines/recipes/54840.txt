Ingredients:
4 large Granny Smith apples, peeled and cored
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
4 tablespoons butter
1 cup brandy

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place apples in a shallow baking dish. Mix together the brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, allspice and nutmeg; pack the mixture into the cores of the apples and pile the remaining on the tops. The tops of the apples should be covered. Place 1 tablespoon of butter on top of each apple. Pour the brandy into the dish, drizzling over the apples. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until apples can be sliced with a spoon. Serve in a bowl with some ice cream, and spoon sauce over. The sauce will be slightly runny.
