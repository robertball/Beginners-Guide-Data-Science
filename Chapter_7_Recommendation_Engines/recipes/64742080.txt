Filling:

Place bottom crust in lightly greased cast iron skillet or a pie plate (use cast iron!)
Pour apple slice mixture into pie crust spreading them out.
Sprinkle topping mix all over the top of the apples making sure to pat it down on the apples.
Place the skillet or pie plate onto a baking sheet in case it drips over and put in oven.
Bake at 450F for 15 mins then reduce heat to 350 and bake for 45 - 60 mins.  (Mine are always done at 45 mins)  (You can use a toothpick to pierce the center and make sure your apples are soft)

Description: 
This is hands down one of the yummiest and easiest apple pies ever!  I'm not gonna lie...i even used a store bought pie crust for the bottom!  Of course you can make your own crust, I usually do, but this pie doesn't need it!!  A store bought pie crust works great!  There is so much flavor in this.  It's absolutely one of my faves to make.
