Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
3 pounds boneless pork ribs
1 cup shredded carrot
4 1/2 fluid ounces barbeque sauce
4 1/2 ounces mesquite sauce

Directions:
Pour beef broth into slow cooker and add pork ribs. Cook on High until meat shreds easily, about 4 hours. Remove meat and shred with two forks.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer shredded pork to a Dutch oven or skillet and stir in carrots, barbecue sauce, and mesquite sauce.
Bake in preheated oven until heated through, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This meat is so good for sandwiches. I like to add a little fiber to it with some carrots and cut out some sugar by using mesquite sauce.
