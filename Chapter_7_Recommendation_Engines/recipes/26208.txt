Ingredients:
2 egg whites
1/8 teaspoon cider vinegar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup white sugar
3 peppermint candy canes, crushed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites, vinegar and salt to soft peaks. Gradually add sugar while continuing to whip until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Fold in 1/3 of the crushed candy canes, reserving the rest. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls, one inch apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Sprinkle remaining crushed candy canes over the top.
Bake for 90 minutes in the preheated oven, or until dry.  Cool on baking sheets.
