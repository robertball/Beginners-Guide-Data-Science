Ingredients:
1 cup glutinous rice flour (mochiko)
1 cup water
1/2 cup white sugar, or more to taste

Directions:
Mix rice flour and water together in a bowl; add sugar. Mix dough until no flour spots are present.
Place dough in top of a double boiler over simmering water; steam until dough is very hot and very sticky, about 15 minutes.
Working quickly, remove dough from double boiler with a spoon or spatula and set on work surface floured with rice flour. Knead dough with your rice floured hands, adding more flour as needed so mochi dough doesn't stick to your hands anymore.
Divide mochi into 6 to 8 pieces, about the size of a ping pong ball.

Description: 
Mochi is a Japanese dessert. The gooey, scrumptious 'dough' surrounds the filling, and is rolled into a little ball. You can color the dough with food coloring, if desired. Eat mochi as is or fill with whatever you want (e.g. peanut butter, red bean paste, etc.) Enjoy!
