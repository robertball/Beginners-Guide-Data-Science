Ingredients:
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 medium onion, minced
2 ounces dried porcini mushrooms , rehydrated in 2 cups hot water, strained, and chopped coarse; soaking liquid reserved
Table salt and ground black pepper
6 tablespoons heavy cream
3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves

Directions:
1. Heat butter in large sauté pan over medium heat. Add onion; sauté until edges begin to brown, about 7 minutes. Add porcini and salt and pepper to taste; sauté to release flavors, 1 to 2 minutes.
2. Increase heat to medium-high. Add soaking liquid; simmer briskly until liquid has reduced by half, about 10 minutes.
3. Stir in cream; simmer until sauce just starts to thicken, about 2 minutes. Stir in parsley, adjust seasonings, and serve.
