Ingredients:
Apple and Brie Filling:
3 Fuji apples - peeled, cored, and diced small
1/2 pound Brie cheese, cut into very small pieces
20 vanilla wafers, crushed
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Funnel Cake Batter:
1 egg
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
oil for frying
20 vanilla wafers, crushed, or more as needed

Directions:
Stir apples, Brie cheese, 20 crushed vanilla wafers, honey, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 15 minutes.
Beat egg until frothy in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Gradually add flour, milk, confectioners' sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt; beat until batter is thick and smooth, adding more flour as necessary to reach desired consistency.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Pour 20 crushed vanilla wafers into a shallow bowl.
Roll apple mixture into small balls. Drop balls into funnel cake batter and turn to coat completely. Roll coated balls in crushed vanilla wafers. Place the coated apple balls onto a plate while coating the rest; do not stack.
Working in batches, fry apple-brie bites in hot oil until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer cooked apple-brie bites to a paper-towel lined plate to drain and cool.

Description: 
This is a recipe I created after receiving a deep fryer for Christmas. These come out tasting just like little mini apple pies or apple empanadas. 

Beware: this recipe can get messy, so you will want to make sure you have extra paper towels waiting in the wings.
