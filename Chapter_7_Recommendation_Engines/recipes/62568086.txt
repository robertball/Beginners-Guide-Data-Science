Description: 
From Kraft Kitchens, a broccoli ring made with crescent rolls, mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes. Since I didn't have cherry tomatoes, I'm trying pimentos and bringing it to Christmas Eve party. Do you think it might resemble a wreath? Testers thought there was too much broccoli in recipe.
