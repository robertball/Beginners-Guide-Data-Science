Ingredients:
1 medium potato, peeled
2 cups water
1 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup shortening
1 tablespoon salt
6 cups warm milk
3 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 teaspoon white sugar
15 cups whole wheat flour

Directions:
Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/2 cup warm water.
Boil one medium peeled potato in 2 cups water with 1 teaspoon salt.  Mash the potato in a medium bowl, while reserving the water. Combine the mashed potato, potato water, 1/3 cup of sugar, shortening or oil, 1 tablespoon salt, and  milk in a large bowl.
Make sure the milk mixture is warm, and add the yeast.   Stir in 15 cups of whole wheat flour.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead for about 10 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, and turn to coat the surface.  Cover with a damp cloth, and allow to rise until doubled.  Rising time will be about 1 1/2 hours.   Punch down, and knead again for 3 minutes.   Place back in bowl, and allow to rise again until doubled. The second rising period should be about 1 hour.  Punch down.  Form 4 loaves, and place into 9 x 5 inch greased bread pans.  Let dough rise again for 30 - 60 minutes.
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour.

Description: 
This is the recipe that my husband's grandmother made for her family, my mother-in-law made for hers, and I have inherited the fun of making this bread for mine.  We particularly like this fresh out of the oven, and then eat it daily for breakfast.  My father-in-law at 86 years old bragged about never having eaten a slice of 'store bought bread.'
