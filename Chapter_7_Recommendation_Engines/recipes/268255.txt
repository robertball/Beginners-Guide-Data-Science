Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk
1 egg
1 cup gluten-free Italian bread crumbs
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1/4 onion, minced
1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
1 sprig fresh parsley, chopped
cooking spray
1 (28 ounce) jar tomato sauce, or as needed

Directions:
Beat milk and egg together in a large bowl. Mix bread crumbs in until a paste forms. Add ground beef, onion, garlic, and parsley, and mix with your hands until just combined.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Measure meatballs using an ice cream scoop. Roll balls with dampened hands and place on the prepared baking sheet
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 30 minutes.
While meatballs bake, heat tomato sauce in saucepan over medium heat.
Add baked meatballs to the sauce and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes.

Description: 
I have to cook gluten-free for some family members who love Italian food, but cannot tolerate the gluten. I have re-vamped my recipes so they can enjoy good food with the rest of the family. Even if you are not GF, you will still enjoy these meatballs. They are delicious!!
