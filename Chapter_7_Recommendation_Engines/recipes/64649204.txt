Ingredients:
2 - 8oz Packages of Cream Cheese, Room Temperature
1c Ranch Dressing
2c Shredded Rotisserie Chicken
1/4c Franks Hot Sauce
1 Tsp Black Pepper
16 Oz Shredded Mexican Cheese Blend

Directions:
In a 9x13 glass pan, place the 2 packages of cream cheese.  Use a rubber spatula to evenly spread the cream cheese across the bottom of the pan.  Next pour ranch dressing over the cream cheese liberally coating the cream cheese.  Then spread shredded chicken on top of the ranch dressing.
Franks can be sprinkled on top of the chicken to your tastes.  The ranch and cream cheese will take away a lot of the heat, so you will want to be liberal here.  Next add a little fresh cracked pepper.
Finally coat completely with cheese and bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes or until cheese is fully melted and starting to brown lightly in spots.
Serve warm
