Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
6 bone-in pork chops, 3/4-inch thick
1 (24 ounce) jar PregoÂ® Fresh Mushroom Italian Sauce
4 cups ziti pasta, cooked and drained

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chops and cook until they're well browned on both sides. Remove the chops from the skillet and set aside. Pour off any fat.
Stir the Italian sauce in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Return the chops to the skillet. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the chops are cooked through, stirring occasionally. Serve the chops and sauce with the ziti.
