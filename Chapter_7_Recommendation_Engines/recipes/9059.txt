Ingredients:
½ pound dry fettuccine pasta
1 cup fresh chopped broccoli
2 tablespoons butter
1  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
½ cup milk
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente, adding broccoli for the last 4 minutes of cooking. Drain.
Cut chicken breast meat into bite size pieces, trimming any fat off in the process. In a large skillet melt butter or margarine over medium heat. Add chicken and saute until well browned. Add soup, milk and cheese and stir all together. Add pasta/broccoli mixture and heat through. Serve hot.

Description: 
This is a simple recipe that is very good. Broccoli lends an added shade and taste of 'vitamin green' to a classic chicken and pasta dish.
