Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato
1 cooking spray
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup quick cooking oats
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Poke a few holes into sweet potato with a fork; place on a greased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until sweet potato can be easily pierced with a fork, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Peel sweet potato and place into a large bowl. Add black beans and mash with a whisk or fork. Add oats, onions, Dijon mustard, cumin, ginger, salt, and cinnamon and mix until well combined. Shape mixture into 6 patties with wet hands and place onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked in the center and crisp on the outside, about 8 minutes on each side.
