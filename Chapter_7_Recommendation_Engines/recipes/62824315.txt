In a small bowl mix the spicy sweet mayonnaise with the canola oil, white wine vinegar, sugar, and celery seeds.
In a large bowl add the bag of slaw mix, carrots, onion, and bell peppers and stir so that the vegetables are evenly distributed.

Description: 
This is a colorful, spicy, slightly sweet cole slaw that uses a kicked up version of mayonnaise from my Kickin' Turkey Burger with Carmelized Onions and Spicy Sweet Mayo recipe from this site.  I like to make it with broccoli slaw but it will work with either regular cabbage cole slaw or broccoli slaw.
