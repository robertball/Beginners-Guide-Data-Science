Ingredients:
For potatos:
4-5 potatos
1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup butter
2 slices american or cheddar cheese
For meatloaf:
1 lb very lean ground beef
2 slices of soft bread torn
1/3 cup milk
1 egg beaten
1/4 up chopped onion
1 T worcestershire sauce
2 T A1 sauce
1 1/4 t salt
Topping:
1 C shredded cheddar cheese or 5 slices american cheese

Directions:
Boil potatos until tender.  Preheat oven to 350.  Mix the meatloaf ingredients together and spread into a 9" pie pan.  Bake for 35-40 minutes.  Drain the meatloaf well (I even turn it out onto a cooling rack, then put it back into the pan).
Mash the potatos, add milk, cheese and butter to taste.  Pile mashed potatos on top of meatloaf and spread to the sides.  Top with shredded cheddar or strips of sliced american cheese.  Bake another 3-4 minutes until cheese melts.
