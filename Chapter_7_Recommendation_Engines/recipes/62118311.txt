Ingredients:
1/3 cup walnuts, chopped
2 Tbsp. granulated sugar
2 Tbsp confectioner's sugar
1/2 cup butter, cut up

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
In the bowl of a food processor, chop together walnuts and sugars. Add butter and blue cheese and blend just a couple of seconds, until a crumbly consistency (don't let it form a ball). Add flour and pulse about 10-20 times. Pat into an 8-inch cake pan. Score with a knife into 8 to 12 wedges.
Bake at 325 degrees F for 15 minutes.
Remove from oven, deepen score with a knife, and return to oven. Bake at 325 degrees F for another 15 minutes, or until done. Cool on a rack.
