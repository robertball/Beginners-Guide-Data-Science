Ingredients:
2 dried ancho chilies, stemmed and seeded
6 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup shrimp powder
1 cup vegetable oil for frying
1/2 white onion, coarsely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup water, or more as needed
1 1/2 chicken bouillon cubes
1 (16 ounce) jar nopales (cactus), drained and rinsed
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Soak ancho chilies in a bowl of warm water until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Whisk eggs and shrimp powder together in a bowl.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; pour egg mixture into small 2-inch circles in the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining egg mixture.
Blend ancho chilies, onion, garlic, and water in a blender until smooth. Add more water if needed to make a soup consistency. Pour chile mixture into a pot over medium heat; add chicken bouillon and egg patties. Cook and stir until bouillon is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Add nopales, reduce heat to low, and cook until soup is heated through, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.

Description: 
This is another recipe from my mother-in-law. She likes to serve this during Lent. It is shrimp patties fried and smothered in sauce and nopales. You may serve this with rice and tortillas (also some like to top it with cilantro), or I just eat it like a soup!
