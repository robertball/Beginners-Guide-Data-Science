Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups uncooked long grain rice
Boiling water
2 teaspoons salt
8 slices bacon
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon dry sherry (optional)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 to 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 1/2 cups diced cooked chicken, pork, or ham
1 large green pepper, diced
1/2 cup green onion, sliced diagonally
1/2 cup green peas
2 eggs, lightly beaten

Directions:
Prepare rice according to package directions using boiling water and salt.  Using a colander, drain rice and rinse well using cold water.  Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.
Cook bacon in a large skillet until crisp.  Remove bacon and drain on paper towels; crumble and set aside.  Drain bacon drippings, reserving 1/3 cup.
Combine soy sauce and sherry; set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon bacon drippings in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and red pepper; stir-fry 1 minute.  Add chicken or pork.  Stir-fry 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from wok and set aside.  Heat 1 tablespoon bacon drippings in skillet.  Add green pepper and stir-fry 2 to 3 minutes or until crisp-tender.  Remove from wok and set aside.
Heat remaining bacon drippings in wok. Add rice, green onion, and green peas.  Stir-fry 2-3 minutes.  Return chicken, vegetables, and bacon to wok.  Add soy sauce mixture, mixing well.
Make a well in the center of rice mixture; pour in eggs.  Cook stirring occasionally in center of wok until soft set.  Toss mixture thoroughly.  Serve immediately

Description: 
This is my favorite fried rice recipe.  Use of the bacon and drippings give the fried rice a wonderful flavor not found in most other fried rice recipes.
