Ingredients:
1 2/3 pounds Brussels sprouts, trimmed
1 pound carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons chopped onion
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef consomme (such as Campbell'sÂ®)
1/3 cup apple juice
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 pinches ground cloves, or to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot 3/4 full of water and bring to a rolling boil. Add Brussels sprouts and carrots, bring back to a boil, and cook vegetables until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.
Heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Add beef consomme, apple juice, cornstarch, lemon juice, brown sugar, and cloves. Cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Fold Brussels sprouts and carrots into sauce.

Description: 
I made this recipe for my mother's birthday over 20 years ago. Everyone loved the Brussels sprouts! Then I lost the recipe. Recently as I was going through my mother's recipe cards, I found the copy I made for her. I had forgotten what an attractive dish this is. It is as good as I remember and best of all, it still gets rave reviews!
