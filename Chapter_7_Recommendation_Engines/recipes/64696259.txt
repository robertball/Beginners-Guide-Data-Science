Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef
1 tbsp. Taco Seasoning
1 box no-boil lasagna noodles or cooked lasagna noodles
3 c. salsa
2 15-oz. tubs of ricotta
1/4 c. sour cream
1 large egg
3 c. shredded Mexican cheese
Sliced green onions, for garnish
Thinly sliced red jalapeño, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°. In a large skillet over medium heat, add ground beef. Season with taco seasoning and cook, crumbling up with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 8 minutes.
In a 9"-x-13" baking dish, spoon a layer of salsa over bottom to cover, then add a layer of lasagna noodles. In a medium bowl, mix ricotta, sour cream, and egg and season with salt.
Spread ricotta mixture over noodles and top with a layer of ground beef and cheese. Repeat layers until baking dish is full, making sure to end with cheese.
Cover with aluminum foil and bake until bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes.
Let cool 10 minutes, then garnish with scallions (and jalapeño and slices - optional)
