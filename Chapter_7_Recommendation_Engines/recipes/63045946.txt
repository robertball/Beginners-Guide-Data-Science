Ingredients:
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 onion, chopped
3/4 cup sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup frozen edemame (soy beans) shelled
2 cups broccoli
1 small zucchini, halved and sliced
20 grape tomatoes, halved
18 pre-cooked shrimp (or fresh, whichever you have on hand)
1 tbsp olive oil
1 clove minced garlic
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp potlatch seasoning (from William Sonoma)
2 tbsp butter
1 box linguine noodles (I use Catelli Smart pasta)
Salt & Pepper to taste
Parmesan cheese & parsley for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Bring salted pasta water to a boil in a large pot.
Season shrimp with potlatch seasoning. Set aside.
In a separate saute pan (deep sided), heat the olive oil.  Add onions. saute for 2-3 minutes on medium heat.
Add peppers & mushrooms with S&P. Continue to saute.
Once pasta water is boiling, add pasta and cook to your liking.
Add tomatoes and zucchini to saute pan with minced garlic & oregano. The tomatoes will start to break down, forming the sauce.
Add frozen edemame and shrimp.
To the pasta water, add the broccoli to blanch for 2 minutes.
Remove broccoli from pasta water and add to saute pan. Add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the pasta water with the butter to vegetables.
Remove pasta from water and add to vegetables.  Toss to coat noodles.  Finish with Parmesan cheese and parsley if desired.
