1 1/2 pounds flounder fillets
salt and ground black pepper to taste

2 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with olive oil.
Arrange flounder fillets on prepared baking sheet and season with salt and pepper.
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes and sprinkle evenly with dill. Continue baking until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 2 minutes more.
