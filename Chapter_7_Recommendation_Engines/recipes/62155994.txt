Ingredients:
6 lasagna noodles, uncooked
2 lb. ground beef
2 teaspoons garlic salt
1 (26-ounce) can spaghetti sauce (I use Hunt's Traditional)
2 cups small curd cottage cheese
1 cup Parmesan cheese
1 egg
1 (8-ounce) package shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1 (8-ounce) package shredded mozarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions.
While water is coming to a boil, brown the ground beef.  Add 2 teaspoons garlic salt to beef while browning.  Drain off fat.  Add the 26-ounce can of spagetti sauce and stir until combined.
While beef is browning, combine the cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and egg in a small mixing bowl.
In a 13x9-inch pan, layer 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the beef mixture, 1/2 of the cottage cheese mixture (spreading evenly with a fork), then 1/2 the package of cheddar, then 1/2 the package of mozarella.  Continue with the remaining 3 lasagna noodles, the rest of the beef mixture, the rest of the cottage cheese mixture, then the remaining cheddar and mozarella cheeses.  Place in 350 degree for 1 hour or until golden and bubbly.  Let lasagna cool 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This simple lasagna is a cinch to throw together.  It's also the best leftover recipe.  My husband always looks foreward to this.  Serve an easy salad while the lasagna cools down.
