NA
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  leek, thinly sliced
3 teaspoons minced garlic, divided
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, divided
¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
4 cups broccoli florets, divided
2 cups cauliflower florets
¾ pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and chopped
½ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
1 small lemon, zested and juiced
½ teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons coarsely chopped shelled pistachios

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add leek and 2 teaspoons garlic; cook, stirring, until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon thyme and crushed red pepper; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
Stir in broth, 2 cups broccoli, cauliflower, and potatoes; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until very tender, about 10 minutes.
Blend with an immersion blender until very smooth. Stir in cheese, lemon juice, salt, and remaining 2 cups broccoli. Simmer, covered, until broccoli is just tender, about 5 minutes.
Make gremolata by stirring together remaining 1 teaspoon garlic, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, lemon zest, parsley, and pistachios in a small bowl. Sprinkle over servings.
