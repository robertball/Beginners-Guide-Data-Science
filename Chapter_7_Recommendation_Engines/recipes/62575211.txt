Ingredients:
4 3/4 cups peeled and diced potatoes
1/3 cup+ 2 Tablespoons diced celery
1/3 cup + 2 Tablespoons finely chopped onion
1 cup diced cooked ham (1- 8 oz bag)
4 1/2 cups water
2 tablespoons + 2 1/4 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, add more to taste
1/4 cup+ 3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup+ 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 3/4 cups milk

Directions:
Combine the potatoes, celery, onion, ham and water in a stockpot. Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the chicken bouillon, salt and pepper.
In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all of the milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir the milk mixture into the stockpot, and cook soup until heated through. Serve immediately.
