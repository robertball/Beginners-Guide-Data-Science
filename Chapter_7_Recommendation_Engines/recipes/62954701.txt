Ingredients:
1 white cake mix
1 1-lb. can pumpkin (not pie mix which is already sweetened)
2 eggs
2 Tbs. veg. oil (I use canola)
1/4 C. flour
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. ginger
1/4 C. cocoa powder
1/2 C. chocolate chips
1/2 C. coarsely chopped walnuts
1/2 tsp. vanilla
1/2 tsp. lemon juice
1/4 tsp. salt
Seasonal color sprinkles/jimmies, if desired
Cream Cheese Frosting:
1/2 stick butter
4 oz. cream cheese
1-1/2 C. confectioners sugar
1/2 tsp. vanilla
Ganache:
Heat 3/8 C. heavy cream, 1/2 Tbs. butter, and 1/2 Tbs. granulated sugar in microwave 30 sec., stir, then heat 30 more sec.  The object is to dissolve the sugar and heat mixture enough to melt the chocolate chips.  Stir in 3/4 C. chocolate chips.  Stir well until it looks smooth.  Chill in fridge until spreading consistency, about 30 min.

Directions:
Do not follow cake mix box directions.  Mix all ingredients in a big bowl until thoroughly blended.  For large cookies, drop by 1/4 C. on cookie sheet sprayed with Pam or similar spray.  (For smaller cookies drop by heaping tablespoon.)  Keep cookies about 2" apart - they do not spread much.  Bake the larger cookies 17 min at 350, the smaller ones take about 12 min.  (Note:  I use the aluminum air-bake cookie sheets).  Let cool on sheet about 5-10 min. then remove to cooling rack.  Frost one half of cookie with the cream cheese, the other with the ganache.  Because the frostings are made with butter, I keep these in the fridge until about 30 min. before serving, and replace leftovers in fridge.

Description: 
A local twist on half-moon (black and white) cookies that combines a moist, fluffy cookie, with a frosting of yummy cream-cheese and rich, decadent ganache!  The recipe looks complicated but it isn't - basically a cake mix cookie with some add-ins.  I have also included the recipe for the cream cheese and ganache frostings in the amount that will frost the recipe output.
