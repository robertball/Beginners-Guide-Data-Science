Ingredients:
1 cup crushed tomatoes
2 cups cooked white rice
1 (15 ounce) can vegetarian refried beans
1/2 (16 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TEL®)
8 ounces sliced seitan
1/2 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella-style vegan cheese (such as Daiya®)
9 (6 inch) corn tortillas
1 (15 ounce) can green enchilada sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour crushed tomatoes into the bottom of a casserole dish. Layer 1/3 of the rice, 1/3 of the beans, 1/3 of the diced tomatoes, 1/3 of the seitan, 1/3 of the vegan cheese, 1/3 of the tortillas, and 1/3 of the enchilada sauce into the dish, in that order. Repeat with 2 more layers.
Bake in the preheated oven until vegan cheese melts and casserole is heated through, about 45 minutes.
