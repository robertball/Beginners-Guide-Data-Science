Ingredients:
1 prepared or store-bought graham cracker pie shell
2 quarts fresh strawberries, more or less
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup boiling water
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored gelatin

Directions:
In a saucepan, mix together the sugar and corn starch; make sure to blend corn starch in completely.  Add boiling water, and cook over medium heat until mixture thickens.  Remove from heat.  Add gelatin mix, and stir until smooth.  Let mixture cool to room temperature.
Quarter strawberries lengthwise and place in pie shell.  Use enough to cover pie shell entirely and mound up a bit. Pour cooled gel mixture evenly over strawberries.
Cover and refrigerate until set.  Serve with whipped cream, if desired.

Description: 
This is the prettiest strawberry pie. Choose berries that are large and of similar shape. Stand them up in a pre-baked pie crust and pour a strawberry gelatin glaze evenly over the top. Chill until set and serve with a bowl of freshly whipped cream.Modified from: Fresh Strawberry Pie I
