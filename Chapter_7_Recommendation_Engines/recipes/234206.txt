Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, divided
1 (10.5 ounce) package miniature marshmallows
2 cups crispy rice cereal (such as Rice Krispies®)
2 cups brown sugar and butter-flavored breakfast cereal (such as Cap'n Crunch®)
2 cups fruit-flavored breakfast cereal (such as Froot Loops®)

Directions:
Use about half the butter to generously grease a 13x9-inch baking dish.
Melt remaining butter in a non-stick stock pot over medium heat; add marshmallows and cook, stirring frequently, until the marshmallows are melted, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove pot from heat.
Stir crispy rice cereal, brown sugar and butter-flavored breakfast cereal, and fruit flavored breakfast cereal into the marshmallow mixture to coat; pour into the prepared baking dish and press flat.
Cool treats completely before cutting into 3-inch squares.
