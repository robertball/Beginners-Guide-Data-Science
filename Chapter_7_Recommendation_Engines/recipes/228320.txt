Ingredients:
6 vine-ripened tomatoes
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3/4 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 fresh red chile pepper, seeded and chopped
1 cup dry white wine, or more as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 (4 ounce) cod loins
8 large uncooked prawns, peeled and deveined

Directions:
Slice an 'X' in the bottom of each tomato. Bring a pot of water to a boil; boil tomatoes for 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl of iced water for 1 minute. Peel tomatoes, starting from the 'X' side; chop.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add chile pepper and tomatoes; cook and stir until tomatoes begin reduce, 5 to 8 minutes. Pour in wine; cook over medium heat until wine reduces slightly, about 5 more minutes. Stir in salt, black pepper, basil, and parsley.
Place cod loins into tomato mixture; cover and cook for 5 minutes. Turn cod and cook other side until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes. Add prawns; cover and cook until prawns are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
