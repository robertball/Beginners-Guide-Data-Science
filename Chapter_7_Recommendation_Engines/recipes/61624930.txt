Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups rolled oats
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, white sugar, eggs, and vanilla until smooth. Combine both  the flours, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt; stir into the sugar mixture. Stir in the oats and raisins. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls  onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes until light and golden. Do not overbake. Let them cool for 2 minutes before removing from cookie sheets to cool completely. Store in airtight container. Make sure you get some, because they don't last long!
