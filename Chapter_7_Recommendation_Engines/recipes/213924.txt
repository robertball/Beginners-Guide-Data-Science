Ingredients:
Filling:
1 1/3 cups grated dry coconut
1/2 cup white sugar
Coating:
1 2/3 cups grated dry coconut
1/2 teaspoon salt
Dough:
5 pandan leaves, chopped
1/2 cup water
3/4 cup glutinous rice flour
2 tablespoons coconut cream

Directions:
Cook 1 3/4 cups grated coconut and sugar for filling over medium heat in a saucepan until thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Roll into 1/2-inch balls to be used as filling.
Mix 1 2/3 cups grated coconut and salt for coating together in a bowl. Place coconut mixture in the top of a double boiler over simmering water and steam for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer coconut coating into a bowl.
Combine pandan leaves and water in a blender; blend until smooth. Squeeze juice through a cheesecloth; you should be left with 1/4 cup pandan juice. Set aside.
Knead rice flour, coconut cream, and 1/4 cup pandan juice in a bowl until a smooth dough is formed, about 5 minutes. Roll dough into 1/2-inch balls.
Flatten the balls into discs; wrap them around the coconut balls. Make sure coconut balls are completely sealed.
Drop the balls into gently boiling water and cook until they float on top. Remove with a slotted spoon. Toss balls into bowl of coconut coating. Roll each ball in the coating and place on a dish to serve.
