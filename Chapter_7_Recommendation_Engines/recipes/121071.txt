Ingredients:
3/4 cup low-fat (1%) cottage cheese
1/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup 1% milk
1/4 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
FILLING:
4 ounces reduced fat cream cheese
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg, separated
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries
1 tablespoon water
GLAZE:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Directions:
In a blender or food processor, cover and process cottage cheese until smooth.  Add sugar, milk, oil and vanilla; process until smooth.  Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to cheese mixture.  Process just until dough forms a ball (dough will be sticky).  Turn onto a floured surface; knead 4-5 times.  Place in a bowl; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth.  Add egg yolk, lemon peel and vanilla; mix well.  Turn dough onto a 17-in. x 13-in. x piece of parchment paper.  Roll into a 16-in. x 12-in. rectangle.  Transfer with paper to a baking sheet.
Spread cream cheese mixture lengthwise in a 3-1/2-in.-wide strip down center of dough; sprinkle with blueberries.  On each long side, cut 1-in.-wide strips about 3-3/4 in. into center.  Fold alternating strips at an angle across berries.  Pinch ends to seal and tuck under.  Beat egg white and water; brush over dough.
Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-22 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove to a wire rack.  Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over warm pastry.  Refrigerate leftovers.
