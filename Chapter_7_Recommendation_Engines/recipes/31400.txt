Ingredients:
1 pound mochiko (glutinous rice flour)
2 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 cups water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1/4 teaspoon red food color
1 1/2 cups potato starch

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Whisk together the rice flour, sugar and baking powder; set aside.
In a medium bowl, mix together the water, vanilla, coconut milk and red food coloring. Blend in the rice flour mixture. Pour into the prepared pan.
Cover the pan with foil and bake for 1 hour. Allow to cool completely.
Turn the pan of mochi out onto a clean surface that has been dusted with potato starch. Cut into bite size pieces using a plastic knife. The mochi does not stick as much to plastic knives.
