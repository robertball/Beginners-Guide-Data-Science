Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups King Arthur Almond Flour
2 tablespoons King Arthur Coconut Flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs (optional)
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 large eggs
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Get out a large rimmed baking sheet.
Whisk together the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl; set them aside.
In a separate bowl, beat together the eggs and oil until frothy.
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together to form a dough.
Shape the dough into a ball and transfer it to a parchment paper-lined work surface. Top with another piece of parchment paper and roll the dough about 1/4-inch thick. Remove the top piece of parchment paper and slide the crust, with its parchment, onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake the crust for 15 to 20 minutes, until the edges have started to crisp and the crust has started to brown all over.
Top the partially baked crust with your desired toppings, and return it to the oven. Bake for another 12 to 15 minutes, until any cheese has melted and the edges are golden brown.
If you like browned cheese, broil the pizza for 1 to 2 minutes after baking.
Remove the pizza from the oven, and let it cool for a few minutes; 2 to 3 should work fine. Slice it with a pizza cutter, and top with a sprinkle of grated cheese before serving, if desired.
