Ingredients:
3 peppers (orange, yellow, and/or red), cut in half, seeded
½ c. rice, cooked
1 ½ lbs. Lean ground meat
1 egg
½ t. salt
1 onion, finely chopped
1 ¾ c. medium heat salsa, divided

Directions:
Mix first six ingredients along with ½ c. of the salsa.  Grease a 9 x 9 pan, or line with foil.  Place handful in each pepper half.  To make sure pepper stays upright, place a small amount of the meat mixture in the pan and press the pepper into it.  Once all six halves have been filled and placed in the pan, pour the remaining salsa on top of each pepper.  Bake uncovered at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until the peppers are soft and the meat mixture is cooked through.  If desired, you can sprinkle with grated cheese for the last 10 or 15 minutes of cooking.

Description: 
I don't really care for stuffed green peppers, but I have found that I really like them with yellow, orange, or red peppers.  The salsa gives these an added kick
