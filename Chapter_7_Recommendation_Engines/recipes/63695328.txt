Ingredients:
1-1/2 cups basmati rice
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onions, from one small onion
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
2 cloves garlic, minced
2-1/4 cups water
1-1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/3 cup dried fruit, such as currants, raisins or finely chopped dried apricots
1/4 cup sliced or slivered almonds, toasted until golden

Directions:
Place rice in medium bowl and add enough water to cover by 2 inches. Using your hands, gently swish grains to release any excess starch. Carefully pour off water, leaving rice in bowl. Repeat four to five times, until water runs almost clear. Using a fine mesh strainer, drain water from rice. Place strainer over bowl and set aside.
Melt butter in a pot over medium-low heat. Add onions and cook, stirring regularly, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, and garlic to saut√©ed onions and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds longer. Add rice to pot, and cook, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes. Add water, salt and pepper to rice and return to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until all liquid is absorbed, 15-18 minutes. Off heat, remove lid, and sprinkle dried fruit over rice (do not mix in). Place lid loosely over pot and let stand 10 minutes. Toss in toasted almonds, fluff rice with a fork, then serve.
