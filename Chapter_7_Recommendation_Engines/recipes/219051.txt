Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 onion, sliced
4 (4 ounce) pork chops
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons reduced-calorie Italian salad dressing
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a skillet sprayed with cooking spray over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside. Arrange the pork chops in the same skillet and cook until browned on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes.
Whisk the Dijon mustard and Italian dressing together in a bowl; pour over the pork chops. Top with the prepared onion; reduce heat to medium-low and season with salt and pepper. Cover and continue to cook until the pork chops are no long pink in the center, about 15 minutes more.
