Ingredients:
1 tablespoon pork rub seasoning, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1 (3 pound) pork loin roast
2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into bite-size pieces
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons butter
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix pork rub seasoning and Chinese five-spice powder together in a small bowl. Rub all over pork roast.
Place sweet potatoes into the bottom of a slow cooker; add brown sugar and butter. Place roast on top and season with salt and pepper.
Cook on Low until roast is fork-tender, 6 to 7 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
