Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil

1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried sage

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in onion. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add carrot, celery, and garlic; cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Pour in red wine; cook until wine has almost evaporated, about 3 minutes.
Add tomatoes and season with salt, black pepper, sage, and bay leaves. Cook over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, about 20 minutes. Remove bay leaves and stir in basil.
