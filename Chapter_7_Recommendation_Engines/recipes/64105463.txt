Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, medium dice
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning
2 medium red bell peppers, chopped
4 medium garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 tablespoon peeled and finely chopped fresh ginger (from about a 1-1/2-inch piece)
3 tablespoons Thai red curry paste
1 (13- to 14-ounce) can unsweetened regular coconut milk
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 medium kabocha squash (about 2 1/2 pounds), peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes
2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lime juice
1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and 1 teaspoon of the salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion has softened, about 6 minutes. Add the peppers, garlic, and ginger, stir to combine, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add the curry paste, stir to coat the onion-pepper mixture, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add cooked onion mixture to crock pot and add the coconut milk, water, soy sauce, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Stir in the squash and cook on low for 8 hours.
Stir in the lime juice. Taste and season with salt as needed.
Sprinkle with the cilantro and serve over steamed rice.
