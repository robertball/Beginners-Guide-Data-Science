Ingredients:
2 8-oz packages cream cheese, softened
1 8-oz tub whipped topping
1 cup brown sugar
3-4 cups assorted cut up fruit (I like grapes and strawberries)

Directions:
In a large bowl, whip cream cheese, whipped topping and brown sugar until light and fluffy, and well mixed.  If you want to make a salad, just mix fruit right in. Or it can be just used as a fruit dip, serve cut up fruit on the side.

Description: 
This was originally a recipe for fruit dip, except I just cut up assorted fruit, threw it right in the dip, and viola!  An easy pot-luck style fruit salad.
