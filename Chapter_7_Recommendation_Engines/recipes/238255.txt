Ingredients:
2 cups cornmeal
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup milk
1 cup coconut milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
3 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 340 degrees F (170 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch round cake pan.
Blend cornmeal, sugar, milk, coconut milk, flour, eggs, and vegetable oil in a blender until smooth; add baking powder and blend to integrate. Pour the cornmeal mixture into the prepared cake pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
Very easy and fast to make from scratch and healthy, too. In Brazil, this cake is a favorite along a cup of coffee for breakfast. It is very similar in texture to a cornmeal bread, but only this is a sweet cake instead. Stir your favorite seeds or walnuts into the blended batter before pouring into the pan, if desired.
