Ingredients:
2 cups bread crumbs
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup milk
4 eggs, beaten
2/3 cup white sugar
2 pounds dried figs, quartered
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the bread crumbs, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Cut the butter into the crumb mixture using a pastry blender or two knives until the mixture is coarse and crumbly. Butter lumps should be no larger than peas. Mix in the milk, eggs and sugar until well blended, then stir in figs and pecans. Cover, and let stand for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Grease a large pudding mold. Give the batter another stir before transferring to the prepared pudding mold. Place the mold into another larger baking dish, place the pudding mold and dish into the oven, then fill the outer dish with at least 1 inch of water.
Steam for 4 hours in the preheated oven, or until the pudding is firm. Cool slightly before removing from the mold. Best served with a lemon hard sauce.
