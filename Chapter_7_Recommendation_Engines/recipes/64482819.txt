Ingredients:
3 Tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 shallots (finely chopped)
4 garlic cloves (finely chopped)
2 pounds fresh mussels (cleaned and de-bearded)
1 cup good dry white wine
1/2 cup heavy cream
4 Tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 bunch fresh parsley (chopped)
salt and pepper
Baguettes/french bread for sopping up the sauce.

Directions:
Soak your mussels in cold water for half an hour then drain.  Discard any with broken shells.  Give them a good scrub and then remove any beards (fibers sticking out from shell)
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the mussels, wine, cream, butter, and parsley and season well with salt. Add pepper to taste. Give it a good stir, cover the pot, and cook until mussels open and are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Divide the mussels and the juices between 2 bowls and serve with fresh baguette slices.

Description: 
These yummy mussels are steamed with garlic, shallots, parsley, white wine, butter, and cream. As they cook, their shells open and they absorb the gorgeous flavor of the sauce. A basket of rolls or breads are a wonderful side, as you’ll want to sop up this delicious sauce.  They are a one pot wonder that is both quick and easy.
