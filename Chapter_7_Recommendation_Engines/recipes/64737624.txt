Ingredients:
1 tablespoon instant yeast
1 cup very warm milk (115 F), I use whole milk.
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup butter, well softened almost melting.
1 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs, room temperature
4 cups all purpose flour

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the yeast and milk until dissolved. Beat in the sugar, butter, salt and eggs until well combined. Add the flour, one cup at a time, stirring until incorporated. The dough will be shaggy and still sticky.
Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and knead 5-6 minutes until smooth and elastic. Or if you use a mixer knead 4-5 minutes. Freeze or refrigerate at this point if desired. If not, continue by placing the kneaded dough into a greased bowl. Cover and let rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size. The length of time needed to rise will depend on how warm the room is. Ideal rising temperature is 72 F.
When dough is risen, punch dough down with a floured hand and shape and bake as desired.
Traditionally you can cook it for 25 minutes at 350 F.
