Description: 
The most popular way to consume chocolate in Mexico is in the form of hot chocolate. Unlike the American version of this drink, Mexican hot cocoa is flavored with cinnamon and beaten until frothy. You can use a wire whisk for this, but in Mexico, cooks use a wooden tool called a molinillo.
