Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 3/4 cups cooled coffee
3/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup sweet potato puree
Icing:
1 cup confectioners' sugar, or more as needed
1 tablespoon orange juice, or more as needed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, and cloves in a bowl and mix well. Add cooled coffee, oil, and sweet potato puree; mix well. Pour batter evenly into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove and allow to cool on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.
Stir together 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 1 tablespoon orange juice, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a bowl. Add more sugar or orange juice, if needed, to achieve your desired consistency. Drizzle icing over the top of the cooled cake.

Description: 
This sweet potato cake smells like autumn thanks to cinnamon and cloves, and just happens to be vegan. There aren't any hard-to-find ingredients here, just sweet potato, sugar, flour, oil, and spices. The secret to the depth of flavor might be the coffee, but the end result does not taste like a coffee-flavored cake.
