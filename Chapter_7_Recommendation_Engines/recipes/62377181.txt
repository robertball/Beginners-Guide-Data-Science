Ingredients:
1 4oz pkg cream cheese, softened
1 Tblsp (real) butter, softened (not melted!)
3 cups confectioner's sugar
1/2 Tsp peppermint oil (or extract)
** TO COLOR:  approx five (5) drops of food coloring or small amount offood coloring paste (optional)

Directions:
To mix:  In a large bowl cream together butter & cream cheese.  Stir in peppermint oil & any food coloring / paste (or leave off-white).  Slowly add (1) cup of powdered sugar at a time, stirring each cup until fully incorporated into the mix before adding next cup.
To make candy:   **  Opt 1:  Tear off a small piece of dough, roll it into a small ball, & place on waxed paper (can sprinkle waxed paper with granulated sugar to keep mints from sticking). Flatten ball with a fork dipped in confectioner's sugar. Let dry for about 2 hrs on waxed paper.  Store in a tightly sealed container in the fridge or freezer. (Thaw in fridge the day before serving).   **  Opt 2:  Tear off a small piece of dough, toss it in granulated sugar (to keep it from sticking), & then press the piece into a mold.  Once formed, drop candy out of the mold onto waxed paper (sprinkled with sugar)& allow to dry on the waxed paper for 2 hrs.  Store in a tightly sealed container in the fridge or freezer.  (Thaw in fridge the day before serving) **  Opt 3:  Roll entire ball of dough out on a sugared (powder) surface & cut shapes with cookie cutters.  Allow cut mints to dry on wax paper for 2 hrs.  Store in a tightly sealed container in the fridge or freezer.  (Thaw in fridge the day before serving).

Description: 
These mints are SUPER FANTASTIC & SUPER EASY!  The texture is so creamy, even after freezing & thawing out.  These turned out & tasted better than any other mint recipe I've used.  Remember, these can last in the freezer for several months if stored in an air tight container.  Just thaw the day before in the fridge.  ENJOY!Modified from: Cream Cheese Mints
