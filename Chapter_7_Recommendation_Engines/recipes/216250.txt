1 (24 ounce) jar PregoÂ® Veggie Smart Chunky & Savory Italian Sauce
1 (16 ounce) tube prepared polenta, cut crosswise into 12 slices
1 cup frozen whole kernel corn, thawed
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Stir the Cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl. Spread 1/2 cup sauce in the bottom of an 8-inch square shallow baking dish.  Layer 4 slices polenta, 1/2 cup corn, 1/2 cup sauce and 3/4 cup cheese mixture in the baking dish.  Repeat the layers.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until the polenta is golden brown and the cheese is melted.  Sprinkle with the parsley.
Heat the remaining sauce in a 1-quart saucepan over medium-high heat until hot and bubbling, stirring occasionally.  Serve the sauce with the polenta.
