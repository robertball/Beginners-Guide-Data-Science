Ingredients:
1 egg
3 cups chow mein noodles
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
EGG SALAD:
6 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup finely chopped celery
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1 1/2 teaspoons ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
Lettuce Leaves

Directions:
In a small bowl, beat egg. Add chow mein noodles and garlic salt; stir to coat. Drop by 1/3 cupfuls onto a greased baking sheet. Using fingers, shape each into a nest; make an indentation in the center of each. Bake at 350 degrees F for 11-13 minutes or until set. Cool for 2 minutes; remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
In a bowl, combine the first eight egg salad ingredients; mix well. Just before serving, spoon 1/4 cupful into each nest. Serve on a lettuce-lined plate if desired.
