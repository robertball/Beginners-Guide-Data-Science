Ingredients:
butter-flavored cooking spray
6 tablespoons sour cream
1 (1 ounce) package vegetable dip mix, or to taste
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
1 pinch Creole seasoning, or to taste
4 (4 ounce) salmon fillets
1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
Mix sour cream, vegetable dip mix, garlic salt, and Creole seasoning together in a bowl.
Arrange salmon fillets, skin-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Spread sour cream mixture over each fillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish almost flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 8 minutes; sprinkle macadamia nuts over fillets. Turn on oven's broiler.
Broil until nuts are browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, 2 to 3 minutes more.

Description: 
In my attempt to find a healthy, yet delicious baked salmon recipe that doesn't include all of the butter and mayonnaise that my favorite recipe contains, and that also doesn't consist of the vinegar-sugar combo that many of the recipes listed contain, I came up with this savory, creamy,and nutty recipe that I fell in love with. I hope that you love it as much as I do!
