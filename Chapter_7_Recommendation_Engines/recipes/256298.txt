Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
¼ teaspoon adobo seasoning
¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
Ground black pepper, to taste
2 ¼ teaspoons chili powder, divided
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup uncooked long grain white rice
1 (14.5 ounce) can Hunt's® Diced Tomatoes, drained
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14 ounce) can low-sodium chicken broth
1  avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced
½  fresh tomato, sliced
4 slices Pepper Jack cheese
Fresh cilantro leaves for garnish (optional)
1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix together adobo seasoning, paprika, black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon of the chili powder. Season 1 side chicken breasts with the mixture.
Place olive oil in a large saucepan over medium; heat until the oil shimmers. Place chicken pieces in hot oil, seasoned side down. Brown on each side, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Add chopped onion to pot and cook over medium heat until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add rice, Hunt's® Diced Tomatoes (drained), corn, garlic, and remaining 2 teaspoons of chili powder, stirring to combine.
When ingredients are well combined, add chicken broth, and stir.
Place browned chicken pieces on top of the rice mixture, with browned side up, being careful not to submerge chicken.
Cover and bake 15 minutes, then remove lid and continue baking about 5 minutes more.
When chicken internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), place a slice of tomato and slices of avocado on top of each piece, and place a slice of pepper jack cheese on top.
Return to oven and bake until cheese is melted, 3-4 minutes.
Plate cooked chicken, then fluff rice with a fork, and serve alongside chicken.  Garnish with fresh cilantro and snipped chives, if desired.
