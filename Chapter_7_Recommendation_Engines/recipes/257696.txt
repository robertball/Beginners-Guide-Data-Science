Ingredients:
1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/3 cup seasoned rice wine vinegar
1/4 cup lime juice
2 tablespoons chile paste with garlic
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon dried mint
8 ounces rice noodles
1 pound lean ground pork
1 cup thinly sliced green onions
1 cup chopped cilantro
1 cup thinly sliced snow peas
1 large red onion, quartered and thinly sliced
1/4 cup roasted peanuts

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, lime juice, chile paste with garlic, sesame oil, ginger root, and mint in a jar with a tight-fitting lid; cover and shake until sauce is well blended.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add noodles and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, cool, and place in a serving bowl. Cut noodles using kitchen shears.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain, discard grease, and cool on paper towels. Add pork to noodles.
Mix green onions, cilantro, snow peas, and red onion with pork and noodles.
Place peanuts in a heavy resealable bag; seal and lightly crush using the bottom of a jar or large glass. Add peanuts to noodle mixture. Add sauce and toss well.
