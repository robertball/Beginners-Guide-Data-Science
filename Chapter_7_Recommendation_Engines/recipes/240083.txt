Ingredients:
1 cup pumpkin puree
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup canola oil
1/4 cup applesauce
1 3/4 cups gluten-free multi-purpose flour (such as Mixoflour)
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Mix pumpkin puree, sugar, eggs, oil, and applesauce together in a large bowl. Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger together in a separate bowl; add to pumpkin mixture and stir until just blended into a batter. Gently fold raisins through the batter; pour into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
