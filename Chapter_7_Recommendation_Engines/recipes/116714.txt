Ingredients:
3 large russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
3 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and quartered
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons butter, divided
2 tablespoons orange juice
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Place the russet potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 20-25 minutes or until tender. Place sweet potatoes in another saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 20-25 minutes until tender.
Drain russet potatoes and place in a large mixing bowl; mash until smooth. Add cream cheese, 2 tablespoons milk and 1 tablespoon butter; beat until light and fluffy, adding more milk as needed. Drain sweet potatoes and place in another bowl; mash until smooth. Add the orange juice, honey and remaining butter.
Insert tip #409 into a pastry bag. Spoon russet potato mixture into one side of the bag; spoon sweet potato mixture into the other side.
Pipe 3-in. swirls, forming large rosettes, onto a greased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until heated through and tops are lightly browned.
