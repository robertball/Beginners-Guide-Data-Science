Heat 2 tsp of vegetable oil in a saucepan over Medium heat.
Add ginger, chilli(es) and garlic to the pan and quickly, cook for 30 seconds, and then add the soy sauce and water before the garlic scorches.
Dissolve the brown sugar in the sauce, then simmer the sauce for 2-3 minutes or until the sauce thickens.
Remove it from the heat.

The Dish:
____________________________________________
Slice the steak against the grain into 1/8" -to- 1/4" thick
Tilt the blade of your knife at about a forty five degree angle to the top of the steak so that you get wider cuts...and you cut across the grain of the meat.
Lightly redge meat in cornstarch
Let the beef sit for about 10 minutes so that the cornstarch sticks.
As the beef sits, heat up one cup of oil in a wok (you may also use a skillet for this step as long as the beef will be mostly covered with oil).
Heat the oil over medium heat until it's nice and hot, but not smoking.
Increase eat to Med-high, add the beef to the oil and saut√© for just two minutes, or until the beef just begins to darken on the edges.
You don't need a thorough cooking here since the beef is going to go back on the heat later.
Stir the meat around a little so that it cooks evenly.
After a couple minutes, use a large slotted spoon to take the meat out and onto paper towels, then pour the oil out of the wok or skillet.
Put the pan back over the heat, dump the meat back into it.
Add the sauce, cook for one minute while stirring, then add all the green onions.
Cook for one more minute, then remove the beef and onions with tongs or a slotted spoon to a serving plate.
Leave the excess sauce behind in the pan.
Garnish with broccoli
