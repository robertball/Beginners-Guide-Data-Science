Ingredients:
6 slices bacon or pancetta, chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups chopped hot and sweet peppers
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
1 1/2 cups cubed cooked potatoes
12 eggs, beaten
2 ounces crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Place bacon and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook until bacon is nearly crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Add peppers; cook and stir over medium heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and drain excess grease from the pan. Season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes; stir to combine.
Return pan to medium heat, add potatoes and stir until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Pour in eggs and slowly stir to form large, soft curds, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle feta cheese over the top and stir gently to incorporate.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Place pan under the preheated broiler and cook until the top is set and feta cheese is browned, about 5 minutes.
