Ingredients:
1 box rigatoni pasta
1 pound bulk "hot" sausage (can use italian sausage with casing removed)
1 large onion
1 28 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes with juice
3 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 large can of French's Fried Onion Rings

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
1.  Boil rigatoni according to directions.  Set aside.
2.  While pasta cooking fry up sausage with onion until brown.  Drain off fat.
3.  Pour pasta into deep casserole dish and stir in browned sausage.
4.  Add can of tomatoes with liquid and hand crush the tomatoes.  Stir into pasta and sausage.
5.  Take only 2 cups of cheese and mix into pasta.
6.  Add half of onion rings into mixture and stir.
7.  Bake for 30 minutes uncovered.
8.  Add rest of onion rings* and cheese on top until melted.  Serve hot and bubbly.
*Don't bake onion rings and cheese on top of the casserole for the 30 minutes.  The onions will get too brown (near black) and the cheese will get hard.
