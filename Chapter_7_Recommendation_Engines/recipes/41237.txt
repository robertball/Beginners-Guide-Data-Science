Ingredients:
1 eggplant, halved lengthwise
1/2 cup olive oil, divided
salt and pepper to taste
8 medium shrimp - peeled, deveined and chopped
1/8 cup chopped fresh basil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 cup white wine
1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Scoop out the flesh of the eggplant, chop, and reserve. Coat shells with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper; set aside.
Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium high heat. Saute shrimp, basil and garlic until shrimp turns pink, about 1 minute. Stir in the reserved chopped eggplant. Season with salt and pepper. Pour in wine, and cook 5 minutes.
Transfer to a large bowl, and mix in the bread crumbs and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. If mixture is dry, stir in more olive oil. Stuff mixture into eggplant shells, and sprinkle top with remaining Parmesan cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until eggplant is tender.
