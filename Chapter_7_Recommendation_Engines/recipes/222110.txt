Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup unsalted butter
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
1/4 cup molasses
3 tablespoons natural (raw) sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together all-purpose flour and whole-wheat flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt.
Beat butter and 3/4 cup sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in egg, then stir in water and molasses. Gradually stir in flour mixture until just incorporated. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets; flatten slightly.
Bake in preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
