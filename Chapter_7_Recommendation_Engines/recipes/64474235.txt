Ingredients:
For the Pork
1 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 tablespoon prepared mustard
1 tablespoon caraway seeds, crushed
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tablespoon salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
1.2 kg (2.5 lbs) pork shoulder / leg  roast
1 large onion, roughly diced
1/2 cup water  (add more if liquids dry out too much)
1/2 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in 2 tbsp water
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
For the Pork
Form paste with vegetable oil, mustard, caraway seeds, garlic powder, s/p.
Rub on pork roast and set aside for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 180C/350F
Place onions in roasting pan. Add water.
Place roast, fat side down, on top of onions.
Cover pan with foil.
Roast 1 hour in the preheated oven. Remove foil, turn roast, score the fat. Continue roasting, fat side up 2 hours uncovered (add more water if pan is drying out). Remove from heat, reserve pan juices. Let sit about 10 mins before cutting into thin slices.
In a saucepan, bring pan juices to boil. Gradually add 1/2 cup water or more to make a sauce. Mix butter and cornstarch solution to thicken slightly, reduce heat, simmer 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary (or add more water if it's too salty). Serve with sliced pork, dumplings and sauerkraut. Please find the recipes after the jump.
