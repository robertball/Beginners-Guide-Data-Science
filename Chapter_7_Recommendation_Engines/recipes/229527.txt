Ingredients:
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup vegetable juice (such as V-8®)
1/4 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)
1/2 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 sweet onion, diced
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1 (16 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 pound ground turkey
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup chili sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat egg, vegetable juice, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, sage, parsley, oregano, salt, black pepper, and hot pepper sauce in a large bowl. Stir in oats and allow to soak.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, bell pepper, and celery until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture, mushrooms, and turkey into oat mixture; shape into a loaf and transfer to a broiling pan. Mix tomato sauce and chili sauce in a bowl; pour over turkey loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
