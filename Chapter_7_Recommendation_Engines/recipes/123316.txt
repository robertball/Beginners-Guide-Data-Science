Description: 
'I love making corn bread and corn muffins, but often the results are not moist or sweet enough for my taste,' comments Patty Bourne of Owings, Maryland. 'So I experimented until I came up with these light, pleasantly sweet muffins. They ended up winning a blue ribbon at our county fair.'
