Ingredients:
1 precooked 9-inch focaccia flatbread
1 Fuyu persimmon, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
4 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves stripped
1/2 cup burrata cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Lay persimmon slices onto the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons olive oil and sprinkle salt on top. Sprinkle 1/2 the rosemary leaves over the persimmon slices.
Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn persimmon slices over and roast 10 minutes more.
Remove baking sheet from the oven and increase temperature to 200 degrees C. Place focaccia on a baking sheet.
Bake focaccia in the hot oven until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven and top focaccia with roasted persimmon slices. Tear burrata cheese using your hands and lay evenly on the focaccia, avoiding the persimmon slices. Reserve about 1 tablespoon rosemary leaves and sprinkle the rest on top.
Return focaccia to the hot oven and bake until warmed and burrata cheese has melted slightly, about 5 minutes. Top with reserved fresh rosemary leaves and drizzle remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil on top. Slice and serve hot.
