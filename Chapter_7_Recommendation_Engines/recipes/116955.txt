1/2 teaspoon salt

Transfer roast to a shallow roasting pan. bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-3/4 hours. Meanwhile, place potatoes and salt in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to boil.

For gravy, pour drippings and loosened browned bits into a measuring cup. Skim fat, reserving 2 tablespoons drippings. Add water and broth to reserved drippings; set aside. In a large saucepan, saute onions and mushrooms in butter and oil until tender.
