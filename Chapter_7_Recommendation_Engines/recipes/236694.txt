Ingredients:
2 cups sifted flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs, at room temperature
2 cups buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray or brush with oil.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat eggs in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Stir flour mixture into eggs, one third at a time, alternating with buttermilk, until just combined; stir in butter.
Pour batter into preheated waffle iron; cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe has been in the family for generations. Now I want to share what is the best memory of my childhood, when I visited my grandparents in Kelvington, Saskatchewan: waking up to freshly made waffles with Canadian maple syrup and crisp bacon.
