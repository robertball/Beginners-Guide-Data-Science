Ingredients:
6 cups fresh cauliflower florets
2 tablespoons sour cream, or more to taste
1 tablespoon butter
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons real bacon bits
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Add cauliflower and boil until fork-tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain.
Add sour cream, butter, salt, and pepper to the cauliflower. Mash to desired texture, adding more sour cream for a creamier consistency.
Transfer cauliflower mixture to an 8-inch baking dish. Top with Cheddar cheese and bacon bits.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with chives and serve.
