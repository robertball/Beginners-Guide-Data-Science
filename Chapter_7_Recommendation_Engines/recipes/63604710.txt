Ingredients:
1 lb minced beef (hamburger meat)
1 lb pork sausage
6 ounces fresh breadcrumbs
4 fluid ounces water
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 teaspoon black pepper (more if you prefer it spicier)
1 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg or 1 1/2 teaspoons ground mace

Directions:
Put everything in big bowl together and give it a really good mix by hand. Then ideally put the mix into a loaf tin or rectangular pan about 10" x 4" x 3".
Put the sausage meat block in the freezer for a little while until it's just starting to set. Remove it from the tin and cut the sausage block into the thickness you prefer.
Put the slices, separated by cling film, into freezer bags and put them back in the freezer.
To Serve.
When required, defrost and grill or fry in a little fat or oil until brown and crispy on the outside, and cooked through.
