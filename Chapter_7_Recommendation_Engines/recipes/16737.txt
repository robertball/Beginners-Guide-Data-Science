Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups water
2/3 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
6 slices bacon
1 (6 ounce) can tiny shrimp, drained
1/2 cup cubed ham
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup sliced celery
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped fresh tomato
3/4 cup Italian-style salad dressing
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Stir in the rice. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes.
While the rice is cooking, place bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until evenly brown. Drain, cool, and crumble.
In a large bowl, mix the cooked rice, crumbled bacon, shrimp, ham, bell pepper, celery, onion, and tomatoes.
Prepare the dressing by whisking together the salad dressing, thyme, chili powder, garlic, and salt. Pour over rice mixture, and toss to coat. Cover, and chill in the refrigerator until serving.
