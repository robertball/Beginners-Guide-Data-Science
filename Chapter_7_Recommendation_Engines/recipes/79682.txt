Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup superfine sugar
3/4 cup light brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, beat together the butter, brown sugar, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla until smooth and creamy; then add eggs, and beat well. In a large bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pudding mix. Gradually mix the dry into the creamy mixture until well blended. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts, if using. Drop by teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in a preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from oven; allow cookies to cool momentarily on baking sheets before removing them to wire racks to cool completely.
