Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 (8 ounce) package sliced white mushrooms
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
8 fluid ounces red wine
1 cup beef stock
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef, mushrooms, and onion. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Transfer mixture to a bowl. Add garlic and oil to the skillet; saute until garlic is golden brown, about 1 minute.
Turn skillet heat to high; add red wine and beef stock. Bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors meld, about 5 minutes.
Whisk sour cream and cornstarch together in a bowl. Mix into the wine/broth mixture. Stir in the browned beef mixture. Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Add salt and pepper.

Description: 
I created this hamburger stroganoff as an amalgamation of about a half-dozen stroganoff recipes. Really hits the spot on a cold day, served over egg noodles with peas and carrots.
