Ingredients:
3 eggs
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 cups half and half cream (10% MF)
1 teaspoon vanilla
4 teaspoons brown sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk together eggs and sugar in a small bowl; set aside.
Heat cream in a saucepan over medium-low heat until bubbles form around edge (will look like foam). Remove from heat; gradually whisk about 1/2 cup half and half into egg mixture. Whisk egg and half and half mixture into remaining cream in saucepan. Return saucepan to stovetop. Stir constantly, over medium-low heat, until mixture thickens slightly, about 7 to 9 minutes. (Don't overcook or custard may become curdled-looking.) Remove from heat; stir in vanilla.
Pour or ladle custard into four 7 or 8-oz (220 or ) ramekins or custard cups, or six 4-oz ramekins or custard cups. Let cool, then cover and store in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight. Custard will thicken a little more as it cools.
Just before serving, sprinkle 1 tsp brown sugar over top of each custard. Use a mini butane torch to melt and caramelize the sugar. Or place the custards briefly under the broiler, watching closely, until tops are lightly browned.
