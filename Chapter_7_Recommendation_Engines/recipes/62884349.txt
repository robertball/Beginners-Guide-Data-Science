Ingredients:
1 1/2 lb. boneless pork butt or shoulder (with marbling)
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
2T vegetable oil
1 Bay leaf
1/2 tsp. salt, to taste
1/2 tsp. black pepper, to taste
1(6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 jar of pimentos, sliced
1 pkg. frozen seet peas
1/2 tsp. white sugar, to taste
1 cup chicken stock
2T Patis* fish sauce, optional*

Directions:
Cut Pork into bite size pieces. Add 2T veg. oil to a skillet over medium high heat. Add pork and stir, about 3-4 minutes. Next, add the onions and garlic. Stir together until the pork is brown and onions are translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes. You can drain some or all of the pork fat, if desired.
When the pork is brown, add the chicken stock, tomato paste, bay leaves, salt and black pepper. Stir until incorporated. Bring the pot to a boil, cover with a lid, then lower the heat to a simmer. Simmer for about 45 to 55 minutes, until pork is soft and tender. Stir often. The tomato sauce will eventually thicken up (you can add more chicken stock, if desired)
Add the frozen peas, stir to incorporate. Add the sugar, to taste, and one jar of the pimentos last. Simmer for 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper, if needed. Remove bay leaf right before serving. This is best eaten over white rice.
