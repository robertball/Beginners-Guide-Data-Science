Description: 
This dressing is OUTSTANDING! I recommend Bel Gioioso Crumbly Gorgonzola for the dressing and for topping your salad. The quality of the cheese is what will have the greatest impact on whether you love the dressing or not. This cheese has won many awards including:
2010 - World Championship Cheese Contest
(3rd Place).
2009 - World Cheese Awards (3rd Place) Bronze Award.
2008 - World Cheese Awards (1st Place) Gold Award.
You can usually find this cheese at most higher end grocers (Harmons, ect.) I know for a fact you can always find it at Costco! For a great price as well!
Enjoy!
