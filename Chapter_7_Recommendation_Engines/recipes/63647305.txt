Ingredients:
¦2 cups granulated sugar
¦1 1/2 cups vegetable oil (I used all unsweetened applesauce here instead of veggie oil. It turned out wonderfully and did not taste like apples)
¦4 eggs
¦2 cups all-purpose flour
¦2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
¦2 teaspoons baking powder
¦2 teaspoons baking soda
¦1 teaspoon salt
¦2 cups shredded carrots
¦1/4 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 350.
Using a hand mixer, stir sugar, applesauce and eggs together, until creamed. In a separate bowl, sift and combine the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the sugar/applesauce/egg mixture and stir until combined. Add carrots and walnuts to the cake batter, and stir them in by hand.
Pour batter into two greased 10? round cake tins, dispensing them evenly between the two containers. Pop into the oven and bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
