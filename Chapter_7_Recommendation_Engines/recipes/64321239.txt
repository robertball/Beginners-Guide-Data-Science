Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
12 chicken thighs with skin and bone still on
1 3/4 pounds chorizo (whole if baby ones or cut into 4cm / 1½ inch chunks if regular sized)
2 1/4 pounds new potatoes (halved)
2 red onions (peeled and roughly chopped)
2 teaspoons dried oregano
grated zest of 1 orange

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Put the oil in the bottom of 2 shallow roasting tins, 1 tablespoon in each. Rub the skin of the chicken in the oil, then turn skin-side up, 6 pieces in each tin.
Divide the chorizo sausages and the new potatoes between the 2 tins. Sprinkle the onion and the oregano over, then grate the orange zest over the contents of the 2 tins.
Cook for 1 hour, but after 30 minutes, swap the top tray with the bottom tray in the oven and baste the contents with the orange-coloured juices.
