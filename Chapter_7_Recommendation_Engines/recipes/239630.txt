1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1 small green bell pepper, chopped
1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)

1/4 cup chili powder
1 cup corn chips (such as Fritos®), or to taste

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix onion and green bell pepper into ground beef.
Mix tomato sauce, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, ranch-style beans, stewed tomatoes, and chili powder into beef mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until flavors have blended, 30 to 45 minutes.
