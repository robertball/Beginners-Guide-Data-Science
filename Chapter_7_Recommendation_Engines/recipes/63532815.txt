Ingredients:
2 whole spaghetti squash, cut in half and seeds removed
olive oil
salt & pepper
1-1/2lbs of your favorite meatballs (I made a batch of these), cooked
4c of your favorite spaghetti sauce (homemade or store-bought)
1c mozzarella cheese, shredded
fresh basil, chiffonade, for serving

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375. Place the 4 squash halves on a baking sheet. Drizzle the interior of the squash with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. Turn cut side down and bake 30-40 minutes, or until squash is tender and strings like spaghetti when scraped with a fork. Remove from the oven.
Turn oven up to 400.
Turn the squash upright and scrape the squash with a fork and fluff the "spaghetti" strands. Place 1 serving of meatballs and 1c sauce over top of the squash. Sprinkle with 1/4c mozzarella cheese. Return the pan to the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly and everything is heated through, about 10 minutes. Top with fresh basil and serve.
