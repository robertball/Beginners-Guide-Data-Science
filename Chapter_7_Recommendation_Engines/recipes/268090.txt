Ingredients:
1 pastry for a 9-inch pie crust
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 tablespoons dark cocoa powder
1 1/2 tablespoons cornmeal

1/2 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup whiskey
1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
3/4 cup toasted almonds

Directions:
Place pastry crust in a pie plate. Refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine white sugar, brown sugar, flour, cocoa powder, cornmeal, and salt in a small bowl.
Whisk eggs, buttermilk, butter, whiskey, and vanilla paste together in a large bowl. Add sugar mixture and blend until smooth. Stir in almonds by hand until incorporated. Pour mixture into the chilled pastry crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden and center is set, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer pie to a wire rack and cool to room temperature before serving.

Description: 
This chocolate buttermilk pie with whiskey and almonds is reminiscent of an old-fashioned chess pie. The whiskey and dark cocoa give it an added kick and the crunch from the almonds adds texture.
