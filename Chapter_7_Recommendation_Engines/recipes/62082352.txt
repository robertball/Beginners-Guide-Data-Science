Ingredients:
4 large cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons dry white cooking wine
1/4 cup chopped parsley
2 teaspoons hot pepper flakes
2 tablespoons red marinara sauce (optional)
2 tablespoons parmigana cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute the garlic in olive oil until garlic turns golden (be careful not to burn garlic).
Stir in the cans of chopped clams, salt, pepper, wine, parsley and hot pepper flakes.
Simmer the mixture for 7-8 minutes, until the sauce has reduced 1/3 and has thickened to your liking.
If you want to make your sauce red, add a few tablespoons of Marinara Sauce(or any store bought red sauce).
Before serving, toss with the parmigana cheese.
Spoon the clam sauce over your favorite pasta, and serve with a green salad and some garlic bread.

Description: 
My first memory of cooking with my Mom was making this clam sauce. It is very easy to make, hearty, satisfying, and the red pepper flakes give it a slight kick.
