Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, diced
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
1 (2 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1/2 cup coconut milk
1 tablespoon white sugar
salt and black pepper to taste
1 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, ginger, and jalapeno pepper; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 7 minutes. Add the butternut squash and chicken broth, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the squash is tender, about 30 minutes.
Stir in the evaporated milk, coconut milk, sugar, salt and pepper. Cook and stir 5 minutes more. Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth, and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. Ladle into bowls, and garnish with sour cream and thyme to serve.

Description: 
A great soup to warm you up in a hurry. Great any time of year. You can play with the volumes of jalapeno and ginger and sour cream, to whatever you like. You can vary the amount of sour cream you add depending on how 'hot' you want the soup to taste.
