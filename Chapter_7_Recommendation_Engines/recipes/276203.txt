Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 pound ground pork sausage
1 sleeve crushed buttery round crackers (such as RitzÂ®)
2/3 cup ketchup
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 eggs
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
12 slices thick-cut bacon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) .
Combine ground beef, ground sausage, crushed crackers, ketchup, onion, eggs, onion powder, and garlic powder in a large bowl until mixed thoroughly, using your hands for best results. Form mixture into a loaf shape.
Weave strips of bacon into a basket weave pattern. Place meatloaf in the center and carefully lift and transfer to a loaf pan, so bacon is on the bottom and sides of the pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Allow to sit for 5 minutes before carefully flipping onto a platter.
