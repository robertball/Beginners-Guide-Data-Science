Ingredients:
1/2 cup hot sauce
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 dash grill seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup milk
1 cup panko bread crumbs, or as needed
2 green tomatoes, sliced
1 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Put hot sauce in small dish for dipping. Mix flour, brown sugar, grill seasoning, salt, and pepper in a separate small dish. Beat eggs into milk in a third dish. Pour panko in a fourth shallow dish. Arrange dishes in a line, respectively.
Dip one side of each tomato slice in hot sauce. Press each side of tomato into flour mixture to coat; dip into milk mixture. Gently press tomato slices into panko to coat. Arrange coated tomatoes on a baking sheet. Refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or a cast-iron skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Fry tomato slices in hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
I've blended many reviewer suggestions for fried green tomatoes with an ingredient my elderly ex mother-in-law suggested. The result is a sweet, hot combination that delights fried green tomato lovers. Serve with ranch or blue cheese dressing as dip.
