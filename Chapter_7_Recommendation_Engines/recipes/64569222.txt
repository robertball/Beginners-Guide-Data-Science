Ingredients:
1 cup whole medium roast coffee beans
3 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Coarse grind one cup of whole medium roast coffee beans.
Pour the fresh grounds into a container that can be covered and can hold at least 4 cups of liquid.
Add 3 1/2 cups of room temperature drinking quality water.
Stir to mix thoroughly then cover the container.
Let it brew out of direct sunlight at room temperature for about 12 to 14 hours.
Filter into another container (a 24-ounce mason jar is perfect) then cover and refrigerate for up to two weeks.  Many filtering options are possible but the best I have found is using a french press to remove the large particles then pouring through a funnel and coffee filter to eliminate the very fine coffee grounds.
When serving, be sure to shake or stir the concentrate before diluting.  To serve dilute with one part water per each part of concentrate.  For a hot cup use boiling hot water or for iced coffee use cold water at the same ratio then add a few ice cubes.
