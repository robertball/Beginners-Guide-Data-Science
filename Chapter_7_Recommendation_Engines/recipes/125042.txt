Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour, divided
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 cup milk
1 1/4 cups water
1/4 cup honey
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 tablespoon salt

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 cups whole wheat flour and yeast. In a saucepan, heat milk, water, honey, butter and salt to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F; add to flour mixture. Blend on low speed until moistened; beat on medium for 3 minutes. Gradually stir in remaining whole wheat flour and enough of the remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Shape into two loaves; place in a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 40-45 minutes. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.

Description: 
This recipe produces two beautiful, high loaves that have wonderful texture and slice very well. The tempting aroma of this bread baking can cut the chill from a cool autumn day. It's a tribute to the goodness of wheat.  -Dorothy Anderson, Ottawa, Kansas
