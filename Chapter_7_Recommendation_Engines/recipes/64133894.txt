Ingredients:
1 T butter (Reduce Fat: I Can't Believe it's Not Butter!)
1 medium onion, chopped
1-2 chicken breasts or 3-4 chicken tenders, sliced
1 t of chopped garlic
4 stalks of celery, chopped
2 large carrots, peeled and diced
6 cups of water
1 Knorr Homestyle concentrated stock - chicken
1-2 ear(s) of fresh corn kernels
salt/pepper to taste
green onion, sliced finely for garnish
ramen noodles or your choice of pasta (optional)

Directions:
In a stock pot or large soup pot melt the butter and saute the onion.
Add and brown chicken until almost cooked through. This is going to create a nice caramel colored base that is full of flavor. Stir in garlic.
Add celery and carrots, allow them the cook for 3 mins and once heated through add about half the water with the concentrated stock and bring to a boil. Continue adding water and allow to simmer for about 15 mins.
Add corn and cook for another 5 mins. Taste. If necessary add additional water or salt for flavor.
If desired, cook some ramen or pasta, drain and add serving to individual bowls.
Ladle soup and garnish with green onions.

Description: 
This is a really easy quick soup to make and my dad's favorite. I usually add ramen noodles as my toddler loves to slurp those up with the broth.
