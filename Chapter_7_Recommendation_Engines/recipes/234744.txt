Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
2/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
2/3 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups quick-cooking rolled oats
1 1/4 cups chocolate chips, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter, brown sugar, white sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg into creamed butter mixture until batter is just combined; fold in oats and 1 cup chocolate chips. Pour batter into a 9x12-inch baking pan; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 40 minutes.
