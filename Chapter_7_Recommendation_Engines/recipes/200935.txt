Ingredients:
1 pound baby red potatoes, quartered
1 cup shelled English peas
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup milk

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Boil potatoes for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain.
In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a boil. Simmer peas in boiling water for 6 to 7 minutes, or until tender (do NOT overcook). Drain.
Using the same saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.  Stir in flour to make a thick paste; gradually whisk in milk, stirring constantly until slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Now add potatoes and peas to the sauce; simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring often.  Serve immediately.

Just a recipe a local farmer suggested to me to use with his potatoes and peas. I slightly modified it and it's very tasty.
