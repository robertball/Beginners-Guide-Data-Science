Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) eggplants, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds
7 tablespoons extra virgin-olive oil, divided
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1 shallot, halved
2 (10 ounce) baskets cherry tomatoes
skewers
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2 cloves garlic, halved
1/2 teaspoon crushed red chili flakes
1 pound fresh mozzarella, cut into thin slices
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
6 sprigs fresh basil

Directions:
Place eggplant in a large bowl. Add 4 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Stir to combine and let marinade for 20 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Thread shallot and tomatoes onto skewers and brush 1 tablespoon of olive oil over them. Grill for 4 minutes. Flip and grill 4 minutes more.
Transfer grilled tomatoes and shallot to a blender. Add vinegar, garlic, crushed chili flakes, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Pulse until blended but still chunky. Set aside.
Grill eggplant slices for 5 minutes. Flip, and sprinkle the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt over them. Top each with a slice of mozzarella and grill until cheese begins to melt, about 2 minutes.
Spoon tomato mixture on a serving platter. Top with eggplant. Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the top and garnish with fresh basil.
