Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
2 small zucchini, sliced
2 small carrots, chopped
2 red bell peppers - cored, seeded, and cut into chunks
2 potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
15 cherry tomatoes
15 black olives
4 green onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
2 teaspoons dried oregano, or to taste
2 teaspoons dried thyme, or to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 sprigs rosemary
2 bay leaves
1 (4 ounce) package feta cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets with 2 tablespoons olive oil each.
Distribute zucchini, carrots, red bell peppers, potatoes, cherry tomatoes, black olives, and green onions between the 2 baking sheets. Season with garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper. Place 1 rosemary sprig and 1 bay leaf on each baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are lightly browned and easily pierced with a fork, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven, distribute feta evenly between the 2 baking sheets, and return to oven. Bake until feta is slightly melted, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
This sheet pan dinner recipe is super versatile - you can use most vegetables for it, depending on your preference. I chop them very coarsely to save time and the cook time can vary. We eat this as dinner with bread and salad but you can also serve it as a side. Leftovers also taste great cold.
