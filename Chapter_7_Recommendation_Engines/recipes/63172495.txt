Ingredients:
1/2 cup vanilla cream soda
1/4 cup root beer
2 drops imitation butter
3 tbsp French Vanilla Cool Whip

Directions:
Pour the cream soda and root beer into your mug.
Add two drops of imitation butter, then stir with a spoon.
Put the 3 tbsp Cool Whip in a microwave-safe container and heat in the microwave until almost completely melted, approximately 15-20 seconds.
Stir the Cool Whip until the rest is dissolved into the liquid.
Pour the melted Cool Whip slowly into your mug; it will float on top of the liquid.
Now, just sit back and enjoy your butterbeer!
