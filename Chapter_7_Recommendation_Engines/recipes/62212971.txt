Ingredients:
1 9" springform pan
1 (20 oz) package of Oreos
1/3 cup of melted butter
4 (8 oz) packages of Philadelphia cream cheese at room temp (full fat version)
1 cup of white sugar
3 tablespoons of all purpose flour
5 large eggs at room temp
1/3 cup of heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
1/4 cup of hot fudge

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees F.
The package of Oreos comes in 3 rows. Crush 1 row of Oreos for the crust (more or less 2 cups) in a food processor. Combine the crushed Oreos with the melted butter and press into a greased 9" springform pan. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes.
Mix the cream cheese, cream, sugar, flour and vanilla for a few minutes until smooth and creamy on medium speed.
Add the eggs in 1 at a time, being careful not to overbeat.
When your crust is ready, take it out of the oven and feel free to use 1-1 1/2 rows of the remaining Oreos for the interior of the cheesecake. I have lined the edge of the pan with them before and also alternate a layer of cookies with batter while pouring it in the the pan.
I find that it helps to have a pan (about 9x13) filled with 1/2" of water on the bottom of the rack.
Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. Then lower to 250 degrees to bake an additional 1 1/2 hours or until the center is slightly wobbley.
Shut off the oven and take the cheesecake out. Run a sharp knife along the edges to make sure nothing is stuck to the pan.
While the cheesecake is still warm, top it with the hot fudge and then crumble the remaining Oreos for the topping.
Let everything cool for a 5-6 hours (I usually pop it back in the oven) and then refrigerate for 1/2 a day before serving.

Description: 
I'm a huge fan of cheesecake and this has pretty much become my signature one! The cheesecake recipe doesn't crack (believe me, I've tested at least 4 or 5 recipes before finding one that works), is smooth, creamy and who doesnt love Oreos? I've made this a few times for friends and they just love it so I'm sharing my recipe.
