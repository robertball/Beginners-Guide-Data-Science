Ingredients:
2 grams Butter
2 tbsp Water
1/4 cup Oat Flour
1/4 cup Erythritol
2 scoops Kal Pure Stevia Extract (equivalent to 2 Tbsp Sugar)
2 tbsp Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
Pinch Himalayan  or Sea Salt
1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract (No Corn Syrup, Gluten Free)
2 tbsp olive oil
6 grams Lily's Chocolate broken into chunks

Directions:
Melt butter in a heatproof mug
Add hot water and mix
Stir dry ingredients on top and then into butter water
Stir in the olive oil and vanilla extract
Stir until smooth and evenly mixed
Stick in junks of Lily's chocolate
Microwave on high for 1 1/2 minutes, checking it after 30 seconds (microwaves vary) – it will be done when it’s springy on top but still a bit gooey – like the very best brownie
Eat warm
