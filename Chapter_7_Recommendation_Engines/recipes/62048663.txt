Ingredients:
about 12-15 baby red potatoes, washed, skins intact
4 ozs. gorgonzola cheese, crumbled
granny smith apple
1/2 cup toasted walnuts
1 small red onion, sliced into thin rings
sweet basil
champagne vinegar
salt and pepper

Directions:
half the potatoes, brush with olive oil and place into oven for about 20-30 minutes or until tender but not too soft.  Remove from oven and let cool completely.
Core the apple and cut in half.  Slice into thin slices and combine with potatoes.
Add remaining ingredients, tossing with a quality first cold-pressed olive oil and champagne vinegar. Do NOT use regular vinegar - it is too acidic.  Champagne vinegar is mild and sweet and can be found in gourmet foot shops.  Serve cold.
