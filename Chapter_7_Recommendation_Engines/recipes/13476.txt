Ingredients:
2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup brandy
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place sweet potatoes in a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Cook 15 minutes, or until tender but firm. Drain, and set aside.
In a large skillet over low heat, melt the butter. Stir in the brown sugar, brandy, and salt. Add the sweet potatoes, and stir to coat. Cook, stirring gently, until sweet potatoes are heated through and well glazed.
