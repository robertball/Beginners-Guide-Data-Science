Ingredients:
Non-stick spray
2 containers of Pillsbury Crescent Seamless Dough Sheet… OR regular Crescent dough will work.  Just pinch the seams together.
1 lb. of sliced Ham
1 lb. sliced Cheese
Toasted/or raw Sesame Seeds
Salt and Pepper to taste
1 egg mixed with a splash of water for egg wash

Directions:
Spray a 9x13 cookie sheet with non stick spray and roll out each dough sheet to fit the pan.  Place it in the pan, and gently stretch the edges to fit.
Start layering, cheese first…a.k.a. the glue…
Now place an even layer of ham down and top that with another layer of cheese.
Place the second layer of crescent dough on top of the sheet and press the edges down to seal with a fork.
Carefully slice shallow slices into the top of the dough, so the steam can escape…you can make custom designs if you prefer.
Brush the whole sheet with the egg wash.  Top with sesame seeds, salt and pepper.
Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes or until golden.
