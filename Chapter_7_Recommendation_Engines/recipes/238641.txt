Ingredients:
2 cups oil, or as needed
1 cup pancake mix (such as BisquickÂ®)
1/4 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
1 (14 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup raspberry preserves
1 cup mayonnaise

Directions:
Heat 2 inches of oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat pancake mix, milk, and egg together in a bowl; stir in corn and pepper until batter is smooth.
Working in batches, drop batter by the rounded teaspoonful into hot oil and cook fritters until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer cooked fritters to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
Melt raspberry preserves in a saucepan over low heat; remove from heat and stir mayonnaise into preserves until smooth. Serve fritters with raspberry mayonnaise.

Description: 
Ate this at a restaurant once and had to figure out how to make it on my own. Yummy! Fritters can also be made with shredded zucchini; substitute sour cream for the mayonnaise in that case.
