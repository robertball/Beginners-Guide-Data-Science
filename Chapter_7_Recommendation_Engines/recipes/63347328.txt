Ingredients:
8 medium to large red potatoes, 1" cubed
4 quarts water
6-7 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped
1 package Philadelphia Cream Cheese
1 tablespoon milk
3 tablespoons butter
1 3/4 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Rinse and cut potatoes; leaving red skins for color and added texture.  Add water, potatoes and 1 teaspoon salt to a large pot.  Boil potatoes on high heat until fork-tender, about 10-15 minutes.
In the meantime, sauté garlic in 1 tablespoon butter over low-medium heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Drain all liquid from large pot.  Add sautéed garlic, cream cheese, 2 tablespoons butter, milk, 3/4 teaspoon salt and the pepper.  Use potato masher until overall texture is smooth and creamy.
