Ingredients:
2 filet mignons, (5 to 6 ounces each, about 1 1/2 inches thick)
Coarse salt and very coarsely ground pepper
2 teaspoons olive oil
Red Wine Sauce, for serving (optional
1 cup red wine
2 tablespoons cold butter, cut up
Coarse salt
Directions
1. Place 1 cup red wine in a small saucepan; boil until reduced to 1/4 cup, 8 to 10 minutes.
2. Remove from heat; add 2 tablespoons cold cut-up butter, and swirl pan until butter is melted and sauce is thickened, about 1 minute. Season with coarse salt; serve with Pepper-Crusted Filet Mignon.

Directions:
Season filets very generously on both sides with salt and pepper (especially pepper), patting in firmly.
2. Heat oil in a small skillet over medium-high. Cook filets until desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes per side (depending on thickness) for medium-rare.
3. Remove strings from filets, and serve with Red Wine Sauce, if desired.
