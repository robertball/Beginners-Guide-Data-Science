Ingredients:
1 - 12oz bag fresh cranberries (about 3 cups)
1/2 cup sugar
1/3 cup red wine
1/4 cup water
1/3 cup orange liqueur (Grand Marnier - best, Cointreau - Good, or Triple Sec - acceptable)

Directions:
Sort and rinse cranberries - ones that don't bounce are no good.
Mix sugar, wine, and water in medium saucepan over medium heat.
Add cranberries.
Heat while stirring occasionally until boiling and cranberry skins split (5-10 minutes).
Remove from heat and cool 15 min.
Stir in orange liqueur.
Refrigerate at least 8 hours
