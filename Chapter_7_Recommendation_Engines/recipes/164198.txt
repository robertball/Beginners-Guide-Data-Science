Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound ground turkey

2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 dash cayenne pepper
1 (19 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup salsa
2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce
2 small carrots, julienned
2 red bell peppers, cut into thin strips

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the turkey, and stir until crumbly and no longer pink. Season with chili powder, cumin, oregano, cayenne pepper, kidney beans, and salsa. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture is simmering and the beans are hot, about 5 minutes.
Divide the lettuce, carrots, and red bell peppers among 4 serving plates. Spoon the turkey mixture overtop to serve.
