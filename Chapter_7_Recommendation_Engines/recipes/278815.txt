Description: 
This frittata is ready in less than 20 minutes. Take a little bit of leftover breakfast sausage, a few chopped veggies, some shredded cheese, and some eggs, and create a hot breakfast! Make it a meal with some whole wheat toast and juice, or just wrap it up in a napkin and eat as you run!  If there is any left, it reheats well.
