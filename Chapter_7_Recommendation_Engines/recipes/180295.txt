Ingredients:
1/4 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup KRAFT Calorie-Wise Zesty Italian Dressing
2 cups baby carrots
4 (6 ounce) bone-in chicken breast halves, skin removed
1 onion, cut into wedges
1 (10 ounce) can 25%-less-sodium chicken broth, divided
1 1/2 cups instant white rice, uncooked
1/4 cup PHILADELPHIA Light Cream Cheese Spread
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Mix flour and pepper in shallow dish. Add chicken; turn to evenly coat both sides with flour mixture. Shake off excess flour mixture. Heat dressing in large nonstick skillet on medium heat. Add chicken, meat-side down; cook 5 to 6 minutes or until golden brown. Turn chicken over; add carrots, onions and 1 cup of the broth. Cover. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 20 minutes or until carrots are tender and chicken is cooked through (170 degrees F).
Meanwhile, cook rice as directed on package. Spoon onto serving platter. Use slotted spoon to remove chicken and vegetables from skillet; place over rice. Cover to keep warm.
Add cream cheese spread and remaining broth to skillet; increase heat to high. Cook until cheese is melted and sauce is well blended, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 3 to 5 minutes or until sauce is slightly thickened, stirring occasionally. Spoon over chicken and vegetables; sprinkle with parsley.
