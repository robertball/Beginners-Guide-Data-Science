Ingredients:
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup chopped raisins
1 (4 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, drained and chopped
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (12 ounce) package vanilla wafers, crushed

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the pecans, raisins, walnuts, cherries, condensed milk and vanilla wafers. Dough will be very thick, you will need to use your hands.
Form dough into a ring shape on top of a dinner plate. Wrap in many layers of plastic wrap and/or aluminum foil. Allow to age in the refrigerator for at least a week. The flavors will have a chance to blend and all of the milk will be absorbed into the cake.

Description: 
I don't know if this is a regional dish or what ... but NO ONE I talk to seems to have ever heard of it except the people in my family... and most people act like it's sooooo ODD ... but it's really yummy and it's really simple common ingredients ...
