In a small bowl, mix together garlic, soy sauce, worcestershire, steak seasoning, oil, ketchup, balsamic vinegar, oregano, and black pepper. Pierce meat with a fork on both sides. Place meat and marinade in a large resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight.

Lightly oil the grill grate. Place steak on the grill, and discard marinade. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes per side, depending on thickness. Do not overcook, as it is better on the rare side.

Description: 
In Char's recipe,she wrote that the secret to making less expensive cuts of meat tender is a good marinade. This one certainly did fit the bill but I tweaked it a litttle, adding worcestershire and balsamic vinegar and more garlic. My family raved!Modified from: London Broil I
