Ingredients:
Crust:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
Filling:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
Topping:
2 cups sliced fresh strawberries, or as needed
2 cups fresh blackberries, or as needed
3 kiwis, peeled and sliced, or as needed
Glaze:
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 cup water
1/2 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 tart pans.
Blend flour, butter, and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until combined. Divide mixture evenly and press into the bottoms of the prepared tart pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool completely.
While crusts are cooling, beat cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, sugar, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Spread mixture over cooled crusts. Arrange strawberries, blackberries, and kiwis on tart in desired design.
Mix sugar and cornstarch together in a small saucepan. Pour in water and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat until clear and thick, about 2 minutes. Let glaze cool completely.
Glaze the entire top of each tart gently using a pastry brush.
