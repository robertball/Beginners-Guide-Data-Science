Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes, undrained
1 tablespoon dried basil leaves
3/4 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1 Tbsp. tomato paste
1 Tbsp. potato starch or corn starch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon butter
1 lb. frozen scallops, reserved liquid

Directions:
In a saucepan, saute onion and garlic in olive oil over medium heat.  Make sure it doesn't burn.  Add tomatoes,  basil, sugar, oregano, salt and pepper. Stir in tomato paste. Bring to boil and continue to boil 5 minutes or until most of the liquid evaporates.
Meanwhile, cook scallops slowly in another saucepan, with just 1Tbsp. of butter. When cooked through, reserve liquid. Pour about 1/4 cup of the liquid into the sauce and stir well. Pass the sauce through a food mill to remove any lumps and thicken the sauce a bit.
Pour about 1/4 C of the scallop liquid into a cup and blend in 1Tbsp. potato starch or corn starch with a small wire whisk. Stir into sauce slowly and continue cooking while the sauce thickens. Remove from heat; stir in whipping cream and butter.  Reduce heat and simmer 5 more minutes.
