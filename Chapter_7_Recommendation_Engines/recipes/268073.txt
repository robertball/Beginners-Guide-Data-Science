Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 1/2 cups glutinous black rice
4 cups almond milk, divided
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Bring water and black rice to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until water is absorbed, about 30 minutes.
Measure 3 cups cooked rice into a medium saucepan. Add 3 cups almond milk, sugar, and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until creamy, about 15 minutes.
Microwave remaining 1 cup almond milk until hot but not boiling, about 45 seconds. Beat eggs into the hot milk.
Pour egg mixture into the saucepan. Add vanilla extract and cinnamon. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.

Description: 
After hearing about how healthy black rice is, I started trying to find ways to get the kids to eat it. Making a rice pudding has worked out great for us and the kids love it. It is important to use short-grain rice - we use glutinous black rice.
