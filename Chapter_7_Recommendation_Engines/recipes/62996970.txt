Ingredients:
1½ cup sugar
1 cup butter or margarine, softened
½ cup molasses
1 egg
2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp ground cinnamon
2 tsp ground ginger
½ tsp salt
1 cup whole-wheat flour
2¼ cup all-purpose flour
Gingerbread icing (recipe follows)
4 cups powdered sugar
3 Tbsp meringue powder
1/3 cup water

Directions:
1. In a mixing bowl, beat together sugar and butter with an electric mixer till light and fluffy. Add molasses, egg, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger and salt; beat till well blended.
2. Beat in whole-wheat flour and as much of the all-purpose flour as you can with the mixer. Stir in any remaining flour. If dough is too soft to roll, cover and chill for 30 minutes.
3. Divide dough in half. On a well-floured surface, roll one half of the dough at a time inch thick. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. (Joyce uses little boy, little girl and bear-shape cutters.) Place cookies on ungreased cookie sheets.
4. Bake in a 350 oven for 8 to 10 minutes or till edges are lightly browned. Cool for 1 minute on cookie sheet. Transfer to wire racks to cool.
5. Cover cookies with Gingerbread Icing.
Gingerbread Icing:
In a medium bowl, beat 4 cups sifted powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons meringue powder (available in crafts stores) and cup water with electric mixer on low speed till blended. Beat on high speed till stiff. If icing becomes too thick, thin with a small amount of water. Makes 1 ½ cups.
