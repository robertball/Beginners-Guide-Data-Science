Ingredients:
18 roma (plum) tomatoes
4 jalapeno peppers, stemmed
4 serrano chile peppers, stemmed
4 Anaheim chile peppers, stemmed
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Place tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, serrano peppers, and Anaheim peppers on grill.
Cook on the preheated grill, turning often, until tomatoes have collapsed and all peppers are blackened, 30 to 40 minutes.
Transfer tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, serrano peppers, and Anaheim peppers to a large serving bowl; blend with an immersion blender until chunky. Add onion, cilantro, lime juice, salt, chili-lime seasoning, and black pepper; stir salsa to combine.
