Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 pounds cubed beef stew meat
1 teaspoon chopped garlic
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 teaspoon cracked black pepper
2 cups water
1 cup dry red wine (such as Carlo Rossi PaisanoÂ®)
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 (.75 ounce) package dry brown gravy mix
1 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat; cook and stir onion in hot oil until browned, about 15 minutes. Add beef, garlic, ground black pepper, and cracked pepper to the hot oil; cook until stew meat is browned and garlic is golden, about 10 more minutes.
Pour water, red wine, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce into a slow cooker and stir brown gravy mix and kosher salt into wine mixture until gravy mix dissolves; add beef mixture to slow cooker and stir to combine. Cook on High until mixture nearly comes to a boil, about 1 hour; reduce heat to Low and cook until beef is tender and sauce has thickened, 1 more hour.
