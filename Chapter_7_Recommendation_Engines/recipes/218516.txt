Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon, diced
1/2 pound ground beef
1 onion, diced
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup ketchup
1/4 cup barbeque sauce
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
2 tablespoons molasses
2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (16 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (16 ounce) can butter beans, rinsed and drained
2 (16 ounce) cans pork and beans

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook the bacon, ground beef, and onion in the skillet until the bacon and ground beef are completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain any excess fat, and transfer to a casserole dish.
Stir the white sugar, brown sugar, ketchup, barbeque sauce, mustard, molasses, chili powder, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour over the bacon mixture. Add the kidney beans, butter beans, and pork and beans; mix thoroughly.
Bake in the preheated oven until the liquid thickens, about 1 hour.
