2 cloves garlic, minced

Arrange a baking rack on top of a rimmed, foil-lined sheet pan.
Remove ribs from marinade (reserve marinade); arrange on the rack, meat side up.
Place pan on middle rack of oven; pour in enough water that it reaches halfway up the sides of the pan, making sure the water does not touch the ribs.
Bake ribs for 35 minutes.
Baste ribs with reserved marinade; flip and baste again. Bake for 35 minutes more. (Add more water to pan if it dries up.)
Raise heat to 450°.
Flip ribs again; baste with remaining marinade.
Continue baking until ribs are glazed, browned, and tender, about 20 minutes more.
