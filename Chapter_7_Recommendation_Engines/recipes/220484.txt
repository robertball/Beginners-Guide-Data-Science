Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon margarine
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons chopped onion
2 tablespoons milk
2 cups cubed, cooked chicken
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
2 tablespoons bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir together the cream cheese, margarine, salt, pepper, milk, and onion together.
Fold the chicken into the cream cheese mixture.
Separate crescent rolls into 4 rectangles and smooth the perforations.
Spoon 1/2 cup of the chicken mixture into the center of each rectangle.
Fold the corners over the chicken mixture and pinch along the edges to seal into a ball shape. Arrange on a baking sheet.
Sprinkle bread crumbs over the top of the newly formed 'baseballs.'
Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 20 minutes.
