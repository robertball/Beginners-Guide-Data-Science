Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package kluski noodles
2 heads cabbage, cored and cut into bite-size pieces
1 onion, chopped
1/4 cup water
1 pound kielbasa sausage, diced
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon mustard seeds
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and cook kluski noodles until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, chop noodles into small pieces, and set aside.
Cook cabbage and onion, covered, in a large pot with water over medium heat until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat and transfer cabbage and onion into skillet with a slotted spoon. Cook in the hot oil until vegetables begin to brown, about 10 minutes; stir in kielbasa and continue to cook until sausage is heated through. Stir mustard seeds into cabbage mixture; season to taste with salt and black pepper. Stir chopped kluski into the mixture.
Pour eggs over the noodle mixture and stir until eggs are set, 3 to 5 minutes.
