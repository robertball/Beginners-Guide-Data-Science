Description: 
This is my all time favorite chicken dish. My mom used to make it for her annual New Year's Eve party, so it was a treat! She wouldn't give me the recipe until I moved out of town! The flavor seems to intensify over time, so they make even yummier leftovers! I can almost guarantee you will be asked for the recipe!
