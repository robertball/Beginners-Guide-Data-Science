Ingredients:
3 cups quick-cooking or old-fashioned oats
1 1/2 cups dried fruit bits
1 cup nuts
1 cup chocolate chips or other sweet bits
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
2 tablespoons margarine or butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Line 2 8x8 inch square pans with foil.  Then grease generously with Pam spray.
In a large bowl, put the oats, dried fruit, nuts, and sweet bits.
Mix with your hands until evenly blended.
Put the milk and margarine in a Pyrex cup and microwave until margarine melts (about 20 seconds).
Pour the milk/margarine mix over the top of the dried ingredients.
Mix with your hands until well blended.
Press the mix flat into the prepared pans.
Bake for about 20 minutes in the preheated oven, depending on how crunchy you want them. (Lightly browned just around the edges will give you moist, chewy bars.)
Cool for 5 minutes and cut into squares. They store and keep well.
