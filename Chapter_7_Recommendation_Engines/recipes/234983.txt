Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cups chopped yams
2 large onions, chopped
2 cups chopped cabbage
2 tomatoes, chopped
6 tablespoons flaked coconut
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups tomato juice
1 cup apple juice
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 pinch salt
1 large green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup peanut butter

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir yams, onions, cabbage, tomatoes, coconut, and garlic in the hot oil until the vegetables are slightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
Pour tomato juice and apple juice into the Dutch oven; season with ginger, cayenne pepper, and salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a simmer for 1 hour.
Stir bell pepper and peanut butter into the mixture. Cook, stirring regularly, until the peanut butter is melted completely into the soup, about 30 minutes more.
