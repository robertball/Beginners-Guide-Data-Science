Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 egg, beaten
1 cup chopped pecans
1 (8 ounce) package toffee baking bits
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 (18 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 egg, beaten
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Mix sweetened condensed milk, 1 egg, pecans, toffee bits, and vanilla extract in a bowl until well blended; set aside.
Cut the butter and 1 egg into the yellow cake mix in a large bowl with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press the crumbs into the prepared pan to form a bottom layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 7 minutes. Spread pecan filling over the baked bottom layer, then continue baking until the filling has set, 22 to 30 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack. Serve with whipped topping.

Description: 
This is my great uncle's favorite dessert. I made this for his birthday(2/29) until Alzheimer's took him away from us. Every time I make this, it prompts my husband and sons to share their memories of him. Can be served warm or cold with or without Cool Whip® topping. Refrigerate leftovers.
