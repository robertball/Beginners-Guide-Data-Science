Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup milk, or more as needed
1/2 cup butter
1 cup flaked coconut, or more to taste
1/4 cup chopped pecans, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring brown sugar, milk, and butter to a boil in a large saucepan, stirring occasionally. Boil until icing thickens and reaches 240 degrees F to 245 degrees F (115 degrees C to 118 degrees C) on a candy thermometer, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in coconut and pecans. If icing is too thick, thin with milk to desired consistency.

Description: 
I created this icing while searching for a German chocolate icing that did not include evaporated milk or eggs. I find this recipe has more of a caramel flavor that the traditional recipes. Yummy!
