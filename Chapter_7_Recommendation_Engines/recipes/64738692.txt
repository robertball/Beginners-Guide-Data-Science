Description: 
This coleslaw has been adapted due to my south of the border and european taste experiences.  Being latina myself and having lived in Switzerland for 16 years has brought the need to combine several levels of flavors and styles to my table!  The slightly sugary-tang of balsamic and apples in this coleslaw is surprisingly refreshing.
