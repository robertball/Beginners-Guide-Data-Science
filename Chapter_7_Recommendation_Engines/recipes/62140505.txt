Ingredients:
1 Large beetroot, peeled, and sliced paper thin
1 Large Sweet potato, peeled and sliced paper thin
1 Turnip, peeled and sliced paper thin
1 parsnip, peeled and sliced paper thin
1 golden beet, peeled and sliced paper thin
Oil for frying (I prefer peanut oil)
Sea Salt, freshly cracked black pepper, and malt Vinegar
For the Dip:
1 Cup Plain Greek Yoghurt
Juice of up to 1 Lemon
4 T. Chopped fresh parsley
1 T. chopped fresh mint
1 clove of garlic, finely minced
4 Scallions, finely chopped
Salt and White pepper, to taste

Directions:
For the Crisps:
1. Heat oil in fryer to 360 F.  Add in small batches, so as not to crowd each other, and fry until golden brown.
2. Remove from heat, and dry on paper towels.  Allow to cool.
3. Once dried and cooled, season with salt, pepper, and vinegar.
4. Continue until all the root vegetables are fried and seasoned.
For the dip:
1. Mix all of the ingredients together, adding the lemon juice (and Salt and pepper) last, until you are satisfied with the taste.

Description: 
My better half could not eat potatoes for a year (it's a long story), and used to make her own potato chips (crisps) from other sources, such as sweet potatoes and beets.  The secret to this recipe is to slice the vegetables ultra thin.  I use a mandolin or the slicing blade on my food processor.  This makes a unique appetiser for a superbowl party!
