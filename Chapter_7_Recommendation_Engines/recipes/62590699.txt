Description: 
My grandma always made Hoppin' John on New Year's Day when I was growing up in Virginia.  I now live in New Mexico and decided to put a hot, southwestern spin on the recipe this year, hence the name.  It's simple and tasty, and has some heat.  I only added two jalape単os, but you could add more if you like it hotter.  If you don't like hot food, you might want to eliminate the jalape単os completely.  I got the base recipe from Paula Deen's website, but I made several of my own changes and additions, and here's the final product.  My husband and I both loved it.
