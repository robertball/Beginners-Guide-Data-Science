Ingredients:
4 quarts mussels, cleaned and debearded
2 cloves garlic, minced
1  onion, chopped
6 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1  bay leaf
Â¼ teaspoon dried thyme
2 cups white wine
3 tablespoons butter, divided

Directions:
Scrub mussels.  Pull off beards, the tuft of fibers that attach each mussel to it's shell, cutting them at the base with a paring knife.  Discard those that do not close when you handle them and any with broken shells.  Set aside.
Combine onion, garlic, 4 tablespoons parsley, bay leaf, thyme, wine, and 2 tablespoons butter in large pot.  Bring to boil.  Lower heat, and cook 2 minutes.  Add mussels, and cover.  Cook just until shells open, 3 to 4 minutes.  Do not overcook.  Remove mussels from sauce, and place in bowls.
Strain liquid, and return to pot.  Add remaining butter and parsley.  Heat until butter melts.  Pour over mussels.

This is a simple recipe.  Most of the work is preparing the mussels; cooking takes very little time.  When you have finished eating the mussels, dip bread in the buttery wine sauce.
