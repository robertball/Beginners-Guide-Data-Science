Ingredients:
10 large red potatoes
1/2 cup cider vinegar
10 eggs, hard boiled, peeled and cut up
2 cups diced celery
1 cup chopped mild onion
1/4 cup dill pickle relish
1 1/2 cups mayonnaise - low fat if desired
1/4 cup deli mustard
2 t. celery seed
2 t. celery salt
1/2 t. pepper

Directions:
Boil potatoes in skin until they can be easily pierced with a fork.  Peel cooked potatoes, cut into bite size pieces, and place in bowl.  Sprinkle with cider vinegar, stir, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator while preparing other ingredients.  Before adding potatoes to the other ingredients, place in colander to drain excess vinegar.
In large bowl combine mayo, mustard, celery seed, celery salt, pepper and relish.
Gently stir together all ingredients and refrigerate several hours or overnight.

Description: 
If you like your potato salad on the sweet side (I don't), this recipe is NOT for you. I've made this salad for years, and am often asked to bring it to family gatherings and parties.  I haven't written down the recipe before since I learned from my mom, who was one of those little of this and that cooks.
