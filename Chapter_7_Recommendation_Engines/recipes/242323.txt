Description: 
This is a great salad for picnics or potlucks! This version of broccoli salad uses more vinegar and less mayonnaise than most recipes. This gives you a slightly different, healthier option when choosing your next side dish. It's best if you wait until right before serving to add the dressing to keep bacon crisp.
