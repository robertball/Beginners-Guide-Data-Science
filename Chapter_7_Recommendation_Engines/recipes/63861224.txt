Ingredients:
1 1/2 C maple syrup
1 C coarse sea salt
3/4 C packed brown sugar
2 Tbs  dried sage
1 Tbs  dried thyme
1 Tbs  celery salt
1/4 C frozen lovage
1 1/2 gal water  (I use ice + water to keep the turkey cold)
1 12-14 # turkey, cleaned and thawed

Directions:
18 to 24 hours before roasting the turkey,
combine 1/2 gal water with all other ingredients and warm to dissolve the sugar and salt.  Cool.
Clean turkey..  Place in clean cooler that is large enough to emerse the bird in the brine.
Cover with brine, add additional gallon of water+ice mixture.
Use weight if necessary to push turkey below surface of brine.
Let sit in brine until roasting time - up to 24 hours for a wonderful, moist bird!
