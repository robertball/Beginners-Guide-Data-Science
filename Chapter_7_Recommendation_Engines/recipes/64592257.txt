Ingredients:
1 egg
1/2 cup  italian style bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated parmesan
1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley
1 shallot, finely diced
1lb. ground turkey

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, mix together first five ingredients. Add ground turkey and mix together until well incorporated.  Form mixture into meatballs the size of your choice. i scooped mine out with a 1/8 c. measure to get a uniform size. This helps in ensuring even cooking.  Cooking methods vary. I cook mine, raw, in my tomato sauce for 45-60 mins. You can bake them on a cookie sheet lined with foil, sprayed with cooking spray, or parchment paper at 400 deg. for approx. 20 mins. or until an internal thermometer reads 160 deg, then add to sauce.

Description: 
On my path to eating healthier, i've really taken a liking to ground turkey and have replaced all of my ground meat recipes with it. These meatballs are very flavourful and will compliment any italian meal.
