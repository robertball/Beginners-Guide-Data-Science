Ingredients:
1 cup butter, at room temperature
2.5 cups powdered cane sugar
3/4 cup mascarpone cheese, at room temperature
1 tsp Madagascar vanilla paste

Directions:
1.	Put the butter and powdered sugar in a mixer with a paddle attachment. On the lowest speed, start mixing. (This is to keep the powdered sugar from blowing everywhere.) Increase the speed to medium and cream the butter and sugar until fluffy scraping down the sides occasionally, about three minutes.
2.	Add the mascarpone and mix on medium-low until creamy. Do not over mix the frosting at this point. The risk is that the butter and/or mascarpone could begin to separate.
