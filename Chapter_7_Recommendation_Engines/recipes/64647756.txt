Ingredients:
4 large flour tortillas or 8 small corn tortillas
2 cups cooked chicken, shredded (from 2 chicken breasts)
1/2 cup Mexican four-cheese blend
About 2 Tbsp sour cream, thinned out with 1 to 2 tsp milk
Sesame seeds, for garnishing
3 ancho or chipotle chilies, stems removed, de-seeded, soaked in warm water
1/2 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 8-oz can tomato sauce
1/4 cup almonds, or hazelnuts if you have any
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp oregano
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp cloves
1/4 tsp cumin
1/4 cup Hazelnut spread
1/2-oz or 1/2 bar unsweetened dark chocolate
1 cup chicken broth

Directions:
In a 350 oven, bake chicken breasts for 25 minutes, Let cool a bit and shred.
Remove stems and seeds from dried chili peppers. Soak in warm water. Set aside.
In a saucepan, saute 1/2 chopped onion and 3 cloves chopped garlic until just softened. Add 1/4 cup almonds, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp cloves, and 1/4 tsp cumin.
Drain and squeeze out water from the chili peppers. Add the chili peppers, the mixture from the sauce pan, and 1/2 of the can of tomato sauce in the food processor. Add more of the tomato sauce if needed to blend the mixture more smoothly. Add the mixture back into the saucepan with the rest of the tomato sauce. Add 1/4 cup hazelnut spread and 1/2-oz or half a bar of unsweetened dark chocolate. On medium-low heat, add about 1/2 cup chicken broth and stir until the mixture is well-blended. You might need another 1/2 cup of chicken broth. You don't want the mole to be too thick, nor to thin. Turn the heat down to the lowest setting.
In another pan, add a few drizzles of oil and lightly pan-fry the tortillas just so they become pliable. Use just enough oil so the tortillas don't stick, but not enough to make them oily. Then roll up the enchiladas with the shredded chicken and some Mexican four-cheese blend if you wish. Lightly pan-fried them again so the cheese could melt.
Lay the enchiladas on a plate and liberally pour the mole  on top. Thin out about 2 Tbsp of sour cream with 1 to 2 tsp milk. Drizzle the cream on top. Sprinkle sesame seeds over everything.

Description: 
Want something sweet? Perhaps something savory?. Instead of ordinary enchiladas, how 'bout I making Mexican mole? This might be a little sweeter than some moles you've eaten, the smooth hazelnut-chocolate taste of hazelnut spread blended in quite nicely with the almonds, chili peppers, and spices in the sauce.
