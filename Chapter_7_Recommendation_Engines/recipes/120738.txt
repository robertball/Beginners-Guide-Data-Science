Ingredients:
1/2 cup chili sauce
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 medium onion, chopped
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2/3 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 bacon strips, halved

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first eight ingredients. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into a loaf in an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with bacon.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 70-80 minutes or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Drain; let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
My family loves meat loaf- this one in particular. I created the recipe after trying and adjusting many other recipes over the years. Cheddar cheese tucked inside and a flavorful bacon topping dress it up just right for Sunday dinner!
