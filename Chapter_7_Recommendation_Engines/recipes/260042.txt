Ingredients:
1 cup textured vegetable protein (such as Bob's Red Mill® TVP)
3/4 cup boiling water
2 tablespoons boiling water
1 (16 ounce) package frozen breaded eggplant cutlets (such as Trader Joe's®)
1 loaf Italian bread
1/4 cup olive oil, or as needed
1/2 pound diced firm tomatoes
3 tablespoons capers
1/4 teaspoon dehydrated minced garlic, or to taste

Directions:
Place textured vegetable protein in a bowl; add 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons boiling water and stir. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place eggplant cutlets on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip cutlets. Bake until golden brown, 16  to 17 minutes more.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Slice bread into 16 slices approximately 1/2-inch thick. Paint bread with olive oil.
Cook on the preheated grill until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.
Place tomatoes in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in a microwave until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Drain and discard excess liquid.
Stir tomatoes, capers, and dehydrated garlic into the rehydrated textured vegetable protein.
Arrange toasted bread slices on a serving dish. Stack 1 eggplant on each slice of bread; top with a dollop of tomato mixture.
