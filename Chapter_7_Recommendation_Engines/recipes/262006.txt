Ingredients:
1/2 pound beef top sirloin steak
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 teaspoons honey
2 teaspoons dry sherry
4 cups hot cooked rice
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 carrot, thinly sliced
1 1/2 cups bean sprouts
1/2 cup peeled and matchstick-cut daikon radish
1/4 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 cup fresh spinach

Directions:
Cut steak across the grain into slices about 2 inches long and 1/4-inch wide. Stack the slices and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips.
Combine soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, and sherry in a bowl. Add beef strips. Stir. Marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes.
Heat a nonstick wok over high heat. Add the beef and marinade; cook and stir until beef is slightly browned, about 2 minutes.
Divide rice into 4 individual serving bowls. Divide beef mixture over rice. Keep warm.
Heat oil in the same wok over medium-high heat. Add carrot, bean sprouts, daikon, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Cook and stir until slightly tender, about 1 minute. Add spinach. Cook until wilted, about 1 minute. Divide vegetable mixture over the beef and rice.
