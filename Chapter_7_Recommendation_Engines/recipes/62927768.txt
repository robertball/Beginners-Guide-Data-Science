Ingredients:
1 cup cornmeal
1 teaspoon salt
1 cups boiling water
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring the liquid ingredients to a rolling boil,then stir in the cornmeal and salt.
Bring the mixture back to a boil while stirring constantly. Reduce heat to a simmer and stir in the cheese.
Let the mixture simmer for 10 minutes; stirring very frequently. Allow the polenta to simmer until it peals away from the sides of the pan while stirring.
Spread the mixture onto a cookie sheet and cool until firm (30 minutes on the counter, faster in the fridge or freezer) then cut up into serving squares. I don't need to grease the cookie sheet, it doesn't seem to stick.
