Ingredients:
1-2 Tablespoon coconut oil
1 pound ground beef or pork
1 Tablespoon appx. minced garlic
1 (12 to 16 ounce) bag shredded coleslaw mix
soy sauce to taste (1-2 T)
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
sriracha sauce to taste (I used about 2 teaspoons)
sliced green onions-1 or 2

Directions:
In a large skillet on medium heat, add coconut oil. Add ground meat and brown with garlic, breaking with the back of a wooden spoon. Add coleslaw mix and continue to cook, stirring occasionally.
Add soy sauce to taste, black pepper to taste and a little srirach sauce to taste. Top with green onions at the end right before serving. Serves 4, but we split it between the 2 of us at appx. 8 net gm carbs each. If feeding 4, only 4 net carbs per serving.
