Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup packed light brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups mashed very ripe bananas
1 (11 ounce) package Ghirardelli Grand Semi-Sweet Chocolate Baking Chips, divided
Cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Beat cream cheese and butter with a heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Gradually add granulated sugar and brown sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating just until blended after each addition. Beat in vanilla.
Whisk together flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a medium bowl; gradually add to butter mixture, beating on low speed just until blended. Stir in mashed bananas and 1 1/3 cups of the Ghirardelli Grand Semi-Sweet Chocolate Baking Chips.
Divide batter evenly among five 3x 5-inch mini loaf pans coated with cooking spray. Top batter with remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips (about 14 or 15 chips per pan).
Bake in preheated oven until deep golden brown and a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, 40 to 44 minutes. If necessary, cover loaves with aluminum foil after 30 minutes to prevent over-browning.
Cool in pans on wire racks 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks, and cool completely, about 1 hour.

Description: 
These moist and tender loaves boasts a fine, pound cake-like crumb. The flavor is distinctly banana-forward with a bit of tang from the cream cheese. The addition of chocolate adds a decadent, gift-worthy note. We've offered instructions for both traditionally sized and miniature loaves for gifting. Pro tip: Though it may be hard to hold off, allow loaves to fully cool before cutting for optimal texture.
