Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
2 cups baking mix
1 cup milk
1/3 cup white sugar
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut
3/4 cup white chocolate chips, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a muffin tin.
Combine baking mix, milk, sugar, egg, and vegetable oil in a bowl. Mix well. Fold in 3/4 cup coconut flakes and 1/4 cup chocolate chips. Fill prepared tin with batter; sprinkle remaining coconut flakes on top.
Bake cupcakes in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool, about 10 minutes.
Melt the remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, about 1 minute. Drizzle melted chocolate over cooled cupcakes.
