Ingredients:
1 whole chicken
16 oz. spaghetti
1 green bell pepper chopped
1 cup chopped onion
1/4 stick butter
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 can Rotel tomatoes
1 can stewed Mexican tomatoes
2) 4 oz. cans chopped green chilis
18 oz. Velvetta cheese cut in to cubes
1 1/2 to 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1 tsp. garlic
3/4 tsp. cumin
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook chicken in a large post with salt, pepper and cumin.  When chicken is cool, chop in to bite size pieces.  Cook spaghetti in the broth from the chicken.  Meanwhile, saute bell pepper and onion in butter until tender.  Add soup, Rotel tomatoes, stewed tomatoes, green chilis, Velvetta, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.  Cook on low until bubbling.  Add chicken and spaghetti ( you will probably need to mix everything together in the pan you cooked the chicken).  Transfer to slightly greased (Pam) 9x13 dish.  Top with cheddar cheese and bake 20 - 3- minutes or until bubbling on top.
