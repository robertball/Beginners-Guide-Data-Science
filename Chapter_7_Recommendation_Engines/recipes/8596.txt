Ingredients:
1 lemon
2 teaspoons dried oregano
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 chicken legs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a 9x13 inch baking dish, grate the peel from 1/2 the lemon, squeeze out the juice (about 1/4 cup) and add to peel with the oregano, garlic, oil, salt and pepper. Stir until mixed.
Remove skin from chicken pieces and discard. Coat chicken pieces with the lemon mixture and arrange, bone-side up, in the baking dish. Cover dish and bake for 20 minutes. Turn and baste chicken.
Reduce heat to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and bake uncovered, basting every 10 minutes, for about 30 more minutes. Serve chicken with pan juices.
