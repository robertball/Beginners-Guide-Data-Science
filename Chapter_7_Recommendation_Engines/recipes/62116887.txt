Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup wheat flour
1 cup lukewarm water
1 pkg yeast
1 t. salt

Directions:
Blend whole wheat flour and 1 cup of the white flour  with water, yeast and salt until moistened and well blended.  Beat 3 minutes on medium speed.
Work in the rest of the flour by hand or with dough hook.
Add more water if needed.
Knead until smooth and elastic.
Place dough in greased bowl and cover for 1 hour at 80 degrees.  I turn the oven on for a little to heat up then turn it off and put dough in.
After it's raised, divide into 30 pieces and cover with damp towel for 30 min.
Roll and flatten pieces on floured board as thin as possible, traslucent.  If to thick they will bubble up or be more like pitas.
Bake on PREHEATED, ungreased baking sheet at 500 degrees for about 3 min.  Watch carefully, they should be lightly browned on top with small bubbles.  If not thin enough, roll again.
Serve as appetizer crackers.  It's best with Havarti cheese melted on it so we don't add any seasonings to it.  Try it, it's great!
Store in sealed container.

Description: 
This is identical to the cracker bread sold at deli's in large grocery stores that sells for $6 for 3 big rounds.  You can make it for pennys!  I fell it love with it as an appetizer with Harvarti cheese melted on it but with the price of the cheese and Lavosh we didn't have it much.  Make sure you roll the dough VERY thin, almost see through.  I found something close in a ND Wheat COmmission cookbook and after playing with the ingredients came up with the perfect clone.
