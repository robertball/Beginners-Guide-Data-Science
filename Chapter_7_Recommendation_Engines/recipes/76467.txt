Ingredients:
3/8 cup vegetable oil
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup plain yogurt
2 oranges, zested and juiced
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the vegetable oil, sugar and eggs. Stir in yogurt and orange zest. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the mixture just until blended. Pour the dough into a greased 9x13 inch baking pan.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the cake comes out clean. Poke holes in the cake with a knife, and pour the juice from the oranges over the cake slowly until it has all been absorbed.

Description: 
This cake is the one my mother is preparing like a chef! It is really simple but excellent. You cannot fail it. Good luck and degustez avec bon! (The cake will look dark orange so if you use black decoration on it, it is a perfect Halloween dessert).
