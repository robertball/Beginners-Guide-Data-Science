Ingredients:
2 cups graham flour (measured with the fluff, sprinkle/spoon and level method)*
1/2 cup all purpose flour (measured with the fluff, sprinkle/spoon and level method)*
1/4 cup tightly packed brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon aluminum-free baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
6 Tablespoons or (3/4 stick) unsalted or salted butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes and chilled
1/4 cup of whole milk, (or 2%)
1/4 cup TOTAL of molasses and/or honey
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Cinnamon and Sugar Mixture for the topping:
1/4 cup of granulated sugar or turbinado sugar
2 teaspoons of cinnamon
2 Tablespoons of mllk-(brush on before using cinnamon sugar mixture)
Pan Size- 18x13 cookie sheet
Cookie Cutters- (2 and 1/2 inch to 3 inch)

Directions:
Place all flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon into the bowl of a food processor and pulse several times to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles cornmeal. Add the molasses, milk and vanilla extract and process until the dough forms a ball, approximately 1 minute. Press the ball into a 1/2-inch thick disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Meanwhile mix the sugar and cinnamon for the topping.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
Unwrap the chilled dough and place it onto a large piece of parchment paper and top with a sheet of waxed paper. Roll the dough out until it is 1/4-inch thick or 1/8-inch thick. Slide the rolled dough and parchment paper onto a baking sheet pan. Remove the top sheet of waxed paper and cut the dough, using a cookie cutter. Remove the excess dough and roll out the dough again. You might have to chill the dough again if the dough is hard to work with. Repeat process above. Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the dough. Brush crackers with milk. Sprinkle crackers with cinnamon sugar mixture. Leave the graham crackers on the pan and bake on the middle rack of the oven for 15 minutes or until the edges just start to darken. Remove from the oven, set the sheet pan with the crackers on a cooling rack and allow to cool completely. Once completely cool, store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
