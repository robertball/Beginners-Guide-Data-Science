Ingredients:
1- 11 oz bag of Brachs Caramel's- unwrapped
4 Tablespoons Margarine or Butter
1/2 Cup brown sugar
1/2 Cup Milk
4 large Granny Smith's(or your favorite apples)peeled and quartered.
1 recipe of Crepes (I use the recipe from the Olive and Chicken Curry Crepes from this site)
1- 12 oz tub of Cool Whip or Ice Cream(optional)

Directions:
Make Crepes Ahead.
Melt margarine in a saucepan.  Stir in brown sugar and then milk.
Add the caramel's and stir with a wire wisk over low/med heat until entirely blended and smooth.
Please try not to slurp it up.  You need to save this for your guests.
Add apples and continue to cook over low/med heat for about 2 minutes until apples are just tender. Remove from heat.
Using a slotted spoon, scoop 4 or 5 slices of apple over center of crepe.  Gently roll and center on plate.
Top with ice cream or cool whip and spoon over some sauce.
ENJOY! YUM!
