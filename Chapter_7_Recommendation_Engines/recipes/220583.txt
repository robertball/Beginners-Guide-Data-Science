Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
4 large carrots, cut into 3-inch x 1/2-inch pieces
4 large parsnips, cut into 3-inch x 1/2-inch pieces
3/4 cup orange juice
3/4 cup chicken stock
2 tablespoons lemon juice
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
Cook and stir carrots and parsnips in melted butter until lightly browned on edges, 8 to 10 minutes.
Stir orange juice, chicken stock, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper into carrots and parsnips. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover. Simmer until liquid reduces to a syrup, about 10 minutes. Stir often.
Season with more salt and black pepper if needed; sprinkle with chives.
