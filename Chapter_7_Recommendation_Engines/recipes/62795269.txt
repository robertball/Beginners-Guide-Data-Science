Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups of graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup of butter, melted
1 can sweetened condensed milk
2 cups mini marshmallows
2 Hershey bars, broken into individual pieces
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
3 graham crackers

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees F
Mix the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together and press into the bottom of a 9x13 greased pan to form a crust.
Evenly pour the can of sweetened condensed milk over the top of the graham cracker crust.
Sprinkle the two cups of mini marshmallows on top of the milk and lightly press down.
Take the individual sections of the Hershey bar and place them on top of the marshmallows.  I usually fit four across and six down.
Sprinkle the semi-sweet chocolate chips over top and in places that the Hershey bars do not cover.
Last, crumble the three graham crackers into 1 inch pieces and sprinkle them over the top.  Using a fork, lightly press down the mixture.
Bake in the oven for 20 minutes.  Remove pan from the oven and let the bars cool for about 10 minutes then run a knife along the edge of the pan and cut into individual bars.

This delicious bar has all the taste and joy of real fire side s'mores but with a bit of a chewy center that screams... OH MY!
