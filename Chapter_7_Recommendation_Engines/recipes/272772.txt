Ingredients:
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
2 tablespoons lemon juice
4 teaspoons curry powder
2 teaspoons fine sea salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
3 pounds cauliflower

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Wash and pat Cauliflower dry. Remove tough core and break (or cut) the florets into bit sized pieces. Set aside.
Combine olive oil, lemon juice, curry powder, salt, cayenne, and garam masala in a large bowl; mix into a paste. Add cauliflower and gently mix with a spoon to evenly coat with the spice paste. Transfer cauliflower to the prepared baking sheet and spread out in one layer.
Roast in the preheated oven until cauliflower begins to caramelize, 20 to 25 minutes.
