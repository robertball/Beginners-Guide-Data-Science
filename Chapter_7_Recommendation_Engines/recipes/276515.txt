Ingredients:
2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups maple syrup
3/4 cup dark cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon gluten-free baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup mashed bananas
1/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk
1/4 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup vegan dark chocolate chips
1/2 cup cocoa nibs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Combine flour, maple syrup, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; blend well and make a well in the center. Combine mashed bananas, coconut milk, olive oil, and vanilla extract in a second bowl. Pour banana mixture into the flour mixture and stir until batter is evenly mixed. Fold in chocolate chips. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish and sprinkle with cocoa nibs.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool completely before slicing.

Description: 
Dress these brownies up with icing to make a delicious dessert or a snack on-the-go. Either way, they are delicious. I made these with my cherry-coconut whipped cream and they were awesome! 
Gluten free often makes desserts dry and brittle but this version is a lot more moist than the standard gluten-free brownie recipe. Bananas are the key. Find some browning or rotting bananas, it will bring a chewy, moistness without the banana aftertaste.
