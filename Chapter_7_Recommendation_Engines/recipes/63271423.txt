Ingredients:
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed (each 17.3-ounce package contains 2 sheets)
2 pounds fresh strawberries, hulled and halved
1 pound fresh rhubarb, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, divided
Pinch of salt
Juice of 2 lemons
1/2 cup cornstarch

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 F. Coat a 9-by-9-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the thawed sheet of puff pastry to 9-by-9-inches. Set aside.
In a large saucepan over medium-high, combine the strawberries, rhubarb, 1/2 cup of the sugar and the pinch of salt. Heat, stirring gently now and then, until the fruit is tender and bubbling, about 7 to 8 minutes.
In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice and cornstarch. Stir into the simmering fruit. Simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 1 minute.
Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan. Place the prepared pastry over the top, then sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar. Using a paring knife, slice a couple of vent holes in the pastry. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Spoon into bowls and serve warm or at room temperature.
