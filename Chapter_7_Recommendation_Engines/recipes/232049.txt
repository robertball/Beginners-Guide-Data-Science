Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1 cup creamy peanut butter
3 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups NESTLE速 TOLL HOUSE速 Milk Chocolate or Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels
12 pieces NESTLE速 BUTTERFINGER速 Bites Candy, finely chopped
24 mini paper baking cups (1 1/2 to 1 3/4 inches in diameter)

Directions:
Place sugar, peanut butter, butter and salt in large mixer bowl. Beat until smooth.  Stir in chopped Butterfinger.
Place morsels in large, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH (100%) power for 1 minute; STIR.  The morsels may retain some of their original shape.  If necessary, microwave at additional 10- to 15-second intervals, stirring until morsels are melted.
Coat inside sides and bottoms of baking cups with melted chocolate using a small spoon or paintbrush. Transfer cups to mini muffin tin(s); freeze for 10 minutes or until set.
Remove about one-third of chocolate cups from freezer. Spoon peanut butter mixture into cups, filling each about three-fourths full. Spoon melted chocolate over mixture, covering completely and filling cups to the top. Return to freezer; repeat with remaining cups. Freeze for 20 minutes or until set. Serve immediately or store in tightly covered plastic container in freezer for up to 2 weeks. To serve, remove from freezer and let cups stand for a few minutes.  Peel off cup and serve cold.
