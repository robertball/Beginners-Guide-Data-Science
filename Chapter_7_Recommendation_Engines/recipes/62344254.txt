3/4 cup paprika
1/4 cup fresh ground pepper blend (you can also use just black pepper)

2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons onion powder
1 tablespoon sea salt
2 teaspoons cayenne

Directions:
Thoroughly mix spices and store in a cool, dark pantry.
When you apply a rub, you'll want to liberally coat the meat and rub it into the grain. For large cuts, it is best to do it the night before to let the flavor seep into the meat. Small pieces like a chicken breast, you can rub and cook. The rub can also be added to ground meat when making dishes like burgers and tacos.
