Ingredients:
4 center-cut pork chops, about 1-inch thick
2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 onions, thinly sliced
2 cups milk

Directions:
Season pork chops with Cajun seasoning and coat completely with flour, reserving any leftover flour.
Heat oil in heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork chops and brown, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Remove to a plate. Add sliced onions to the pan drippings and cook for 1 minute.
Dust onions with leftover flour and continue to cook until brown, another 4 to 5 minutes. Add milk and bring to a boil, stirring until incorporated. Return pork chops to the skillet; cover, reduce heat, and simmer until gravy is thick and pork chops are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
