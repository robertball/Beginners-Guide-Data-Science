Ingredients:
Claussen whole dill pickles (1 1/2 pickles per person)
2-Cups vegetable oil
Batter:
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 tsp baking powder
1 egg
1 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp dried dill
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)

Directions:
Pre heat oil to 360-370 degrees
Combine all batter ingredients into a bowl and stir until smooth. Let the batter stand for 5 minutes.
Slice pickles into medium sized slices. Place on a paper towel and pat dry.
Place Panko bread crumbs into a separate bowl.  Dip each pickle slice into the batter and coat well. Place the battered pickle into the Panko crumbs and toss until well coated. Fry the battered pickles in small batches. Change bread crumbs when they start to get too moist. They will not stick to the pickles if they are too wet.  Serve with ranch dressing.
