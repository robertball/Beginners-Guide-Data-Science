1 package chocolate wafers (9 oz, see notes below)
3 Tbl sugar
1 stick butter melted
Filling
4 8 oz packages of cream cheese
1 cup sugar
4 eggs
10 Tbl heavy cream

Directions:
Crust
Crush wafers in Cuisinart until fine. Add sugar and melted butter and press into 9-inch springform pan. Bake at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes to set.
Filling
Blend cream cheese with sugar until smooth in Cuisinart.
Add eggs one at a time then add the cream and vanilla.
Pour into crust and bake at 325 degrees until cake is set approx. 45 minutes to an hour. Don't overbake!
Then turn off the oven-and let cake sit until nearly cool (don't open oven door). This prevents cracking of surface.
