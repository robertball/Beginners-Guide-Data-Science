Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
4 slices ham
4 slices Swiss cheese
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon paprika
2  eggs, beaten
⅓ cup milk
1 cup dry bread crumbs
¼ cup olive oil
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
½ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
⅛ teaspoon curry powder
¼ cup white wine
½ cup sour cream
2 sprigs fresh parsley, for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Flatten chicken breasts without breaking through meat. Roll each ham slice in a cheese slice, then roll up in chicken breasts. In a shallow dish or bowl season flour with salt, pepper and paprika. In a separate dish or bowl beat together eggs and milk. Dip chicken rolls in seasoned flour, then egg mixture, then bread crumbs. Heat oil in a large skillet and fry chicken in hot oil until golden brown. Set aside.
To Make Sauce: In a large bowl combine the soup, mushrooms, garlic powder, curry powder, wine and sour cream. Mix all together. Place browned chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour sauce mixture over chicken and bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley sprigs.
