Mallow-Nutter Milk Shake Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 Cup peanut butter
(creamy will allow you to be able to drink with a straw)
2 Cups vanilla ice cream (or ice milk or frozen yogurt etc.)
1/2 Cup milk (any variety will work, whole, 2%, 1%, skim)
1 Cup Marshmallow (whipped in jar, ex. Fluff)
1 teaspoon of vanilla
(2-3 ice cubes if you want it thicker)

Directions:
Add the milk, ice cream and ice and blend in blender.
After these start blending together but aren't fully mixed together (still a bit chunky), add the peanut butter and marshmallow.  Keep mixing until it gets to the consistency that you like.
This is a VERY tasty treat.  I also like to mix it up by using different flavors of ice cream (such as chocolate, or peanut ripple, etc.)
Hope you enjoy!

Remember those days when your Mom made you your favorite lunch sandwich that incorporated peanut butter and marshmallow? Well, it's still pretty darn good, but change it up and have it as your Shake.
