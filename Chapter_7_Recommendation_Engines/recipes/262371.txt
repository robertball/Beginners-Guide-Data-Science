Ingredients:
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt
3 very ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
1/2 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Combine coconut oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; whisk well to combine. Add flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Stir well until combined. Fold in bananas, pineapple, and coconut; stir until just blended. Pour batter evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
