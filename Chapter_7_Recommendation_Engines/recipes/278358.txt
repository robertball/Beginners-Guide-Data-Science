Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 pounds ground turkey
1 extra large onion, diced
1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 cups chicken broth
2 cups chicken stock
2 (28 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes
1 (16 ounce) can kidney beans - rinsed, drained, and mashed
4 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Place turkey into the pot and cook evenly until browned, crumbly, and no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in onion and cook until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in jalapeno and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Pour broth and stock into the pot.
Mix in tomatoes, kidney beans, chili powder, brown sugar, cinnamon, kosher salt, paprika, oregano, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, cover, and let simmer for 30 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is my family's favorite turkey chili for a crowd that we serve with freshly baked cornbread, sour cream, and shredded cheeses for a topping. The secret ingredient is the cinnamon that makes this special. We like spicy so be careful adding the cayenne pepper. This is even better the second day.
