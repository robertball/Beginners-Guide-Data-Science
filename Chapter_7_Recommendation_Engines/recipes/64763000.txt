Ingredients:
2 cups whole milk plain Greek yogurt
3 tbsps pure maple syrup, or to taste
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp maple extract (optional)
Pinch of salt
1 cup pumpkin puree
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1/8 tsp ground nutmeg
1/8 tsp ground allspice
1 cup maple granola

Directions:
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together Greek yogurt, maple syrup, vanilla extract, maple extract (if using), and salt until thoroughly combined. Reserve 1/2 cup of yogurt mixture, and set the rest aside.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together pumpkin puree, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, and reserved 1/2 cup of yogurt mixture until thoroughly combined.
3. In four small jars or containers, place a small amount of the yogurt mixture in the bottom of each. Top each with a portion of the pumpkin mixture, followed by a layer of the maple granola. Continue alternating layers of the yogurt mixture, pumpkin mixture, and granola. Serve immediately, or cover and keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
Note: You can use any kind of yogurt you prefer--flavored, or not. I also used the recipe for "Maple Pecan Granola" https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/220814/maple-pecan-granola/  from this site for this parfait.
