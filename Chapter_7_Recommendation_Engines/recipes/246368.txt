Description: 
Looking for a healthy, yummy breakfast to start your day? Try this vegan smoothie bowl with carrots, banana, coconut, and goji berries. I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk but you can substitute with any non-dairy milk. If you like it sweeter, use some agave syrup (but I don't think it needs any extra sugar).
