Chop eggs, reserving at least one to slice for top decoration.  I always do the dressing, lettuce, sprouts, eggs, bacon and spinach the day before, refrigerate everything and then it's ready to assemble when you are ready to take somewhere or eat.Tear lettuce into pieces, mix with spinach, drained bean sprouts, chopped eggs, bacon. For dressing, everything in blender and blend till smooth. Put into empty salad dressing bottle and serve on the side with salad.

Description: 
Betty's Salad is a regional, Midwest salad created by Betty Timko and featured as a menu item at her restaurant, Timko's Soup and Such, in Toledo, Ohio. The restaurant was located in a brick building at the northwest corner of Sylvania and Douglas Roads of the Devaux Village strip mall in West Toledo.  After Betty died, the restaurant closed, and her signature salad dressing is still produced and distributed at regional grocery stores.
