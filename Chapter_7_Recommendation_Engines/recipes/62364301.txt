Description: 
Razor Clam in Sha Cha Sauce is one of my favorite dishes. Sha Cha is a type of sauce which is actually from my hometown. I was so glad to find it in the US, it makes this dish so tasty. I almost felt like I was home.In the store, Sha Cha Sauce is actually spelled Sa Cha.

If you cannot find razor clams with shell on, you may substitute razor clams with Manila clams. It will be also delicious.
