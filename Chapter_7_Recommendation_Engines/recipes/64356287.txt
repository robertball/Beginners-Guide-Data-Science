Spray slow cooker with cooking spray.

Description: 
I made this by mistake when I accidentally overcooked some potatoes in my slow cooker for a different recipe.  It turned out to be a delicious mistake! When the potatoes mush up and are mixed with the cheddar cheese soup, it gives this soup a wonderful base. Serve with a salad and warm French bread.  Great for a cold winter night.
