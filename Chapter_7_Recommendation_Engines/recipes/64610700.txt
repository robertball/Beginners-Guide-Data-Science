Ingredients:
1 c. carrots, diced
1 Medium Onion, Diced
1 bag frozen peas
1 bag frozen corn (or 1 can corn, juices drained)
2 lb. boneless chicken breasts
3 cans cream of chicken soup
3 c. water
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. Pepper
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tube refrigerated biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury Grands Buttermilk biscuits)

Directions:
Pour carrots, onion, peas and corn into the slow cooker. Chop chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces and add to the slow cooker, along with the cream of chicken soup and water. Season with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Stir.
Cover with lid and cook on high for 4-5 hours (or low for 6-8).
Once the time is almost up, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Turn off the slow cooker and place all of the biscuit dough pieces side by side on top of the chicken mixture. Remove the ceramic, inner part of the slow cooker (the bowl) and place it in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the tops of the biscuits are golden. Ladle the chicken pot pie into bowls and serve.
