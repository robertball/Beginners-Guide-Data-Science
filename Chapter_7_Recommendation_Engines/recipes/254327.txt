Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 teaspoon salt
1 clove garlic, minced
cooking spray
Sauce:
1 (10.5 ounce) can beef consomme
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons ketchup
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
9 ounces canned black olives, diced
1/4 cup sherry

Directions:
Mix ground beef, milk, bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon salt, and garlic together in a large bowl. Shape into small meatballs.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat; grease with cooking spray. Cook meatballs in batches until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large plate; drain excess grease from the skillet.
Stir beef consomme, sour cream, flour, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a bowl.
Pour beef consomme mixture into the skillet; cook and stir over medium-low heat until heated through but not boiling, 5 to 10 minutes. Return meatballs to the skillet; stir to coat with sauce. Stir olives and sherry into the sauce before serving.

Description: 
My stand-by company meal in the early married years: from my mom, Jo Gilstad. Serve over noodles. It goes well with sweet and sour French-style green beans.
