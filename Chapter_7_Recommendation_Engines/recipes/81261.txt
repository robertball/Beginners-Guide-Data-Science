Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 eggs
4 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 shallot, chopped
1 green onion, chopped
1/2 cup minced crabmeat
1/2 cup chopped cooked pork
1/2 cup diced firm tofu
1 cup bean sprouts
1 cup frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
1/2 cup shredded cabbage
4 teaspoons canola oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 chile pepper, chopped (optional)

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the flour, eggs, water and salt. It will be very watery, as the pizza is like a crepe. Stir in the crabmeat, pork, tofu, bean sprouts, mixed vegetables, and cabbage until well blended.
Heat some of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Your pizzas will be the size of your skillet. Spoon in enough of the vegetable batter to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook for about 8 minutes, or until the underside is golden brown. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes. The edges should be crispy. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve pizzas with dipping sauce.
To make the dipping sauce, mix together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil and chile pepper in a sealable container. Seal, and shake until well blended. Shake again just before serving.

Description: 
I got this recipe from my Korean friend. He says it's a really popular snack food in Korea and even though it looks more like a crepe, they call it pizza. It's very versatile and you can add pretty much anything you like to it, as long as it's chopped small enough.
