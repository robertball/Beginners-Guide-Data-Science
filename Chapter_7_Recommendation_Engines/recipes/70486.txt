Ingredients:
1 pound halibut fillets
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup low-fat creamy salad dressing (e.g. Miracle Whipâ„¢)
1 1/2 cups crushed saltine crackers
garlic salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch seasoning salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Rinse fish fillets with water, and pat dry with paper towels.
In a shallow bowl, mix together the cracker crumbs, garlic salt, pepper and seasoning salt. Set aside. Coat the fish fillets with flour, shaking off the excess, and place in a baking dish. Coat the tops of the fillets with salad dressing, then press on a layer of seasoned cracker crumbs. Flip over, and repeat on the other side.
Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until fish is white and flakes easily with a fork.

Description: 
A wonderful recipe my mother used to use when I was a kid. A crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside recipe. Also works great for ling cod, snapper, or other white fish. Enjoy your halibut with what my sisters and I used to call 'pink sauce' (Miracle Whip and ketchup mixed together), a fresh spinach salad and toasted French bread.
