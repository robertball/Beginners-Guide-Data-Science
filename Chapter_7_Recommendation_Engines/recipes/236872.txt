Ingredients:
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 1/4 cups water
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
5 1/2 pounds pot roast
2 potatoes, cut into cubes
2 carrots, sliced and halved
1 yellow squash, sliced
1 zucchini, halved lengthwise and sliced

Directions:
Stir cream of mushroom soup, water, and dry onion soup mix together in a slow cooker. Set pot roast into the soup mixture and spoon liquid over the meat. Add potatoes, carrots, yellow squash, and zucchini.
Cook on High until the beef is cooked through, 3 to 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). You can also cook on Low for 5 to 6 hours.

Description: 
This simple pot roast makes its own gravy in the slow cooker. As a single parent to girls, I am always trying to get the food groups into my abbreviated meals. I threw in potatoes, carrots, yellow squash, and zucchini to add to the original base recipe. They love stew, so this leads them in that direction, but is still a roast. It was a hit. I hope you enjoy it!
