Ingredients:
4 cups of whole-wheat flour
2 tablespoons of baking powder
2 teaspoons of salt
4 tablespoons of sugar or powdered stevia
3/4 cup of peanut/coconut or vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups applesauce
1/4 cups of water

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C).
2. Mix flour, baking powder, salt and sugar or stevia. Add oil, applesauce and water all at once and mix until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.  Drop golf-ball size spoonfuls onto a greased baking sheet, or line the sheet with parchment paper.
3. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the biscuits are browned on the top and bottom.
