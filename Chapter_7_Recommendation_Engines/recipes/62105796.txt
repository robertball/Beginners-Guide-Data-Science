Description: 
My husband and I love grilling hamburgers in the summer.  I came up with this while trying to make a nice, juicy burger with good flavor.  We make them all the time, and friends rave about them! The secret...it's all in the sauce! Try not to substitute it for another one, it won't be the same!
