Ingredients:
For the sauce:
1 12 ounce jar of HerdezÂ® Traditional Chipotle cooking sauce
1 14 ounce can of low sodium beef broth
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
Sprigs of cilantro for garnish (optional)
For the filling:
2 tablespoon of vegetable oil
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 pound deli-sliced roast, cut into strips
4 bolillo, ciabatta or other crusty sandwich roll, halved and lightly toasted

Directions:
For the sauce: In a sauce pan combine the chipotle cooking sauce with the beef broth and cilantro. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
For the filling: In a large skillet over medium-high heat add the oil. When the oil is hot add the onions. Cook until the onions begin to soften. Add the garlic in and stir for about 2-3 minutes. Add the meat with 1/4 cup of the sauce and toss for about two minutes until heated through. Ladle the sauce into four bowls for dipping. Place the meat mixture on the bottom half of the sandwich bun, garnish with cilantro sprigs and place top half of bun on top. Dip sandwiches in the sauce and enjoy.
