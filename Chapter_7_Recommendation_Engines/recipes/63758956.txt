Ingredients:
Lemon Yogurt Cake Ingredients:
• 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
• 2 teaspoons baking powder
• 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
• 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
• 1 cup sugar
• 3 large eggs
• 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest (2 lemons)
• 1/2 teaspoon good quality vanilla extract
• 1/2 cup vegetable oil
• 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
• Cooking spray
Raspberry Puree Ingredients:
• 1 container of fresh raspberries
• 2 tablespoons of sugar
• 2 teaspoons of lemon juice
• Blueberries, Strawberrier or an extra container of raspberries (for garnish)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F.
Coat a loaf pan with cooking spray generously
In a medium bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt into 1 bowl.
In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, 1sugar, eggs, lemon zest, and vanilla. Slowly add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix together. With a rubber spatula, fold the vegetable oil into the batter, making sure it’s all combined together. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for about 50 minutes, or until a toothpick placed in the center of the loaf comes out clean.
Meanwhile, take out a small chopper and add raspberries, sugar and lemon juice and blend until smooth. Put in a bowl and set in the refrigerator.
When the cake is done, let sit for at least 10 minutes. Take a butter knife and go along the loaf to make sure it is loose and take out and place on a serving dish.
To serve, slice loaf and put on a dessert dish, add the raspberry puree over the slice. Add blueberries, strawberries or raspberries on the side of the plate or a few on top of the puree.

Description: 
This is a great dessert that is always a nice ending. To make it extra special add some homemade whipped cream but it is delicious without it too!
