Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup molasses
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups boiling water
2 tablespoons active dry yeast
1/2 cup lukewarm water (100 degrees F/38 degrees C)
1 cup whole wheat flour
5 cups bread flour
2 eggs

Directions:
Combine oats, molasses, oil, salt and boiling water. Let cool to about 105 degrees F.
Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and let stand for 5 minutes or until creamy. Stir the yeast into oat mixture and mix well. Add whole wheat flour, 2 cups bread flour, and the eggs. Mix until well combined.
Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn dough out to a floured counter and knead for about 10 minutes. Place the dough in a well-greased bowl and cover with greased plastic wrap. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator overnight.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 3 regular loaf pans and 4 mini loaf pans.
Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and divide it into 4 pieces. Shape the dough into loaves and place them in the pans, seam-side down. Let rise until doubled, about 90 minutes. Bake in the preheated oven until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, about 30 minutes.
