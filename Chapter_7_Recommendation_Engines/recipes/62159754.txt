Description: 
Having lived in southern California for years, I had a chance to develop salsa that tasted very much like the kind I was served when I'd cross the border into Mexico. I originally made this with ripe, peeled tomatoes. I later discovered that canned tomatoes produce the same taste. I prefer salsa that's medium hot, which is what this recipe will produce. Feel free to adjust the hot ingredients to suit your preference.
