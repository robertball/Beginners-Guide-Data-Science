Description: 
This is a slightly spicy and VERY filling side dish that you can alter to suit your family's tastes.  It's the absolute only way to get my kids and I to eat peas!  Simple, filling and TASTY!  This comes from my father-in-law's family where inexpensive foods were used to create a filling meal.  My husband LOVES to sop up the pea/oil juice with fresh Italian bread.  Great as a side for meat dishes.
