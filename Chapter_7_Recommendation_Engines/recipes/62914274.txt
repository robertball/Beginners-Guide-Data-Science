Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 large onion, minced
1/8 teaspoon beef bouillon granules
4 cups water to cover
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup water
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place the ground beef in a large pot and pour in enough water to cover beef. Boil until beef is cooked through. Drain.
Add water to cover cooked beef, add onions and enough bouillon granules to taste. Cook until the onions are soft. Season with salt and pepper to your taste and make sure the filling has enough bouillon to have a nice beef flavor.
Combine the 1/4 cup water with the cornstarch and stir until smooth. Add to the beef mixture and cook until mixture has thickened.
Pour beef mixture into the pastry crust and cover the top with pastry. Crimp edges and prick top.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.

Description: 
This is a hearty, baked meat pie that would work beautifully for a Sunday supper. The ground beef is cooked until tender, and combined with beef bouillon and onion. Cornstarch and water are added for thickening, and then this savory filling is arranged in a pie crust, topped with another crust and baked. Slice and serve it with mashed potatoes.Modified from: Scottish Mince Pie
