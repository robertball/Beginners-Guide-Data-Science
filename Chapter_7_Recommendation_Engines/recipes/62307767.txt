Onion and Mushroom Scrambled Eggs Recipe

Ingredients:
1. 1 sliced white onion
2. 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms (any variety, I prefer a blend of exotic mushrooms)
3. 1 clove of garlic
4. 1 1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
5. 2 tablespoons of garlic and herb Boursin cheese (or cream cheese if you cant find any Boursin)
6. 1 1/2 tablespoons of italian seasoning
7. 1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
8. 5 eggs
9. Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Put the mushrooms, onions, garlic in a saute pan with the olive oil and sautee on medium heat. Add the italian seasoning. Cook until onions caramelized and mushrooms cooked through, about 15 minutes (do not add salt early on when cooking the mushrooms, it will pull the water out of them and take away their crispiness).
In a bowl, mix the 5 eggs with some salt, pepper and the boursin. Try to get the boursin as well mixed as you can into the eggs, but some chunks of boursin are okay, they will melt in the pan.
Add the eggs to the cooked onion and mushrooms, continue to stir while cooking to scramble the eggs (30seconds - 1 minute). Add the mozzarella cheese and fold into the eggs for another 30 seconds and then remove from the heat.

Description: 
A recipe inspired from a local brunch restaurant. The boursin gives the omelet an incredible creaminess. A great brunch/breakfast dish, I like to serve this with toast.
