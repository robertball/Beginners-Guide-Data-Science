1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup milk
3 eggs

2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup poppy seeds

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Beat applesauce, sugar, milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and orange extract together in a large bowl. Add flour, poppy seeds, baking powder, and baking soda; stir until batter is just-combined. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
