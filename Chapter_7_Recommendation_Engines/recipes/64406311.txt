Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups of shredded zucchini
1 cup of flour
1/2 cup of cocoa
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/3 cup of applesauce
1/2 cup of white sugar
1/2 cup of packed brown sugar
2 eggs ( 2 T gr flax seed + 6 T warm water)
1 tsp vanilla
3/4- 1 cup of chocolate chips

Directions:
In your mixer bowl combine the eggs, applesauce, vanillas and sugars.
Sift together your dry ingredients, then add to the egg mixture, combining well on low speed.
Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold in the chocolate chips.
Grease and flour a loaf pan, then pour the batter in.
Bake at 325 for 50-60 minutes, until a fork inserted comes out clean. Which can be hard to do with chocolate chips in the recipe, but it is doable.
