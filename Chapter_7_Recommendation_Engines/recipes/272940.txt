Ingredients:
1/2 buttercup squash, halved and seeded
1 small yellow squash, peeled and cubed
1 sweet potato, peeled and cubed
1 nectarine, pitted and chopped
1/2 orange bell pepper, cubed
1/2 cucumber, peeled and cubed
1/3 cup chopped yellow onion
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt
1/3 cup shredded Pecorino Romano cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place butternut squash face-down in a baking dish; pour water into dish around squash.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 45 minutes.
While butternut squash bakes, place yellow squash, sweet potato, nectarine, orange bell pepper, cucumber, and onion into a large pot with enough water to cover. Stir in salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pepper to vegetable mixture. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.
Remove butternut squash from the oven. Let cool 10 minutes.
Scoop out the inner pulp of squash half; add to the simmering soup. Continue to let simmer to meld flavors for at least 15 minutes. Remove from heat; drain liquid.
Place cooked vegetables into a food processor and puree until smooth.
Transfer puree to a large saucepan over low heat. Stir chicken broth and yogurt into puree until well blended. Cover and let simmer until incorporated, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat; sprinkle with Pecorino Romano cheese. Serve.
