Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups self-rising flour
1 cup canned pumpkin
2/3 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon maple flavoring
2 tablespoons maple syrup
2 tablespoons butter-flavored shortening, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Place the flour in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour. Place the pumpkin, sour cream, maple flavoring, and syrup in the well. Mix the pumpkin mixture into the flour to make the dough until stiff. Roll the dough on a lightly-floured surface. Cut into 8 biscuits. Dip each biscuit into the melted shortening and place the biscuits on the baking sheet with the side that was dipped in shortening facing up.
Bake in preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
These are tender, moist biscuits with a subtle and mellow taste and a bright saffron-yellow color. Even my son who hates pumpkin will eat these.
