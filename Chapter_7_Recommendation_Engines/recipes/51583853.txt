Ingredients:
For the hash
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup finely chopped red onion
1 large jalapeño, chopped
Kosher salt, to taste
Freshly ground pepper
4 cups peeled, roasted sweet potatoes, 1-inch cubed
2 tablespoons ketchup
4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
8 ounces baked tofu, diced
4 teaspoons chopped parsley
For serving
Scallions, chopped
Hot sauce
Ketchup

Directions:
In a nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and the jalapeño, and season with salt and pepper. Cook until golden, about 5 minutes.
Add the cubed potatoes, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce, and season with salt. Press the mixture down into the skillet, reduce the heat to medium and cook until golden, about 5 to 7 minutes.
While the potatoes are cooking, cut the tofu into quarter-inch dice, about the same size as the potatoes. When potatoes are cooked, gently add diced tofu.
Place the hash on a plate and top with parsley. Serve with scallions, hot sauce and ketchup, if desired.
