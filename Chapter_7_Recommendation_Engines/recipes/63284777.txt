Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 (5.9 ounce) package vanilla or French vanilla instant pudding mix
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1 cup warm water
2 cups white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix together the cake and pudding mixes, sour cream, oil, beaten eggs and water.
Pour batter into a well greased and floured 12 cup bundt pan. Sprinkle white chocolate chips over top of batter - do not mix in.
Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until top is springy to the touch and a wooden toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Cool cake in pan 5 minutes.  Gently run a knife along the edges of the pan to loosen any stuck on cake. Carefully invert cake onto a wire rack to cook. If desired, dust the cake with powdered sugar.
