Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups milk
1 tablespoon heavy cream
1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 cup brewed espresso
1/4 cup white chocolate chips, chopped

Directions:
Combine the milk and cream in a saucepan, and whisk over high heat until hot and frothy. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and sugar. Whisk together hot espresso and white chocolate chips in a mug until smooth. If you are making two, pour half into another mug. Top with the frothy hot milk and stir to blend in the flavoring.

Description: 
I created this recipe for my little sister, Abbey, who's a latte fanatic. She was blown away, and drained it to the last drop! This makes one VERY large, indulgent latte, and could probably serve two. Enjoy!
