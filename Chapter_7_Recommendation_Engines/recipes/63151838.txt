Ingredients:
1 stick butter, softened (put in a bowl and microwave for 30 seconds)
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup mashed ripe bananas
1 (16 ounce) container cream cheese frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees (Press BAKE)
Grease a glass oblong 13".9" pan.
In a medium bowl, mash the bananas and set aside (you won't use them until the end)
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth (that means to use the electric mixer on the highest speed).
Then, beat in the eggs, one at a time.
Then, stir in the sour cream and vanilla.
In a SEPARATE bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt.
Then, stir this flour mixture into the wet batter (you can use a blender on the lowest setting for this).
Finally, mix in the mashed banana.
Coat the bottom and the sides of glass pan with butter and flour (so the cake won't stick)
Pour batter evenly into the prepared pan.
Put in oven, and bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Allow cake to cool completely before frosting with the cream cheese frosting.
