1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 1/2 cups bread flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Day 1: In a medium bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
Stir in flour, salt and oil. Beat until smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a round. Transfer crust to a oiled bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap and place in fridge.
Day 2: Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Lightly grease pizza pan or baker's peel dusted with cornmeal.
Take dough out of refrigerator and spread into prepared pan. Prick with a fork and bake for about 8 minutes. Take out of oven.
Spread with desired toppings and return to preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving.
