Ingredients:
1 large McIntosh apple - peeled, cored, and diced
2  sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 small onion, sliced
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
salt and pepper to taste
2  bone-in chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir the apple, sweet potatoes, onion, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour into a baking dish and place the chicken breasts on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
