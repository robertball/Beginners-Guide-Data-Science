Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 cup cider vinegar
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon whole allspice berries
1 tablespoon whole cloves
1 tablespoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon ground ginger
6 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1/2 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Place the water, cider vinegar, sugar, allspice, clove, nutmeg, and ginger into a small saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.
Meanwhile, toss the sliced apples with the lemon juice, and pack into two sterilized 1 quart canning jars with lids and rings. Pour the boiling syrup over the apples, and affix the lids and rings.
Allow the jars to stand at room temperature until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Place in the refrigerator, and wait 1 week before opening.

Description: 
I was trying to come up with a way to use up a bunch of apples we had in our fridge. Eventually I decided to just pickle them refrigerator-style. This is the result.
