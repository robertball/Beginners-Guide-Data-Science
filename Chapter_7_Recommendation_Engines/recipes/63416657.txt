Ingredients:
3-4 red apples peeled and cored (your favorite variety)
3-4 bananas
3/4 cup raisins
1 can of diced pineapple
2-3 Tbs mayo (I use Veganaise - Mom use Best Foods)
1/2 to 3/4 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Blanch the raisins and set aside,
Peel, core and dice the apples,
Put the apples in a glass or ceramic bowl and mix the diced pineapple (reserving the juice)so apples don't brown.
Dice the bananas and stir into the apple/pineapple mixture
Chop the walnuts into small chunks and add to mixture
Stir blanched raisins
In a separate small bowl, whisk the mayonaise and about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the reserved pineapple juice so you have a more liquid consistency rather than creamy.
Add this dressing to the salad and stir until well coated. If it doesn't look a bit creamy, you can mix up some more dressing and leave it creamier this time. You really can't go wrong with the dressing.
Add a dash of salt to bring out the flavors of the fruit. (This is optional)
Chill for several hours if possible and enjoy.
