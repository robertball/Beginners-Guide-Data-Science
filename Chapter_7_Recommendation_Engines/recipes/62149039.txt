Ingredients:
1 boneless moose or sirloin steak (about 1 inch thick and 1-1/2 pounds)
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 tablespoon ground mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 can (14-1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes, undrained
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
1 medium carrot, diced
Hot cooked noodles, optional

Directions:
Cut steak into serving-size pieces. Combine cornstarch, mustard, salt and pepper; rub half over steak. Pound with a meat mallet to tenderize. Rub with remaining cornstarch mixture; pound on both sides with the mallet.
In a skillet, brown steak in oil. Transfer to a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Top with tomatoes, onion and carrot. Cover and bake at 350Â° for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. Serve over noodles if desired.

Description: 
Our family especially enjoys this tender moose main dish in the fall and winter, when an oven meal really satisfies. The seasonings cover the game flavor wonderfully, and the tomatoes keep the meat nice and moist.
