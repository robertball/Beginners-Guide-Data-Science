Ingredients:
3 lbs of salmon fillets
1/4 t.  salt
1/4 teaspoon of ground pepper
1/2 C.  of brown sugar packed
1/2 cup of butter cut in small pieces
1/2 cup of mayonnaise
1/4 cup of ketchup
2 T.  of white vinegar
1/2  t.  of worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Arrange fillets, skin side down, on a double sheet of foil that is slightly larger then the salmon. Poke holes in the Foral at 2 inch intervals all around fillet including space between fillets.
Sprinkle salmon with salt, pepper, and brown sugar. Dot wiith butter.
In a small bowl, blend together mayonnaise,  catchup, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Spread evenly over brown sugar and butter.
Play salmon on foil on the grill over hot coals. The holes in the foil allow the juices to run down into the coals and create smoke, which gives the salmon a wonderful barbecued flavor.
Medium heat for 20 minutes or until fish starts to flake and it's thickest part, the milky juices start to form on top of the thickest part.
