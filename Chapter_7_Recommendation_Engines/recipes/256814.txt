Description: 
Like many people, I enjoy iced coffee at any time of the year. It is just one of those things that never seems to get old. But who wants to go pay 5 dollars every day and wait another 5 to 10 minutes to get it made for them? Haha, not many. My goal was to find a super cheap and easy way to make cold-brewed coffee that tasted just like Starbucks®, and boy did I hit the nail on the head for this one. Here is an easy, homemade way to remake your favorite drink for a price anyone can afford!
