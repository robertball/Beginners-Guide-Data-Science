Ingredients:
Oatmeal Crust:
2 cups quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
2 tablespoons vegetable shortening, melted
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
Pie Filling:
1 1/4 cups brown sugar
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 cup frozen whipped topping (such as Cool WhipÂ®), or more to taste, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch pie plate.
Mix oats, confectioners' sugar, butter, shortening, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl until the dry ingredients are entirely moistened; press evenly into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pie plate.
Bake in the preheated oven until beginning to brown, about 20 minutes. Cool for at least 10 minutes.
Beat brown sugar, cream cheese, pumpkin puree, white sugar, and pumpkin pie spice together with a mixer until smooth. Fold whipped topping into the pumpkin mixture until smooth; pour into the pie crust.
Refrigerate pie until filling is set, at least 4 hours.
