Ingredients:
3 pounds catfish fillets
2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning (such as Tex JoyÂ® All Purpose), or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 (16 ounce) package saltine crackers, crumbled
1 (2.45 ounce) package sliced almonds
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups milk
1 teaspoon pressed garlic
1 quart peanut oil, for frying

Directions:
Season catfish with Cajun seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Refrigerate fillets 1 to 3 hours.
Mix saltine crackers and almonds in a large, wide bowl. Stir milk, beaten eggs, and garlic together in a separate bowl.
Soak the catfish fillets in the milk mixture for 5 to 10 minutes.
Heat peanut oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Gently press the catfish fillets into the cracker mixture to coat completely; shake to remove any loose breading.
Fry fillets in hot peanut oil until cooked through and floats atop the oil, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
One of my favorite fried-catfish recipes when having a fish fry. This is not too spicy and is usually a crowd favorite.  Adapted from one of one of my old working buddies in the late 70s. Serve with french fries or onion rings.
