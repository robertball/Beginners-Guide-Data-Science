Description: 
I would love to try this as stated with the balsamic and asiago, but we opted for red wine vinegar and ricotta insalata cheese (texture of feta, but not as salty)   We also don't like dried parsley so we used basil instead.  Very easy to make, pretty salad.    I sliced the cold cuts into thin strips.  Very pretty and tasty.Modified from: Antipasto Pasta Salad
