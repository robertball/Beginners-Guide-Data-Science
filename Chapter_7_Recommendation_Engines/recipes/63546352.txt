Ingredients:
3 cups old fashioned rolled oats (Gluten Free Bob's Red Mill)
1/4 cup honey
1 tbsp coconut oil, melted
1 tsp vanilla (*optional)
3/4 tsp cinnamon (*optional)
1/2 cup coconut flakes, unsweetened (*optional - if using reduce oatmeal by 1/2 cup)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Spread oats & coconut flakes (if using) evenly onto a rimmed cookie sheet and toast in oven for 16 minutes. 1/2 way through toasting, stir the oats and rotate the cookie sheet.
In a medium bowl mix the melted oil and honey and vanilla and cinnamon if using, until well combined. When oats are done toasting, pour them into the honey and stir until oats are coated.
Place a silicon liner onto the cookie sheet (or wax paper - silicon works best)then spread the coated oats evenly onto the cookie sheet.
Return pan to oven and toast for another 8 - 15 minutes, watching them very closely after the 8 minute mark. (if they become too dark, once they cool the are beyond crunchy and can tire your jaw)
When done baking, loosen the cooked oats by stirring them with a spatula then remove the oats (on the liner) and place them on a wire rack to cool.
