Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent roll dough
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
6 jalapeno peppers, halved and seeded
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste
6 smoked jalapeno sausages, halved

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Unwrap crescent dough and separate into 12 triangles onto a clean work surface. Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons cream cheese into each jalapeno half and press a sausage half into the mixture. Place stuffed jalapenos on top of the crescent triangles and sprinkle with 1 to 2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese. Wrap stuffed jalapeno with crescent dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until dough has puffed up and is lightly browned, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This blends the best of two worlds. Jalapeno poppers and pigs in a blanket. They aren't the traditional small size appetizers, so they're perfect for a satisfying snack. These get double jalapeno flavor with jalapeno-smoked sausage. If you want an even fancier presentation, use puff pastry.
