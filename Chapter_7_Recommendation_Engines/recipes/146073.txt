Ingredients:
2 cups plain yogurt
1 egg, beaten
1/3 cup molasses
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup wheat germ
1 cup quick cooking oats
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups.
Beat together the yogurt, egg, molasses, raisins, wheat germ, oats, and butter in a large bowl until evenly mixed. Sift the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt on top of the molasses mixture. Fold the flour mixture into the molasses until a batter has formed. Pour batter into muffin cups, filling to the top.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
