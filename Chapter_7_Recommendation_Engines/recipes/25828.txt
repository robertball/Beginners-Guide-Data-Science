Ingredients:
6 eggs
3/4 cup evaporated milk
1 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
6 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, beat the eggs, evaporated milk, oil and vanilla until well blended. Mix in the sugar and baking powder. Stir in the flour 1 cup at a time until the dough becomes too stiff to stir. Turn out onto a clean surface and knead in as much of the remaining flour as possible. Dough should be smooth and not sticky. Keep the dough covered with a towel while pinching off tablespoon sized pieces of dough and rolling them into small ropes 6 inches long and 1/4 inch in diameter. Tie ropes into loose knots and place them 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. The cookies will almost triple in size while baking.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until light brown on the bottom. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks. When cool, glaze with a mixture of confectioners' sugar and water, if desired.

Description: 
This is a family heirloom recipe from my grandmother. We had to stand by her to come up with measurements because she used a hand of this or a container of that. She called them oil cookies because most of the recipes had lard in them and this one used oil instead. This is a recipe that is called for on every cookie tray at holidays or gatherings. Brush cookies with a basic powder sugar and water icing and while wet, sprinkle colored jimmies to match the occasion. Let dry completely before storing. These cookies freeze great UNFROSTED.
