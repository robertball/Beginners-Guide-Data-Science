Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup diced celery
1 cup sliced carrots
2/3 cup diced onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups vegetable broth
1 3/4 cups jarred marinara sauce
1/4 cup tomato paste
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 cups small shell pasta
2 cups quartered and sliced zucchini
1 (14.5 ounce) can great northern beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup stemmed and thinly sliced kale
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add celery, carrots, and onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until onion begins to turn translucent, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add vegetable broth, marinara sauce, tomato paste, and Italian seasoning. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until carrots are soft, about 10 minutes.
Add pasta and zucchini. Cook until pasta is tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in beans, kale, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat and allow soup to cool slightly. Spoon into individual bowls and garnish with Parmesan cheese.
