2 (6 ounce) fillets swordfish fillets
1/4 cup melted butter
2 tablespoons Creole seasoning

Directions:
Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Place melted butter in a shallow bowl. Dip fish into the butter and place on a plate. Sprinkle Creole seasoning on top of the fillets and pat it in.
Place fish in the hot skillet and cook until just starting to blacken, but not burn, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until blackened on the other side, about 2 minutes more.
