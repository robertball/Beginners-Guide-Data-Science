Ingredients:
1 head broccoli, cut into florets
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 pinches salt to taste
½ (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
6  anchovy fillets in olive oil, drained
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Toss broccoli in a bowl with 1 tablespoon olive oil and salt; spread on a large baking sheet.
Broil in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and beginning to brown, 5 to 10 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Add anchovies, garlic, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until anchovies dissolve into the oil, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with pepper. Mix in roasted broccoli.
Drain pasta and return to the pot. Add broccoli-anchovy mixture and mix well. Drizzle remaining olive oil on top.

Description: 
An Italian classic. Sweet, salty, and spicy flavors combine in this unique and tasty pasta and broccoli dish. This dish benefits from being richly coated in olive oil. Serve with a fresh, absorbent slice of focaccia to mop up the sauce.
