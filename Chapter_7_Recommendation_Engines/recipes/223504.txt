Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
4 cups chicken stock
1 (9 ounce) package frozen artichoke hearts, thawed
1 cup fresh pearl onions, peeled
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 ounces soft goat cheese, sliced into 4 pieces
2 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook chicken breast halves until browned on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Pour in chicken stock, artichoke hearts, pearl onions, thyme, salt, and black pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until stock is reduced and onions and artichokes are tender, about 45 minutes; turn chicken breasts over in the skillet after 20 minutes.
Place a goat cheese slice on each chicken breast; cover skillet and let goat cheese melt. Place chicken breasts onto a serving platter. Spoon about 3 tablespoons liquid from skillet into a small bowl and whisk in cornstarch until smooth; stir cornstarch mixture into skillet and cook until sauce has thickened, about 1 minute. Serve pan sauce with chicken breasts.
