Ingredients:
3 tablespoons canola oil
4 Chinese eggplants, halved lengthwise and cut into 1 inch half moons
1 cup water
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes
3 tablespoons garlic powder
5 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons light soy sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce

Directions:
Heat the canola oil in a skillet over high heat. Cook and stir the eggplant until soft, about 4 minutes. Stir in the water, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder. Cover and simmer until all the water is absorbed. Meanwhile, mix sugar, cornstarch, soy sauce, and oyster sauce in a bowl until sugar and cornstarch have dissolved. Stir sauce into the eggplant, making sure to evenly coat the eggplant. Cook until the sauce has thickened.
