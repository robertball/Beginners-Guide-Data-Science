Ingredients:
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon tamari
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
6 tablespoons barley flour
1/4 cup water
1 cup mung bean sprouts
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon sesame oil
ground cayenne pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together ginger, tamari, sea salt, barley flour, and water. Stir in mung bean sprouts, coating the sprouts with the batter. You may want to break some sprouts into smaller pieces before adding to the batter.
Heat vegetable oil and sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, and pour in batter to make one 6 inch pancake. Cook for about 4 minutes on each side. Serve hot or cool. Sprinkle cayenne pepper or more soy sauce over the cooked pancake if you like!

Description: 
This is a savory pancake. Make it with plenty of mung bean sprouts! Unlike other bean sprouts, mung sprouts are eaten cooked in Japan. They are economical and nutritious! I created this recipe for my wheat-free diet, but if you like go ahead and use wheat flour for barley flour. It tastes like good old Japan to me!!
