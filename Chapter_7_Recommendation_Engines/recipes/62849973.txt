Ingredients:
16 ounces softened cream cheese
1 can sweetened condensed milk (or unsweetened + 1/3 cup sugar)
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup sour cream
2 and 1/4 cup crushed chocolate graham crackers
1/4 cup of melted butter
1 box Nilla Waffers
1/2 cup chilled coffee
Whipped Creme, Shaved Chocolate, Toffee Bits, Cocoa Powder, or Raspberries for topping.

Directions:
Line a 9"x13" cake pan with foil, making sure to cover the sides and leaving several inches of foil on each end.
Mix graham crackers and butter until moist and pat down into the cake pan.
Bake crust at 325 degrees for 12 minutes. Once done remove and let cool.
Meanwhile, with an electric mixer, beat cream cheese until fluffy.
Add in the sweetened condensed milk and beat until combined.
Then add the lemon juice and sour cream and blend.
Place mixture in refrigerator to chill for 20 minutes.
While cream cheese mixture is chilling, dip each nilla waffer in the chilled coffee for just a few seconds and arrange them on the crust leaving 1/2 inch between each one (they will swell.)
Spoon 1/3 of the cream cheese mixture gently over the crust and nilla waffers. Spread with a spatula.
Repeat two more times or until cream cheese mixture is gone.
Place in Refrigerator to chill for 2 1/2 - 3 hours or until center no longer jiggles when you shake the pan.
Once chilled lift cake out of pan using the excess foil and place on a flat surface.
Sprinkle entire cake with shaved chocolate or cocoa powder. Cut individual servings and and top off each piece with whipped creme and raspberries or toffee bits.
