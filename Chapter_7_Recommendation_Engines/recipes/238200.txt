Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup quinoa
2 cups broccoli florets
1 cup fresh parsley
1/4 cup walnuts
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
1 cup diced tomato
1 cup diced baby cucumber
1/4 cup sliced leeks
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese, or more to taste
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover the saucepan, and steam until broccoli is tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
Puree parsley, walnuts, and olive oil together in a blender or food processor until sauce is smooth.
Stir quinoa, broccoli, tomato, cucumber, and leeks together in a large bowl. Pour parsley sauce over quinoa mixture and toss to coat completely. Sprinkle blue cheese over the top and season with sea salt.

Description: 
A seriously amazing and fresh salad; the epitome of healthy and nutrition-packed. I served this over fresh baby kale with balsamic dressing on the side for those that want a more robust flavor. This is amazing with the addition of garlic! Serve cold or at room temperature.
