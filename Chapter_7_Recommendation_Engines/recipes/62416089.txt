Hanky Panks Recipe

Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground sausage (mild or hot)
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 cup Cheese Wiz
1 package cocktail rye bread
Spray butter (optional)

Directions:
Brown the beef and sausage together in a pan.  Drain excess grease to cut down on the fat.
Sprinkle in the oregano and stir to incorporate.
With the stovetop set to medium-low, stir in the cheese until everything comes together as a gooey mixture.
While browning the meat, place the cocktail rye breads on cookie sheets in a single layer.  If desired, spray with a little bit of butter or butter substitute spray.
Place under the broiler of your oven just until lightly browned.
Once browned, spoon some of the mixture onto each piece of bread.  If you mound the mixture up, you may not use all of the rye breads.  It's up to you if you stretch it or not.
Place back under the broiler for just a minute or two to lightly brown the tops and warm the two items together.
Serve warm and enjoy!
