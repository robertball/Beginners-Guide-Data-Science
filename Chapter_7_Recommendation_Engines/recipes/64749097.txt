Ingredients:
28oz tomato sauce
1/2c brown sugar
1/2c apple cider vinegar
1t onion powder
1t garlic powder
1/2t cayenne pepper, McCormick*
1/4c worcestershire sauce
4t cornstarch
1T water
2t liquid smoke
*McCormick is worth the higher cost.  Storebrand doesn't compare.

Directions:
Stir ingredients together in a 3qt pot.  Over medium heat, bring to a boil.  Reduce heat & simmer 15 minutes or more, stirring occasionally.  Combine cornstarch & water.  Add a small amount, about 2 - 3T, of barbecue sauce to mixture.  Return blend to pot & constantly stir to thicken, a minute or two.  Gently stir in liquid smoke.  You're all set!
DSRTDOMME ...  https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/713829/ ...  For a more mild sauce, try increasing water/chicken broth to 1 1/2c & cornstarch to 2-3T.  Accordingly, add more sauce to it before returning to the pot.   I'll play with some I already have made & get back to you.  :)

Description: 
'Had a hard time finding recipes without ketchup.  I don't mind ketchup as ketchup, but I do as an ingredient -  so I played & made my own.  If using as a condiment, you may want to lessen the cayenne; a bit spicy on its own.   When mixed in with meat, it is darn good barbecue!  :D
