Ingredients:
1 cup seedless green grapes
1 cup seedless red grapes
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Remove grapes from stems and place in a colander. Wash thoroughly.
Place grapes in a gallon-size resealable bag.
Pour sugar into the bag and seal. Gently shake the bag to evenly coat grapes with sugar.
Arrange grapes on a paper towel to air-dry any remaining water, about 15 minutes.
Place grapes in a single layer on a shallow pan or baking sheet. Freeze for at least 2 hours.

Description: 
These grapes were served to me after a massage at my local spa. This recipe is perfect as an after-school snack, a simple appetizer at parties, or a sweet treat before bed. Substitute SplendaÂ® for the sugar if you like! Can be kept in a sealed bag in the freezer for several months.
