4 large potatoes, peeled and diced
8 cups water
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
16 ounces heavy cream
1/2 cup sour cream
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon onion salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt to taste
freshly ground pepper, to taste

Directions:
Place the potatoes and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 1 hour, or until potatoes are very soft.
Mix the evaporated milk, heavy cream, sour cream, butter, onion salt, garlic powder, salt and pepper with the potatoes. Simmer 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until liquid has reduced by 1/3.
Scoop out and drain 1 to 2 cups of the mixture and thoroughly mash with a potato masher. Return to mixture. Garnish and serve.

Description: 
This is a hearty potato soup that tastes like a creamy baked potato. I invented it to please a picky vegetarian daughter who pronounced it 'delicious'. Garnish with chives, shredded cheese or dried dill. Serve with a bread (flour tortillas, pita bread, sourdough or cornbread) and a salad or fruit.
