Ingredients:
1/2 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)
1/4 cup creme fraiche
1 1/2 teaspoons amaretto liqueur
1/2 cup heavy cream
4 chocolate wafer cookies, or to taste

Directions:
Combine chocolate-hazelnut spread and creme fraiche in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add amaretto and blend until just incorporated.
Beat the heavy cream in a separate chilled glass or metal bowl until firm peaks begin to form. Fold the whipped cream into the chocolate-hazelnut mixture with a rubber spatula until you can no longer see the cream.
Spoon the mousse into 4 parfait glasses. Refrigerate until set, about 20 minutes. Serve with chocolate wafer cookies.
