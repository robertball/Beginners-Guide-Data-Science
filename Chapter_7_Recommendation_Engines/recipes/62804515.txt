Description: 
I cook a big batch of this sauce and keep in the freezer for when I need to pull together a quick dinner party or supper for my family. Just reheat and add a combination of shrimp, sausage or chicken and serve over hot rice. Add in a combination of the optional ingredients to make it your own. You will have a meal fit for company.
