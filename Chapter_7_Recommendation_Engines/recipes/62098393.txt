Loaded Mashed Potatoes Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 - 4 lbs. potatoes, peeled and chunked
1 stick butter or margarine
16 oz. sour cream
8 oz. shredded cheddar cheese
4 - 6 strips bacon, cooked and crumbled (Bacon bits can also be used to save time.)
1/2 c. fresh chives, chopped (optional)
salt & pepper, to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a pot of lightly salted water and boil for approximately 30 minutes or until tender.  While the potatoes are cooking, prepare bacon in either frying pan or microwave, cool and crumble.  Also, chop the chives if you've decided to use them.
When potatoes are finished, drain them and place them back into the pot.  Add the butter and begin to mash using either a hand-masher or an electric mixer.  Next, add the sour cream.  When potatoes have reached a desired consistency (there most likely will be some lumps in this recipe due to all the ingredients), add the cheddar cheese, bacon and chives and mix until everything is incorporated.  Season with additional salt and pepper, if desired.
Serve and enjoy!
