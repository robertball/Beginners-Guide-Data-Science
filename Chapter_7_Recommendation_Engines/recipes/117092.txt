Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon pepper
3/4 pound beef flank steak
1 (5 ounce) package spring mix salad greens
1 plum tomato, cut into wedges
1/4 cup sliced radishes
1/4 cup chopped celery
2 green onions, cut into 1-inch strips

Directions:
In a bowl, whisk the first six ingredients. Pour 1/3 cup into a large resealable plastic bag; add steak. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 3 hours. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade for dressing.
Drain and discard marinade from steak. Grill, covered, over indirect medium heat for 11-12 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Cut across the grain into thin slices.
In a large serving bowl, combine the greens, tomato, radishes, celery, onions and beef. Drizzle with reserved marinade and toss to coat.
