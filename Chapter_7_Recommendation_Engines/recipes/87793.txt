Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root
1 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 lemon, juiced
water

Directions:
Into an empty 2-liter soda bottle, put the ginger root, sugar, yeast, and lemon juice. Fill the rest of the way with water. Screw the cap onto the bottle as tight  as possible. Shake the bottle well, then leave at room temperature until the bottle is too hard to squeeze, about 2 days. Refrigerate. To serve, pour through a tea strainer.

A fun way to make a family favorite. It tastes a little different than the commercial stuff, but it is much better. Above all things, have fun and feel free to experiment! Try adding fruit extract, if you like.
