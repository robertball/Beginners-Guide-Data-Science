Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups oats
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix oats, flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Fold in butter. Mix in milk until dough comes together in a ball.
Divide dough into thirds. Roll out very thinly on a floured surface using a Swedish or notched rolling pin. Cut into 2-inch pieces and place on a baking sheet.
Bake crackers until tops are just very slightly golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
This is a delicious and yummy cracker passed down from my Swedish grandmother. It is a great and economical alternative to store-bought crackers and processed snacks. Big hit with kids, and a great way to sneak some healthier snacks into their everyday diet. Fast, easy, and great results!
