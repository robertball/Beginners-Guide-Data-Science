Ingredients:
2 racks of baby ribs, silver skin removed
3 cups of BBQ sauce, or more. I use  Presidents Choice Beer and Chipotle

Directions:
Add enough BBQ sauce to cover the bottom of your pan.
Cut ribs into 3-4 bone portions
Place ribs, bone side up, in pan and cover with sauce.
Flip the ribs, meat side up and cover with sauce.
Cover with plastic wrap and marinate, in fridge, for 24 hours.
Remove from fridge one hour before you plan to cook them.
Preheat oven to 375.
Cover with foil and bake for one hour.
Decrease temp to 325 and bake for another hour.
Remove from oven.
Cover cookie sheet with foil.
Place ribs on cookie sheet and spoon some sauce on ribs. Not enough to flood the foil.
Bake for an additional 20 mins.
Pour left over sauce in pot and simmer to thicken.
