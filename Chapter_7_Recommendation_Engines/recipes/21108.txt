Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Grind oatmeal in a food processor or blender. In a large bowl, combine oatmeal, flour, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, dissolve honey in vegetable oil then stir in the milk. Combine both mixtures and stir until a soft dough is formed. Form the dough into a ball and place on a lightly oiled baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until bottom of loaf sounds hollow when tapped.

Description: 
There's no yeast in this bread, so it's good for special diets. You may also use soy milk instead of regular milk if you wish. It's pretty dense, but great when fresh from the oven. Especially with butter and honey on cold mornings!
