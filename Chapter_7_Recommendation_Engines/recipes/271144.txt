Ingredients:
4 large eggs
1 cup whole milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons margarine
2 medium ripe bananas, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 cup sliced fresh strawberries, or more to taste
1 cup blueberries, or more to taste
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a 10-inch ovenproof skillet in the oven to heat up.
Combine eggs, milk, flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a blender; blend until batter is very smooth.
Remove hot skillet from the oven. Add margarine and swirl until melted. Pour batter into the hot skillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until puffy and golden, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, toss bananas, strawberries, blueberries, 1 tablespoon sugar, and lemon juice together in a bowl. Spoon compote onto hot pancake and top with a dollop of frozen whipped topping. Cut into wedges and serve immediately.
