Ingredients:
2 tablespoons active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
10 tablespoons sugar
2 cups warm sour cream (110 to 115 degrees F)
2 eggs, lightly beaten
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
7 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add 2 tablespoons sugar; let stand for 5 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine the sour cream, eggs, butter, salt and remaining sugar. Stir in baking powder, yeast mixture and 4 cups of flour until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Roll each portion into a 23-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Cut into 1-1/2-in. strips. Stack five strips together; cut into 1-1/2-in. pieces and place cut side up in a greased muffin cup. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 20 minutes.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks.

Description: 
I received this recipe from an E-mail pen pal in Canada. The dough is so easy to work with, and it makes the lightest yeast rolls. I haven't used another white bread recipe since I started making this one. -Carrie Ormsby, West Jordan, Utah
