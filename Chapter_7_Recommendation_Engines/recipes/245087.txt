Ingredients:
2 pounds beef skirt steak - cut across the grain into 1/4-inch strips and 2-inch pieces
2 1/2 cups Swanson® Beef Broth, divided
1 (1.4 ounce) package dry fajita seasoning
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1 (32 ounce) package frozen French fries
4 tablespoons butter
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 onion, sliced into thin strips
1 green or red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
8 ounces cheese curds
Chopped cilantro (optional)
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped (optional)

Directions:
Place beef pieces in a large resealable bag. Whisk 1/2 cup Swanson(R) Beef Broth, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and fajita seasoning mix together in small bowl until mix dissolves; pour over beef. Seal bag and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Arrange French fries in a single layer on a baking sheet; bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes (or according to package directions).
While fries are baking, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and stir until smooth, about 2 minutes. Whisk in remaining 2 cups Swanson(R) Beef Broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and saute 2 minutes or until soft. Add bell pepper and saute an additional 3 minutes.
Drain marinade from beef and discard. Add beef to skillet with vegetables. Saute to desired doneness, about 5 minutes.
Place fries on a serving platter. Cover fries with beef mixture and cheese curds. Top with gravy and garnish with cilantro and chopped jalapenos.
