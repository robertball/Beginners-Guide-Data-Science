Ingredients:
1 package of baby spinach (~10oz - 16oz)
1/2 pound of orzo
1 package of cherry or grape tomatoes (~10 oz)
Zest of 1 lemon
1/4 Cup of olive oil (extra virgin)
Salt

Directions:
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
Cooked orzo until al dente.
While orzo cooks, wash and dry spinach well & add to a large salad bowl.
Halve the tomatoes and add to spinach.
Zest the lemon over the spinach & tomatoes.
Sprinkle spinach and tomatoes with a little salt.
Drain orzo and add it immediately to the spinach while it’s hot. The warmth wilts the spinach slightly and releases the lemon zest aromatics.
Drizzle with olive oil and toss.
