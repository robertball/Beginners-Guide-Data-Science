*SIMPLE* "15" Bean Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups of raw beans of choice (I use prepackaged 14-bean soup mix)
2 cups of water
1 pinch of basil
1 pinch of rosemary
1 pinch of pepper
2 pinches of chili powder
4 cups of chicken broth (or vegetable broth for vegetarians)
3-4 cups of water, or as needed for desired consistency
1 large carrot or 2 normal carrots
3 stalks of celery
1 small onion or 1/2 of a large onion

Directions:
Allow beans to soak in 2 cups of warm water in a spacious pot for around 25 minutes.
Bring the soaking water and beans to a boil for 5 minutes, then remove the pot from heat and cover.
Let the beans sit for 1 hour, or until the water is warm, but not scorching.
Add 1 cup of water and 1 cup of broth to the beans and bring back to a boil. Add in spices of choice. Omit chili powder at your own risk!
Once a rapid boil is achieved, lower heat to medium-low. The soup should remain boiling.
While the beans cook, chop up the carrots, celery, and onion. I like to chop the carrots the long way first, then across. I do the same with the celery if the stalks are big enough.
Once the beans have absorbed most of the liquid, add in 1-2 cups of water and the carrots and onion.
When the soup is thickening again, add 1 more cup of water and the celery. Let this simmer for a while.
At the very end, add the remaining 2 cups of chicken broth and stir. Set the burner very low and cover until your personal desired thickness is reached. If the soup is too watery, add 2-3 tablespoons of flour.
