Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour for coating
2 teaspoons salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
4 pounds beef short ribs
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup water
1 cup stewed tomatoes
1 clove garlic, minced
6 potatoes, peeled and cubed
3 onions, chopped
6 carrots, chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 tablespoons water

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the 1/2 cup flour, salt and ground black pepper. Roll the ribs in the seasoned flour.
In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil and brown the ribs well on all sides. Pour in 1 cup boiling water, tomatoes, and garlic. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, adding more water if necessary.
Place the potatoes, onions, and carrots in the pot. Continue to simmer for another 30 minutes to 1 hour, or until all vegetables are tender. Remove the meat and vegetables to a serving platter.
In a separate small bowl, dissolve 1 1/2 tablespoons flour and 2 tablespoons water for every one cup liquid remaining in the pot. Add this to the pot and stir well until thickened. Pour over meat and vegetables.
