Ingredients:
2 teaspoons rubbed sage
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 clove garlic, crushed
1 (5 pound) boneless pork loin
3/4 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
3/4 cup balsamic vinegar
3/4 cup water
6 tablespoons soy sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).(I used crock pot)*w*
In a bowl, combine sage, salt, pepper, and garlic. Rub thoroughly all over pork. Place pork in an uncovered roasting pan on the middle oven rack.
Bake in the preheated oven approximately 3 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), depending upon your desired doneness.
Meanwhile, place sugar, cornstarch, vinegar, water, and soy sauce in a small saucepan. Heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture begins to bubble and thicken slightly. Brush roast with glaze 3 or 4 times during the last 1/2 hour of cooking. Pour remaining glaze over roast, and serve.
