Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 pounds ground beef
1/2 cup diced onion
1 1/2 cups water
9 tablespoons taco seasoning mix
5 flour tortillas
1 (10 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
8 corn tortilla chips, or more to taste
1/4 cup diced tomatoes, or to taste (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped olives, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until almost browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until beef is browned and onion is softened, about 5 minutes more. Mix water and taco seasoning into beef mixture; simmer until water evaporates, about 5 minutes.
Line the prepared baking dish with tortillas and top with 1/2 of the ground beef mixture. Spoon 1/2 of the corn over the beef layer and top with 1/3 of the Cheddar cheese. Crush tortilla chips over cheese layer. Repeat layers with remaining ingredients, ending with Cheddar cheese, tomatoes, and olives.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great Mexican dish for our bigger family. Could be made ahead for potlucks too! This recipe I threw together with what I had on had one night that sounded good together! Could be done with chicken as alternative too. I served this with cooked spinach and put my portion of casserole over the spinach.
