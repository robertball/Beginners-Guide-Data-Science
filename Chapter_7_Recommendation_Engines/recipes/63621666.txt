Ingredients:
1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
3 tablespoons red raspberry jam
5 chocolate chips on each roll
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400*
Unfold the puff pastry sheets on a lightly floured surface.
Cut each one into thirds along the fold lines with a pizza cutter.
Roll each strip of dough out to about 16 inches long, and cut strips into thirds.
Spread about 1/2 teaspoon raspberry jam on the pastry.
Put 5 chocolate chips on top of jam.
Dab water on edges, roll over to enclose the filling. Press the edges firmly to seal. Repeat with the remaining rectangles.
Use a sharp knife to cut 3 slits across the top of each pastry, and place them on baking sheets lined with PARCHMENT PAPER, spacing 2 inches apart.
Bake for 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Cool on racks. Dust with confectioners' sugar when cooled if desired.
