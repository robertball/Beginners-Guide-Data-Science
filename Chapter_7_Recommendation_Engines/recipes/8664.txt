Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
50 cloves garlic, peeled
6  chicken legs, halved
½ cup chopped fresh parsley
½ cup chopped celery
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon ground white pepper
½ teaspoon ground allspice
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 ½ cups white wine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place olive oil in a heavy oven-safe Dutch oven which can be tightly covered. Add 1/3 of the chicken, garlic, parsley, celery leaves, tarragon, salt, white pepper, allspice, cinnamon and dry white wine. Mix. Repeat two more times.
Cover pot tightly and place in preheated oven, cook for about 1 1/4 hours. The chicken will not be brown, but moist and succulent. If desired, serve with crusty bread to mop up the sauce.

Description: 
Don't let the name of this fool you - it is elegant enough for dinner guests. I've made several slight revisions over the years. I prefer skinless, boneless chicken breasts for the health value, and I do a single layer in a 'bring to the table' shallow baking dish. Suggestion: Spread the soft garlic cloves on some crusty bread, like butter. The flavor is not overpowering!
