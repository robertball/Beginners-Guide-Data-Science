Ingredients:
1 cup beer
1 fluid ounce amaretto liqueur
1/4 fluid ounce 151 proof rum

Directions:
Fill a pint glass half full of beer.
Pour the amaretto into a standard shot glass. Carefully pour the 151 proof rum on top of the amaretto so that it floats.
Carefully light the shot on fire by touching with open flame. Drop the lit shot into the half full glass of beer and slam.

Description: 
This drink is actually considered a shooter, meaning don't hold back, guzzle it down. But be careful because of the 151, that is how it is able to catch on fire, hence the name.
