Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey, pork or beef
1 medium carrot, peeled and shredded
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and minced
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 cup SwansonÂ® Chinese Hot & Sour Flavor Infused Broth
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
1 tablespoon lime juice
8 large leaves Boston or Bibb lettuce
2 green onions, thinly sliced
1/4 cup chopped peanuts

Directions:
Cook the turkey in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat.  Pour off any fat.
Add the carrot, garlic, ginger and red pepper to the skillet and cook and stir for 1 minute.  Add 1/2 cup broth and heat to a boil.
Stir the remaining broth and the cornstarch in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth.  Add the cornstarch mixture to the skillet.  Cook and stir for 2 minutes or until the mixture boils and thickens.
Stir in the cilantro and lime juice just before serving.  Spoon about 1/4 cup turkey mixture into each lettuce leaf.  Sprinkle with the green onions and peanuts.
