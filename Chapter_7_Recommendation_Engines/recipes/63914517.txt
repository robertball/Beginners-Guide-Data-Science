Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup cornstarch
2/8 teaspoon salt
5-1/2 cups milk
4 tablespoons butter, room temperature
2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a saucepan, stir together sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt. Place over medium heat, and stir in milk. Bring to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon. Remove from heat, and stir in butter and vanilla. Let cool briefly, and serve warm, or chill in refrigerator until serving.
