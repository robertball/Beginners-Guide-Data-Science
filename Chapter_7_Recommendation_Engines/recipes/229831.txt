Ingredients:
1 cup bran cereal (such as Kellogg's® All Bran® Original)
1 cup mashed bananas
3/4 cup plain yogurt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped nuts and/or raisins
2 eggs
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup cooking oil

Directions:
Combine bran cereal, bananas and yogurt in a medium bowl. Let stand for a couple minutes to allow cereal to soften. Meanwhile, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nuts and/or raisins in a large bowl; set aside.
Stir eggs, sugar and oil into bran mixture, then add to dry ingredients; stir just until combined.
Spoon batter evenly into 12 greased or paper-lined muffin cups.
Bake in a preheated 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) until tops spring back when pressed, about 17 to 20 minutes. Let muffins cool in pan for a few minutes, then remove to a wire rack to finish cooling. Store in an airtight container.
