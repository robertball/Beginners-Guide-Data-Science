Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
salt-free herb seasoning to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 eggs, beaten
2 pounds veal cutlets
1/4 cup oil for frying

Directions:
In a shallow bowl, combine flour, herb seasoning, salt and pepper. In another bowl, place the beaten eggs. Coat each veal cutlet with the flour mixture, then dip into egg, then back into the flour mixture.
Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Place veal cutlets into hot oil, and cook until browned, about 10 minutes on each side.
