Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 cup milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Chill muffin cups in refrigerator while mixing batter.
Break eggs into bowl and beat well.  Add milk, flour and salt.  Beat with a wire whisk or spoon, disregarding lumps. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups, filling each cup three quarters full.
Place popovers in cold oven. Set oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Turn oven on and bake for 30 minutes, until golden and puffed. Serve immediately. If you must hold them, pierce, and keep warm in a 170 degree F (75 degrees C) oven.
