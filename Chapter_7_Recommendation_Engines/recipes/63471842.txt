Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts, ends trimmed and yellow leaves removed
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Juice of one lemon
2 Tbsp capers
1 tsp pureed anchovy paste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
Place trimmed Brussels sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal tightly, and shake to coat, set aside.
In a small sauce pan, combine capers, lemon juice and anchovy paste.  Heat on low until the anchovy paste is well mixed into the lemon juice and capers. Allow to cool.
Pour anchovy mixture into resealable bag along with Brussels sprouts.
Pour contents of resealable bag onto a baking sheet, and place on center oven rack.
Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, shaking pan every 5 to 7 minutes for even browning. Reduce heat when necessary to prevent burning. Brussels sprouts should be darkest brown, almost black, when done.
Adjust seasoning with kosher salt, if necessary. Serve immediately.
