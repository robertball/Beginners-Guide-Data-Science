Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 cup butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup hot water
1 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Separate the eggs and beat the egg whites until stiff, and set aside.  In a large bowl, cream the butter with the sugar.  Melt the chocolate in the hot water.  Beat in the egg yolks, then the melted chocolate, buttermilk, and vanilla.
In a bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt.  Beat into the chocolate mixture.  Stir in about 1/3 of the egg whites to lighten the batter and then fold in the rest gently but thoroughly.
Turn the batter into a greased and floured tube pan.  Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 1 hour, or until the cake tests done with a toothpick.  Let cool on a rack.  Makes 16 servings.
