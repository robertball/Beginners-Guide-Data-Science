4 boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 1 lb)
1/4 cup Gold Medal® all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon olive, canola or soybean oil
1/2 cup roasted garlic-seasoned chicken broth (from 14-oz can)
1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 jar (4.5 oz) Green Giant® sliced mushrooms, drained
Chopped fresh thyme, if desired

Between pieces of plastic wrap or waxed paper, place each chicken breast smooth side down; gently pound with flat side of meat mallet or rolling pin until 1/4 inch thick. In shallow dish, mix flour, salt and pepper.

In 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Coat both sides of chicken with flour mixture. Cook chicken in hot oil 6 to 8 minutes, turning once, until chicken is no longer pink in center. Remove chicken to serving plate; cover to keep warm.
