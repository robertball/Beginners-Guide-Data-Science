Ingredients:
2 pkgs. lemon jello
3-4 small chopped apples
15 oz. can crushed pineapple, drained
3/4 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans)
2 eggs
3/4 cup sugar
2 tbs. real lemon
8 oz. tub of cool whip OR 8 oz. carton of whipping cream

Directions:
Dissolve 2 packages lemon jello in 1 1/2 cups of hot water.  Add 2 cups of cold water and then add chopped apples, drained crushed pineapple and chopped nuts.  Pour into a 9x13 pan and refrigerate until set.  In a saucepan combine 2 beaten eggs, sugar, and real lemon.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the egg mixture coats a metal spoon with a thin film or reaches 160Â° F. Immediately place the saucepan in ice water and stir until the egg mixture is cool. Once cooled, fold in a softened tub of cool whip or whipping cream which you have already whipped.  Top the jello with the mixture and refrigerate.  Cut into squares to serve.
