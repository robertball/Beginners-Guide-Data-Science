Ingredients:
5 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons arrowroot flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon marjoram
2 cups almond milk
2 cups ricotta cheese
1 small butternut squash, peeled and cut into bite-sized cubes
1/2 large bag (12 oz) fresh kale
1 onion, peeled, quartered, and sliced
For Topping:
1/2 cup almond meal
1/2 cup nutritional yeast or 1/4 flax meal
5 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon marjoram
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
3 tablespoons shredded parmesan

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Melt 5 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan, and continue to cook just until it bubbles and begins to lightly brown.
Stir in arrowroot flour, then add salt, pepper, marjoram, and nutmeg.
Whisk in almond milk and cook just until it begins to boil.
Stir in ricotta cheese and remove from heat.
Lightly spray an 11x13 glass baking dish with olive or coconut oil.
Spread approximately 1/3 of white sauce into dish.
Layer butternut, kale, and onion, topping with another 1/3 of sauce.
Repeat layers, ending with remaining sauce.
Cover tightly with foil and bake for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine almond meal, nutritional yeast or flax meal, butter, marjoram, thyme, sea salt, and parmesan with a pastry cutter or fork.
Remove foil from baking dish, top with breadcrumb mixture, and bake an additional 5-10 minutes, or until dish is bubbling and top is browned (watch closely; nut meal burns easily).
