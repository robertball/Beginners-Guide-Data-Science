Ingredients:
2 (3/4 inch thick) bone-in pork chops
1 (4 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
4 ounces diced Swiss cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
3/4 cup bread crumbs
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup white Zinfandel wine, or as needed

Directions:
Lay pork chops flat onto your work surface. Use the tip of a sharp boning or paring knife to cut a pocket in each pork chop making a 2 inch slit in the side.
Mix mushrooms, Swiss cheese, parsley, garlic powder, black pepper, and salt in a bowl; stuff pork chops with mushroom mixture. Secure the open side with a toothpick.
Whisk eggs in a bowl; pour bread crumbs into a separate bowl. Dip the stuffed pork chops into the beaten egg; press pork chops into bread crumbs until completely coated.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; place pork chops, pocket side-down, into the hot oil. Cook until outside of pork chops is browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Pour in enough wine to come halfway up pork chops. Reduce heat to low, cover skillet, and simmer until pork chops are tender, about 2 hours. Check wine level occasionally and add more as needed. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This recipe was given to me by my friend Will who learned it from his mom and grandma. It's a very simple recipe for stuffed pork chops that end up moist, fork tender, and delicious! I made a few adjustments to his recipe, feel free to experiment and make this your own.
