Description: 
This is my favorite squash casserole. The recipe is  from a local restaurant who had the most wonderful squash casserole, different from any other I had had before.   There used to be several locations of this restaurant, now most have closed down.  The recipe was published in the local paper and for years was their most requested recipe for reprints.  Try it and you'll too see why it was so popular.
