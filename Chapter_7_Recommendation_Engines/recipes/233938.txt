Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon fish sauce
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®)
2 heads romaine lettuce
1/3 cup fresh mint leaves
1/3 cup fresh cilantro leaves
1/3 cup fresh Thai basil leaves

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Sprinkle pepper and salt onto flank steak.
Cook steak on preheated grill until desired doneness is reached, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
Whisk lime juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, fish sauce, garlic, and chile-garlic sauce together in a bowl.
Mix romaine lettuce, mint, cilantro, and basil together in a bowl; spoon about 6 tablespoons lime juice mixture over romaine mixture. Toss to coat.
Cut steak into strips and place strips into remaining lime juice mixture; let sit for steak to marinate, 1 to 2 minutes. Place steak on romaine mixture.
