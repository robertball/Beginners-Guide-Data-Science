Ingredients:
8 ounces of shredded swiss cheese
8 ounces of cream cheese, softened to room temperature
2/3 cup of Miracle Whip
1 (4.3 ounce)package of precooked bacon bits-or-1 pound bacon cooked crispy and crumbled
1 sleeve of Ritz crackers (4 ounces-1/4 package), crumbled.
3 green onions, sliced or chopped

Directions:
Combine the cheeses and the Miracle Whip, microwave for 2 minutes.
Add 3/4 of the bacon bits, 1/2 of the crumbled Ritz crackers and 1/2 of the chopped green onions. Mix well and microwave for 2 more minutes.
Sprinkle remaining cracker crumbs, bacon bits and green onions on top.
Serve with additional Ritz crackers, melba toasts, or assorted dipping vegetables. You may also add a tablespoon of chopped jalepeno for kick if desired. This recipe is a great base recipe.  I have also tasted it with chopped sundried tomatoes added.  Add what you like to make it your own. Enjoy!
