Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup oil
2 eggs
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp vanilla
3 cups flour
2 cups milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Combine brown sugar, white sugar, butter and oil until creamed. Add eggs, one at a time and vanilla.
Sift baking soda, salt, baking powder and flour into a small bowl. Mix a cup of flour in at a time until well mixed.
Add milk chocolate chips and stir in with a wooden spoon. The mixture will look crumbly, but that is how it is supposed to look.
Roll into a ball the size of a walnut and placed on a greased baking sheet (or one lined with parchment paper). Bake for 8-10 minutes.
These were probably the best homemade cookies I've ever eaten. Yes, they were that good.
The recipe should yield: 3 1/2-4 dozen, depending how much dough you eat before you cook them
