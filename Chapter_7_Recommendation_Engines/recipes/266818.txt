Ingredients:
2 tablespoons loose-leaf tea, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper (optional)
1 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Grind tea into a fine powder using a spice grinder. Mix in cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, salt, and pepper.
Beat butter, sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add the spiced tea mixture and mix thoroughly. Fold in flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a stiff dough forms.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and roll out to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut into 2-inch pieces with a cookie cutter or knife. Arrange cookies on baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to brown slightly, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
These cookies are based on a shortbread recipe, but spiced to taste like a chai tea latte. Don't try to make a substitution for the cardamom - it's essential to the chai taste. Masala chai varies widely by region, brand, and store, so you can play with the spices to get closer to your favorite chai.
