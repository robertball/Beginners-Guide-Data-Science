Ingredients:
8 ounces fresh bean sprouts, rinsed and drained
1 cup cooked small shrimp
8 eggs, beaten
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms
2 large green onions, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
ground white pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons cold water

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the bean sprouts, shrimp, eggs, mushrooms, scallions and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Mix thoroughly.
Heat a deep skillet over high heat until 1 or 2 drops of water bubble when sprinkled in. Add oil and turn heat back to Medium-High. Pour in 1/2 cup of egg mixture into pan. Push cooked egg up over shrimp with a spatula to form a patty. Fry until golden brown, turning once, about 4 minutes.
Repeat with remaining egg mixture. If you need to, add more oil.  Keep patties warm.
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine chicken broth, soy sauce, 1/4 teaspoon salt and white pepper to taste. Bring to a boil.  Mix cornstarch and water; stir into broth mix. Cook and stir until thickened (about 10 seconds).  Pour over patties.
