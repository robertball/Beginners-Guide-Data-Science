Ingredients:
10.50 oz cream of mushroom soup (1 can)
1 ½ cups milk
12 oz albacore tuna (1 large can)
2 zucchini, sliced
2 carrots, peeled and sliced
1 tbsp dried minced onions
1 tbsp Italian seasoning
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
½ tsp salt
½ tsp pepper
½ cup plain breadcrumbs
12 oz egg noodles (1 package), cooked and drained
16 oz shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Combine the cream of mushroom soup, milk, tuna, sliced zucchini, and sliced carrots in a large saucepan.
Season with the dried minced onion, Italian seasoning, Worcestershire, salt, and pepper.
Transfer the saucepan to the stovetop and cook over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes.
Place a handful of the cooked noodles in the bottom of your baking dish.
Top with several large spoonfuls of the veggie-tuna mixture.
Cover with a layer of shredded cheddar.
Repeat with another layer of noodles, veggie-tuna, and cheese.
Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the top and transfer to the oven.
Bake for 40 minutes. Then turn on the broiler and broil for about 2 minutes, watching closely so you don't burn it.
Let stand for about 15 minutes before serving.
Dig in and enjoy!
