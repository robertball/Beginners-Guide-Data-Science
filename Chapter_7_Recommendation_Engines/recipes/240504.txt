Ingredients:
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 tablespoon balsamic syrup
Â¼ teaspoon garlic powder
2 pinches cayenne pepper
1 pinch ground white pepper
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch ground dried chipotle pepper
3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Whisk maple syrup, balsamic syrup, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, white pepper, nutmeg, and chipotle pepper together in a small bowl until rub is smooth. Coat chicken on all sides with rub.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
