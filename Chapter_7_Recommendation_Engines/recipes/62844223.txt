Ingredients:
8 ears of corn, husked
1 tablespoon butter
Salt
Cayenne pepper
Half a lime

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place a box grater on a medium cast-iron pan, and finely grate each ear of corn directly into the pan. Discard the cobs.
Spread the milky corn evenly across the pan, and bake until the edges and top are golden brown and the corn milk has thickened, 20 to 30 minutes.
Remove from heat, and transfer corn and any liquid to a bowl. Add butter, and season to taste with salt, cayenne pepper, and a squeeze of lime juice. Mix well.

Description: 
“The sweetness of the corn caramelizes it,” she said. “I made it for Jean-Georges, and he loved it, and every year, we put it on the menu at Jo-Jo’s and the Mercer in Manhattan, and at my own restaurant, Cucina in Woodstock.”
