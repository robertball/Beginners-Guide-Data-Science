Ingredients:
1 (40 ounce) can cut sweet potatoes, undrained
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 2 quart baking dish.
Place the sweet potatoes and their liquid in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cook 15 minutes, or until tender. Remove from heat, drain, and mash.
In a medium bowl, mix the mashed sweet potatoes, white sugar, eggs, 1/3 cup butter, milk, and vanilla extract. Spread evenly into the prepared baking dish.
In a separate bowl, mix the brown sugar, chopped pecans, flour, and 1/3 cup melted butter. Sprinkle over the sweet potato mixture.
Bake 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
