Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup corn syrup
1/2 cup salted macadamia nuts, chopped in half
1/2 cup pecans, chopped
1 teaspoon coconut oil
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1/2 cup dried blueberries
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Butter a 10x15-inch baking pan.
Combine sugar and corn syrup in a saucepan with a candy thermometer clipped on. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Heat to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C); add macadamia nuts, pecans, coconut oil, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cook and stir until candy mixture reaches 300 degrees F (148 degrees C); remove from heat.
Stir blueberries, baking soda, and vanilla extract quickly into the candy mixture until combined. Pour all of the candy immediately onto the prepared pan. Spread evenly. Cool completely, about 15 minutes, before breaking into pieces.
