Ingredients:
2 celeriac (celery roots), peeled and sliced 1/3- inch thick
2 eggs
1 pinch seasoned salt, to taste
4 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook celery root slices until lightly softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels.
Beat eggs and seasoned salt in a shallow bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a second bowl. Dredge celery root slices in egg, then dip in bread crumbs.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and pan-fry celery slices on both sides until browned, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
I often just pan-fry celery root cause it's much faster than just boiling it, though for the sake of time I parboil it for a few minutes. I often make it as a vegetarian main and serve it with different salads.
