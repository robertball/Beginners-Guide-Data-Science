Ingredients:
1 Can or bottle of beer
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup of bread crumbs
Worcestershire sauce
Mccormick's hamburger seasoning
4 Slices cheddar cheese
4 Hamburger buns
Choice of burger toppings
*Many people suggest using dark beer for marinades, personally I have used whatever is on hand such as Miller Lite and Labatt Blue and it always turns out just fine*

Directions:
1) Form ground beef and bread crumbs into 4 equal size patties.
2) Pour beer over burgers to marinate and place in refrigerator for 30 minutes- 1 hour.
3) Remove burgers from marinade carefully and lightly dab off remaining beer with paper towel.
4)Dash worcestershire sauce lightly on each side of patty, and season each side with hamburger seasoning to taste.
5) Place burgers on a grill preheated to medium heat.
6) Just before burgers are done cooking to desired temp, place cheese on burgers.
7) Remove burgers from heat and serve on buns with your favorite toppings.
*I would avoid marinating for too long as the beer can make the beef crumble, with my experience the bread crumbs make this less of a problem.*
