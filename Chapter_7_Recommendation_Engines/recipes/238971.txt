Description: 
This is a recipe that I came up with by combining things that like to taste in my rice. The cilantro really kicks up the taste for me. I will add stir fried shrimp and/or chicken if I want to just make the rice the whole meal. If you are using mea, stir-fry it first and sit it to the side.
