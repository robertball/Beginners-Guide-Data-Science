Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) boneless beef chuck shoulder pot roast or bottom round rump roast
1 (.7 ounce) package Italian dressing mix
2 large onions, each cut into 8 wedges
2 cloves garlic, peeled
2 red bell peppers, cut into 1-1/2 inch pieces
1/2 cup ready-to-serve beef broth
2 zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices
2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons water
Salt and pepper

Directions:
Press dressing mix evenly onto all surfaces of beef pot roast. Place onions and garlic in 4-1/2 to 5-1/2-quart slow cooker; top with pot roast. Add bell peppers and broth. Cover and cook on HIGH 5 hours, or on LOW 8 hours. Add zucchini. Continue cooking, covered, 30 minutes or until pot roast is fork-tender.
Remove pot roast and vegetables. Strain cooking liquid; skim fat. Combine 2 cups cooking liquid and cornstarch mixture in medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; cook and stir 1 minute or until thickened.
Carve pot roast into slices; season with salt and pepper, as desired. Serve with vegetables and gravy.
