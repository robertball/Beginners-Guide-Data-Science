Ingredients:
3 cups chicken broth
1 carrot, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 onion, chopped
3 potatoes, cubed
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 pound bay scallops
2 tablespoons margarine
1/2 cup white wine
1 egg yolk
1 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
In a large pot over high heat, combine the chicken broth, carrot, celery, onion, potatoes, thyme, parsley, salt and ground black pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer mixture to a food processor or blender, puree until smooth and set aside.
In the same pot over medium heat, saute the mushrooms and scallops in the butter or margarine for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine and reserved puree mixture to the pot, reduce heat to low and allow to simmer.
In a separate small bowl, combine the egg yolk and heavy cream. Mix well and add to the soup. Continue simmering over low heat, stirring occasionally for 10 to 15 minutes.
