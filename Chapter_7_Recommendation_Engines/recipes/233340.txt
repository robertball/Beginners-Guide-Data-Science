Ingredients:
3 pounds pork spareribs
1 onion, diced
1 cup ketchup
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/4 cup vinegar
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange spareribs in a large, lidded roasting pan.
Mix onion, ketchup, water, celery, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, Dijon mustard, and salt in a bowl; pour mixture over spareribs. Cover.
Bake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until pork is tender and sauce is thickened, about 30 minutes more.

Description: 
These ribs are wonderful because when they are ready, the meat is just about falling off the bone. The sauce is wonderfully tangy as well! It's also so quick and easy.
