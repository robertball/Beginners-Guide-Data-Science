Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups unbleached flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 pound salted butter at room temperature
2 cups coconut sugar
1 tablespoon unsulphured organic molasses
1 cup crunchy roasted peanut butter
2  extra large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup salted roasted peanuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Chop peanuts in food processor and put aside.
Sift dry ingredients into a mixing bowl.
In a large mixing bowl with electric mixer beat butter until creamy.
Add sugar and keep beating until fluffy.  Then beat in peanut butter, vanilla, and molasses until fully incorporated, scraping down bowl as necessary.  Then add in eggs and beat in one at a time.
Scrape down bowl and gently mix in dry ingredients with a wooden spoon. Still using the spoon mix in peanuts.  Roll dough into balls and place onto cookie sheet with space between to spread while cooking.  With a fork dipped in ice water gently press cookie down  twice to make a criss cross imprint.  Repeat that process for each cookie.  Cooking time will depend on the size of your cookies.  For large cookies bake about 15 -16 minutes or until edges become golden.
