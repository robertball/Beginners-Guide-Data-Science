Description: 
This is an excellent slow-cooker recipe which is very simple to prepare and easy to adjust with different add-ins and garnishes. Add 2 cups of diced cooked vegetables (peas, corn, carrots, beans, broccoli, etc.) and a chopped smoked sausage after the soup is pureed, or  garnish the soup with a little sour cream, cooked, crumbled bacon, grated cheddar cheese, or chopped chives.Modified from: Slow Cooker Cream of Potato Soup
