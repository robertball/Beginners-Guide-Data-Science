Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package fresh Chinese egg noodles
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
10 ounces beef skirt steak, cut into thin strips
1 (8 ounce) package portobello mushrooms, quartered
1 carrot, peeled and sliced diagonally
1 red bell pepper, julienned
1/2 cup snow peas
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
2 teaspoons liquid aminos
1 tablespoon chopped green onion, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook for about 5 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
Press Saute button on an multi-functional electric pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Add oil and garlic. Saute for 30 seconds. Add steak strips and saute until starting to brown, about 5 minutes.
Remove steak from pot and keep warm. Add 1/2 cup water to the pot. Insert steamer basket and add mushrooms, carrot, bell pepper, and snow peas. Steam for about 5 minutes.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, mix hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, and liquid aminos to make the sauce.
Unlock and remove the lid. Toss noodles, steak, and vegetables with the sauce. Garnish with green onion.

Description: 
Strips of tender beef accompanied by a flavorful sauce, noodles, and vegetables are done in under an hour. I buy my lo mein noodles at a local Asian food store. Feel free to use linguine if you're not able to find fresh lo mein noodles. I prefer steaming the vegetables and cooking the meat in my Instant PotÂ® for fast preparation.
