Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, softened
5 fresh basil leaves, chopped
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons water
1 red onion, chopped
1 tomato, chopped
8 anchovy fillets, chopped
8 pitted green olives, chopped
6 fresh mushrooms, chopped
4 ounces goat cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, salt and basil leaves. Mix in the butter, olive oil and water until it becomes a smooth dough. Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 8 inch pie plate. Press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the dish until it is about 1/4 inch or 1/2 centimeter thick. Bake for about 8 minutes in the preheated oven, until just starting to brown.
Make a layer of mushrooms and onion in the bottom of the pie crust. Top with a layer of tomatoes, olives and anchovies. Dot with goat cheese.
Return to the preheated oven, and bake for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
