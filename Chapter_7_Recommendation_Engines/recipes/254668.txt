Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped celery
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon fresh thyme
4 cups frozen corn kernels, thawed
2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt

Crumble 4 slices bacon into the skillet. Add onion, celery, garlic, and thyme; cook and stir over medium heat until soft, about 5 minutes.
Transfer bacon mixture to a large pot. Add corn and chicken broth. Bring soup to a boil; cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
Pour 2 cups of soup into a blender. Cover and hold lid down; puree until smooth.
Return pureed soup to the pot. Stir in half-and-half, pepper, and salt. Bring to a boil. Stir in shrimp; cook until shrimp are opaque, 3 to 4 minutes.
Ladle soup into bowls. Crumble remaining 2 slices bacon on top.

Description: 
This is a hearty soup that you can serve as a first course or as an entree. You may want to try a little hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®) when serving. It kicks it up a notch.
