Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut in 1-inch cubes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper.
Mix the olive oil, honey, rosemary, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl, and stir the sweet potato cubes in the mixture to coat. Remove sweet potato cubes with a slotted spoon, and arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 45 minutes. Turn oven heat up to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and bake until browned, another 15 minutes.

Description:
