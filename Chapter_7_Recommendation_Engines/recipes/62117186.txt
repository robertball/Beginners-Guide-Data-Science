Ingredients:
T-bone steak
2 garlic pieces
1 green bell pepper (chopped)
sliced red onion
2 fresh carrots
1 bottle of Mariot wine
4 red patato (cut in halfs)
1 Iron skillet
1 set of tongs

Directions:
Marinate steak overnight till ready to cook on slow heat, add garlic, patatoes, carrots, bell pepper, and after add red onion, cover the iron skillet with foil to keep in taste of steak's flavors. It will melt in your mouth with a taste unlike any other. Depending on way you like your steak, like me, medium-rare; turn over after 3 minutes on each side, with the skillet being hot before placing steak in it. Very little of the wine should remain in skillet while cooking.
