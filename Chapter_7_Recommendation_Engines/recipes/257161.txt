Ingredients:
2 cups raw sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder (such as RumfordÂ®)
1 teaspoon ground cloves
4 cups carrot pulp from juiced carrots
1 cup chopped dates
1 cup shredded coconut
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple
6 eggs
1 cup extra-virgin coconut oil, melted
1 cup grapeseed oil
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffin tins with paper liners.
Mix sugar, all-purpose flour, white whole wheat flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and cloves in a very large bowl. Stir in carrot pulp, dates, shredded coconut, and walnuts.
Whisk crushed pineapple, eggs, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, and milk together in a separate bowl. Fold into the sugar mixture until batter is well blended.
Divide batter evenly among muffin tins, filling each cup almost to the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Don't throw away the carrot pulp after you juice those organic carrots! This is a great use for that pulp that many people throw away. Make this recipe or print it and give it to a friend along with your leftover pulp. Tasty!
