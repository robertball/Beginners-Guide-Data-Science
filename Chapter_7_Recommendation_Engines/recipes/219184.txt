Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup chopped onion
2 large garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 cup taco sauce
1 (16 ounce) can fat-free refried black beans
6 (10 inch) flour tortillas
3/4 cup Daisy Brand Sour Cream
1 1/2 cups finely shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Cook the ground beef in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat 5 to 7 minutes or until thoroughly cooked, stirring frequently; drain. Add the onion, garlic, chili powder, cumin and taco sauce to the meat and stir. Cook for 5 minutes or until thoroughly heated and the vegetables are tender, stirring frequently.
Spread 1/3 cup of refried beans on the bottom 1/3 of each tortilla, leaving 1-inch around bottom and edges. Spoon 1/3 cup of the meat mixture over beans. Top the meat with 1 tablespoon of sour cream and 1/4 cup of cheese. Start rolling up from bottom, enfolding the filling. Fold in the sides and continue rolling up.
Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Spray all sides of the burritos with cooking spray. Place burritos on a cookie sheet, seam sides down. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until thoroughly heated and browned, turning over once. Top with dollops of the remaining sour cream.
