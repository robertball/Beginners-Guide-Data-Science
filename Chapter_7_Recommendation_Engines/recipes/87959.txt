Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 cups peeled, pitted and sliced peaches
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons cold butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup butter. Beat in sour cream, vanilla, and eggs. Mix in flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Spread 1/2 the batter into the baking pan. Layer with peaches, and top with remaining batter.
In a small bowl, mix 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar, pecans, and cinnamon. Cut in cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle evenly over the batter.
Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.

Description: 
This is a great recipe I came up with when our white peach tree yielded sooo many peaches I had to figure out many ways to use them.... Even my kids love this one -- they will eat it all day....
