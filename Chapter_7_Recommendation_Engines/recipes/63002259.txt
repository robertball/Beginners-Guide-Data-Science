Ingredients:
1 lb  candy corn (16 oz)
1 jar(s) Crunchy Peanut Butter (18 oz)
1/2 pkg semi-sweet chocolate chips (about 6 oz)
1 Tbsp vegetable shortening

Directions:
In a microwave safe bowl, melt candy corn in microwave on high in 30 second intervals. Stir every 30 seconds until all melted and smooth.
Stir in 1 jar of crunchy peanut butter to melted candy corn until well blended. Press mixture in a parchment paper lined 9 x 13 pan. Allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.
Melt chocolate chips with 1 TBSP shortening in a double boiler or microwave. (I prefer the double boiler.) Wish some store brands of chocolate chips I have had to use 2 TBSP Shortening.
Pour melted chocolate over candy. Allow chocolate to set before cutting. I usually place in the refrigerator until mixture is thoroughly cooled.
Cut into squares. Enjoy!
(Optional) Sometimes I drizzle some melted milk chocolate on top of the semisweet chocolate after it's cooled just for decoration.
*Update*  As time goes by and package sizes change, (the last bag of candy corn I purchased was 9 oz.) I have found that 1 cup of candy corn to 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter is the best ratio.

Description: 
Sometimes I am embarrassed to tell people how easy this delicious candy is to make. It tastes very much like a Butterfinger candy bar, and can be made in about 10 minutes! (total time) I like to buy a lot candy corn right after Halloween when it is on sale so it can be a very inexpensive candy to make.
