Ingredients:
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 1/2 tablespoons curry powder
1 teaspoon coarse salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
3/4 cup fat-free chicken broth
1/2 cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt

Directions:
Pour flour into a wide, shallow bowl. Dredge chicken pieces in flour to coat completely.
Heat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Saute onion in hot oil until softened, 6 to 7 minutes; season with curry powder, salt, cumin, cinnamon, garlic powder, black pepper, and coriander. Continue cooking until spices are fragrant, about 1 minute.
Increase heat to medium-high. Stir flour-coated chicken pieces into the onion mixture; cook and stir until the chicken is browned on the outside, 3 to 5 minutes.
Pour chicken broth into the skillet and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the sauce begins to thicken, about 8 minutes. Stir yogurt into the liquid until smooth; cook until the sauce is again hot, 2 to 3 minutes.
