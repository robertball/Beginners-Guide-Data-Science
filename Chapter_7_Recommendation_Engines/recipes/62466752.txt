Ingredients:
Load the bread machine:
1   cup  warm water
2     eggs (large)
1/3   cup  canola oil
3-4 tbs. honey
1/3   cup  white sugar
1-1/2 tsp. salt
4 cups flour  (all-purpose)
2     tsp. yeast  (Fleischmann's Instant)
KEEP FOR THE END:
1-2 EGG yolks.
(Sometimes I use 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup white flour.

Directions:
Load the bread machine in the order recommended by its manufacturer. I do liquids first and then dry ingredients.  Put it on the dough cycle.
When finished split dough into two sections and then those two sections into three. Braid the dough into two challahs.
Put on baking sheet or bread pan and let rise, covered, in a warm area or in the oven at 100 degrees or so for 30 minutes or so.
Take egg yolk and  1/2 tsp. water and then put on the top of challah. Sprinkle poppy seeds or sesame seeds.
Bake 20-25 minutes at 350F
