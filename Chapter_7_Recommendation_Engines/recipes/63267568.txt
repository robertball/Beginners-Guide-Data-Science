Directions:

In a large pot, heat the sesame oil on medium heat and saute the onions, celery, and carrots until soft. About 5 minutes.
Add the garlic and tomato paste and continue to saute a few minutes.
Add the chicken, za'atar, and salt and saute a few minutes more until the veggies begin to stick to the pan.
Deglaze the pan with the wine (to do this, splash the wine on the bits that have stuck to the pan, stirring to release the bits.)
Add the lentils and water, bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the lentils are soft.
Add in the olive oil just before serving.
Serve with Roasted Kale
Preheat oven to 375*
Using a baking sheet lay the kale out as flat as possible and spray with oil. Sprinkle on salt & pepper and bake for 20 minutes or until kale is crispy. Store in plastic bag.
