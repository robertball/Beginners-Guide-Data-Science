Ingredients:
3 cups penne pasta
1 tomato, diced
1/3 cup finely chopped red onion
1/3 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pinch paprika
salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1 (5 ounce) can solid white albacore tuna in water, drained

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Rinse penne pasta with cold water and drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Mix the tomato, onion, vinegar, olive oil, garlic, paprika, and salt and pepper together in a bowl. Add the cooked pasta, then flake the tuna on top. Stir to combine.

Description: 
Many years ago, my friend went to Spain and brought back a fantastic tapa that was made with tuna, garlic, onions, tomatoes, garlic aioli sauce. This mixture was spread on chunks of crusty bread...OH YUM. But that is not very healthy and I wanted to revamp it a little and this is what I came up with. And honestly, it comes pretty close. It is easy and tasty. I hope you like it as much as I do.
