Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup diced onion
1 rib celery, diced
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1 egg
5 cherry tomatoes, quartered and seeded
1 tablespoon crumbled feta cheese, or more to taste
1 cup fresh spinach, torn into small pieces

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, celery, rosemary, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper; cook and stir with a wooden spoon or spatula until onion starts to turn translucent, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute.
Push onion mixture to outer edges of the skillet and crack egg into the middle. Break yolk with the wooden spoon and stir in onion mixture. Add tomatoes; cook and stir until egg is almost cooked, about 3 minutes. Stir in feta cheese until slightly melted, about 1 minute. Add spinach. Remove from heat and stir until slightly wilted, about 30 seconds.

Description: 
This is a really quick, easy, and healthy breakfast for one that can easily be doubled or tripled if you're feeding a family. I love the way onions and celery smell when they're cooked with rosemary. It reminds me of the beginning of autumn.

 When it's done, it looks like a lot, but you have to realize it's mostly all veggies! The measurements are all approximate. I don't measure out things when I cook, I just eyeball them, so feel free to adjust ingredients to your liking. Serve with your favorite toast and a strong cup of coffee. Enjoy!
