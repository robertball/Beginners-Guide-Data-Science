Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and celery and cook until onion is soft and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
Combine sauteed onion mixture, cornbread stuffing, applesauce, marjoram, thyme, and lemon pepper in a large bowl. Pour in boiling water and mix to combine. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until stuffing is lightly browned on top, about 30 minutes.
