Ingredients:
1 lb bulk Italian sausage (or taken out of casing)
2 packages of potato gnocchi (17 oz each)
1 16oz bag of frozen chopped broccoli
One jar of alfredo sauce (15 oz)
1/2 stick of butter (4 TB)
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tsp. Italian seasoning
1/4 c. grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 - 1/2 tsp. black pepper

Directions:
Put water on the stove to boil the gnocchi. Place broccoli in a dish and put in the microwave for 7 minutes. Cook the Italian sausage in a metal skillet on high breaking it up as it cooks. Pieces should be small. Cook until nice and brown, almost crunchy, scrapping the bottom of the pan with a metal spatula to get the yummy pieces of brown goodness.  When sausage is all cooked (about 10 min.), add butter, minced garlic, Italian seasoning and cook and stir for one minute on medium heat. Add alfredo sauce. Stir. Put about 1/4 cup of water in the alfredo jar, shake, pour into skillet. Add grated parm. Stir. Add broccoli. Add black pepper. Stir. Wait until sausage mixture is almost complete to put gnocchi in the boiling water.  When the water boils for gnocchi, place gnocchi in. It doesn't take long to cook so as they float, scoop them out and place them into the sausage mixture. Stir. Serve.
