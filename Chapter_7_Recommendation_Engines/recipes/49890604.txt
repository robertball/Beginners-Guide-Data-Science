Ingredients:
1 package active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 cups all purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoons white sugar

Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add sugar and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine 2 cups flour, olive oil, salt and the yeast mixture; stir well to combine. Beat well until a stiff dough has formed. Cover and rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Turn dough out onto a well floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a pizza crust shape. Cover with your favorite sauce and toppings and bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 - 25 minutes.
