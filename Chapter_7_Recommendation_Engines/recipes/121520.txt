Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups chopped zucchini
1 (10 ounce) package frozen cut green beans, thawed
1 large onion, chopped
1/4 cup water
1 garlic clove, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
4 eggs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Paprika

Directions:
Squeeze spinach dry. In a skillet, saute spinach in oil for 2 minutes. Stir in zucchini, beans, onion, water, garlic, basil, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. In a bowl, beat eggs; gradually stir in 1-1/2 cups vegetable mixture. Return all to pan and mix well. Transfer to a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Place in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; fill the larger dish with hot water to a depth of 1 in. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese and paprika. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
Flavorful veggies form the foundation for this side dish that I like to serve with beef and chicken. You could use this as an appetizer, too.
