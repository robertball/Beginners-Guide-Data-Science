Ingredients:
1 CAULIPOWERÂ® Cauliflower Pizza Crust
3 tomatoes, halved and sliced
1/3 cup prepared pizza sauce
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced
1 link fully cooked roasted red pepper and Asiago chicken sausage, sliced into thin rounds
1/3 cup pesto sauce
1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, torn (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Arrange tomato slices on a few sheets of paper towels to absorb excess moisture.
Place pizza crust onto a baking sheet or baking steel. Spread pizza sauce evenly over the crust. Top evenly with shredded mozzarella cheese. Next, add the tomato slices and fresh mozzarella cheese. Top with chicken sausage. Dot evenly with pesto sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
Remove from oven and immediately top with torn basil.

Description: 
Two of my favorite ingredients, pesto sauce and sausage, come together to make one of my family's favorite foods: pizza! They loved how crispy, melty, and cheesy it was! Feel free to adjust ingredients according to your personal tastes.
