Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
2 fresh tomatoes, chopped
1 large green bell pepper, chopped
1 cup fresh sweet white corn, cut from the cob
1 bunch green onions, sliced
1 jicama, peeled and minced
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, minced
1 (8 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
1 clove garlic
1 pinch sea salt
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper
1 cup olive oil

Directions:
Place the beans, tomato, bell pepper, corn, onion, jicama, jalapeno pepper, and feta cheese in a large salad bowl.
Mash the garlic and salt together with a mortar and pestle. Whisk together the mashed garlic, lime juice, mustard, and pepper in a small bowl. Add the oil in a slow, steady stream while whisking. Continue whisking until smooth. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Chill overnight.

Description: 
I tasted many salads with similar ingredients, but all seemed very bland, so I developed this myself. It is dressed with a lime vinaigrette and has lots of crunch and flavor with a little jalapeno pop. It's wonderful to make in summer with fresh ingredients from the garden or farmer's market. This is great with BBQ's or for potlucks. My husband likes it best with fish tacos.
