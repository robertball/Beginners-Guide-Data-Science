Ingredients:
2 cups carrots, sliced diagonally into ovals
1 cup chicken or vegetable stock
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon sugar, granulated
Â¼ teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a shallow, heavy pan.  If the stock is already salted then omit the salt added by the recipe.  On medium heat bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer and cover.
Stir occasionally and recover until the carrots are nearly done and the liquid has been almost absorbed.
Uncover and set heat to high, stirring constantly until carrots are coated with a golden buttery-sweet glaze.
Remove from heat and serve at once.
