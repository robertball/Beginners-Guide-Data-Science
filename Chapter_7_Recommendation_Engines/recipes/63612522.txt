Ingredients:
- 2 1/4 cups of self rising flour
- 1 cup of half and half (milk can be substituted for a healthier version)
- 1/2 cup of Vegetable oil
- Sriracha - The amount varies from person to person and their taste.
---optional---
- Melted butter for topping the biscuits
- A bit of salt for the biscuits

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 F
Mix the ingredients in a large bowl, I found a spoon does the trick.
The dough is going to be lumpy. When you feel it's ready, bits of the dough off, and roll small balls from the dough - somewhere in between a golf ball and tennis ball.
Place them on an un-greased cookie tray
Leave these in the oven for 15 minutes at 425 F.
When they're golden brown, take them out.
Share these with your friends. They will love you.

Description: 
I bought self-rising flour by accident, so I decided to make the best of the situation. I could make regular biscuits, but regular biscuits are boring. What could make biscuits more interesting? The answer was in the side door of my refrigerator - SRIRACHA!
