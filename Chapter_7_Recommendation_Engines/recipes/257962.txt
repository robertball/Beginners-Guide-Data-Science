Ingredients:
1 white grapefruit, peeled and sectioned
1 pink grapefruit, peeled and sectioned
1 navel orange, peeled and sectioned
1 honeydew melon, halved and seeded
1 cantaloupe, halved and seeded
1 large avocado, chopped into small pieces
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1/3 cup chopped fresh mint
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon coarse sea salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste
fresh mint, leaves picked

Directions:
Combine white grapefruit, pink grapefruit, and orange sections in a large bowl.
Scoop out honeydew melon and cantaloupe flesh using a melon baller; add to the citrus in the bowl.
Toss avocado with 1 tablespoon lemon juice in a small bowl. Remove from the juice; add to the bowl of citrus and melons.
Whisk olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and balsamic vinegar together in a bowl. Stir in 1/3 cup chopped mint, honey, salt, and black pepper. Pour over citrus and melon mixture; toss gently to prevent mashing avocado. Garnish with fresh mint leaves.
