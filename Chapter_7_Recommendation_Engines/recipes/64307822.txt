Ingredients:
32 oz low sodium chicken broth
12 oz pale ale
1 cup of carrots, finely diced or shredded
1/2 cup celery, finely diced
1 cup onion finely diced
2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
3 cups very sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup cornstarch

Directions:
Place all chicken broth, beer, carrots, celery, onions, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and salt and pepper into your slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours.
15 minutes before serving, remove lid and stir in shredded cheese. Stir until cheese is melted. Next whisk cream and  cornstarch until combined, then add to crockpot. Recover and cook for 10-15 minutes longer.
Use an immersian blender to make a smooth soup, or process in batches in a food processor or blender.

Description: 
Better than the beer cheese soup your local pub serves, and it cooks while you're at work.  The perfect complement is a fresh batch of pretzel rolls.
