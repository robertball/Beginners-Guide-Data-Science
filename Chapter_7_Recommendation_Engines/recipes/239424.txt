Ingredients:
6 medium baking potatoes, scrubbed
1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal® Kosher Salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 stick butter
1 cup sour cream
6 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/4 cup cream
8 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
6 green onions, chopped, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place potatoes on a baking sheet and pierce once with a fork. Bake for one hour. Remove from oven and let cool for about 10 minutes.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Slice potatoes in half and scoop the potato flesh into a bowl, leaving some to form a shell. Place potato skins in a lightly oiled casserole dish.
Season potato mix with Diamond Crystal(R) Kosher Salt and pepper. Add the butter and begin to mash with a fork. Add sour cream, half of the cheese, and the cream. Continue to mash and stir until creamy. Stir in the bacon and half the green onion.
Scoop filling evenly into potato shells, mounding as necessary. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and green onion.
Bake until cheese is melted, about 20 minutes. Let cool five minutes before eating.

A family favorite! Potatoes are baked, then re-stuffed for a second baking with a decadent mixture of potato, cheese, bacon and green onion. Great for all occasions!
