Stuffed & Smoked Baby Bellas Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/3798816.jpg
Ingredients:
12-16 good sized fresh baby portobello mushrooms
1 lb. creamy goat cheese (chevre)
3 cloves shallots
1-2 tablespoons chopped garlic
4 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
Fresh ground pepper & kosher salt to taste

Directions:
Break the stems off the mushrooms and remove with skirts. Chop finely.
Shop shallots and garlic.
Saute the crimini stems, shallots, and garlic in 2 tablespoons olive oil until tender.
Add goat cheese and stir over low heat until well mixed and creamy.
Salt and pepper mixture to taste.
Spoon mixture into hollowed-out baby bellas.
Brush remaining olive oil on bella caps and place cap down on a grill over low hardwood flame (preferably in a sidebox for slow smoking). I use alder but you can probably use a sweet hardwood of your choice for that nice smoky flavor.
Sprinkle parmesan cheese on top of stuffed bellas.
Cook until soft and browned on top.
Remove from grill and serve.
