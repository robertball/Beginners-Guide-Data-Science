Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups fresh corn kernels
1 tablespoon red bell pepper, chopped
1 tablespoon red onion, chopped
1 tablespoon cornstarch
4 (5 ounce) red snapper fillets
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning, or to taste
1 cup all-purpose flour
3 egg whites, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine corn kernels, bell pepper, onion, and cornstarch in a bowl; set aside.
Sprinkle the Creole seasoning over the red snapper. Dredge the fish in the flour, then dip them in the egg whites. Coat both sides of the fish by pressing the corn mixture into the egg whites.
Heat the vegetable oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high eat. Arrange the fillets in the skillet and fry until golden, about 5 minutes on each side. Place the skillet in the preheated oven and continue cooking until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 more minutes.

Description: 
This makes a good presentation served on either salad greens or mashed potatoes but is also very tasty.  When red fish is not available I've used grouper and even tilapia and orange roughy
