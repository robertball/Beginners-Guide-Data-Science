Ingredients:
Pico de Gallo
2 tomatoes, diced
3 green onions, finely chopped
1 limes juiced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
salt to taste
Meat Filling
1-2 tbsp olive oil
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into strips & seasoned with salt, cumin, paprika & cayenne pepper
1/2 onion, thinly sliced
1/4 bell pepper, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 (6 inch) flour tortillas
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
sour cream (optional)

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine tomatoes, onion, lime juice, cilantro,  jalapeno and salt. Set aside.
In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add chicken, garlic, onion & bell pepper and saute until cooked through and juices run clear. Remove chicken mixture from heat and set aside.
Put the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium hot skillet, add one flour tortilla. Quickly spread 1/4 cup shredded cheese on the tortilla and top with 1/3 the chicken mixture, a couple spoonfuls of pico de gallo, more cheese, then top with another tortilla. When bottom tortilla is lightly brown and cheese has started to melt, flip quesadilla and cook on the opposite side. Remove quesadilla from skillet and cut into quarters. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve quesadillas with remaining pico de gallo and sour cream.
