Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs, divided
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
4 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine first five ingredients. Combine milk, oil and 1 egg; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups half full. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and second egg. Add cheddar cheese and seasoned salt; mix well. Stir in bacon. Spoon 2 tablespoons in the center of each muffin. Bake at 425 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until muffins test done. Serve warm.
