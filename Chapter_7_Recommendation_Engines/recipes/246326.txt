Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk flour and salt together in a bowl; form a well in the center. Add milk and oil; mix until smooth dough forms.
Turn dough out onto a lightly-floured work surface; knead until smooth and pliable, 10 to 15 minutes. Set dough aside to rest for 15 minutes.
Divide dough into 4 equal pieces; roll out each piece with a rolling pin to 1/4-inch thickness. Arrange on prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
