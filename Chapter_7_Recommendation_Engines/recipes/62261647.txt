Ingredients:
1 pound broccoli rabe, trimmed
1 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Cut an X in the bottom of the stems of the broccoli rabe and place in the boiling water.   Cook until tender but still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain.
In a large heavy skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil and saute garlic for 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir in the broccoli rabe and saute 10 to 15 minutes, or until desired doneness.  Dust with parmesan cheese, if desired.
