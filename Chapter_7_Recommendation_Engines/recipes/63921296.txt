Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds baking potatoes
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
4 teaspoons canola oil
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450F.
Spray non-stick baking sheet with non-stick spray.
Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2 inch slices.
Combine potatoes, 1/4 teaspoon salt, sugar, and enough water to cover in a large bowl and soak 15 minutes. Drain and pat dry.
Toss together potatoes, oil, and paprika in large bowl until evenly coated. Spread in single layer on prepared baking sheet. Bake, turning potatoes over as they brown, until cooked through and crisp, about 45 minutes.
Remove from oven and sprinkle with remaining salt.

Description: 
Soaking cut-up potatoes in sugar and salt helps to remove some of their liquid which makes them much crisper when baked.
