Ingredients:
2 whole tortilla(s), flour, whole-wheat, (8 inch)
2 1/2 teaspoon lime juice, fresh, divided
2 1/4 teaspoon oil, olive, extra-virgin, divided
1/2 clove(s) garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
3/4 pounds pork, boneless leg cutlets, about 1/2" thick
1/2 large pepper(s), red, bell, cut into thin strips
1/2 small onion(s), thinly sliced
salt, to taste
pepper, black ground, to taste

Directions:
Heat oven or toaster oven to 200Â°F. Roll tortillas in foil and place in oven to warm.
Whisk together 3 teaspoons of the lime juice, 3 teaspoons of the oil, garlic, and chili powder in a large mixing bowl. Add pork and stir to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes.
While pork is marinating, heat remaining oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add remaining lime juice, stir, and remove from heat; season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Wipe pan dry with paper towels.
Season pork on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat the same skillet over high heat. Cook pork until no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 2 minutes.
Slice pork into thin strips, place on a platter with peppers and onions, and serve with warmed tortillas.
