Ingredients:
First I thinly sliced two sour apples into a bowl with 4 cups of apple juice and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.

Directions:
Soaking the apples will add just a little sweetness, but feel free to use water instead if you don't want to add any sugar. I used a Mandoline to get the apples sliced this thin, but you could also use a sharp knife with a little patience and practice. Allow the apples to soak for 10-12 minutes.Now lay the apple slices on a baking pan lined with a cooling rack. You want the hot air to be able to travel all the way around the apple slice, drying it out as it bakes. Don't layer apples on top of each other because they will stick. Just FYI. You may need to bake a couple of batches depending on how many pans your oven can accommodate. Bake at 350 F for 23-26 minutes. Remove from the oven and turn the heat off and let the oven cool down for a few minutes. Then stick the apples back in the oven for 6-8 minutes to dry out a little more but without all the heat (this helps to prevent them from burning).If you don't consume these all at once be sure to save them in an airtight container.
