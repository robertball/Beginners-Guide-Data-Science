Ingredients:
1 lb. confectioners' sugar
2 tbsp. vanilla extract
2 tsp. salt
2 tbsp. cornstarch
1/2 cup of Soy Milk chilled(I like the vanilla flavored ones vs. the regular)
1 stick of unsalted butter softened
1/3 cup of cocoa powder (optional if you want to make the chocolate version)

Directions:
1. Place all the dry items and the softened butter in a deep bowl.
2. Slowly add the soy milk while mixing. (I usually use a hand mixer)
3. Mix until it is a smooth, thick spreadable consistency.
4. Cover and chill in the fridge for at least 20 mins. before using.

Description: 
My sister requested this for a friend of hers and it was a HUGE HIT! Note: It still contains butter and some people with a lactose intolerance can not eat butter.
