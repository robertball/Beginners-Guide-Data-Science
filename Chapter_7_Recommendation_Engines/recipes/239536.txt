Ingredients:
8 ounces wide egg noodles
1/4 cup butter
1 onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
4 ounces baby spinach leaves
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and return noodles to pot.
While the noodles boil, melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in melted butter until lightly browned and soft, about 8 minutes. Stir baby spinach into the onion mixture; saute until the spinach is just barely wilted, about 2 minutes.
Stir spinach mixture into the noodles; season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
A wonderful side dish to ramp up plain buttered egg noodles. We love it with Salisbury steak, chicken, or pork.
