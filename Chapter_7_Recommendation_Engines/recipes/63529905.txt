Ingredients:
1/4 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/3 cup ground almonds
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 tilapia fillets
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour for dusting
salt to taste
extra virgin olive oil
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Stir together ground almonds, Parmesan cheese, lemon pepper, flour and garlic powder in a shallow dish until combined; set aside. Dip the tilapia in the milk, then press into the almond mixture.
Put oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia until golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium, and season fillets with salt if desired. Sprinkle the tilapia with the remaining Parmesan cheese and cook for another minute. Serve and enjoy.
