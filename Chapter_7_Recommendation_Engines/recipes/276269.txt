Ingredients:
1 teaspoon unsalted butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons buttermilk
1/4 cup strong brewed coffee
1 egg
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup chocolate chips, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 6-cavity donut pan with 1 teaspoon butter and set aside.
Whisk flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Set aside.
Whisk brown sugar, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons buttermilk, coffee, egg, 1 tablespoon butter, and vanilla extract together in another bowl. Add milk mixture to flour mixture; whisk until blended and smooth. Stir in chocolate chips.
Pour batter into a large, resealable plastic bag, cut 1 corner, and squeeze batter into the prepared donut pan, filling each mold about 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until donuts spring back when lightly pressed, about 8 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 5 minutes; turn pan over directly onto rack to release donuts. Allow to cool for 5 minutes more.
