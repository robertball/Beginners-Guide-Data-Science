Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
1 pkg lemon cake mix
1 egg
3 egg yolks
1 can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 c lemon juice

Directions:
Cut butter into lemon cake mix - it will be crumbly.  Add egg, mix, but mixture should still be crumbly.  Reserve 1 cup.  Pat remining into pan (9x13 will work - smaller pan will produce thicker bars).  Bake 15 min at 350 degrees.
Mix egg yolks, sweetened condensed milk and lemon juice together.  Pour on top of baked crust.  Bake 25 min more (depending on the size of pan used).
Refrigerate 2 hours before cutting.  Store covered in the refrigerator.
