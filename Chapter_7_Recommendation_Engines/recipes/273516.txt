Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 packet stevia sweetener (such as Truvia®) (optional)
2 tablespoons sugar-free white chocolate-flavored syrup (such as Torani®)
1 cup brewed coffee

Directions:
Heat milk and sugar substitute in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until simmering, about 2 minutes. Froth hot milk with an immersion blender until foamy.
Pour white chocolate syrup in a mug. Top with hot milk, holding froth back with a spoon. Pour coffee over syrup and spoon froth over coffee.

Description: 
I made this beautifully layered coffee drink in my Ninja Coffee Bar®. You can also achieve the same effect by slowly pouring the froth over the coffee.
