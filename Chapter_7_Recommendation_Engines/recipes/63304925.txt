Ingredients:
8 oz. linguini or bowtie pasta
2 TBSP butter
2 boneless chicken breast halves, sliced thinly (into strips)
1/2 lb. shrimp (peeled and deveined)
1 TBSP cajun seasoning
3/4 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 1/2 cups milk (or heavy cream)
1/4 tsp dried basil
1/4 tsp lemon pepper
1/4 tsp salt
1/8 tsp garlic powder
2 TBSP grated parmesan cheese
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes

Directions:
Cook pasta according to directions.
Saute chicken in butter until white.  Stir in shrimp until opaque.  Remove from pan.
Add mushrooms with a little more butter and cook until done.  Remove and set aside with chicken and shrimp.
Add milk to pan along with cajun seasoning and remaining spices.  Cook and stir constantly until mixture begins to thicken (You may need to add a mixture of 2 TBSP milk and 2 TBSP flour if using milk).  Mixture will get thicker as it cools.
