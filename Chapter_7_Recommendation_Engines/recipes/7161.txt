Ingredients:
1 cup Herman Sourdough Starter
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Bring Herman Starter to room temperature.
Stir together flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
Stir flour mixture and oil into Herman Starter. It will form a soft dough.
On a lightly floured surface knead dough until smooth. Pinch off small pieces of dough and shape into balls OR roll dough out and cut with a biscuit cutter. Place biscuits onto a greased baking sheet, cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in biscuits in the preheat oven for about 30 minutes or until golden. Serve warm.
