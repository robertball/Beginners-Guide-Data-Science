Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 (16 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 large green pepper, diced into small pieces
1/2 cup uncooked long grain rice
1/2 cup boiling water
2 teaspoons worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a skillet, brown beef and drain.
Transfer to a greased 2-quart casserole dish.
Add the next eight ingredients right on top of the beef.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees for about 1 hour or until rice is tender.
Uncover and sprinkle with the cheese; return to the oven until cheese melts; about 5 minutes.
If the rice doesn't cook all the way; which sometimes happens, just cover with a bit more hot or boiling water and bake a little longer.
So the dish doesn't get washed out by the water; put some beef oxo cubes or just use beef broth to add more flavor.

Description: 
This is a really great and easy recipe. My kids love it; and of course they don't like veggies! I received this through a recipe swap from a woman named Jeannie Lofland. I add fresh garlic to the beef and sprinkle seasoning between layers. I also like to use different cheeses; cheddar can be so oily. Try putting a bit of cheese on top of the beef before adding the other ingredients. 

For a faster dinner use cooked rice instead.
