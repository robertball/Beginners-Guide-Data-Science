Ingredients:
4-6 large to medium potatoes, cubed
1 fairly large carrot, cubed into small pieces
1 small stalk of celery with leaves, cubed into small pieces
1 small onion, diced
1 heaping tsp. of salt for boiling the potatoes
Water to cover the potatoes
2-3 cups of milk
1/2 tsp of basil
1/4 tsp dill weed
pepper to taste
salt to taste
large pat of butter

Directions:
**NOTE: WE ALWAYS DOUBLE RECIPE**
1. In 2-qt pot, boil potatoes, carrot, celery, onion, and salt in water that hardly covers the potatoes.  Be sure not to over cook potatoes.  You want them to be soft, but not mushy.
2. Drain off only a little water.  If the potatoes covered with water look like their depth is a total of 4 inches, be sure there's at least 3 inches of water left in the pot after you drain.  Do your best not to lose any veggies down the drain.
3. Add milk to the veggies. Be aware that too much milk takes away some of the great taste this soup has.
4. Add pepper, basil, and dill weed.  Add more salt if necessary.
5. Add butter for great flavor!
