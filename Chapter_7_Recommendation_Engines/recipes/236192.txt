Description: 
I had this drink at a juice bar in Venezuela over 20 years ago. I was very surprised at the three ingredients in this healthful drink. Adjust the proportions to match your individual taste buds, and add sugar if you like it a little sweeter. Trust me, this sounds awful but it's really good! Use a juicer to make orange, carrot, and beet juice (all fresh, not cooked). Serve over ice.
