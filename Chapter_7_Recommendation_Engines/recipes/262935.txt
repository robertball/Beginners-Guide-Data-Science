Ingredients:
3 cups sliced cabbage
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup red wine
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
1 (7 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 (16 ounce) package frozen cut asparagus
1 cup thinly sliced ham

Directions:
Place cabbage in a bowl. Whisk red wine vinegar and oil together in a separate bowl; pour over the cabbage. Marinate, mixing 4 to 5 times, about 15 minutes.
Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add cabbage. Cook and stir until cabbage begins to wilt and gently brown, about 10 minutes. Pour wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
Combine water chestnuts, mushrooms, and garlic in the deglazed skillet. Cook and stir until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Add asparagus and ham. Cook, stirring occasionally, until asparagus is crisp-tender, 6 to 10 minutes more.

Description: 
I concocted this recipe yesterday using cabbage and asparagus. It has become my husband's newest favorite vegetable stir-fry side dish! Thinly sliced leftover meat or seafood added will make this a main dish. I used a thinly sliced ham steak that made a yummy, quick dinner.
