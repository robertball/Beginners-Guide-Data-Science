Ingredients:
5 lbs. Yukon Gold Pototoes
4-6 qts. Water
1/8 - 1/4 c. salt
1 T. rosemary or 1/4 c. fresh snipped
1 1/2 - 2  c. half and half
1 1/2 sticks of real butter.
2-3 pats of butter for top.

Directions:
Rinse and peel potatoes.  Cut into cubes. Place in bottom of empty 6-8 qt. stock pot.  Add 4 qts of water (or enough to cover by 1")
Add one eighth to one quarter of a cup of salt (yes that's a lot, but not all of it will be absorbed, I personally use 1/4 c.) and the rosemary.
Bring to boil.  Simmer on medium until potatoes are tender enough to mash easily.  Drain.  RINSE away rosemary and residual salt with hot water.
Mash with a stand mixer.  Add butter, mix again.  Add half and half, starting with 1 cup.  Adding additional 1/4 to 1/2 c. amounts until the desired creaminess.  Whip until fluffy.
Place in warm caserole and place three to four pats of butter on top (can melt if desired or they will melt while waiting). Cover. Place in warming drawer on high or tepid (170 degree)oven until serving.
