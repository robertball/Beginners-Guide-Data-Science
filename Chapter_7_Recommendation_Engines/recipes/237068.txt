Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons tamarind powder
1/4 teaspoon soy sauce
2 tablespoons chopped peanuts
1/4 cup sliced red onion
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat water in a saucepan over low heat. Dissolve sugar and tamarind powder in warm water; add soy sauce, peanuts, and red onions. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until onions become slightly translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir cilantro into the sauce; continue cooking until thickened to your liking, 5 to 7 minutes more.

Description: 
This is my version of a popular sauce that can be tweaked in a lot of ways to suit one's taste, either more to the sweet side or sour side. It's great with small fried items, like fried tofu, egg rolls, or samosas.
