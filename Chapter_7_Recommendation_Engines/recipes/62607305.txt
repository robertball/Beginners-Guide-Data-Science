Ingredients:
4 lbs ground beef, browned & drained
1 large can tomatoes (crushed, diced or sauce--whichever you prefer)
1 can black beans
1 can kidney beans
1 can sweet corn
1 small can green chilis
1 can enchilada sauce (we prefer mild, but any can be used)
2 cans beef broth
2 envelopes taco seasoning

Directions:
Put ingredients into crockpot on low for the day, or on high for a couple of hours. It can also be cooked on the stovetop. The key is to heat through and allow flavors to meld....it will also make your house smell wonderful and drive the family nuts!
Top with sliced flour tortillas--this is important! They act like noodles and are delicious. Also offer shredded cheese, avocado, cilantro, sour cream, additional seasoning,...anything that sounds good! Enjoy!
