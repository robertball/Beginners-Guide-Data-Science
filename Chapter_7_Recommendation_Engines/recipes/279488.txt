Description: 
Most of the turkey burgers that I have had were overcooked and flavorless. This recipe was inspired by some friends of ours that put a Southwest spin on the burger. With a few tweaks these Southwest turkey burgers have become a staple recipe in our house. The patty is flavorful and plays well with some creamy guacamole and spicy salsa.
