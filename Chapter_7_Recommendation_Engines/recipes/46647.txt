Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup uncooked basmati rice, rinsed and drained
3 tablespoons sesame oil
1 (14 ounce) package firm water-packed tofu, drained and cubed
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (10 ounce) can coconut milk
2 tablespoons green curry paste

Directions:
Place water in a medium saucepan, and stir in the rice. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes. Remove from heat, cool slightly, and fluff with a fork.
Heat the sesame oil in a separate medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in tofu. Stirring occasionally, fry about 20 minutes, until evenly crisp and lightly browned. Season with salt.
In a small saucepan, bring the coconut milk to a boil. Mix in green curry paste. Reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes. Drizzle generously over the tofu and rice to serve.

This is so simple and so good! I replicated this recipe from my favorite Thai restaurant in Atlanta. Serve tofu over the rice and drizzle generously with green curry sauce!
