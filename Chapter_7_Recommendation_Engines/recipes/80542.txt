Ingredients:
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
1/2 cup pecans, broken into pieces
2 heads red leaf lettuce, rinsed and torn
1/2 cup frozen green peas, thawed
1/4 pound smoked salmon, cut into 1 inch chunks
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Place asparagus in the pot, and cook 5 minutes, just until tender. Drain, and set aside.
Place the pecans in a skillet over medium heat. Cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted.
In a large bowl, toss together the asparagus, pecans, red leaf lettuce, peas, and salmon.
In a separate bowl, mix the olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Toss with the salad or serve on the side.
