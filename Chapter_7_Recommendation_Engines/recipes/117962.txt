Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin
1 clove garlic, peeled
Paprika
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cold water
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
Rub pork on all sides with garlic; sprinkle with paprika.  In a large skillet, brown the pork in butter.  Add the mushrooms, lemon juice, marjoram, salt and pepper.  Turn meat to coat with seasonings.  Cover and simmer for 25-30 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) and juices run clear.  Remove meat and keep warm.
In a small bowl, combine the flour and cold water until smooth; stir into the pan juices.  Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.  Slice the pork; serve with gravy and rice.
