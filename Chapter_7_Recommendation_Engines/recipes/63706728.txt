Ingredients:
1/2 Cup of coffee
4 standard size scoops of Edy's or Bryers Vanilla ice cream
Hershey's Chocolate Syrup
Smucker's Caramel Sundae Syrup
1 Cup of Milk

Directions:
I use the NuWave Twister to blend this great new Milk Shake, but you can use a blender. For the coffee, you can use instant or brewer, I use my neat K-Cup brewer. Start by preparing the coffee first, once its done pure in blender. Next, put (4) scoops of vanilla ice cream into the blender. Add the milk next, how thick you want it depends on the amount of milk. Less milk will make this tasty shake a bit thick. More Milk will loosen it up a bit. Add the rest of the ingredients to your liking. I'm a choco-junky, so I add a lot of Chocolate and Caramel syrup. Next, just blend for about 5 minutes or until you think all of the ingredients are mixed thoroughly. That is it! Enjoy!

First time venturing out and doing my own thing. Dunkin Donuts is getting a bit pricey for their Turbo coffee and Starbucks; I only got two words for them! INSANE PRICES!
