Ingredients:
1 cup raisins
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 cup dark brown sugar, packed
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups quick cooking oats
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1 1/2 teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Soak raisins in a bowl of warm water until plump, about 30 minutes. Drain and pat raisins dry with a towel.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter and both sugars with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter until completely blended; beat vanilla extract in with the second egg.
Combine oats, flour, walnuts, coconut, five-spice powder, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Stir egg mixture into oat mixture until well mixed. Fold in raisins and mix until just incorporated.
Drop rounded spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
