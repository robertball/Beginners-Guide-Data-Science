Ingredients:
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup mochiko (sweet rice flour)
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/2 cup sliced green onions
5 tablespoons soy sauce (such as Alohaâ„¢ Shoyu)
2 tablespoons sesame seeds (optional)
4 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into strips
2 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Mix sugar, mochiko, cornstarch, and salt together in a bowl.
Whisk eggs, green onions, soy sauce, sesame seeds, and garlic together in a bowl. Whisk into the flour mixture to form a smooth batter.
Stir chicken strips gently into the batter. Marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.
Fill a deep saucepan with 1 1/2 inch oil; heat over medium heat. Fry chicken strips in batches in the hot oil, turning occasionally, until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes.

Description: 
This mochiko chicken is my daughter's favorite thing in the whole wide world. If you have never eaten mochiko chicken then you don't know what you been missing. This is a staple in many potlucks, tailgating and family gatherings. Mochiko is a Japanese sweet flour that makes a light batter. I make this for my family of 8 once a month. I have to triple the recipe and there is never leftovers.
