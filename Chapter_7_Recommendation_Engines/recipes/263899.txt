Ingredients:
1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup milk
1 medium lemon, chopped and seeded
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup hemp hearts
2/3 cup blueberries, or more to taste
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x4-inch loaf pan with parchment paper.
Blend orange juice, milk, lemon, egg, oil, and vanilla extract in a blender until smooth.
Mix flour, sugar, hemp hearts, blueberries, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Pour in the orange juice mixture; stir to combine. Do not overmix. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the loaf comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan.
