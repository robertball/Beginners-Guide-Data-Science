Description: 
A tongue-tingling blend of zesty flavors comes together in Shirley Glaab's versatile vegetable dip. 'This is also great on ham, turkey or roast beef sandwiches,' she suggests from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, 'I stir a little into my potato salad, egg salad and tuna salad, too.' To suit more timid tastes, cut the horseradish back to 2 teaspoons.
