Ingredients:
1 medium onion, diced
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 Tbs olive oil
1 lb. ground sirloin
28 oz can whole tomatoes
2 Tbs McCormick's Italian Seasoning
1 tsp dried basil
2 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
Salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in medium saucepan.  Add onion and saute for 1 minute.  Add ground sirloin and cook over medium high heat until ground beef is almost cooked through.  Remove from heat and drain off juices.  Put back onto fire and add garlic, cook for 1 minute.  Run canned tomatoes through a food processor if you don't like chunky tomato sauce.  Otherwise, drain juices, then coarsely chop the tomatoes.  Add tomatoes to ground beef mixture.
Stir in herbs, sugar and crushed red pepper flakes.  When sauce begins to bubble, turn heat to a simmer and let cook uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep the sauce from burning on the bottom.  Salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
Despite only simmering for 20 minutes, this surpasses any of my old recipes that cooked for hours.  The amount of sugar you use will vary depending on your canned tomatoes so you'll have to do this 'to taste'...same with the salt. I used San Marzano tomatoes and that is what mine are based on as we don't care for sauces that are too acidic.  Garlic is only cooked for the last minute before adding sauce to keep it from becoming overcooked and bitter.  Canned whole tomatoes guarantees better quality than crushed or diced.  The pepper flakes give a subtle nuance to the sauce without 'heat'.
