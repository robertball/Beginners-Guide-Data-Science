Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 (16 ounce) garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed

1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 cup chicken broth
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 head iceberg lettuce, halved
1 avocado, sliced
1 tomato, chopped
1 (3 ounce) can sliced black olives

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Stir garbanzo beans, taco seasoning, and cumin into the skillet. Pour in chicken broth and cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until soft, about 10 minutes. Mash mixture with potato masher. Season with salt and pepper.
Pull lettuce "cups" out of the center of each half. Fill with garbanzo bean mixture. Top with avocado, tomato, and olives.

Description: 
I sort of made this by accident, trying to recreate something else. My skeptical wife was amazed and added it to the menu rotation! Add other toppings as you like. I think sun-dried tomatoes are also good with this.
