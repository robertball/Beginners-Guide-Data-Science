Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels sprouts
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pinch garlic powder
1 pinch red pepper flakes
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Trim Brussels sprouts and discard any yellow outer leaves.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add Brussels sprouts, cover, and steam until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain well, pat dry, and transfer to the baking sheet.
Toss Brussels sprouts with olive oil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Spread out evenly on the baking sheet. Use a Mason jar or other heavy object to press Brussels sprouts into flat patties.
Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Cover with Parmesan cheese. Broil until cheese starts to brown, about 2 minutes.
