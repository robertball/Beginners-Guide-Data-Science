Ingredients:
7 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 1/2 cups oat bran
1 1/2 cups wheat germ
1 cup sweetened shredded coconut
1 cup hulled pumpkin seeds
1 cup broken walnuts
1 cup broken pecans
1 cup hulled sunflower seeds
1 cup slivered almonds
2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup honey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups sweetened dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or aluminum foil.
Stir rolled oats, oat bran, wheat germ, shredded coconut, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, pecans, sunflower seeds, and slivered almonds together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.
Mix kosher salt and cinnamon together in a saucepan, place over medium-high heat, and add vegetable oil and coconut oil. Heat until coconut oil is melted and oil mixture is hot. Stir maple syrup and honey into oil mixture until incorporated; remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract.
Pour oil mixture over dry ingredients and stir thoroughly to coat. Spread granola onto prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; stir granola. Bake for 15 more minutes and stir; repeat, baking 15 minutes (45 minutes total baking time). Let granola cool, transfer to large bowl, and stir dried cranberries into granola.

Description: 
I've been making this granola for more than a year. I often get requests for the recipe. It's loaded with a variety of nuts and flavored with cinnamon and vanilla. An excellent choice for topping yogurt or ice cream. I prefer 'extra-thick'-style rolled oats.
