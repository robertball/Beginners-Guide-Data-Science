Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 ripe bananas
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Mix bananas and baking soda together in a bowl. Add cake mix; stir to create a thick batter. Spread into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
So easy, so good! Only 3 ingredients. This recipe was a happy mistake. I misread a recipe and discovered this fantastic treat! It has a different texture than a regular cake. Sort of a cross between cake and brownies, it has a lovely chewiness. Lovely hot out of the oven alone or with ice cream, or when cool topped with whipped cream.
