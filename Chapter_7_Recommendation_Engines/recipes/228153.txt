Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups crabmeat
1 cup Italian-style bread crumbs
1 cup panko (Japanese bread crumbs)
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 egg, beaten
3 tablespoons milk
3 tablespoons butter, melted
12 portobello mushroom caps

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix crabmeat, Italian-style bread crumbs, panko, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, egg, milk, and butter in a bowl until thick yet pliable enough to shape. Divide and roll into 12 1-inch balls.
Gently press the balls into the mushroom caps and press to spread into a rounded mound atop the mushroom.
Bake in preheated oven until heated through and golden on top, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
I couldn't find a mushroom recipe that I liked, so I started playing around with my own creation. You can make these with salad shrimp, crab, sausage - practically anything you think would be a good meat filling.
