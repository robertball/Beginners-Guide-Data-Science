Ingredients:
6 cups fresh cranberries
1 cup full-bodied red wine (such as pinot noir) or cranberry juice
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cinnamon stick
1 tablespoon finely shredded orange peel

Directions:
Wash and drain the cranberries, removing any spoiled berries or foreign objects.
In a wide stainless steel skillet, combine wine, sugar, salt, and cinnamon.
Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cook for 1 minute. Add the cranberries and bring to boiling; reduce heat.
Boil gently over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until skins pop*, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the orange peel.
Cool completely; remove cinnamon. If desired, smash berries slightly with the back of a spoon for a thicker relish.
Spoon into decorative jars. Cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Makes 4 to 5 cups.
