Ingredients:
4 cups shrimp stock
1 teaspoon freshly-grated ginger
1 pound asparagus spears, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 egg, beaten
1 cup cooked crabmeat

Directions:
Combine shrimp stock and ginger in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a rolling boil.
Stir in asparagus and reduce heat to medium. Cover and simmer until asparagus are partially cooked, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low.
Combine cornstarch and water in a small bowl.
Whisk cornstarch mixture into soup.
Stir sesame oil and soy sauce into soup.
Simmer, stirring constantly, until soup thickens, about 1 minute.
Slowly add beaten egg, while gently stirring soup to form threads of cooked egg.
Stir in crab meat and simmer until crab is thoroughly heated, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
An Asian-inspired soup that is decadent and rich.  Perfect for a cold winter day and elegant enough for special holidays.  I make this every year at our Christmas gathering, usually doubling the recipe, and my daughter always claims the leftovers to take home.
