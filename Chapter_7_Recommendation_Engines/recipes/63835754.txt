Ingredients:
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup mustard
1 teaspoon basil
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon parsley

Directions:
Sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and pepper to taste, and place in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a small bowl, combine the honey, mustard, basil, paprika, and parsley.
Mix well.
Pour 1/2 of this mixture over the chicken, and brush to cover.
Bake at 350Â° for 30 minutes.
Turn chicken pieces over and brush with the remaining 1/2 of the honey mustard mixture.
Bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
Let cool 10 minutes before serving.
