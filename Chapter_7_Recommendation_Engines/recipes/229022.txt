Ingredients:
1 cup light soy sauce
1/2 cup rice wine vinegar
1/4 cup cane sugar
lime, juiced
lime, zested
1 green onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground ginger
5 dashes chile-garlic sauce, or to taste
1 (3/4 pound) pork tenderloin, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, cane sugar, lime juice, lime zest, green onion, garlic, ground ginger, and chile-garlic sauce together in a large glass or ceramic bowl; add the sliced pork and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours.
Remove pork from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard marinade.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork slices in oil until no longer pink in the center, about 2 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
I made this up one night with garlic mashed potatoes and my husband made me swear to include it in the rotation. It originated from a marinade my mother had for moose meat, but the lime and chili garlic sauce adds a fresh twist. Warning: I didn't measure; it's all approximations to your taste!
