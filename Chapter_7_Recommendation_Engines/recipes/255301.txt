Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons lightly packed brown sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 egg
2 ripe bananas, mashed
1/3 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup chocolate chips, or to taste (optional)
Frosting:
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups confectioners' sugar, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Combine white sugar, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup butter in another bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in egg. Mix in mashed bananas. Add flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with buttermilk, stirring after each addition. Fold chocolate chips into the batter.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool cupcakes on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.
Beat cream cheese and 3 tablespoons butter in a bowl until smooth. Add vanilla extract. Beat in confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, until frosting is smooth.
Spread frosting over cupcakes.

Description: 
I was inspired by a few different banana cupcake recipes before settling on this one. The cream cheese frosting is probably my favorite part; it's just wonderfully decadent on a banana cupcake. Refrigerate cupcakes after frosting. P.S. They taste much better the next day!
