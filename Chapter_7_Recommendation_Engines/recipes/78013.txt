24 medium stalks asparagus
4 cups Italian-style salad greens with radicchio
4 tablespoons chopped hazelnuts
Dressing:
6 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons orange juice
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
Freshly ground pepper, to taste

Directions:
Trim, peel and rinse asparagus (do not dry). Place spears flat, two or three deep, in a glass pie plate or similar dish. Cover tightly with microwavable plastic wrap and microwave on high 2 1/2 to 5 minutes, depending on wattage.
Whisk together dressing ingredients, pour over asparagus and marinate in refrigerator until cool.
Divide greens onto four salad plates; top each with six asparagus spears.
Drizzle with equal amounts of dressing, and top with hazelnuts.
