Stir in soy milk.  Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until combined.  Batter should be slightly thick, adjust liquid if necessary.

Description: 
These healthy pancakes with a hint of almond are delicious.  They're thick and fluffy and they really stick to your ribs. Serve warm with maple syrup or peach jam. Leftovers are great served cold with a little peach jam spread on them, yum!Modified from: Dairy Free Whole Wheat Pancakes
