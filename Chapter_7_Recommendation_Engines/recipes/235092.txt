Ingredients:
1/4 cup low-sodium teriyaki sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
10 Brussels sprouts, halved
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Whisk teriyaki sauce, sesame oil, paprika, and garlic powder together in a bowl.
Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add Brussels sprouts to garlic; sprinkle with pepper. Arrange Brussels sprouts cut-side down and brush about 1/3 the teriyaki mixture over sprouts. Cook and stir Brussels sprouts, brushing with teriyaki sauce 2 more times, until Brussels sprouts are golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.
