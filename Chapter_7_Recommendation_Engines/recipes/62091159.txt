Ingredients:
2 (1 oz.) squares unsweetened chocolate
3 eggs worth of Egg Beaters
2 C. Splenda
2/3 C. applesauce
1/3 C. oil
2 C. grated zucchini
1 t. vanilla
2 C. all-purpose flour
1 t. baking soda
1 t. salt
1 t. ground cinnamon
1 C. semisweet chocolate chips
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Lightly spray two 9 by 5 inch loaf pans.  In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate until melted.  Stir occasionally until chocolate is smooth.
In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugar, oil, grated zucchini, vanilla, and chocolate; beat well.  Stir in the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.  Fold in the chocolate chips.  Pour batter into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean.  (Remember that Splenda shortens bake times on quick bread recipes.)

This lower fat recipe was created when I had an abundance of zucchini and trying to be good on WW. Each slice is only 4 points!
