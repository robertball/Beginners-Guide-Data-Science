Ingredients:
12 whole chicken wings
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons Big Daddy's Lemon Pepper Rub
1/2 cup butter or margarine, divided
2 tablespoons cooking oil
1/2 cup taco sauce

1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Directions:
Cut chicken wings into three sections; discard wing tips. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a skillet over medium heat, combine 2 tablespoons butter and oil. Fry chicken until brown, about 6-8 minutes on each side. Place in a greased baking dish. In a saucepan, combine Lemon Pepper Rub, taco sauce, barbecue sauce, French dressing, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce and remaining butter; cook and stir over medium heat until butter is melted and sauce is blended. Pour 1/2 cup over the chicken wings. Bake, uncovered, at 300 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until chicken juices run clear. Serve with the remaining sauce.
