Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) loaves French bread
1/4 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon orange marmalade
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground curry powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
8 cups mixed salad greens
1 cup cubed smoked deli turkey
1 cup cubed papaya
1 cup seedless grapes, halved
1 red apple - cored and diced
1 California avocado

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cut one inch off the top of each loaf of bread. Using serrated knife, cut around inner edge of crust to remove the inside of the bread.   Remove by tearing out all of the interior of the loaf. A 1/2 inch shell should remain.
Prepare the dressing in a small bowl by whisking together the 1/4 cup olive oil, 3 tablespoons vinegar, marmalade, garlic, curry powder, salt and pepper. Set aside.
Whisk together the 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar; spread on the inside of each loaf. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and cool.
In a large bowl, combine the greens, turkey, papaya, grapes, and apple. Whisk together dressing and pour over salad. Toss to coat.
Spoon into breadbaskets.  Peel, seed and slice avocados into crescents, and arrange over the salad. Cut each breadbasket into four pieces and serve.
