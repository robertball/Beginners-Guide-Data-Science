Ingredients:
Fish:
vegetable oil for frying
2 eggs
1/4 cup milk
2 teaspoons taco seasoning mix
2 cups panko bread crumbs
6 cod fillets, quartered lengthwise
Tacos:
1 (10 ounce) package corn tortillas
1 cup sour cream
2 limes, cut into wedges
1/2 head napa cabbage, shredded
1 tomato, diced
1/2 onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 avocado, sliced

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat eggs, milk, and taco seasoning together in a bowl using a whisk or a fork. Place panko bread crumbs in a separate bowl.
Coat each piece of cod in egg batter, followed by bread crumbs.
Place cod in hot oil and fry until golden brown and flaky, flipping halfway through if using a saucepan, 4 to 8 minutes, depending on size and fry method. Transfer to a platter covered with paper towels to drain. Keep warm.
Warm tortillas in a microwave oven, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Divide fish evenly between tortillas. Top tacos evenly with sour cream; squeeze lime juice over each. Top each with cabbage, tomato, onion, bell pepper, and avocado, in that order. Squeeze additional lime juice over each taco and serve.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe because I love fish tacos and couldn't find any where I live that weren't overly breaded and kind of soggy. We love the crispiness and great flavor of this fish!
