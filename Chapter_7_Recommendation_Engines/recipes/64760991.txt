Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup rolled oats
1 1/2 tsps baking powder
1 1/2 tsps baking soda
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 eggs
1 1/2 tsps vanilla extract
2 cups carrot, shredded
1 cup apple, shredded
1/2 cup crystallized ginger, finely chopped
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease, or line and grease two 12 cup muffin pans.
2. In a large bowl, stir together flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, and salt until combined. Set aside.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together maple syrup, Greek yogurt, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla extract until thoroughly combined. Add to flour mixture, and stir until just combined. Fold in carrot, apple, crystallized ginger, raisins, and walnuts.
4. Divide batter evenly between 16 muffin cups, filling to the top. Bake in preheated oven 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the muffins comes out clean. Allow to cool a few minutes in pan before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
