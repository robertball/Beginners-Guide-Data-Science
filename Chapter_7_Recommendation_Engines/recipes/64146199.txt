Ingredients:
2 cups  flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons butter
1 cup milk
8 ounces concord grapes
2 teaspoons coarse sugar, for topping (optional)

Directions:
Prep grapes by slicing in half lengthwise and removing seeds with a small paring knife.
Preheat oven to 400ÂºF.
Grease one 12-cup standard size muffin tin; set aside.
Add flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt to a bowl. Whisk to combine. Add butter and using a pastry blender, blend until it forms a sandy-looking mixture.
Pour in the milk and stir, until just mixed and there are no visible traces of flour. Gently fold in the grapes. Spoon into the prepared muffin tins and sprinkle tops with an even amount of coarse sugar, if desired.
Bake 20 minutes, until tops are golden and a toothpick inserted comes out clean (it's okay if there's grape goo on it). Remove from oven and let cool 10 minutes in the tin, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.

Found this looking for another way to use up all these grapes.  Not my favorite muffin, but definitely top 10!
