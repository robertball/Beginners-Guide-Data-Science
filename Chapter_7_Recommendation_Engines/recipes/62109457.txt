Ingredients:
1/2 pound unsalted butter
2 1/2 c granulated sugar
6 large eggs (at room temperature)
1/3 c grated lemon zest (6-8 large lemons)
3 c all-purpose flour
1/2tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 1/4 tsp table salt
3/4 c freshly squeezed lemon juice
3/4 c buttermilk (at room temperature)
1 1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract
2 c confectioners’ sugar
3 1/2 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350° F.  Grease two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 -inch loaf pans.
With an electric mixer, cream the butter and 2 cups granulated sugar for about 5 minutes or until light and fluffy.
With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs, one at a time, and the lemon zest.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl. In another bowl, combine 1/4 cup lemon juice, the butter milk, and vanilla.
Add the flour and butter mixtures alternately to the batter, beginning and ending with the flour mixture.
Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to an hour, until a cake tester comes out clean.
For Lemon Syrup: Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar with 1/2 c lemon juice in a small saucepan and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves and makes a syrup. When the cakes are done, let them cool for 10 minutes, then invert them onto a rack set over a tray, and spoon the lemon syrup over the cakes. Allow the cakes to cool completely.
For the Lemon Glaze: combine the confectioner’s sugar and lemon juice in a bowl, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth. Pour over the top of the cakes and allow the glaze to drizzle down the sides
