Ingredients:
1 (2 1/2 pound) beef eye of round roast
2 tablespoons Greek seasoning
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons salt
3 cloves garlic, minced
kitchen twine
2 cups beef broth
1 teaspoon beef bouillon granules
6 Italian submarine rolls
1/2 cup giardiniera, drained, or to taste

Directions:
Cut notches all over the roast with a sharp knife. Rub with Greek seasoning, pepper, salt, and garlic. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
Bring roast to room temperature before cooking, about 1 hour. Tie up roast with kitchen twine so it will hold its shape while roasting.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix beef broth and bouillon granules together in a roasting pan. Place roast on a rack above the broth so drippings will fall into the broth.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Tent with foil and let cool for 20 minutes.
Pour broth into a saucepan. Bring to a simmer. Slice roast very thinly; dunk slices in the hot au jus and stuff into Italian rolls. Top with giardiniera. Ladle more au jus over each sandwich.

You've seen them in O'Hare. Not sure why these beef sandwiches aren't a nationwide craze because they're that good!
