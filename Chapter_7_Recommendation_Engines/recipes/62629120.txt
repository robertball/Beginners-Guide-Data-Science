Ingredients:
3 3/4 cups flour
1 3/4 cups sugar
1 lb butter, cold cut into cubes
1 1/2 tsps baking powder
1 cup finely ground almonds
1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp almond extract
2 egg yolks
1/8 cup milk
dark chocolate melted for dipping

Directions:
In a large bowl whisk all dry ingredients together.
Cut in cold butter, using your hands work the butter into the flour mixture.
In a cup measure mix together vanilla, almond extract, egg yolks and milk.
Add egg mixture to flour mixture, using hands again knead into a ball forms.
Cover and chill at least 2 hours.
Divide into quarters and roll out first dough on a lightly floured surface, do not roll dough too thin as you do not want crispy cookies.
Using a cutter of your choice cut out shapes, transfer to a cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes.
Allow to cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.
When completely cool dip half the cookie in dark chocolate, wipe off excess chocolate on the back of the cookie then place on waxed paper to set the chocolate. I usually leave them overnight to set up properly, then store in wax paper lined Tupperware containers.
I use a square or rectangle shaped cutter with fluted edges.
