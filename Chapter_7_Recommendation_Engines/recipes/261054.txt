Ingredients:
1/2 cup prepared horseradish
1 (12 count) package Hawaiian bread rolls, split
12 slices deli roast beef
12 slices deli-sliced Swiss cheese
1/2 cup butter
1 onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
2 teaspoons poppy seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Spread horseradish on the bottoms of the Hawaiian bread rolls and cover each with 1 slice roast beef and 1 slice Swiss cheese. Cover with top bread rolls.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, brown sugar, spicy mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour over Hawaiian rolls and sprinkle rolls with poppy seeds. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 25 minutes. Uncover and bake until tops are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
