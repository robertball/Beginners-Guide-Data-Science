Add mayonnaise and parmesan cheese and blend well.
Stir in chives.
Rinse haddock fillets and pat dry.  Place haddock fillets on cookie sheet and top with mayo mixture, spreading over the haddock.
Bake at 400 for 10 minutes or until fish flakes when tested with a fork.  Topping should be lightly browned.
