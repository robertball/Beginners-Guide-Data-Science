Ingredients:
4 6oz frozen skinless salmon portions defrosted.(I buy individually frozen salmon from the bulk store)
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper
1/2 cup honey dijon salad dressing. (I use wishbone)

Directions:
Sprinkle salt and pepper over salmon portions on both sides.  Pour dijon salad dressing into a zip lock bag and add salmon portions.  Marinate at least 1 hour.
Grill salmon on charcoal grill, gas grill, or grill pan over medium heat until salmon flakes easily or until done to your preference.
Serve with instant rice and salad.
