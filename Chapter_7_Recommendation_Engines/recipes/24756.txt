Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/4 cups canola oil

Directions:
In a lidded, plastic storage container stir butter until it has a smooth, frosting-like consistency.
Slowly, one tablespoon at a time, stir in the first 1/2 cup of oil; mix until smooth.  Stir in the remaining oil a little more quickly, mixing well.
Refrigerate for 3 hours, or until set.
Store in refrigerator.  If the 'butter' melts after being left out, refrigerate to restore solidified quality.

Description: 
This is a homemade margarine or soft spread 'butter'.  While it is not lower in calorie, it has a higher ratio of unsaturated to saturated fat than butter, and unlike margarine, it contains no trans fat. Create a flavored butter by adding garlic or cinnamon, or anything you chose!
