Ingredients:
2 T olive oil, divided
1/2 c onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 10 oz package frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1/4 c fresh basil, chopped
1/2 T oregano
3/4 T lemon juice
black pepper to taste
2 c shredded mozzerella cheese
1 large or 2 small fresh tomatoes, thinly sliced
3/4 c feta cheese, crumbled
1/3 c seasoned bread crumbs
dough for one large pizza crust, unbaked

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees; if using a pizza stone, preheat the stone.
Heat 1 T oil in skillet; saute onion and garlic for several minutes.  Add spinach and saute until all liquid is evaporated.  Remove from the heat and add basil, oregano, lemon juice, and pepper.  Mix and cool slightly.
Brush pizza dough with 1 T oil.  Spread spinach mixture over pizza dough, leaving a small border at the edge of the crust.  Top with 1 cup of mozzerella cheese.
Dredge tomato slices in bread crumbs and arrange over mozzerella cheese; they should cover most of the crust.  Top with the remaining mozzerella cheese and the feta cheese.
Bake 15 min at 400 degrees.
