Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups shredded zucchini
1/2 cup agave nectar, or more to taste
1 egg
1/4 cup coconut oil
1/4 cup applesauce
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 3 mini-loaf pans.
Beat zucchini, agave nectar, egg, coconut oil, applesauce, lemon juice, and lemon zest together with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth. Whisk flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in a bowl; mix into zucchini mixture until batter is just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool bread in pans for 10 minutes before turning onto a wire rack to cool completely.
