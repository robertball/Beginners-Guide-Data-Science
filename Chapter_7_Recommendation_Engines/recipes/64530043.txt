Directions:
Directions:
In food processor, process cabbage, yellow pepper, parsley, and kale. Process ingredients to coleslaw size chunks. Set aside in a mixing bowl.
Puree mango and ½ cup of Greek yogurt in food processor. Plain or vanilla flavored is fine. You can’t taste the vanilla or the sweetness from the yogurt in the end result, it will taste garden fresh.
Once the mango and the yogurt are pureed, mix with chopped vegetables.
Impress your friends and family with this delicious side. This side is my favorite for any tropical salmon recipe. This is a great recipe to sneak in some kale in those kids tummies!
