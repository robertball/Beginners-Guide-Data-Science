Ingredients:
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons vinegar
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 2 inch pieces
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
1 red pepper
mushrooms
1 red onion
250 g Basmati Rice
skewers

Directions:
In a shallow glass dish, mix the soy sauce, brown sugar, sherry, sesame oil, ginger, and garlic powder. Stir the chicken pieces and pineapple into the marinade until well coated. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours.
Preheat grill to medium-high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Thread chicken and pineapple alternately onto skewers. Grill 15 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally, or until chicken juices run clear.
With the leftover marinade, heat it to boiling and then mix in a little corn starch to thicken.  Use sauce to top meat and veggies.
