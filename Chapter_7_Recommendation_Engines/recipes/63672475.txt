Ingredients:
2/3 cup soft silken tofu
1 1/3 cups fresh orange juice
2 tbsp sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Put all ingredients in a blender and puree until mixture is smooth and sugar is dissolved, 1 - 2 minutes.
Pour mixture into plastic ice-pop molds or paper cups and transfer them to the freezer. (If you use cups, wait about 1 hour, then insert a wooden ice-pop stick into each cup; it should stand upright).
Freeze until pops are completely solid, another 2 or 3 hours.
To release, run the mold under cool water for a few seconds to loosen (or peel off the paper cup).
