Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound bulk Italian sausage
2 tablespoons sausage drippings
2 tablespoons margarine
2 apples, cored and sliced
1 large onion, sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 cup water
3 cups prepared mashed potatoes
1 tablespoon melted margarine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a 2-quart casserole dish.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir Italian sausage until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer sausage to prepared casserole dish. Drain drippings and reserve 2 tablespoons drippings in the skillet.
Melt 2 tablespoons margarine in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir apple and onion slices until tender, about 8 minutes. Place apple and onion in casserole dish with sausage.
Lightly stir sausage, apple, and onion together; season with salt, black pepper, and oregano.
Brown flour in reserved drippings in skillet over medium heat. Whisk water into flour until thick gravy forms, about 3 minutes.
Pour gravy over sausage mixture in the casserole dish; spread mashed potatoes over the top with a spoon, creating peaks. Lightly brush mashed potatoes with 1 tablespoon melted margarine.
Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are lightly browned and the sausage mixture is bubbling, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe my Irish aunt gave me. Her husband is Italian, and she developed this recipe to blend things they both like. It is a variation of Shepherd's Pie. For richer flavor, substitute beef broth for water in gravy.
