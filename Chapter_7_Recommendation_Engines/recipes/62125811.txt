Ingredients:
4 slices of white bread
3 eggs
3/4 milk
1 1/2tb Sugar
rounded 1/2t Cinnamon
1/2t Vanilla
1/4t Salt
2 shakes of Cloves
1 Belgian Round Waffle Iron

Directions:
Lightly whisk eggs and milk in a small bowl until combined.
Add the spices and mix well.
Cut each slice of bread in half and layer in a small shallow dish (such as a 9x9 Pyrex).  Pour the egg mixture over the bread and let soak.
Preheat the waffle iron per the manufacturers directions.
When heated, spray the iron with cooking spray to keep the batter from sticking.
Arrange 4 slices of bread onto the iron into a diamond shape and pour half of the excess egg mixture over it.  The batter will spread out and fill the iron while cooking.
Close the iron, and bake on a lower heat setting until browned (or the iron signals it is done).
Carefully remove the waffle and place it on a dish covered with a clean towel (if not serving immediately).
Spray the iron with cooking spray before cooking the next waffle, and continue as directed above.

Description: 
Since I never have stale bread on hand when I made French Toast, it always came out extra soggy and never as good as it could've been.  By cooking it in a waffle iron, it gets the shape of a waffle with the great flavor of French Toast, and is baked perfectly every time!
