Ingredients:
1/2 total cup ketchup/BBQ sauce mixture (try to find both ketchup and BBQ sauce without high fructose corn syrup)
1 egg
1 1/2 cups flavored croutons
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 cups shredded (whatever kind of cheese you like, pepper jack works well)
If desired, make additional ketchup/BBQ sauce mixture to place on top of meatloaf approx. 10 minutes or so before it's finished cooking.

Directions:
In a bowl, combine ingredients; mix well.
Using a PAM sprayed baking dish, approx. 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. form into a loaf of approx two inches high. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
Easy throw together meatloaf. Place some veggies of your choice around it while baking. One less dish to worry about washing! If you place the veggies, go ahead and put foil over the baking dish to hold the heat/steam inside for the veggies. Uncover towards the end if you are glazing the top or like a browned top.Modified from: Cheese-Stuffed Loaf
