Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 (4 ounce) fillets swai fish
2 tablespoons margarine
1/4 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a shallow pan or baking sheet with cooking spray.
Place fish fillets into the prepared pan.
Heat margarine in a saucepan over medium heat. Mix white wine, lemon juice, cilantro, garlic, salt, and black pepper into the melted margarine; simmer sauce for 2 minutes. Generously spoon sauce over fish fillets. Sprinkle fillets with paprika.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes.

Description: 
I typically do not like fish. However, I love this one! It is light-tasting, and, in my opinion, does not have that 'fishy taste.' I serve this fish with English peas or green beans and wild rice or rice pilaf.
