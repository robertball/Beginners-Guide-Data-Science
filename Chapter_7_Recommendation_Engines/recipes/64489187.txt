Ingredients:
1 medium fryer, cut up
1/2 cup wine vinegar
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 garlic cloves, mashed
salt
pepper
1 teaspoon prepared mustard
3/4 cup catsup
1/3 cup honey or 1/2 cup natural sugar

Directions:
Wash and dry fryer. Put in 2 quart casserole and cover with sauce made of remaining ingredients. Cover and bake at 325 degrees for 2 hours, or until very tender.
I put all the sauce ingredients in a blender and mix them that way. You can also throw in an onion. I don't like the sauce to be too soupy, and so I check it and if it's too soupy towards the end of the cook time I remove the cover. Or it can be cooked uncovered. Experiment with this to get it how you want.
