Ingredients:
2 pounds potatoes
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 onions, sliced
3 1/2 ounces bacon, diced
1 1/2 cups dry white wine
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 slices Reblochon cheese

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool until easily handled. Peel and slice potatoes.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onions until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes and bacon, cover, and simmer over medium-low heat for 15 minutes. Add wine, salt, and pepper.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.
Transfer potato mixture to the prepared baking dish and cover with Reblochon cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and slightly browned, about 30 minutes.
