Ingredients:
4 teaspoons dried rosemary
1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
1 1/2 teaspoons dried marjoram
salt and pepper to taste
3 pounds pork tenderloin
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle hard apple cider
water
3 Granny Smith apples, cored and cut into 1 inch pieces
1 large red onion, cut into 1 inch pieces
5 tablespoons brown sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup maple syrup

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together rosemary, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper.  Rub herb mixture over tenderloin. Place in a container, and pour hard cider over roast.  Add water until pork is completely submerged. Cover, and refrigerate 6 to 8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place roast in a roasting pan, elevated from the bottom, and pour marinade around the meat. Bake for 1 hour in preheated oven.
In a large bowl, mix apples and onion. Put mixture around and on top of roast. Spoon brown sugar over entire pan evenly. Place roast back into oven, and continue to cook for 1 hour more, or until meat reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer roast, apples, and onion to a serving platter.
For the gravy, brown flour in a skillet. Pour the marinade/drippings mixture into the skillet. Stir in syrup. Cook and stir over high heat until liquid has thickened to desired consistency.
Slice roast, and serve with gravy.

Description: 
This roast is by far the best tenderloin recipe I've ever made. The sweetness imparted from the gravy and the apple flavor is quite different from what is typically expected from a pork roast. The apple and onion mixture cooked with the roast makes an excellent side dish with a little of the gravy over the top.
