1 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 teaspoon dried thyme or oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary

Cut about 1/2-inch off top of onion; peel onion. Cut onion into 12 to 16 vertical wedges, leaving root base intact. Set bloomed onion on 14 X 10-inch foil piece. Top onion with butter, thyme or oregano, rosemary and salt and pepper, to taste. Wrap foil around seasoned bloom and pinch edges together tightly. Placed wrapped onion upright on pan. Bake at 425 degrees for 30 minutes, or until tender and cooked but “petals” still have body and stand upright. If desired, sprinkle with minced parsley or paprika. Baked wrapped onion may be held in warm location for up to 1 hour before serving.
