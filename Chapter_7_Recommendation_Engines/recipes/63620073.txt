Ingredients:
5 mild Italian sausages, taken out of casings
3/4 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup minced onion
6 large cloves crushed garlic
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (13 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (13 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon dried cilantro
12 lasagna noodles
1 (500g) container fat free cottage cheese
1 egg
1 teaspoon dried basil leaves
1 teaspoon dried cilantro
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (500 g) pkg light mozzarella cheese, shredded
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, water and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce. Season with sugar, 2 1/2 tsp basil,  Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon cilantro. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 9 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a food processor, puree cottage cheese with egg, and remaining basil and cilantro.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 3 noodles lengthwise, 1 widthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layer, then do noodles, sauce and then top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
