Ingredients:
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 pound ground lamb
8 small slider-size rolls, split
1 cup baby spinach
1/2 cup tzatziki sauce
1/4 cup sliced red onion
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix garlic, cumin, coriander, allspice, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; add lamb and mix well. Form mixture into 2-ounce patties.
Grill patties on the preheated grill until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Place rolls on the grill and heat until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes.
Layer spinach, tzatziki sauce, lamb patty, red onion, and feta cheese in each roll, creating a slider.
