Cook the burgers in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat for 10 minutes or until well browned on both sides. Pour off any fat.
Stir the remaining sauce in the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 20 minutes or until the burgers are cooked through. Top the burgers with the mozzarella cheese and heat until the cheese is melted.  Serve the burgers and sauce on the rolls.
