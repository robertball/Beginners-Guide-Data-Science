2 tsps. lemon juice
10 oz. apple juice
2 Tab. butter/margarine

2 tsps. cornstarch
1 Tab. water

Directions:
Toss apples with lemon juice in a medium sized saucepan.  Add apple juice, butter or margarine, sugar, and spices.  Cook on low until apples are almost tender.  Using a potato masher, crush apples but leave a lot of small chunks.  Mix cornstarch in water until smooth and add to apple mixture.  Cook until thick, and liquid is "clear"  - about  2 mins.
