Ingredients:
32 oz. (One Box ) of Chicken Broth
3 oz. Cream Cheese
One Small Bunch Broccoli
¾ Cup 1% Milk
1 tsp Chopped Chives
Two Small Potatoes
Two Parsnips
One Leek
¼ tsp White Pepper
2-3 Tbsp Butter
One Pot of Water

Directions:
Heat up some butter in a large pot. Rinse the leek before you chop it!
Chop broccoli into florets, and steam the florets using a steamer in a small pot of water. Turn the stove off once the florets are bright green.
Once the butter is all melted; chop up and add peeled potatoes, peeled parsnips, and leek, and sauté for around ten minutes.
Add chicken broth and simmer veggies until they are soft.
Mix well with an immersion blender until smooth, then add cream cheese and milk; and then mix until you have a cream-colored liquid.
Add white pepper and continue mixing until the mixture is very consistent.
Add broccoli florets to the pot, and heat through.
Serve immediately with chopped chives.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite recipes. Like pretty much all of my others, it was a result of kitchen improv. It is a delicately flavored soup with cream cheese, broccoli, chives, and many other good veggies.
