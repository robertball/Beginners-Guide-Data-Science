Ingredients:
6 slices Wonder® Classic White Bread, crusts removed
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning, divided
1 clove garlic, minced
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
6 cups torn greens
1 tomato, diced
1 cup black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup frozen corn, thawed and drained
1/2 red or green bell pepper, diced
2 green onions, chopped
3/4 cup fat-free ranch dressing
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Cut bread into 3 strips; cut each strip into thirds, making 9 cubes. Combine 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons chili seasoning and garlic. Place bread cubes in zip-top bag and toss with olive oil mixture.  Spread bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake for 5 minutes; turn and bake for 5 to 7 additional minutes or until well toasted; set aside.
Brush chicken breasts with remaining tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons chili seasoning. Heat a grill skillet or regular skillet over medium high heat until very hot. Cook chicken 4 minutes; turn and cook an additional 4 to 5 minutes or until done and meat is no longer pink inside. Allow to rest 10 minutes.  Cut chicken into strips.
Place greens in a large salad bowl. Add tomatoes, black beans, corn, pepper and green onions. Top with chicken breast strips.
Combine remaining chili seasoning with ranch dressing; stir to blend. Pour over salad and toss. Sprinkle with cheese. Top with chili croutons.
