Ingredients:
2 tablespoons sunflower seed oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
4 1/2 cups cubed fresh pumpkin
1 red bell pepper, cubed
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated

1 ear fresh corn on the cob
1/2 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 lemon, juiced
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat oil in a pot over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add pumpkin, red bell pepper, and ginger; cook until softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in curry paste and cook for 1 more minute. Pour in vegetable broth and bring to a boil.

A girlfriend of mine gave me this recipe and was raving about it. After I tried it out I wholeheartedly agree - this is my new favorite pumpkin soup. It's made with coconut milk which gives it a delicious subtle flavor and it's vegan to boot!
