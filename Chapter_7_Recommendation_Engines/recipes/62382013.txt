Ingredients:
5 cups sweetened flaked coconut
7 Tbsp. unsalted butter
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 eggs
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 all purpose flour
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
2 cups milk
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup sweetened flaked coconut, toasted

Directions:
For the crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Spray a 9 inch pie plate with cooking spray.  Place 3 cups coconut in a medium bowl.  Melt 5 tbsp. butter.  Pour melted butter over coconut and mix well.  Press mixture into and up the sides of the pie plate.  Bake 25-30 minutes, until crust is golden brown.  Check often to prevent browning.  Sprinkle chocolate chips onto hot crust.  Let sit for 5 minutes until chips are melted.  Carefully spread chocolate over bottom of crust.  Refrigerate crust while you prepare the filling.
For the filling:  In a bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, flour and vanilla until smooth.  Warm milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat until almost simmering.  Whisking constantly, slowly pour hot milk into egg mixture. Return the egg mixture to saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to thicken.  Remove from heat and stir in remaining coconut and 2 tbsp butter.  Let stand 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.   Pour custard into crust.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly onto the top of the custard and chill completely, about 2 hours.
For the topping:  Beat cream until stiff peaks form.  Spread whipped cream over custard and sprinkle with toasted coconut.
