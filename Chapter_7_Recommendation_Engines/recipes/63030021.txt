Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
4 eggs
1/4 c chopped onion
1/4 c canned artichoke hearts, rinsed and drained
1/4 c washed and torn spinach leaves
1/4 c chopped plum tomato
1/4 tsp of ground oregano
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Spray small nonstick skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium heat until hot. Cook and stir onion 2 minutes or until crisp tender.
2. Add artichoke hearts. Cook and stir until heated through. Add spinach and tomato. Toss briefly. Remove from heat. Transfer vegetables to a small bowl.
3. Scramble eggs, oregano, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Pour egg mixture into a greased skillet. Cook over medium heat 5 to 7 minutes; as eggs begin to set, gently lift edges of omelet with spatula and tilt skillet so that uncooked eggs flow underneath.
4. When egg mixture is set, spoon vegetable mixture over half of omelet. Loosen omelet with spatula and fold in half.
5. Slide omelet onto serving plate.
