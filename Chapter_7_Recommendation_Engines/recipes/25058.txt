Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
7/8 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups chopped dried figs
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup confectioners' sugar for rolling

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar until thick and pale. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cloves, cinnamon and allspice; blend into the egg mixture along with the vanilla. Finally fold in the chopped figs and walnuts. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly toasted. When cool, cut into squares and roll the squares in confectioners' sugar.
