Ingredients:
2 c. hash browns
1 can cream of celery soup
3 eggs, slightly beaten
1 lb. sausage, cooked and drained
2/3 c. milk
1 c. Velveeta, cubed or 7 slices of sliced cheese
grated Cheddar cheese
bread crumbs

Directions:
Combine soup, milk, eggs, cheese and hash browns.  Stir in cooked sausage.  Put mixture into greased 9x9-inch casserole dish.  Sprinkle with grated cheese and bread crumbs, if desired.  (I never do this!)  Bake at 350Â° for 45 minutes to an hour.  It can be made ahead and frozen before baking.  If frozen, add 30 minutes to baking time.

Description: 
This recipe came from Marie Wright (my stepmother).  She had us over for breakfast once and served this and the Frozen Fruit Cups.  They were a real hit with us and I use these recipes often because they are easy to make and can be made ahead of time.
