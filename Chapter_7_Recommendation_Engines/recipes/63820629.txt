Ingredients:
28-32 oz stewed or diced tomatoes (or about 3 cups fresh)
30-45 oz kidney beans (do not drain)
30-45 oz baked beans (do not drain)
2-3 Tbsp barbecue rub or sauce (I prefer Pit Master from The Great American Spice Company)
2 tsp garlic powder
2-3 Tbsp chili powder
1-2 Tbsp Backdraft or other habanero-based hot sauce
1/2c brown sugar
1-2 lbs ground beef
1-2 med onions
1-2 cups cubed ham or 1 pound bacon

Directions:
Brown hamburger and onions together. Drain off excess grease.
Fry bacon and cut into pieces (or cook ham and cube).
Combine all ingredients in 5 qt Crock Pot (or stove top pot).
Heat for 2-3 hours until bubbling, stirring every 30 mins.
Let cool briefly and then place in refrigerator.
Leave in fridge overnight, then re-warm to bubbling and simmer for 1 hour. Re-cool and refrigerate for a second night.
On the day that you plan to serve the chili, simmer it on low for at least 4 hours prior to serving and stir every 30 mins.
