Ingredients:
1 mango, diced
1/2 cup diced avocado
1/4 cup chopped red onion
2 tomatoes, chopped
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon honey
1 pound halibut steaks
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
4 Bibb lettuce leaves
4 flour tortillas
4 teaspoons taco sauce

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix mango, avocado, onion, tomatoes, jalapeno pepper, parsley, 2 teaspoons olive oil, lemon juice, and honey in a small bowl.
Brush halibut steaks with 1 teaspoon olive oil; season with salt, black pepper, and garlic salt.
Place halibut on grill and close lid; cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
Place a Bibb lettuce leave atop each tortilla. Divide halibut into 4 portions and nestle into the lettuce leaves. Top with mango mixture and drizzle with taco sauce to serve.

Description: 
Yummy! I love fish tacos! Very good! If I find a cheaper white fish, I will substitute it for the halibut.
