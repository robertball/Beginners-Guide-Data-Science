Ingredients:
1 cup potatoes, peeled & diced
1/4 cup carrots, diced
1/4 cup onions, chopped
1 cup broth from veggies
1/2 cup raw cashews, unsoaked (or 1/2 cup white beans for 3 grams fat per serving of lasagna)
4 Tbsp nutritional yeast flakes
1 Tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp garlic powder
pinch paprika
pinch cayenne (optional)

Directions:
In medium pot, bring about 3 cups of water to a boil. Place potatoes, carrots, and onion in pot and allow to cook until veggies are tender, approximately 15 minutes. Cooking time will vary based on how small the veggies are diced.
When veggies are tender, drain and place them in blender. NOTE: reserve 1 cup of the broth, and add to blender. Add all the remaining ingredients, and blend until smooth.
