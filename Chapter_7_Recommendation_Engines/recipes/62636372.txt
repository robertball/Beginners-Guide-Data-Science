Ingredients:
4 1/4 cups All purpose flour (up to 4 3/4 c.)
1 pkg. Active Dry Yeast
1 1/4 c. Milk
1/3 c. Honey
1/4 c. Butter or Margarine
1 tsp. Salt
2 Eggs

Directions:
Combine 2 cups flour and yeast in a large mixer bowl. Heat milk, honey, margarine and salt just until warm (115 to 120°F) and margarine is almost melted, stirring constantly. Add to flour mixture; add eggs.
Beat at low speed of electric mixer for 30 seconds; scrape sides of bowl constantly. Beat for 3 minutes at high speed. Stir in as much remaining flour as you can mix in with a spoon.
Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead in enough remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 mins). Shape into a ball. Place dough in a greased bowl, then turn it once. Cover dough and let rise in a warm place till double (about 1 hour). Punch dough down; divide in half. Cover again; let rest 10 minutes.
Cut each dough half into 18 equal pieces. Roll into balls, and place in greased 2 1/2-inch muffin pans. Let rise until doubled (about 30 mins).
5. Bake in a 375°F oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from pan. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
I first made these in 2000. These are my favorite dinner rolls! I got the recipe out of a cookbook that famous country singers contributed to. This was sent in by Steve Wariner. You'll have no room for dinner after you start eating these! I make my rolls a bit bigger, so of course my yield is considerably less then recipe states.
