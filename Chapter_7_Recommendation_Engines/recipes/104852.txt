Ingredients:
1 eggplant
2 large potatoes, cut into 3/4 inch cubes
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 teaspoons black mustard seed
1 medium onion, sliced
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground dried turmeric
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
2 teaspoons garam masala
2 teaspoons caraway seed
1/4 cup soy sauce

Directions:
Fill a large bowl with cold water.  Cut the eggplant into 3/4 inch cubes, and immediately place into the water to keep from turning brown.  Pour the oil and mustard seeds into a pot, and place over medium heat.  Cook until the seeds begin to pop, being careful not to burn.  Stir in the onion, and cook until tender.  Sprinkle in the chili powder, turmeric, cumin, coriander, garlic, ginger, garam masala, and caraway seed; cook for a minute or two to release the flavor.
Drain the eggplant, add it to the pot, and fry it for a few minutes.  Pour in the potatoes, and soy sauce, then add enough water to cover.  Turn the heat to high, bring to a boil, then turn heat to low and simmer for approximately 30 minutes until potatoes have cooked.

Description: 
Alu Baigan is a West Indian curry made with potato and eggplant which is served with roti or rice and kadhri.  You can improvise with the ingredients if you are missing some; it tastes great even with just a few spices and hot pepper!  I like my eggplant to be completely mushy.
