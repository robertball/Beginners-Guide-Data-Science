Ingredients:
butter-flavored cooking spray
Cake:
1 (18.25 ounce) package butter cake mix
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant French vanilla pudding mix
2 cups sour cream
1 cup melted butter
5 eggs
1 teaspoon butter-flavored extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon coconut extract
1 (8 ounce) package butterscotch chips
1 (6 ounce) package toffee baking bits
Praline Topping:
1/2 cup butter
8 ounces chopped pecans
1/2 cup corn syrup (such as KaroÂ®)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 (12 ounce) container butter cream frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.
Mix cake mix and pudding mix together in a bowl. Add sour cream, melted butter, eggs, butter-flavored extract, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and coconut extract to cake mix mixture and stir until batter is thoroughly mixed. Fold butterscotch chips and toffee baking bits into batter. Fill the prepared pan 2/3-full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing cake from pan to cool completely.
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add pecans, corn syrup, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to melted butter; cook and stir until mixture is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in frosting; pour over cooled cake.

Description: 
This cake I created when I was packing to move and didn't have all my baking tools handy. I usually bake from scratch, but I used a box mix to start and added in lots of goodies. I called it my 'experiment' and it turned into one of the yummiest cakes I've ever made.
