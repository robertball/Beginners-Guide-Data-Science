Description: 
My daughter spent a brief time in the hospital as a 6 year old many years ago and when the nurses told her she had to eat to go home, this was the only thing she wanted.  Reduce the mayonnaise to 1/4 cup and use only the egg yolks to make deviled eggs, restuffing the whites with the mixture.
