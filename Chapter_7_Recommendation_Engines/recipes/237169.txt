Description: 
I love pizza, but I can no longer eat yeast bread. I can have wheat though, so pasta is still in. To serve my pizza craving, I devised this dish that delivers all the goodness of a supreme combo pizza without the yeast bread.  For a crowd, serve with garlic bread and salad and/or veggies on the side to really stretch this dish.
