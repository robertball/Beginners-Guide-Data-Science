Ingredients:
Loaf of french bread
Butter or margarine, softened
Garlic powder
Garlic salt

Directions:
Cut the french bread horizontally.
Spread the butter/margarine on both cut sides.
Sprinkle enough garlic powder to cover the butter/margarine on both sides of the bread.
Sprinkle the garlic powder SPARINGLY on both sides of the bread - garlic powder is strong,  less is more.
Put both buttered and seasoned sides of the bread together and then cover with aluminum foil.
Put into oven or grill and toast lightly - for about 5-10 minutes or until bread inside has become slightly crisp and golden.
Enjoy!
