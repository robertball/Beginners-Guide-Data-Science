Description: 
I am asked to make this year round, it's no longer just for the holidays. I often have trouble finding cookie crumbs, so I end up using a premade chocolate crust which works just as well. I also use the light options for the filling to save on calories and no one can tell the difference. Can also be garnished with chocolate drizzle or a ganache.
