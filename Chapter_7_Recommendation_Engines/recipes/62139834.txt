Ingredients:
1 3lb. spaghetti squash
2 tbsp. olive oil
1 onion, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 green bell pepper, diced
2 tbps. paprika
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. caraway seeds
black pepper to taste
1 can whole tomatoes, drained
3-4 boneless chicken breasts
OPTIONAL:
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Using a skewer or fork, pierce the skin of the squash in several places. Place the whole thing on a cookie sheet and roast for 45 minutes, then roll it over and roast for an additional 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.
In a large skillet or soup pot, sautee the onions, garlic, bell pepper and spices in the oil over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent. Remove from the pan and set aside.
Add chicken breasts to the pan and cook until well done, then remove and slice on the diagonal. Add the chicken and cooked vegetables back into the pan, adding the tomatoes, and let simmer while you clean out the squash.
Slice the squash in half and scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Using a fork, scrape the long, spaghetti-like strands out of the skin until you've got it all. Add the squash to the pot and stir to combine all the ingredients. Let simmer for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to combine.
You can serve as is, or add 1/2 cup of sour cream for a more creamy flavor.

Description: 
Caraway seed gives this dish a satisfying rye bread taste, and the spaghetti squash makes it healthier than the pasta alternative.
