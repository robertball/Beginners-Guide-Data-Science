Ingredients:
2 pounds beets, peeled and sliced
3 tablespoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons vinegar
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Place the beets into a large saucepan. Pour in enough water to cover the beets by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the beets are easily pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes; drain.
Whisk together the brown sugar, vinegar, water, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a saucepan. Add the beets and the butter, turn the heat to medium, and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil. Cook until the sauce thickens slightly, about a minute or two. The sauce will not be sticky-thick, but will still pour nicely. Serve beets hot or cold.

Description: 
A delicious side dish that can be frozen and used later, if you like.  Just cook them, then bag them up for the freezer. You can cut this recipe in half if you like with no problem. You can also use canned beets, substituting the beet juice in the can for the water.
