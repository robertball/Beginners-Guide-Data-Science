Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm water
2 tablespoons egg replacer
1 cup shredded vegan cheese
1/2 cup grated tofu
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1 cup dry bread crumbs, or more as needed
Sauce:
3/4 cup grape jelly
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix warm water and egg replacer together in a large bowl. Stir in vegan cheese, tofu, nutritional yeast, salt, and garlic powder. Add onion, pecans, Italian seasoning, basil, and sage; mix until well combined. Stir in enough bread crumbs to reach a moist, crumbly texture.
Form mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls and place in an 8-inch baking pan.
Mix grape jelly, ketchup, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, and oregano in a separate bowl. Pour over meatballs.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are firm, 35 to 40 minutes.
