Ingredients:
Crust:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup shortening
4 egg yolks
8 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed
2 tablespoons lemon juice
Filling:
7 cups finely chopped apples
2 cups white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon milk, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine 4 cups flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in shortening with a fork until coarse crumbs form.
Whisk egg yolks, cold water, and lemon juice together in another bowl. Stir into flour mixture with a fork until dough comes together into a ball; divide in half. Roll out 1 half and press into the bottom of a 10x15-inch baking pan.
Combine apples, sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and ground cinnamon in a bowl to make filling. Spread over dough in the pan.
Roll out remaining dough and lay on top of filling. Brush with milk. Cut slits in the dough with a sharp knife.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool before cutting into 24 bars, at least 20 minutes.
