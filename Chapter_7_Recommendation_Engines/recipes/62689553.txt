Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1 cup sliced carrots
1 Potato diced
1/2 frozen green peas
1/2 cup sliced celery
1 cup butter
1/3 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon seasoned black pepper
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 teaspoon thyme
2 TBsp. Parsley
1 quart chicken broth
1-1/3 cup milk
2 (9 inch)  unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
In a saucepan, combine chicken, carrots, potato, and celery. Add chicken broth to cover and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Meanwhile, in the saucepan over medium heat, cook onions in butter until soft and translucent. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, thyme, parsley, and celery seed. Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Add peas, remove from heat and set aside.
Place the chicken mixture in bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly.
Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
