Description: 
I tried to make a lactose and alcohol free version of the famous cocktail and found that my family went crazy for this recipe.  It is fantasitically refreshing and addictive!  This uses coconut cream, a thick mix of pureed coconut and water. Not to be confused with creamed coconut which is a hard concentrate of coconut pulp. Enjoy.
