Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste
1 pound bulk hot Italian sausage, removed from casings and crumbled
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh basil
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)
6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
4 cups chopped kale
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup peeled and chopped yellow potatoes, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium heat until the oil shimmers; cook and stir onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, and black pepper until onion is translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.
Mix sausage, basil, and paprika together in a bowl.
Stir sausage mixture into onion mixture; cook and stir until sausage is browned and fully cooked, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chicken broth, kale, cannellini beans, and potatoes to sausage-onion mixture; lower heat to medium low. Cover stockpot and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
My boyfriend loves this recipe and even prefers it to the Tuscan soup at a well known restaurant! I adapted this from a diabetic-friendly recipe, if you want to make it that way substitute sweet potato for the yellow potato.
