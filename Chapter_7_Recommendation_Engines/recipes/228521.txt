Ingredients:
1 cup light corn syrup
1 cup vegetable shortening
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon clear vanilla extract
1 tablespoon cornstarch, or as needed
1 (32 ounce) package confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Mix corn syrup, vegetable shortening, and salt in a large bowl. Beat in clear vanilla extract and cornstarch. Slowly stir in confectioners' sugar, about 1 cup at a time, mixing in the sugar thoroughly each time before adding the next cup. Fondant will become increasingly stiff; if too sticky, add more cornstarch and confectioners' sugar to make an easily-workable dough.
Turn fondant onto a work surface generously dusted with cornstarch; roll to desired thickness.
