Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups lukewarm water
3 tablespoons olive oil (plus additional for drizzling into the pan)
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
3 1/2 cups All-Purpose Flour
1 tablespoon instant yeast

Directions:
Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan, and drizzle 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil in the bottom.
Combine all of the ingredients except the cheese and garlic, and beat at high speed with an electric mixer for 60 seconds.
Add the cheese and garlic, beating gently just to combine.
Scoop the sticky batter into the prepared pan, cover the pan, and let it rise at room temperature for 60 minutes, till it's become puffy.
While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
Sprinkle the dough with pizza seasoning, and/or the dried herbs of your choice, if desired.
Bake the bread till it's golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.
Remove it from the oven, wait 5 minutes, then turn it out of the pan onto a rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Description: 
Stir up the batter for this easy yeast bread, scoop it into a 9 x 13 pan, and bake up a moist, golden flatbread, studded with melting cheese and chopped garlic. Serve it fresh; or let it rest overnight, then cut into strips and crisp in the oven, to make delightfully crunchy appetizer bread sticks.
