Ingredients:
1 cup butter, divided
1  onion, chopped
2 ½ cups water, divided
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
¾ cup berbere seasoning
1 teaspoon chopped garlic
½ teaspoon ground ginger
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
⅓ cup sweet white wine
½ teaspoon ground cardamom
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4  hard-boiled eggs

Directions:
Heat 1/2 cup butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir onion until translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and tomato paste; stir until hot, about 2 minutes. Stir in remaining butter, berbere, garlic, and ginger. Adjust heat to low and cook until mixture thickens to paste consistency, 20 to 30 minutes.
Stir remaining water into berbere paste; add chicken. Simmer until thickened to sauce consistency, about 45 minutes.
Stir white wine, cardamom, and black pepper into the sauce; add hard-boiled eggs. Cook until sauce is reduced slightly, about 15 minutes more.

Description: 
I love Ethiopian food but had difficulty finding authentic recipes online. I ultimately found 3 or 4 recipes and altered them all to incorporate them together in an attempt to capture the flavors. Typically served with injera and some side vegetable dish. I prefer Atkilt, a cabbage and potato dish, but there are many delicious options.
