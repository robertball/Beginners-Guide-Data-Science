Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 (19 ounce) can ready-to-serve New England clam chowder
1 large onion, chopped
2 eggs
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
3 tablespoons bread crumbs
1 pinch dried parsley, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a small roasting pan with cooking spray.
Combine ground beef, 1/2 can chowder, onion, eggs, celery, bread crumbs, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl; mix until smooth. Mound meatloaf mixture in the prepared roasting pan. Cover pan with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
Remove from oven; pour remaining 1/2 can chowder over top and sides of meatloaf. Return uncovered pan to the hot oven; bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 30 minutes more.

Description: 
A nice, tender, creamy meatloaf! My husband is fairly picky, and he said it's the best meatloaf he's ever tasted! 
I originally based it on my mother's recipe, which called for cream of mushroom soup, but had to change it due to my mushroom allergy.
