Ingredients:
1 - 14.5 oz. box of Gingerbread cake mix
3 cups of Silk Almond Nog (non dairy egg nog)
2 - 1 oz. boxes of Jello sugar free - fat free instant vanilla pudding mix
1 - large container of Cool whip
2 T. gingersnap crumbs (optional)
1/4 cup dried cranberries, chopped (optional)

Directions:
1. Make gingerbread according to package directions...ALMOST....substitute applesauce for the oil, in same amount.  Allow to cool completely.
2. Place the pudding mixes in a large bowl. Pour in the Silk nog and whisk for about 2 minutes.  Refrigerate pudding until the gingerbread is cool, the cool whip is thawed and you are ready to assemble the trifle.
3. Crumble 1/2 of the gingerbread into the bottom of a trifle bowl or a large glass bowl. Spread 1/2 of the pudding over the gingerbread, then spread 1/2 of the cool whip. Repeat layers. Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.  This is better when time is allowed for flavors to meld together.  Decorate top with ginger snap cookie crumbs and cranberries, if desired.
