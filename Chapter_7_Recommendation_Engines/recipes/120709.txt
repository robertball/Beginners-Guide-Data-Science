Ingredients:
1/2 pound bulk pork sausage
1 egg
2/3 cup milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup pancake mix
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup shredded peeled apples
CIDER SYRUP:
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 cup apple cider
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons butter or margarine

Directions:
In a skillet, cook the sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain and set aside. In a bowl, beat the egg, milk and oil. Stir in pancake mix and cinnamon just until moistened. Fold in apple and sausage. Pour batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle; turn when bubbles from on top. Cook until second side is golden brown.
For syrup, combine the sugar, cornstarch and pumpkin pie spice in a saucepan. Gradually stir in cider and lemon juice until smooth.  Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.  Remove from the heat; stir in butter until melted. Serve warm with the pancakes.
