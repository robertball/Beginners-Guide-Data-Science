Amazing Italian Bread Using a Bread Machine Recipe

Ingredients:
1-1/4 c warm water
3 tbs milk (room temp)
3 tbs olive oil
2-1/2 tbs brown sugar
1-1/2 tsp salt
4 c bread flour
2-1/4 tsp active dry yeast OR
1-1/2 tsp quick-rise yeast OR
1 packet (.25 oz) yeast
Optional: 1 to 2 tbs Italian Seasoning or a blend of seasoning, garlic powder and/or Parmesan cheese.

Directions:
Add ingredients (this makes a 2-lb loa) to the bread maker in the order specified. Tip: make a well in the flour down to where the water is and place yeast into the well.
Set the bread maker to the "French Cycle" and choose crust color (I use "medium") and let the machine do its job!
If you'd like to bake this in the oven, use the "Dough" cycle. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees, and sprinkle a baking sheet with corn meal. When dough cycle is completed, divide dough into 2 sections on a floured surface, shape into loaves and place on baking shee. Let sit for about 10 minutes covered with greased plastic wrap. Remove plastic wrap and light mist loaves with water, place in oven and bake for 20 minutes. Rotate the pan, then bake an additional 20-30 minutes, until loaf is nicely browned.

Description: 
This is one of our family's favorite breads. Most of the time I will use the breadmaker from start to finish, but at times the dough is SO handy for mini focaccia or thin garlic sticks, for example. We even like making an olive loaf by adding drained and chopped olives or pepperoni rolls with it. VERY versatile.
