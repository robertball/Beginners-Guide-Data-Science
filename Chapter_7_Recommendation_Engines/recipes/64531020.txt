Take a small measuring cup and pour in olive oil and lemon juice, stir together until combined.
Take a large salad bowl and pour in half of the quinoa. add handful of spinach and stir together. Repeat with handful of strawberries and feta. Add more quinoa and repeat until everything is mixed together.
