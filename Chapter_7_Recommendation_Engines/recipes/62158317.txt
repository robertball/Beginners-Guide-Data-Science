Title:
Crowd Pleasing Crab Rangoon Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 8oz package of cream cheese
1/2 T granulated sugar
1/2 tsp garlic powder
8oz crab meat, flaked
3 green onions, diced
1 package wonton wrappers
Water
Oil for deep frying

Directions:
Heat frying oil to 350 degrees.
Using an electric mixer, whip the cream cheese, sugar and garlic powder to incorporate and introduce some fluffiness.  Mix in the crab and green onions.
Place about 1 tsp of mixture in each wonton wrapper. Seal each rangoon by dipping your finger in water and running along the edges of the wrappers.  Fold into your desired shape and press edges to seal completely.
Fry in batches depending on the size of your deep fryer (usually 4 - 6 at a time) for approximately 3 minutes or until golden.  Overcooking will cause them to burst.  Drain on paper towels.
May be served with sweet and sour, soy, or other asian dipping sauces.

Description: 
I created this recipe to come as close as possible to my favorite Cantonese restaurant's 'Krab Rangoon'.  You can use either imitation, fresh or canned crab meat.  You can also use light cream cheese.  The flavor is still amazing.  Sealing the rangoon in any shape is fine as long as all of the edges are sealed to keep the goodness inside.
