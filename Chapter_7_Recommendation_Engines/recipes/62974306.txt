Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup sugar
1 cup orange juice
1 cup white wine vinegar or champagne vinegar
1/4 cup ginger chopped
1 tablespoon orange zest
1 shallot minced
2 cinnamon sticks
1/8 teaspoon salt
24 ounces of cranberries
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
2 teaspoon mustard seeds

Directions:
In a large saute pan combine sugar, orange juice, vinegar, ginger, orange zest, shallot, cinnamon sticks and salt.  Over high heat bring mixture to a boil, stir so sugar dissolves, continue to stir mixture will thicken 8-10 minutes.  Add cranberries, allow mixture to boil until they pop, another 10 minutes.  Remove from heat.
in a small pan heat oil and add mustard seeds to toast 1-2 minutes using medium heat.  Add mustard seeds to chutney.   Allow to cool. I like this at room temperature but it can be served cold.  I have made it up to 4 days in advance and it keeps beautifully,  After the holiday I have put it over vanilla ice cream, sounds strange but also delicious.
