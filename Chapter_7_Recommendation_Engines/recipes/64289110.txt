2. Drain grease from pan.
3. Add tomato, tomato sauce and remaining spices to skillet.
4. When sauce is warmed through (about 2 minutes) add tomato paste and mix thoroughly.  Then add the zucchini spirals and push down to submerge in sauce.

Description: 
Fooled my husband into eating his vegetables. When fully cooked the texture is like an al dente pasta.  You can turn this vegetarian by omitting the ground beef.
