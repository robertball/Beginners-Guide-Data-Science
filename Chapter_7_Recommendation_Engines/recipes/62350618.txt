Description: 
Growing up my Grams would make these for us in the morning when we would spend the night.  It was her way of making sure everyone got up and going early, if you slept in you might not get one.  This was one of those recipes that seemed to be passed around the church and the neighborhood, as she was a believer in sharing her recipes and her food with friends and family, and the occasional stranger.
