make a well, add beaten eggs.
pour in cream and mix, kneading until you have a nice soft ball.
Roll out thinly, about 1/8 inch thick. cut into rectangles, slitting down the middle, then twisting one end through the slit. (This is the traditional way; I have done letters and cookie cutter shapes for the kids, with same results:) )
