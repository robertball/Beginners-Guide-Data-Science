Ingredients:
3 Quarts Chicken Broth
1.5 lb ground chuck
1 cup raw white rice
2 potatoes - cubed (red or white)
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
2 cloves minced garlic
1 medium onion - diced
1 large red tomato
salt & pepper
1/2 tsp cumin
1 small diced hot pepper
8 oz. pepper jack cheese - cubed
2 hard boiled eggs - cut into small chunks (optional)

Directions:
In a blender blend the tomato with some of the broth.  Add that with remaining broth in a large pot and bring to a boil.
Remove foam as necessary.  Season broth with salt and pepper.
Add cumin, salt and pepper to ground chuck and season to your taste.  Add diced hot pepper to meat and mix.
Take a cube of cheese and chunk of egg and form meatball around it making sure the cheese and egg are sealed in the meat.
Add the meatballs to the boiling broth. It's very important that the broth is boiling so the outside of the meat is cooked fast and the cheese doesn't leak out.
Add all other ingredients, lower to a simmer and cook about 20-30 minutes until the rice and potatoes are done.

My Mother-in-law, who is from Mexico, makes this and it's my husbands favorite.  It's the spanish version of meatballs although it's cooked in a delicious broth instead of tomato sauce. Very filling...enjoy!
