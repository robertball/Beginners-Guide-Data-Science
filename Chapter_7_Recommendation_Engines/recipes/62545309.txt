Description: 
Our pastor's wife, while we were stationed in Hawaii, gave me this recipe. It taste just like the imu pit roast pork, like they serve at luaus. It's really easy to prepare too. I get tons of compliments and requests for the recipe every time I make it. It is really suppose to say 1 handful of rock salt, but the system won't take that as a measurement. I usually halve the recipe, so I'm not real sure how many servings this makes.
