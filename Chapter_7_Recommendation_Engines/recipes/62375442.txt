Ingredients:
Approx. 2  3 quarts left over red beans previously prepared for supper (whatever meat you used to make your red beans, just leave it in there) DO NOT USED CANNED BEANS!
Approx. 2 lbs ground chuck
1 yellow or white onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
3 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro (or 2 tbsp dried)
3 cloves fresh minced garlic (or 3 tbsp granulated garlic)
4 tbsp. adobo seasoning
2 tsp. thyme
2 tsp. oregano
4 tbsp. Season salt
1/3 cup chili powder
¼ cup cumin
2 tbsp. paprika
1 tbsp. basil
2 tsp. dried red pepper flakes
1 can stewed tomatoes, chopped
1/3 cup mild, medium or hot salsa (depending on how hot you want it)
1 cup tomato juice
Cheyenne pepper to taste
Salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
On a medium heat, brown beef in a large skillet with onion, bell pepper, celery and cilantro (if fresh).  Pour off excess grease.  Replace meat mixture to skillet and put back on a medium heat.  Add in all dried ingredients and stir thoroughly.  Then add in the wet ingredients except the red beans.  Again, stir thoroughly.  Place left over red beans in a dutch oven and reheat gently so as not to burn.  Add in the mixture from the skillet, stir thoroughly and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Allow to cool completely, then place in refrigerator over night to blend seasonings.  Reheat the next day and serve.

Description: 
This chili is the best ever and requires an evening of enjoying red beans and rice first.  It uses the left over well seasoned beans with the meat still in it to make the chili better than ever!  The dried ingredients can be altered to taste.
