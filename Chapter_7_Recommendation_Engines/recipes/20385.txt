Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) venison roast
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Louisiana-style hot sauce
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
3 leaves fresh basil, chopped
2 tablespoons fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Slice venison roast into thick 1 inch steaks.
In a saucepan, combine water, chicken broth, olive oil, butter, garlic, and hot sauce; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and stir in vinegar. Season with parsley, basil, rosemary, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring regularly. Allow to cool.
Pour cooled sauce over venison steaks, and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 hours, turning regularly.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Take steaks out of marinade, reserve marinade.
Grill steaks for 7 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. Turn them regularly and make sure you don't over-cook. Mop steaks with reserved marinade while cooking.

Description: 
Most people think you have to take the 'wild' taste out of deer. But really you can keep that good 'game' flavor by using a variety of herbs and spices.
