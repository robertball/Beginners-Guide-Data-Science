Ingredients:
8 pounds Roma (plum) tomatoes, peeled and chopped
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 large onion, minced
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 sprigs fresh basil, or more to taste, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons red wine
coarse salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Puree tomatoes in a food processor until smooth; strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.
Heat olive oil in a large, deep pot over medium heat. Stir strained tomatoes, onion, Parmesan cheese, basil, garlic, and red wine together in the pot with the oil; season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until thickened, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
Homemade tomato sauce that doesn't take hours to make! This sauce can be different every time or can be your own signature sauce, but the basics are the same! Included are directions for using real tomatoes, but if time doesn't permit canned tomatoes will work nicely as well. Enjoy!
