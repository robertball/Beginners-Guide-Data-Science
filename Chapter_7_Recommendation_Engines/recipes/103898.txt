Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large leek, cleaned and thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup Arborio rice
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided
1 cup dry white wine
1/2 pound bay scallops
1/2 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 cup fresh snow peas, trimmed and halved crosswise
1 medium red bell pepper, diced
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons dried basil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat.  Cook the leek and garlic until soft, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the rice, and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring frequently.
Pour in 1 1/2 cups of the chicken broth, and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered for 5 minutes, continuing to stir.  Pour in the remaining chicken broth and wine, increase heat to medium, and cook for about 5 more minutes, stirring constantly.
Add the scallops, shrimp, peas, and red pepper.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the remaining liquid is almost absorbed, and the seafood has cooked, about 5 minutes.  When the rice is just tender and slightly creamy, season with Parmesan cheese, basil, lemon juice, and pepper.
