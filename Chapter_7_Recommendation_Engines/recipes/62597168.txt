Ingredients:
1 Pound spinach
1 Egg yolk
1/4 cup Orange juice
1 tsp. Balsamic vinegar
2 tsp. Tumeric
1/2 tsp. Salt
3 tbsp. Room temp butter
2 tsp. Chopped fresh dill
1 tsp. White vinegar
6 Eggs
3 Whole wheat english muffins
2 Beefsteak tomatoes (sliced)

Directions:
In a medium pot fill with water and bring to a boil. Add spinach and cook for 3 min. Stir several times. Then drain, place a plate on top of the spinach to drain all the water out completely.
Next you need a double boiler, Take a pot and fill about half way with water and bring to a boil. Put a heat safe bowl on top of the pot, and make sure it does not touch the boiling water. Now put the egg yolk in the bowl, also add orange juice and stir till blended. Now stir in balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, tumeric, salt, softened butter, and Fresh dill. Whisk until all ingredients are blended and the sauce becomes a creamy consistency (about 2 mins.)
Now remove bowl from double boiler and set aside.
Pour the white vinegar into the pot of boiling water. Gently crack the eggs one by one into the boiling water and poach for about 3 mins. Remove eggs with a slotted spoon so excess water can drain out.
Transfer eggs to a warm plate and cover.
Toast your english muffins, and  then add a slice of tomatoe to each muffin and some cooked spinach. Then place a poached egg and drizzle the orange dill sauce on top. And then enjoy!
