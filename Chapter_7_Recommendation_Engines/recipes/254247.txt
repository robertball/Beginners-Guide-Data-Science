Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup frozen corn
1 tablespoon ketchup
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups prepared instant mashed potatoes
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Cook and stir beef and onion in a skillet over medium-high heat until beef is browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Reduce heat to low. Stir mushroom soup, corn, ketchup, and pepper into beef mixture; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Divide beef mixture into four 4-inch round baking pans; spread prepared mashed potatoes over beef mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Sprinkle Cheddar cheese evenly over pies. Place pies on a baking sheet.
Broil until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. Allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving.
