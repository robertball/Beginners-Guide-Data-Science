Greek Lemon Soup Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
8 cups of water
2-3 tablespoons of Better Than Bouillon, Superior Touch, Vegetable Base
1 pound chopped leeks, white and light green parts only, cleaned and sliced thin
2/3 cup jasmine rice
4 large brown eggs
3 lemons, juiced, or about 6-8 tablespoons (see note)
1 tablespoon dill for garnish, dry is fine

Directions:
Note: The more lemon juice you use, the saltier and lemon-ier this soup will taste. Start with 6 tablespoons to start and taste before adding in the last two. I enjoyed the 6 tablespoons.
In a Dutch oven, combine the vegetable stock and leeks and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the rice and continue to stir to make sure it does not stick to the bottom of the Dutch over. Simmer until cooked through, 30-45 minutes. Remove from heat.
In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and lemon juice together until combined.  If you add the eggs directly into the pot, the eggs will curdle so slowing  ladle broth from the pot and pour slowly into the egg mixture, whisking while pouring. Add one more ladle of broth to the eggs and whisk to combine. Then pour the egg mixture into the large pot of soup.
Garnish with dill after serving.
