Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
12 ½ ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
3 ½ ounces carrots, julienned
3 ½ ounces white onion, thinly sliced
3 ½ ounces red onion, thinly sliced
2  bay leaves
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon salt
¼ cup red wine vinegar
¼ cup dry white wine
¼ cup water
1 teaspoon achiote powder
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Heat oil over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven. Add chicken to the hot oil and brown on 1 side, about 5 minutes. Flip chicken; add carrots, white onion, red onion, bay leaves, garlic, black pepper, and salt. Mix until vegetables have softened and chicken has browned, about 8 minutes.
Pour red wine vinegar, white wine, and water into the Dutch oven. Sprinkle with achiote powder and cayenne; stir well. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes.

Description: 
Chicken breasts, onions, and carrots stew in vinegar and wine for a tangy South American escabeche meal. This is delicious served over rice or quinoa. This dish can be served immediately but it is even better if served at room temperature after the flavors have had some time to meld.
