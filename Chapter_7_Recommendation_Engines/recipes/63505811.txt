Ingredients:
Chili:
1 1/2  lbs uncooked chicken breast (can be frozen) cut into 1-2? chunks
2  15 oz cans of white beans
1  15 oz can of white corn
1 onion chopped (sweet/Vidalia)
1 clove garlic finely chopped (I love garlic so I used 2)
1 package taco seasoning
1  7 oz can of chopped green chilies
1 can cream of chicken soup
1  14 oz can of chicken broth
Toppings:
1/2 cup sour cream (I used low fat)
2 tbls lime juice
Finely chopped cilantro
Fresh shredded cheese (I used Colby-Jack)
Corn tortilla chips (the authentic yellow kind)

Directions:
Place cut up chicken in the bottom of the Crock Pot.  Add beans, corn and onion.  Mix the next five ingredients and pour over the top.  Cover and cook on low in the Crock Pot for 8-10 hours.  (I was running low on time so I cooked mine on low for about 4 1/2 hours and then raised it to high for the last two hours).
Before serving use a potato masher to break up the chicken.  (Make sure you do this very quickly with pressure and alternating directions… the consistency should change from brothy with chunks of meat and beans to a very thick and even consistency.  If it is still brothy, keep mashing).
Add shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, a splash of lime juice, cilantro and chips before serving.  YUM!
