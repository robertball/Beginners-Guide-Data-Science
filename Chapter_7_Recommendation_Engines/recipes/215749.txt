Ingredients:
1 (1.1 oz) package chai tea powder
3/4 cup hot water
1/4 cup Chardonnay wine
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg yolk
1/2 cup frozen unsweetened raspberries
1 tablespoon butter, room temperature
1/2 cup bread flour
1/4 cup rye flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup wheat bran
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
1/2 teaspoon caraway seed
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon coarse smoked salt flakes

Directions:
Prepare the chai tea using one packet or two tablespoons of dry mix stirred into 3/4 cup hot water. Allow to cool for about 10 minutes.
Combine the chai tea, Chardonnay, vanilla extract, egg yolk, frozen raspberries, and butter in the pan of a bread machine. Add the bread flour, rye flour, all-purpose flour, wheat bran, yeast, walnuts, caraway seed, sugar, and salt.
Select the "Sweet" setting with a "Light Crust" and press Start. When the bread has finished baking, allow it to cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving.

Description: 
This bread machine cake is very moist, but not exactly a coffee cake. This bread was an experiment that turned out to be pretty good for breakfast (or as a snack/dessert). I topped my pieces with strawberry cream cheese. But I'm sure you could put any number of things on top to help you satisfy your sweet tooth. Enjoy!
