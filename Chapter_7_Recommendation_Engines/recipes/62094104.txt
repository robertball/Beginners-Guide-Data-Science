Ingredients:
1 1/2 tbsp. veg. oil
3 med. thinly sliced Vidalia onions
4 cups Campbell's Beef Broth (3 cans)
1/2 cup water
1 1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. garlic salt
1/4 tsp. black pepper
French Baguette bias cut into 1/2 inch pieces
thick slices of a good Gruyere

Directions:
Heat the oil in a soup or stock pot over medium high heat.  Add the onions and saute about twenty minutes until translucent but not brown. (Use whatever type onions you prefer, but Vidalia onions add a touch of sweet flavor.) Add the beef broth, water, salt, garlic salt and black pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer (either uncovered or with the lid cocked open) for forty five minutes.  Place foil on a sturdy cookie sheet (to easier cleanup and prevents burning of any spillage), place your oven safe bowls on the foil and ladle the soup into them.  Arrange your baguette slices on top of the soup and place your gruyere on top of them. If desired, sprinkle the cheese with a little paprika for color.  Put your oven rack in the middle position and place the cookie sheet on it, under your broiler, until the cheese melts. Great for either summer or winter.
