Ingredients:
2 (8 oz. ea.) pkgs. cream cheese, softened
1 20 oz. can crushed pineapple, drained very, very well
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
1/2 cup chopped green onion (green part only)
2 cups chopped pecans, divided
1 tsp lemon pepper seasoning
1 tsp seasoned salt

Directions:
Beat cream cheese until smooth. Add drained pineapple, green pepper, green onion, 1/2 cup pecans, and seasonings. Mix well.  Turn out onto plastic wrap and shape into a ball. Wrap well in plastic wrap and refrigerate several hours or overnight. Roll in remaining pecans before serving. Serve with crackers.
*Note--if you do not drain the pineapple enough, you will end up with a dip...but it still tastes good!

Description: 
This is an addictive cheeseball that I usually just serve with crackers. The recipe makes a large cheeseball but there is never much left at pitch-ins. The ingredients may seem like they don't go well together but I highly recommend trying it. I got this recipe from Taste of Home magazine several years ago.
