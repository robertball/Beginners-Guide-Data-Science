Ingredients:
3 large Granny Smith apples or 5 small apples
(You may also use one large can of apple pie filling)
2  cans of cinnamon rolls
3/4 C sugar
3 T flour
1 tsp cinnamon
1 egg

Directions:
Arrange unbaked cinnamon rolls in an ungreased pie pan, beginning with one roll in center and the remaining rolls surrounding it. Press rolls flat to cover entire surface and up the sides  of pan.
Beat the egg in a small bowl and brush the surface of your cinnamon roll crust.
If using fresh apples, slice them thinly and toss with remaining ingredients.
Place apples or filling into cinnamon roll lined pie pan.
Arrange second can of rolls in a circle onto parchment or wax paper and place more paper on top. Roll the dough flat to make a top crust.
Remove top sheet of paper, lift the dough with bottom paper attached, and flip onto the top of your pie filling. Peel paper off and press top crust into the edges of bottom crust to form a seal.
Don't worry if there are holes, they are needed for venting steam.
Brush top crust with egg wash.
Bake in oven at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.
When cool, drizzle both batches of icing over the top of pie.
Brush top crust with the egg wash.
