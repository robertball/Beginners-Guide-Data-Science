1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoons sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg

1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 dashes liquid smoke

Directions:
Combine the dry rub mixture ingredients and rub all over the roast.
Combine the vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, mix well.
Place the onions in the bottom of the crock pot, reserving one fourth to top the roast. Place roast fat side up on top of onions and top with the remainder onions and minced garlic. Drizzle the liquid over the roast.
Cook on high one hour, then turn to low for 7-8 hours, or low for 8-10 hours, depending on cooker.
Return shredded pork to the crock pot, stir in barbecue sauce and heat on low or warm for at least another 30 minutes.
Serve on warm buns or crusty hard rolls, top with more barbecue sauce if desired.

Description: 
After trying several slow cooker pulled pork recipes I have tweaked and tweaked until we finally all agree this one taste the closest to what we get in the Carolinas. Sweet and slightly spicy with just the right amount of tang. I also change it up to use for Mexican dishes, since we love pork enchiladas and soups. This pork won't be swimming in too much liquid when done, but still moist and delicious. I like to put the rub on the night before to let the flavor sink deep into the meat.
