Ingredients:
Preferment:
1 cup milk
1/2 cup sourdough starter
2 cups all-purpose flour
Dough:
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon cornmeal, or as needed

Directions:
Stir milk and sourdough starter together in a large bowl until mostly smooth. Mix in flour. Cover bowl and leave to ferment at room temperature, 8 hours to overnight.
Add sugar, baking soda, and salt to the preferment, stirring just enough to incorporate. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for 4 to 5 minutes, adding as much of the 1/2 cup flour as needed to make the dough workable.
Use a rolling pin to flatten dough to an even 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into 4-inch rounds using a clean tuna can or biscuit cutter; keep edges well floured to avoid sticking.
Sprinkle a thin layer of cornmeal over a sheet of waxed paper. Arrange cut-outs over the cornmeal. Sprinkle a thin layer over the dough. Let rest for 45 minutes.
Heat a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Cook English muffins until lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
Here is an easy recipe that makes muffins much better than store-bought and is also a good way to use your extra sourdough. I found this recipe on a website called 'The Fresh Loaf' and tweaked a few of the details based on my experience. There is some amount of planning ahead needed as you have to start the night before, but it is definitely worth it.
