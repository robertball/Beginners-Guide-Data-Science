Ingredients:
1/4 cup quinoa
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 (16 ounce) package ground turkey
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon garlic & parsley granules
2 tablespoons whole wheat breadcrumbs
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon water

Directions:
Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. (Add some bouillon to add more flavor to quinoa.) Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, and the water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir the turkey, cooked quinoa, tomato paste, breadcrumbs,garlic & parsley granules (and any other seasonings you like), 2 tablespoons Worcestershire, egg, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well combined. The mixture will be very moist. Shape into a loaf on a foil lined baking sheet. Combine the 2 teaspoons Worcestershire and 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl. Rub the paste over the top of the meatloaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 50 minutes. Let the meatloaf cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
