Description: 
By using a little egg and a touch of finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese instead of a breadcrumb binder, I was able to make farro cakes that didn't fall apart in the skillet. The key is letting the first side cook until a well-browned, crispy surface forms, then you can flip them.
