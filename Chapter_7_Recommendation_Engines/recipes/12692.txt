Ingredients:
8 ounces semisweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon instant coffee powder
1 tablespoon boiling water
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1/4 cup frozen whipped topping, thawed
1 (9 inch) pie shell

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a double boiler, over hot (not boiling) water, melt chocolate morsels; stir until smooth, and set aside.
In a cup, dissolve coffee in 1 tablespoon boiling water.
In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar together until smooth.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add melted chocolate and coffee; mix well, then blend in frozen whipped topping.
Pour mixture into pie shell and bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Turn oven off and allow pie to stand in oven with door ajar for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool. Refrigerate 20 to 30 minutes before serving. Garnish with whipped topping and chocolate curls just prior to serving, if desired.
