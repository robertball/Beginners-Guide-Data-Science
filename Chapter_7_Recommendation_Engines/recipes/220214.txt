Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 (12 ounce) pork tenderloins
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Spray a baking dish with cooking spray. Arrange pork tenderloins in the baking dish.
Mix together bread crumbs, parsley, Parmesan cheese, thyme, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; set aside.
Stir mustard and garlic together in a bowl. Spread mustard mixture over the pork.
Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture over the mustard coating.
Bake pork in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Allow pork to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
