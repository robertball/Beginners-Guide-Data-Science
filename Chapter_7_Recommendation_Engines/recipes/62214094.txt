Ingredients:
vegetable oil
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons garlic salt
1 TABL. garlic powder
2 tsp. onion powder
1 tsp. paprika
3 tablespoons ground black pepper
4 eggs, beaten
8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into small chunks

Directions:
Heat 1 inch oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large skillet or saucepan.
Stir together the flour, garlic salt, and pepper in a bowl. Dip the chicken pieces individually into the beaten eggs before pressing into the flour mixture to coat; shake off the excess flour. Place the coated chicken pieces onto a plate until all the chicken has been coated.
Cook the chicken in batches in the hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink in the center.
