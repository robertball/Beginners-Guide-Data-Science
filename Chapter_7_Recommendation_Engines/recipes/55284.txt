Ingredients:
1/4 pound margarine
2 medium yellow onions, finely chopped
3 quarts water
1 3/4 pounds fresh or frozen haddock fillets, thawed and cut into 1/2 inch pieces
5 medium white potatoes, 1/2 inch dice
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups non-dairy creamer

Directions:
In a large stock pot, melt margarine over medium high heat. Cook and stir chopped onion until translucent, but not darkened. Carefully add 3 quarts of water, increase heat to high, and bring to a low boil. Once boiling, stir in diced haddock and potatoes. Reduce heat to medium, and cook at a low boil for 30 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Remove pot from heat, and allow to cool until mildly warm.
Stir non-dairy creamer into cooled soup, slowly and thoroughly to avoid lumps from forming. Season to taste with salt. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight, to develop flavors.
To serve, reheat on the stove or in the microwave. Adjust seasoning as needed with salt. Serve with soda crackers and sweet pickles.

Description: 
This is a hardy fish chowder that is low in fat and still rich tasting. While it is easy to prepare, it is not a spur-of-the-moment dish since it must sit overnight to bring out the full flavor. Fat-free margarine and creamer may be used without sacrificing flavor.
