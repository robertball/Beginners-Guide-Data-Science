Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 bunch green onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups heavy whipping cream
2 cups milk
2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 (16 ounce) box dry fettuccine pasta
2 grilled chicken breasts, cubed, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat butter in a large pot over medium-high heat and add green onions and garlic. Cook until butter is simmering and onions and garlic are softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add flour and stir for 1 minute. Stir in heavy cream, milk, Parmesan cheese, and mushrooms. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer until sauce looks thick and creamy, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Stir chicken into sauce mixture and heat through, 3 to 5 minutes, to avoid overcooking.
Serve chicken Alfredo sauce over cooked pasta.

Description: 
This is one of my absolute favorite Alfredo dishes with mushrooms. My mom always used to make it, and I made it recently for some of my college friends and they were dying over it! It's very easy and, I have yet to meet a person who doesn't like this recipe!
