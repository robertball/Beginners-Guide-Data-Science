Ingredients:
6 cups water
6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided
4 large artichokes (about 1 pound each)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup sliced shallots
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups dry white wine
1 tablespoon capers
1 (16 ounce) can fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
1 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Combine water and 2 tablespoons juice. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, cut off stem to within 1 inch of base; peel stem. Remove bottom leaves and tough outer leaves, leaving the tender heart and bottom. Remove fuzzy thistle from bottom with a spoon; discard. Cut artichoke into quarters lengthwise. Place artichoke quarters in lemon water. Repeat procedure with remaining artichokes. Drain.
Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add shallots; saute 2 minutes. Add garlic; saute 30 seconds. Add artichoke quarters. Reduce heat; cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add 1/4 cup lemon juice, wine, capers, and broth; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes. Uncover and simmer 15 minutes. Stir in parsley.

Description: 
Capers give this dish a pungent, briny flavor. Look for them near the olives in your supermarket. Try serving the artichokes with French bread or grilled polenta.
