Ingredients:
1/2 (17.3 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1/4 cup butter
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1/4 cup maple syrup
4 firm pears - peeled, cored, and halved, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Roll puff pastry out on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness; place in the refrigerator.
Melt butter in a 9-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat; stir in brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg and cook and stir until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Stir maple syrup into brown sugar mixture; cook, stirring, until mixture begins to bubble. Remove skillet from heat.
Place one pear half, cut side up, into the center of skillet. Cut remaining pear halves in half again; arrange pear quarters around the center pear, cut sides up.
Place skillet over medium-low heat; cook pears, basting with syrup mixture, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
Remove puff pastry from refrigerator; place pastry over pears, tucking edges of pastry around pears inside skillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is puffed and golden, about 20 minutes; allow to cool for 5 minutes. Place a serving plate over skillet; invert to remove tart (skillet will still be hot). Serve warm.
