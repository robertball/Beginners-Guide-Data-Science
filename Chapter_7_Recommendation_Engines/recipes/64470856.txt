Ingredients:
3 tablespoons of butter
6 cups of rice cereal
2 packages of large marshmallows (one for recipe, one for snacking/marshmallow fights)
Warm, fuzzy feelings (not optional)

Directions:
In a large saucepan, melt the butter.
Add one bag of marshmallows, and stir constantly, thinking about how fun scavenger hunts are.
When the marshmallows are melted and look like clouds, add the rice cereal.
Stir until rice cereal is completely coated in the marshmallows.
Remove from heat.
Eat by the spoonful while feeling good about yourself!
