Description: 
A variation of a dish from Spain, this is a unique and very special recipe that I make when company is coming.  Gradually stocking up on the more expensive ingredients makes less impact on the budget, and it's all worth it when I hear the oohs and aahs of our friends.  Even my husband, who is not a chicken-lover, raves about this dish.
