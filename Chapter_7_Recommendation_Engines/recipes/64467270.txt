Ingredients:
8 ounces Chinese wheat noodles, udon noodles, or soba noodles
4 green onions, sliced
¼ cup pickled mustard greens or pickled cabbage*
1 ½ teaspoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
1 teaspoon chili paste
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook them according to the directions, until they are slightly soft. Drain the water and set the noodles to the side.
Over medium-high heat, add the green onion and pickled greens to a wok. Cook for about 1 minute. Remove them from the wok. Add the soy sauce, vinegar, chili paste, and noodles to the wok, and cook them for about 30 seconds.
Plate each serving with half of the noodles, and garnish them with the cooked green onions, pickled greens, and sesame seeds.
