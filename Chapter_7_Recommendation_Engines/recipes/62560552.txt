Ingredients:
1 scallion, minced
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1 pound center-cut salmon fillet, skinned and
cut into 4 portions
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds (See Tip)**

Directions:
Whisk scallion, soy sauce, vinegar, honey and ginger in a medium bowl until the honey is
dissolved. Place salmon in a sealable plastic bag, add 3 tablespoons of the sauce and
refrigerate; let marinate for 15 minutes. Reserve the remaining sauce.
Preheat broiler. Line a small baking pan with foil and coat with cooking spray.
Transfer the salmon to the pan, skinned-side down. (Discard the marinade.) Broil the
salmon 4 to 6 inches from the heat source until cooked through, 6 to 10 minutes. Drizzle with
the reserved sauce and garnish with sesame seeds.
**"Tip" To toast sesame seeds, heat a small dry skillet over low heat. Add seeds and stir
constantly, until golden and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool.
