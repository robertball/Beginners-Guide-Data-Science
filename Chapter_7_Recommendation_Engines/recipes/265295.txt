Ingredients:
8 ounces enoki mushrooms
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 large clove garlic, finely chopped
1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce (such as BraggÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger

Directions:
Cut the bottom 2 inches off the mushrooms and discard. Separate the mushroom strands gently.
Heat oil in a medium-sized nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until just fragrant, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and stir-fry until they begin to wilt, about 2 minutes. Add soy sauce and ginger; toss to coat. Cook 1 to 2 minutes more.
