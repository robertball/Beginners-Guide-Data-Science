Description: 
This will make an excellent desert for the holidays. Give them cranberries in a whole new way. I don't know how anyone can't love this dish.
 
I was going make a Martha Stewart Cherry Clafouti, but the grocery store was out of cherries. I also needed cherry liquor, but the liquor store was closed. I did have cranberries and Grand Marnier which sounded really good. I was right on the money. It's fantastic, probably better than the cherry version. The cranberries add a nice tartness to the dish. I hope you like it.
