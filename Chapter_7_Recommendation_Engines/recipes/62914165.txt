Ingredients:
1 cup splenda
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup milk
1/4 cup margarine, melted
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups.
Combine flour. splenda and baking powder in a small bowl.
Mix  1/2cup melted butter  and nutmeg in a large bowl. Stir in the milk, then mix in the flour mixture until just combined. Fill the prepared mini muffin cups about three-fourths full.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
While muffins are baking, place 1/4 cup of melted margarine in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of sugar with the cinnamon. Remove muffins from their cups and let cool 5 minutes, dip each muffin in the melted margarine, and gently shake in the sugar-cinnamon mixture. They taste like a fresh homemade old fashioned donut.
