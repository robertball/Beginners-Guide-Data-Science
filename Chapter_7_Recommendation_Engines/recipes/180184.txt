Ingredients:
1 cup creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle WhipÂ®)
2 tablespoons white sugar
5 (15 ounce) cans baby peas, drained
1/2 cup finely chopped green bell pepper (optional)
1 head iceberg lettuce, torn into bite-sized pieces
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
bacon bits

Directions:
Stir together salad dressing and sugar in a large salad bowl or 9x13 glass baking dish until sugar is dissolved. Add peas and chopped green pepper, if desired, and mix lightly to combine.  Spread the pea mixture evenly across the bottom of the dish.
Spread the lettuce in an even layer over the pea mixture, and top the lettuce with a layer of the Cheddar cheese.  Sprinkle bacon bits over the cheese.
Chill for at least 8 hours or overnight to blend flavors.
