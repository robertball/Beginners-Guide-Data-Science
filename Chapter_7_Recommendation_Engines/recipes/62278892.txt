Ingredients:
2 Pounds chicken wings (about 12 wings)
1 Stick butter, melted
1/4 Cup brown sugar
1/4 Cup bottled hot pepper sauce (I usually use Frank’s Original)
3 Tablespoons Tabasco sauce (Tabasco has the vinegar kick you need)
2 Cloves garlic, minced
1 Teaspoon onion powder
1 Tablespoon paprika
1/4 Teaspoon chili powder
1 Teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 Teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 Teaspoon salt
1/4 Teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
If wings are frozen, make sure they’re completely thawed. Rinse and pat dry. Cut off wing tips (I save the tips for stock).
Add the wings to the sauce mixture and coat evenly. Cover and marinate for at least two hours.
Place the coated wings on a baking sheet lined with wax paper. Place the baking sheet in the middle of the rack and bake for 20 minutes. Flip the wings over and bake for another 20 minutes.
Putting It All Together
Transfer the wings to a service dish or plate. Drizzle the 3 tablespoons of reserved sauce over the wings. Toss to make sure the wings are coated.
Serve with celery and carrots sticks and blue cheese dipping sauce.

Description: 
Haes’ Super Bowl Hot Wings is always a hit. It’s crazy spicy, sweet and has a wonderful zip. Be sure to serve it with bleu cheese or ranch dressing to offset the spiciness. They're so tasty, you don't realize you have sauce on your cheeks, elbow, ears and the front of your shirt.
