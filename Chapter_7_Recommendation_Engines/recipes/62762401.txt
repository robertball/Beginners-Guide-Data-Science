Ingredients:
Crust
3 tbsp (45 mL) cocoa powder
1 tbsp (15 mL) confectioners sugar
1 1/4 cups (300 mL) all purpose flour
1/2 cup (125 mL) butter
1 egg
Filling
1 package (259 g) dark chocolate chips
1 tub (475 g) Tre Stelle® Mascarpone
2/3 cup (150 mL) granulated sugar
3 eggs
1 tbsp (15 mL) orange liquer (Grand Marnier, Triple Sec)

Directions:
Crust: Combine cocoa, sugar, flour and butter in a food processor, blend until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add the egg and blend briefly to combine. Roll out the crust
on a floured surface and place in an 8” loose bottom tart pan. Prick pastry liberally with a fork and chill for one hour.
Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
Bake crust for 15 minutes, remove from oven and set on a rack to cool.
Reduce oven temperature to 300ºF (150ºC).
Filling: Place chocolate chips in a double boiler to slowly melt; remove from heat. In a large bowl, beat Mascarpone with the sugar and eggs until smooth. Add the melted chocolate and orange liquer; stir to combine. Pour the filling into the tart pan and bake for 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool. Best served slightly warm.
