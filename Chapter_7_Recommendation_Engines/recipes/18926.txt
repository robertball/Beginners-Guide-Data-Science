Description: 
This is a delicious cocktail which tastes just like summer in a glass! Its also pretty lethal because it tastes so innocently alcohol free!  You can make up a big bowl of it by just chucking a bottle of each spirit and a carton of each juice into a punch bowl.  Adding a bottle of sparkling wine gives it some fizz -- and an extra kick!
