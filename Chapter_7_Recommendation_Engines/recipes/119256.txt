Ingredients:
6 ounces uncooked spaghetti
1/2 cup egg substitute
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
3 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese
1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons butter or stick margarine
2 cups meatless spaghetti sauce
1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Cook spaghetti according to package directions; drain. Add the egg substitute and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of a 9-in. deep-dish pie plate coated with nonstick cooking spray. In a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sour cream, green pepper and remaining Parmesan cheese. Spread over spaghetti crust.
In a nonstick skillet, saute mushrooms and garlic in butter until tender. Spoon over cheese mixture. Spread with spaghetti sauce. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese; bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Let stand for 10-15 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
Pasta shows its versatility as a 'pie crust' in Carol Beyerl's family-pleasing main dish. 'This is a combination of several recipes. I came up with it when I didn't have all the ingredients to make any one of them,' she writes from Ellensburg, Washington. A nice alternative to lasagna, the saucy entree doesn't taste light.
