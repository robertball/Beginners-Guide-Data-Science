Ingredients:
1 cup sliced carrots
3 tablespoons minced onion
4 1/2 cups water
2 teaspoons salt
2 cups uncooked long grain white rice
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup half-and-half cream
3/4 cup butter

Directions:
In a large saucepan, combine carrots, onion, water, and salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in rice. Reduce heat to low, and cover pan. Allow to steam for 20 minutes.
Stir sugar, half-and-half, and butter into rice mixture. Consistency should be creamy, not dry. Stir in some milk if necessary. Remove from heat, and serve immediately.

Description: 
Creamy rice and sweet, buttery carrots go with just about any meal. This recipe was a specialty of my mother's. It has been served in our family for Thanksgiving and Christmas for over 25 years, but it can be served anytime. It is very rich and quite delish.
