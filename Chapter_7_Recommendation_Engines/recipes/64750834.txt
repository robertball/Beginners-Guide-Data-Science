Ingredients:
6 slices of bacon, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
1.5 lb. ground beef
Salt and pepper to taste
1-2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 c. ketchup
1 Tbsp. yellow mustard
1 tsp. Worcester sauce
4-6 oz. cheddar cheese slices
2 packages (8 count each) crescent rolls
2 Tbsp. melted butter
Sesame seeds
Sliced plum tomatoes and dill pickle slices, if desired.

Directions:
Cook chopped bacon in a large skillet until just crispy. Remove from pan to a paper towel and drain.
Cook onion in bacon drippings until just translucent.  Add ground beef to pan and brown, breaking up into very small pieces.  Drain fat.
Add bacon back to pan. Add ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire, garlic, salt and pepper and mix thoroughly, heating through.
Arrange crescent rolls on large pizza stone, wide side towards the middle of pan, point facing out and hanging about halfway off of the edge.  Crescent rolls should overlap one another slightly.
Place a scoop of the meat filling on each roll, then place cheese slices on meat. Bring point of crescent up and over filling and tuck under.   Brush rolls with melted butter and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Bake in 350 degree oven for 15-18 minutes until crescents are nicely browned and cooked though.
Arrange sliced tomatoes and dill pickles on a small plate and place in the center for serving if desired.
