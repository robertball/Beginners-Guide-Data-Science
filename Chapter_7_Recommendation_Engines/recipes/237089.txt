Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups hot water
1 cup red lentils
1 large onion, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon spicy Dijon mustard, or more to taste
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine water and lentils in a saucepan; bring to a boil and cook until the water is completely absorbed and the lentils tender yet holding form, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer lentils to a large bowl and let cool.
Stir onion, cilantro, garlic, mustard, cumin, parsley, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes into the lentils; add flour as needed to help absorb excess moisture and bind ingredients together. Shape lentil mixture into 4 patties.
Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat.
Cook burgers in the hot skillet until firm and hot in the center, 4 to 7 minutes per side.

Description: 
Red lentils are my favorite. I was craving something lentil-y and found a recipe that 

was just what i wanted after I changed it up a little. I topped them with cherry tomatoes and garlic sprouts. I will totally make this again, it was so amazing!
