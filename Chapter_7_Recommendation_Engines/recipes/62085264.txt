Ingredients:
6 large halves /or 2.5 lbs. boneless chicken breasts
Sauce:
2 Tbsp. butter
2 Tbsp. flour
1 cup milk
1 cup white or rosé wine
salt and pepper to taste
Crab topping:
¼ cup finely chopped red bell pepper
¼ cup finely chopped green onion
1 cup mayonnaise
2 tsp. Lemon juice
1 pkg “Old Bay ~ Crab Cake Classic” mix (1.24oz.)
1 tsp. celery seed or ¼ cup finely chopped celery
1 Tbsp. finely chopped parsley
1 pound can (refrigerated) claw crabmeat
paprika

Directions:
Lay chicken breasts in a 13” x 9” pyrex baking dish and bake at 350° for 15-20 mins. [depending on thickness]   While baking, prepare white sauce with wine by melting butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add flour and stir until the butter and flour are well combined. Pour in milk, stirring constantly as it thickens. Add wine ½ cup at a time stirring in well and keeping sauce thick.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Remove from heat.
In a bowl, combine all ingredients for crab topping, mixing together well.
Remove chicken from oven and drain juices.  Pour wine sauce around chicken but not over top of it.  Spoon crab mixture on top of each piece, using it all.  Sprinkle with paprika, returning to oven for another 20 mins. at 350°.  If it looks like it’s getting too brown, cover with foil.
