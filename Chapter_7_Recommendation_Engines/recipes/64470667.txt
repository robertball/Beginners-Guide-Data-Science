Ingredients:
FOR THE CREAMED SPINACH:
1	large bag of spinach leaves
4	ounces cream cheese
¼	C shredded parmesan cheese
2	cloves garlic, minced
3	T red onion, minced
2	T olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
FOR THE SAUTEED MUSHROOMS:
8 ounce package of mushrooms, sliced
½	stick butter
2	T olive oil
½	C white wine
2	cloves garlic, minced
Salt and pepper to taste
FOR THE CHICKEN:
4-5	boneless chicken breasts
8-10	slices Mozzarella cheese, cut into ? inch slices
1	T garlic powder
1	T seasoned salt, like Lawry's
1	teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Sprinkle the garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper on both sides of the chicken.  Bake for 16 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the creamed spinach.  Over medium-high heat, melt 2 T olive oil in a skillet.  Add in the onions and saute 2-3 minutes.  Add in the spinach and garlic.  It will shrink ridiculously.  When it's cooked through, stir in the cream cheese and parmesan cheese.  Continue cooking and stirring until the cream cheese is melted.  Remove from heat.
For the mushrooms, melt butter and 2 T olive oil in a skillet.  Put the mushrooms in and cook until browned all over.  Don't season with salt until they are browned or they will never brown.  Deglaze the pan with the wine.  Add in the garlic and season with salt and pepper.  Cook until most of the wine is cooked out.
When the first 16 minutes' cooking time was done, turn the breasts over with tongs and lay them flat again, pile on the spinach mixture, mushrooms, and slices of cheese.  Then return them to the oven and finished cooking them.
