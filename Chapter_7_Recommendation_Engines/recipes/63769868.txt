Ingredients:
3 cups sugar
5 sticks of softened butter
2 tsp vanilla
3 eggs
8 oz. cream cheese at room temperature
8 cups flour
16 oz semi sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In an extra large mixing bowl cream together sugar and butter until smooth.
Add vanilla and eggs and beat until light and fluffy.
Add cream cheese and beat until well mixed.
Slowly add flour.
Stir in chocolate chip cookies
Place parchment paper on a cookie sheet. Spoon cookie mix onto paper. Roughly  2" in diameter. Allow 2" of space around each cookie.
Bake for 10-15 minutes. These cookies will not brown on the top only on the bottom. Test with a wooden toothpick. If it pulls away clean without any dough, they are done. Cool on a cookie rack.
