Ingredients:
Dough:
2 cups sifted all purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter
1 cup sugar
1 large egg
1/4 cup Kahlua
1 teaspoon vanilla
2/3 cup finely chopped walnuts
Kahlua Cream Filling:
2/3 cup softened butter
5 cups sifted powdered sugar
1/4 cup Kahlua

Directions:
Lightly grease baking sheets.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Resift flour with cocoa, baking powder and salt.
In a bowl, cream butter, sugar and egg together well.  Blend in about half the flour mixture.  Stir in Kahlua and vanilla, and then stir in remaining flour.  Mix in walnuts.  Divide mixture in half.  Shape each into a 7 inch roll.  Wrap well in waxed paper or foil and place in freezer until firm.
To bake, cut into thin slices approximately 1/8 inch and place on baking sheets.  Bake above oven center for 10 minutes until firm to touch.
Cool on pan a minute.  Remove with broad spatula to cool on wire racks.
Prepare Kahlua Cream Filling:  Cream together butter, icing sugar and Kahlua until smooth and creamy.
When cold, sandwich 2 cookies together with a slightly rounded teaspoonful of Kahlua Cream Filling.
