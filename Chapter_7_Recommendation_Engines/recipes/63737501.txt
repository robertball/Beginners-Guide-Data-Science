½	cup yellow onion, minced
¼	teaspoons kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1	cup white or brown rice
1	cup low-sodium chicken broth

Directions:
1.	Melt the butter with the onion in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Season with the salt and pepper and cook until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir until coated with the butter. Increase the heat to medium-high. Let the rice toast in the butter for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2.	Stir in the broth, chicken base, and bay leaf, lay the rosemary & thyme on the top of the rice. Cover; bring to a boil and turn down to simmer over low heat; cook until all the broth has been absorbed by the rice and the rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let set covered  for 20 minutes. Discard the rosemary, thyme and bay leaf. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve.
