Ingredients:
40  rectangular shortbread cookies
35  individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped
Â¼ cup water
4 cups milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Place shortbread cookies on a baking sheet or tray.  In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt caramels in water, stirring frequently.  Spoon a thin line of caramel over each cookie.  Place cookies in refrigerator until caramel is set.
Line baking sheets or trays with waxed paper.  In a double boiler over simmering water, melt chocolate.  Dip cookies in chocolate one at a time, tapping against the side of the bowl to remove excess.  Place on prepared sheets and let rest at room temperature several hours, until set.
