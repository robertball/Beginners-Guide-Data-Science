Ingredients:
12 fresh figs
3 tbsp. honey
1/2 tsp. red chili powder
1/2 tsp. ground cloves
1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg
1/4 tsp. paprika

Directions:
Preheat your broiler and set the top rack as close to the heating element as possible.
Rinse the figs and pat dry.  Cut off stems (optional, but the stems aren’t edible).  Slice figs in half lengthwise, from stem to root.
Combine the dry ingredients in a small bowl (measurements are approximate – do what looks/smells/tastes good to you).
Lay the figs, cut side up, on a lined baking sheet.  Drizzle the cut side of the figs with honey.  Sprinkle over the spice mixture.
Broil on the top rack until the honey bubbles and just begins to brown, about 10 minutes.  Note: watch the figs closely – cooking time will vary from oven to oven.  Alternately, you can place the figs cut side down on a hot grill for about 10 seconds.
Remove from heat and serve.

Description: 
The first signs of Fall have arrived: the mornings are crisp and overcast, the slutty mannequins at the costume shop on Denny are dressed as pirates, and figs are plentiful and cheap.  Fresh figs are one of the most versatile Fall fruits around, and also one of the most delicious.  Baked, grilled, or, in this case, broiled, they’re kinda hard to screw up.  For this preparation, we’re glazing sliced figs with honey and spices – feel free to substitute whatever smells good to you (try Chinese Five Spice) – then broiling until the honey caramelizes.
