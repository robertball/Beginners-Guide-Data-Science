Ingredients:
2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper
1 tsp. cumin
1 tsp. chili powder
1 tsp. cinnamon
2 pork tenderloins (2-2.5 lbs. They usually come 2 to a bag)
2 TBSP olive oil
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 TBSP finely chopped garlic
1 TBSP Tobasco sauce
1 cup Jasmine Rice
1 can coconut milk
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Make spice rub with first 5 ingredients.
Rub all over pork (you don't need to trim the pork).
Heat oil in pan (I use a deep pot) and brown pork.
Put sugar, garlic, and Tobasco in bowl and pat into pork.
Put pot straight into oven
roast in oven for 30 minutes.
while pork is cooking start the rice by rinsing rice with cold water until water runs clear.
Add rice, coconut milk, sugar, and reg. milk in a saucepan.
Bring to a boil then turn to low, cover and cook 25-35 minutes.
Stir every 5 minutes--don't let it overboil.
pork and rice should be done around the same time
once both are done cooking, slice pork tenderloin and serve over warm sweet rice.
You can pour the extra juice over the cut meat
