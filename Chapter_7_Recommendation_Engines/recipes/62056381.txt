Ingredients:
3 cups Bisquick
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg
1/2 cup butter, melted, divided
1 cup milk
2 eggs
1/3 cup sugar
1 tsp. cinnamon
1 cup blueberries, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Melt butter in microwavable measuring cup.  Set aside.
In small bowl, combine 1/3 cup sugar and cinnamon for topping.  Set aside.
In large bowl, combine Bisquick, 1/3 cup sugar and nutmeg.  In separate bowl mix together milk and eggs.  Dip out 3 Tbsp. butter from melted butter, add to eggs and milk.  Pour this over dry mixture, stirring only until combined. Stir in blueberries, if desired.
Spray 12-muffin tin with PAM.
Pour batter evenly into 12 muffin cups.
Bake at 375 for 15 minutes.  Remove from oven, let pan cool on wire rack for about 3 minutes.  Carefully remove muffins from pan, running a knife around the edge of each muffin to prevent crumbling.  Dip each muffin top in remaining melted butter, then in cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Serve warm.

Made with Bisquick, these are a Saturday morning favorite; in fact, we call them Tom's Favorite Muffins in our house.  You can add blueberries to make them even more special.
