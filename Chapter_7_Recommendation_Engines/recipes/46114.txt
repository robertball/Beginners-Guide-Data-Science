Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded
4 cloves unpeeled garlic
2 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 bunch chopped fresh cilantro
3 tomatillos, husked and chopped
1/2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
1/2 cup cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup chicken stock
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Roast ancho chiles and 4 cloves unpeeled garlic. Press the chiles flat against the pan with a spatula until they begin to pop and smoke, then flip. When done, rehydrate chiles in a bowl of warm water for 30 minutes. Turn garlic until all sides are browned, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool, then peel.
In a blender or food processor, combine chiles, 2 cloves roasted garlic, and eggs. Blend until smooth. Place the flour in a mound on a clean surface. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt with a fork, then make a well in the center. Pour in egg mixture. Working from the center outward, gradually incorporate the flour with a fork until dough is formed. Knead dough for 5 minutes, adding more flour if necessary. Prepare fettuccini according to your pasta machine's instructions. Lay the fettuccine flat on lightly floured surface for 15 minutes.
In a blender or food processor, combine 2 remaining cloves roasted garlic, cilantro, tomatillos, jalapeno, cream cheese, sour cream, chicken stock, 1 tablespoon olive oil, cumin, salt and pepper. Blend until smooth. Pour into a saucepan over low heat, and cook until heated through.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until pasta rises to the surface. Drain, and divide into serving portions; pour sauce over top.

Description: 
Rather than make fettuccine colored with spinach or tomatoes, I wanted to create something with color AND flare. Here is my idea. Try serving with grilled skewered chicken and mushrooms, marinated with lime, garlic, cumin, salt and pepper.
