1 tablespoon butter
1 cup orzo pasta
1 1/4 cups low sodium chicken broth
1 1/4 cups water
1/4 cup parmesan cheese, fresh is better
2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add orzo, stirring constantly and cook 3 minutes or until pasta is golden.
Stir in broth and water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until liquid is absorbed, and orzo is done, about 15 minutes.
Remove from heat; stir in cheese, basil, salt and pepper.
Serve immediately.
