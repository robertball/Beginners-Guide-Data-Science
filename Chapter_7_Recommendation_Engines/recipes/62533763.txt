Ingredients:
1 slice of bacon
3 cups of fresh corn (cut from cob), (frozen is good, if fresh is not available)
1/3 cup milk, or cream
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, fry the bacon slice till just barely crisp, remove the bacon to a paper towel to cool and then eat the bacon.
Add corn to the hot skillet, then begin stirring in enough milk to cover the bottom of the skillet and/or the bottom layer of corn.
Bring mixture to a low boil, and cook the corn for 2-3 minutes, stirring a few times, until milk/cream is almost completely reduced.
Add salt and pepper to taste (Bubba has a particularly heavy hand when it comes to the pepper).
