Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
4 ounces Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate baking bar, broken or chopped into 1-inch pieces
2 large whole eggs
2 large egg yolks
1/3 cup granulated white sugar
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 tablespoon cake flour
Raspberries, to garnish
Whipped cream, to garnish

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Butter four 6-ounce ramekins and dust with sugar.
Melt the butter and chocolate in the top of a double boiler or in a heatproof bowl over barely simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth.
In a large bowl, whip the whole eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer on high speed for about 10 minutes. Fold in the melted chocolate mixture. Fold in the flour just until combined. Spoon the mixture into the prepared ramekins.
Bake for 9 to 10 minutes, until the top and sides are set. The center will be quite soft. Remove from the oven and let sit for about 5 minutes, then unmold each ramekin onto a dessert plate. Serve with a few raspberries and a dollop of whipped cream.
