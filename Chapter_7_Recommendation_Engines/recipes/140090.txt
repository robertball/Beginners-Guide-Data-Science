Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup all purpose flour
3 tablespoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/3 cup cold butter
3/4 cup chopped dates
1/2 cup chocolate chips
1 1/2 cups milk
milk for brushing
extra sugar and cinnamon to sprinkle

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Sift together wheat and all-purpose flours, baking powder, salt, sugar and cinnamon into a large bowl. Rub butter into dry ingredients until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in dates and chocolate chips. Mix in the milk, just until blended and form dough into a ball.
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Roll into a circle about 1/2 inch thick. Dip a round cookie cutter into flour (to prevent sticking) then cut out round scones. Place scones on a greased baking sheet. Brush with milk and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until risen and golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
