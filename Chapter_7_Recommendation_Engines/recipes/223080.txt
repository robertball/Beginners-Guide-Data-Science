Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 stalks celery, diced
1 onion, diced
2 tablespoons white wine (optional)
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch beet greens and stems, chopped
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon fish sauce

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet. Cook and stir celery and onion in hot oil until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour white wine over the celery mixture; add ginger and garlic and toss to mix. Stir beet greens and stems, soy sauce, sesame oil, and fish sauce into the celery mixture; simmer together about 5 minutes. Add drained spaghetti to the skillet; toss to coat with the sauce. Cover the skillet and continue cooking until the beet greens are tender, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
A great recipe using beet greens and stems. I usually use FarkayÂ® noodles from the Asian section of the supermarket, but a Japanese Somen noodle or even a spaghetti noodle would work well too.
