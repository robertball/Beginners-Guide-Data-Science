Ingredients:
2 packages cornbread mix
2 Tablespoons of dried onion
2 teaspoons ground sage
2 Tablespoons celery flakes
3-4 chicken breasts
Chicken broth (from above chicken, about 32 oz.)
1 stick butter, melted
2 packages chicken flavored stuffing
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup milk

Directions:
Prepare 2 packages cornbread mix with water only (i.e., if the package calls for 1 egg and 1/3 cup milk each box, use only 1/3 cup water instead); set aside to cool.
After cornbread is cooled, crumble up and combine with dried onion.
Add ground sage and celery flakes.
Place all in a large zip lock bag and place in the refrigerator overnight.
The next day, season and boil the chicken breasts until done; set aside to cool (reserve broth).
Shred chicken.
In a large bowl, add melted butter, stuffing, eggs, cornbread mixture from zip lock bag and chicken and milk.
If mixture is too thick, add broth until it is pourable.
Pour into pan; cook at 350 degrees until browned on top, about 30-45 minutes.
