Ingredients:
6 oz. cream cheese, softened
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup lime juice
1 tsp lime zest (optional)
1 cups heavy cream
3/4 cup sugar
TOPPING:
1 cup heavy cream, chilled
1/4 cup sugar

Directions:
1. Combine cream cheese with 1 cup cream and salt.  Heat in double boiler (or in microwave 30 seconds at time stirring often), until fully combined and smooth. Let cool and add vanilla, lime, and lime zest if using.  *Add Food Coloring at this point if using...2 drops green, 4 drops yellow.
In a large bowl, beat 2 cups chilled cream with 1/4 cup sugar.  Beat until soft peaks form.  Fold whipped cream into lime mixture.  Pour mixture into dessert cups or glasses.  Chill for at least 6 hours.
Just before serving, beat remaining 1 cup cream with 1/4 cup sugar.  Beat until stiff, then pipe or place a dollop on each serving.  Top with a curl of lime rind if desired.
