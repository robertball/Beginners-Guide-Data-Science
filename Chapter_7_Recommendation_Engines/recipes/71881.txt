Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with balsamic vinegar, basil and olive oil
1 pound broccoli florets
2 cloves garlic, chopped
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, and cook for a few minutes, stirring constantly. Pour in the tomatoes with their juices, and simmer until the liquid has reduced by about 1/2. Place the broccoli on top of the tomatoes, and season with a little salt and pepper. Cover, and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes, or until the broccoli is tender. Do not over cook the broccoli, it should be a vibrant green. Pour into a serving dish, and toss to blend with the sauce before serving.

Description: 
This is a great quick version of an Italian traditional side dish in our family all the way from Italy.  You can use fresh tomatoes and basil. However, as a mother of four, I opt for the quick method as I'm sure other parents of small ones can appreciate. The kids really love this dish too. Buon Appetito!
