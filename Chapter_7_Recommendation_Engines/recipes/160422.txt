Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 cups grated Asiago cheese
1/2 cup minced fresh parsley
1 1/2 cups frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the cream cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, and garlic in a mixing bowl. Add the Asiago cheese and parsley; mix well. Press as much moisture out of the spinach as you can; stir into the mixture. Spread into the bottom of an 8 1/2 x 10 baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the middle is bubbling and the edges are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
