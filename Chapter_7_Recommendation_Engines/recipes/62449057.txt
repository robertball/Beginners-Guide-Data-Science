Ingredients:
2 pounds of fresh cod (clean and sliced into filets)
1 big sweet onion, sliced
1 big red bell pepper, sliced
4 big cloves of garlic, minced
1 can of diced tomatoes (no juice)
1 can of creamy coconut milk
1 green onion (just the green part)
Hot sauce (I used sritacha)
Olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
First you need to start with the fish, just rub olive oil, salt and pepper and set aside.
In a large skillet, sauté the onions, garlic and green bell pepper until tender (for about 2 minutes), then add the diced tomatoes and arrange the filets on top of the sauté veggies.
Pour the coconut milk on top and drizzle hot sauce and the green onions. Turn down the heat to low and let it cook for an hour. You need to cover the pan with a lid.
Serve with rice.
