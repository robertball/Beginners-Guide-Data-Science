Description: 
I created this sauce in my own kitchen with ingredients I already had in my cupboard. The results are delicious and has become a staple in my home. This recipe can easily be doubled. Try using it for dipping katsu chicken, egg rolls or use it as a substitute for barbeque sauce. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!!
