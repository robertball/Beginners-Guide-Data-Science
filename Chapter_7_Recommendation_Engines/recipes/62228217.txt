Ingredients:
Bread:
3 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp baking powder
2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp ground cloves
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp salt
2 c. solid pack pumpkin (one 15 oz./425 g. can)
1 c. vegetable oil
3 c. sugar
3 eggs
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup raisins
Orange Glaze:
1 1/2 c. confectioners sugar
1 tsp. grated orange peel
6 tsp. orange juice
additional chopped walnuts for topping

Directions:
For bread: Preheat over to 350 degrees.
Spray two (meatloaf sized) loaf pans with non-stick cooking spray.
In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl mix together pumpkin, oil, sugar, and eggs with electric mixer until well blended.
Add dry ingredients and mix well.
By hand, stir in the walnuts and raisins.
Divide batter between prepared pans.
Bake for 50-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool in pans on a wire rack for 15 minutes.
Remove from pans and cool completely.
For glaze: Combine confectioners sugar, orange peel, and orange juice in a small bowl.
Stir with spoon to blend.
Spoon over top of cooled loaves, letting excess glaze run down the sides.
Sprinkle with additional nuts before glaze hardens.

Description: 
My grandmother and I always make tons of these at Christmas time to give as gifts. It isn't the holidays without this recipe. Not only are they delicious, they freeze great! I would classify these in the same family as banana bread (sweet loaf) rather than bread.
