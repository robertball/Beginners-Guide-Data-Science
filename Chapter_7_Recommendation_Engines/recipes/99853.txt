Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf frozen white bread dough, thawed
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 sprig fresh basil, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
3/4 cup Italian tomato sauce
4 ounces crumbled goat cheese
2 sprigs fresh basil, chopped

Directions:
Allow dough to rise in a covered bowl until doubled in bulk.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Roll the dough on a floured surface into a 15-inch circle.  Roll the edges towards the center to form a crust, leaving a 12-inch circle.  Brush the entire crust generously with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, 1 sprig of chopped basil, and rosemary.  Bake in preheated oven until the crust begins to turn golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
Spread the crust with tomato sauce.  Sprinkle with 2 sprigs of chopped basil and goat cheese.  Bake in preheated oven until the crust is brown, and the pizza has heated through, about 8 more minutes.

Description: 
This is among my husband's favorite dinners!   The flavors compliment each other so well and it is so easy!  I use frozen bread dough to speed the process.  Set out dough before you leave for work and you are ready to go by the time you get home!
