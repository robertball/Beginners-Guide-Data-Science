1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Toss edamame and garlic olive oil in a bowl to coat completely.
Mix Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, chile lime seasoning, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl. Add to the edamame mixture and toss until well combined. Spread edamame in 1 layer on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until Parmesan cheese begins to brown, turning once halfway through, 10 to 15 minutes.
