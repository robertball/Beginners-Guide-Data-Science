Ingredients:
1/2 cup all natural smooth peanut butter
1 1/2 cup rolled oats
1/3 cup milk
1/3 cup applesauce
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup chopped dates

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Mix in a large mixing bowl the milk, honey, vanilla and applesauce. When the mixture is smooth, add in the peanut butter and mix until blended.
3. Add the rolled oats, chocolate chips and dates. The mixture should stick together well and may be a little tough. If it is too dry and falling apart, add a little bit of additional milk (tablespoon at a time).
4. Place a spoonful of the mixture on a greased ( PAM spray) cookie sheet. The cookies retain their shape during baking.
5. Cook for 20 minutes or until the cookies are golden brown and edges look crispy (check at 15 minutes). Refrigerate after cooling for best taste.
6. Makes about 12 cookies.

I decided to whip this up on a whim after craving something sweet after working out. It does have a peanut butter flavor and is sweet without sugar added!
