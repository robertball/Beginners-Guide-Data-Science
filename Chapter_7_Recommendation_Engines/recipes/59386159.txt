Description: 
I greatly reduced the cost of this recipe by eliminating the costly green bell pepper and leaving out the iceberg lettuce that typically tends to get soggy and wilted without losing the best flavors of this dip.  I also beat the cream cheese into the refried beans instead of the sour cream leaving the beans creamy, smooth, and easy to scoop up with a chip.Modified from: Seven Layer Taco Dip
