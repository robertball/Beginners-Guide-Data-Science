Ingredients:
6 ounces raw boneless skinless lean chicken breast
2 small hamburger buns
3/4 cup Fiber One bran cereal
1/4 cup egg substitute
4 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 leafs romaine lettuce (shredded)
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, divided
Dash of salt, pepper, and chili powder.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Using a food processor, grind Fiber One to a breadcrumb-like consistency. Add half of the cayenne pepper (1/4 teaspoon) to the crumbs and mix well. Place crumbs in one small dish and egg substitute in another.
Sprinkle salt and pepper evenly on both sides of chicken. Then coat chicken on both sides-first with egg substitute and then with seasoned crumbs.
Place chicken on a baking pan sprayed with nonstick spray. Top chicken with a light mist of nonstick spray and then place in oven. Cook for 10 minutes.
Flip chicken over and add another light mist. Cook for an additional 10-12 minutes, until coating looks crispy.
While chicken is cooking, combine mayo and the remaining cayenne pepper, and chili powder in a small bowl. Spread half the mixture on each half of the bun.
On the bottom bun, place chicken, and lettuce, then top with other bun. Enjoy!

Hungry Girls! I love sandwiches, but they can be so unhealthy and loaded with calories. This one is under 350 calories and it's delicious!
