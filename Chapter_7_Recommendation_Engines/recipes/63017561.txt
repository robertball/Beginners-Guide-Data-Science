Mix shortening, flour, and salt together with a fork or a pastry blender until very crumbly.  Add as much water as needed to hold together, and mix lightly with a fork.
Roll gently on a floured pastry cloth to about an inch larger than pie plate. Fold carefully in half, lift to pie plate, and unfold.  Press into pan.  For a single-crust pie, trim with a small knife to about 1/2 inch beyond rim.  Fold up, and pinch so edge of pie is raised from rim.
