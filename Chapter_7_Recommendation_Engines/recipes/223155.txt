Ingredients:
4 avocados, peeled and pitted
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TELÂ®)
1/2 cup diced red onion
1 large jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place avocado in a bowl. Splash with lime juice and lemon juice to prevent browning. Add diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, red onion, jalapeno pepper, garlic, salt, and pepper to the bowl; mash with a potato masher until reaching desired consistency.

Description: 
Fast easy and tasty with as much heat as you want. I don't like mine too highly mashed. I like some avocado chunks to remain. If you want more heat, add all of the jalapeno seeds and/or more jalapenos.
