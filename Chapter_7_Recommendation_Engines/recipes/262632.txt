Ingredients:
2 cups Quaker® Oats (Quick or Old Fashioned, uncooked)
1/3 cup ground flax seeds
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 cup unsweetened dried cranberries
1/4 cup almond butter
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons honey
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
3 tablespoons sliced almonds

Directions:
In large bowl, stir together oats, flax seeds, cinnamon, and ginger. Stir in cranberries.
In small bowl, stir together almond butter, water, honey, and almond extract. Add to oat mixture and stir to combine well. Let stand 5 minutes or until mixture holds together when pressed.
Line 8x4-inch loaf pan with foil, leaving some foil hanging over sides. Spray with nonstick cooking spray. Press oat mixture evenly into pan. Top with sliced almonds, pressing lightly. Cover with overhanging foil. Refrigerate until firm and set, about 2 hours.
To serve, remove oat mixture from pan. Cut in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 12 pieces. Store, covered, at room temperature up to 2 days or refrigerate, covered, up to 1 week.
