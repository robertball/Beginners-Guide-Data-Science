Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 cup onion, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
1 cup chopped cashews
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 3/4 cups chicken stock
1 cup long grain and wild rice mix

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onions until tender and translucent. Stir in mushrooms, and saute until soft. Add rosemary, and cook for 1 minute. Stir in cashews, and cook for 1 minute. Transfer to a medium saucepan.
Pour in chicken stock, and stir in rice. Cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer until water is absorbed. Remove from heat, and let stand for 5 minutes. Stuff into the cavity of a small roasting chicken.

Description: 
Essentially, this is a rice pilaf that I have modified ever-so-slightly to be used as a stuffing for a small roasting chicken. The type of nuts, mushroom, and herbs can be varied in any number of ways.
