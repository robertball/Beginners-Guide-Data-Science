Ingredients:
1/3 cup diced kiwi
1/3 cup diced watermelon
1/3 cup diced strawberries
1/3 cup diced pineapple
1/4 cup fresh pineapple juice or orange juice

Directions:
Combine diced fruit in a bowl and fill each 5 oz cup with fruit. Add 1 tbsp of juice and insert craft sticks into each cup. They easily stay in place because of all the fruit. Place in the freezer a few hours until firm. To remove the pops from the cups, run under warm water a few seconds. Enjoy!
