Ingredients:
12 jumbo cooked shrimp, peeled and deveined with tails on
1/2 cup crabmeat, flaked
1 tablespoon chili sauce
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
2 dashes hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢)
2 tablespoons capers, drained
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 pinch paprika, for garnish

Directions:
Slice shrimp down the back as deep as you can without cutting through, to make a nice opening for stuffing. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, mix together the crabmeat, chili sauce, horseradish, hot pepper sauce and capers. Mix in enough of the cream cheese to form a sticky paste.
Stuff the openings of each shrimp with about 1 tablespoon of the crab salad. Sprinkle paprika over the top. Chill for about 30 minutes before serving.
