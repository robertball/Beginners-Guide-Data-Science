Ingredients:
4 egg whites
1 cup white sugar
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups shredded coconut
12 maraschino cherries, halved

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line baking sheets with waxed paper.
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks.
Beat cocoa powder, vanilla extract, and salt into egg white mixture until incorporated; fold in coconut. Drop spoonfuls of coconut mixture onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until coconut starts to brown, about 20 minutes.
Press a cherry half into the top of each macaroon; transfer cookies to a cooling rack.

Description: 
I took my grandmother's recipe for chocolate coconut macaroons and made them festive by adding half of a maraschino cherry to the top of each one. Her recipe called for 12 ounces of semisweet melted chocolate, but I used Hershey'sÂ® unsweetened cocoa powder instead because it's what I had on hand.
