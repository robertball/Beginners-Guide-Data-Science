Ingredients:
10	large eggs
1/4	cup  mayonnaise
1 1/2	tablespoons  lemon juice
2	tablespoons  spicy brown mustard
1/2	teaspoon  paprika
1/4	teaspoon  hot sauce
Salt and pepper
2	tablespoons  finely chopped fresh chives

Directions:
1. Combine 4 cups water and 4 cups ice cubes in large bowl; set aside. Place eggs in large saucepan, cover with 1 inch water, and bring to boil over high heat. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let stand 8 minutes. Pour off water from saucepan and gently shake pan back and forth to crack egg shells. Transfer eggs to ice water and cool 5 minutes.
2. Peel eggs and halve lengthwise. Transfer yolks to large bowl. Using potato masher, mash yolks with mayonnaise, lemon juice, mustard, paprika, hot sauce, ¼ teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Whisk mixture until smooth; set aside.
3. Chop whites into ¼-inch pieces. Fold whites and chives into yolk mixture and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve. (Salad can be refrigerated in airtight container for 2 days.)
MAKE AHEAD Eggs can be made through step 1 and refrigerated in airtight container for 1 day. To finish, proceed with step 2

Description: 
We prefer Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise (also known as Best Foods). You can substitute Hellmann's Light, but avoid Hellmann's Low-Fat Mayonnaise. If you like, replace the chives with scallions
