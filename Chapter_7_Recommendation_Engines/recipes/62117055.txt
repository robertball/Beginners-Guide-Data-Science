Ingredients:
4 thick pork chops
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
1 medium onion sliced
3 cloves garlic minced
3/4 cup beef stock
1/4 cup water
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
1 tbsp dill weed
2 heaping tbsp dijon mustard

Directions:
Season pork chops liberally with salt and pepper while healing oil in a deep skillet on meduim high.
Brown pork chops 4-5 minutes per side until dark golden brown.  Remove from pan and set aside.
Reduce heat to medium.  Add onions to pan and saute in drippings for 5-6 minutes until soft and starting to caramalize.
Add dijon and stir through to just cook the mustard, then add stock, water, vinegar, worcestershire, dill and garlic.  (I usually mix all this together in a bowl while chops are browning).
Bring just to a simmer and stir all ingredients together, add pork chops back to the pan and simmer, covered about 20 minutes till pork is cooked throught and tender.
Remove chops and stir sauce, you can reduce sauce for a couple of minutes if necessary.  Spoon sauce over chops.
Serve with Smashed potatoes with garlic, and steamed green and yellow beans for a delicious meal.
