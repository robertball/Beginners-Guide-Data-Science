Ingredients:
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon Paprika
2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon thyme
1 tsp fresh spices (rosemary, oregano, etc)
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 large roasting chicken
1 cup chopped onion

Directions:
In a small bowl, thoroughly combine all the spices.
Remove giblets from chicken, clean the cavity well and pat dry with paper towels.
Rub the spice mixture into the chicken, both inside and out, making sure it is evenly distributed and down deep into the skin.
Add Onion to bottom of crock and inside chicken
When ready to cook chicken put it in the slow cooker and do not add any liquid.
As the cooking process goes on it will produce its own juices.
Cook on LOW 8 to 10 hours and it will be falling off the bone tender.
Let cool then remove the meat from the bones, and set aside.  If you like add about 6 â€“ 8 cups of water and all the skin and bones back into the crockpot to cook for another 8 hours, and then strain all the bones and bits and have some of the best homemade chicken broth.
