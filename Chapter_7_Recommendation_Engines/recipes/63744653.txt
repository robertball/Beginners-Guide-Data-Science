Directions:
Melt butter in heavy large cast iron pot over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and cauliflower and sauté 5 minutes. Add salt, pepper and chicken broth. Cover and simmer until cauliflower is tender, about 25 minutes.
Working in batches, transfer soup to blender and purée until smooth. Return soup to pot. (Soup can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Cover and refrigerate.) Bring soup to simmer.
Ladle soup into bowls. Drizzle truffle oil over and enjoy!

Description: 
I love cauliflower but wanted to make something different and decided to make soup! This is a great Paleo recipe and Italian recipe to enjoy… I may add red pepper flakes next time to give it a little extra kick but the white truffle oil did make cauliflower soup really amazing…
