Ingredients:
2 acorn squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 pound bulk pork sausage
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup diced celery
1 cup finely chopped onion
1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar-Jack cheese, divided
aluminum foil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Slice a small piece off the rounded side of each acorn half so it will sit evenly; place on the prepared baking sheet, flesh-sides up.
Roast in the preheated oven until tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove squash and reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Meanwhile, cook sausage in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until until browned and just done, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage to a bowl and keep warm. Drain and discard grease from skillet. Melt butter in the skillet, then add celery and onion. Saute until onions are soft and transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir in mushrooms and cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add parsley, salt, and pepper.
Stir sausage into the mushroom-onion mixture. Turn off heat and mix in 1/4 cup Cheddar-Jack cheese. Divide mixture evenly amongst the 4 squash halves and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar-Jack cheese. Cover the baking dish with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.
