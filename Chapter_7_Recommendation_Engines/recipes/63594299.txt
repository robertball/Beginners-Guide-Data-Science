Ingredients:
1/2 cup Dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc
1/2 cup white wine vinegar
1/4 cup brown mustard seeds (about 1 1/2 ounces)
1/4 cup yellow mustard seeds (about 1 1/2 ounces)
1/2 kosher salt

Directions:
Place all of the ingredients in a small, nonreactive bowl and stir to combine. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 2 days.
Remove the plastic wrap and transfer the mustard mixture to a blender. Blend until the desired consistency is reached, about 30 seconds for a course texture. (Keep in mind it is not possible for this mustard to reach a completely smooth consistency.)
Transfer the mustard to a small, nonreactive container with a tight fitting lid, and refrigerate for up to 3 months.

Description: 
I found this recipe on another site. The texture of this mustard is similar to a stone ground, and the taste is unlike anything you can buy in the store. The potency reminds me of horseradish, but the taste is better. We love this mustard on brats.
