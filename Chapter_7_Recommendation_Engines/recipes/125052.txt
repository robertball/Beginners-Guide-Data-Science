Description: 
Donetta Brunner of Savanna, Illinois traces this hearty main dish back to a 4-H cooking project. 'I liked the recipe immediately, and it has traveled through the years with me to become a favorite with my children and husband, too. The only change I've made to the original is to add extra seasonings.'
