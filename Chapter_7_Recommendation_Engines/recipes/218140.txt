Ingredients:
2 (10.75 ounce) cans cream of mushroom soup
1 cup Chardonnay
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon dried onion flakes, or to taste
1 tablespoon garlic powder, or to taste
1 tablespoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1/4 cup garlic herb seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
5 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
4 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 11x14-inch baking pan. Whisk together the cream of mushroom soup, Chardonnay, Cheddar cheese, onion flakes, garlic powder, and black pepper in a large bowl; set aside.
Combine the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Dip the chicken breasts into the beaten egg, then press into bread crumb mixture. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded chicken onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pan fry the chicken breasts until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Place the browned chicken in the prepared baking dish; then cover with the mushroom soup mixture.
Bake the chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
We often spend weekends at our family vacation home on Lake Chelan.  Tired of the weekend's restaurant fare, I created this recipe using ingredients I had on hand in the kitchen, including a wonderful Chardonnay from the nearby Big Pine Winery.  This is a family-pleasing and comforting recipe of breaded and lightly fried chicken breasts baked in a creamy mushroom wine sauce.
