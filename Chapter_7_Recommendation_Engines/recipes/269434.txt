Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package bow-tie pasta
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1 tablespoon finely diced shallot
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup dry white wine (such as Chardonnay)
cayenne pepper
2 pinches saffron
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound uncooked shrimp - peeled, deveined, and tails removed
1/2 pound cooked lobster meat
1/2 pound cooked lump crabmeat
lemon, juiced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, add 1 tablespoon butter, and stir. Set aside and keep warm.
Melt remaining butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and cook until softened, about 1 minutes. Add cream and wine and bring to a boil. Add cayenne pepper, saffron, salt, and black pepper. Reduce heat to a low simmer for 10 minutes; sauce will not thicken.
Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Add shrimp and cook until opaque, 3 to 5 minutes. Add lobster and crab and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes more. Season lightly with salt and black pepper.
Add seafood combination to the pot with the sauce and stir. Add lemon juice and simmer over low heat 10 minutes more.
Serve cooked pasta in individual bowls with 2 ladles of sauce on top. Fold sauce gently into pasta and top with a dash of black pepper.
