1 teaspoon ground ginger
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground cloves
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced

Directions:
Mix spices in small bowl. Heat oil in a Dutch oven or small soup kettle over medium-high heat; add onion and saute until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
Add garlic; saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add spices; toast until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add chicken; stir until completely coated with spices. Add coconut milk, tomatoes and broth. Bring to a simmer; cook uncovered until flavors blend and stew is thick, about 20 minutes.
Remove from heat, sprinkle with cilantro and serve over rice. Pass chutney separately.

Description: 
It's easy to buy a cooked hen, take the meat off the bone and use it in a 'wow' recipe. I especially like it for dishes like this curry that I might not have time to make from scratch.
