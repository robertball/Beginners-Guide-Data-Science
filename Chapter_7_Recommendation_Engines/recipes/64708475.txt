Description: 
Dense, fudgy brownies. Found this one online when looking for a 9x13 pan recipe... I made this for Honey's 57th Birthday. They were a hit... Super easy to make... Very sweet though... You might want to adjust the sugar just a little if you don't like extra sweet... They are super good. ( Most of us like extra sweet here)...
