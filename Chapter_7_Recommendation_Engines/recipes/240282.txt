Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small yellow onion, diced
2 leeks (white and pale green parts only), diced
1 sweet potato, peeled and cut into cubes
1 beet, peeled and cut into cubes
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes
2 (14.5 ounce) cans water
2 cups baby spinach leaves
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), rinsed and drained (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir yellow onion, leeks, sweet potato, beet, and garlic in hot oil until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour tomatoes and water into the pot; add spinach and stir. Season soup with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer soup until the vegetables are soft, about 35 minutes.
Blend soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Stir garbanzo beans into the soup; cook until beans are heated, about 5 minutes.
