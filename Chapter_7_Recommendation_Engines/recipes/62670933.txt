3/4 cup sugar
1 cup flour
1 tsp baking powder

1/4 tsp cinnamon (or to taste)

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375F.
2. Mix well eggs and sugar (electric hand mixer, works perfectly here), add flour and baking powder and use a spoon to mix until smooth. Set aside.
3. Lightly grease the bottom of a pie dish, or any baking dish of a similar size, coat evenly with bread crumbs.
4. Core and dice apples (do not peel), toss with lemon juice and place on the bottom of the baking dish. Sprinkle cinnamon, layer raisins (if used), and pour the batter over.
5. Bake for 45-50 minutes, until pink crust forms on top and a wooden stick comes out dry from the center.

Description: 
A really easy and NO FAT delicious cake I learned to make when I was maybe 8 years old. At the time, I had no idea it was a HEALTHY cake. I only knew it was easy to make and yummy to eat!
Use any combination of raisins (your choice of variety) and/or dried cranberries. Or none at all! I added them as an adult, the original recipe didn't have any. I also reduced the amount of sugar and added lemon juice to prevent apples from turning brown. Granny Smith apples are the best, other varieties are too sweet and get watery while baking.
