Ingredients:
5 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained and squeezed dry
6 eggs
1 cup chopped fresh dill leaves
1 large onion, chopped
1 pound crumbled feta cheese
1/2 pound cottage cheese
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
8 sheets phyllo dough, thawed
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
sour cream for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place the spinach, eggs, dill, onion, feta cheese, cottage cheese, and black pepper into a large bowl, and mix well.
Place 2 sheets of phyllo dough into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, and drizzle with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil; top with 2 more sheets of phyllo dough. Spread the spinach filling evenly over the sheets of phyllo, pat it down gently, and top with 2 more sheets of phyllo. Drizzle with 1 more tablespoon of olive oil, and top with the remaining 2 phyllo sheets. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned and the filling is set, about 1 hour. To serve, cut into squares and top each square with a dollop of sour cream.

My father and mother survived World War II and immigrated to America. They used food and tradition to overcome their struggles and raise a healthy, joyous family. It's the good memories I have of bringing family together -- and family is of number-one importance to me.
