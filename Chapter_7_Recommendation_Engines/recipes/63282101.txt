Ingredients:
5 pounds of red potatoes, steamed with skins ON
5 large eggs, hard-boiled
1/2 cup finely chopped green onion tops
1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
2 teaspoons celery seeds
1 3/4 teaspoons salt

Directions:
1. Rinse and clean potatoes.  Steam, with skins ON, for about 45 minutes.  You could boil them, but they get mushier (is that a real word?) if you do.  Set aside until cool enough to handle.
2. Bring eggs to boil in pot of cold water, remove from heat and cover for 24 minutes.  Then rinse with cold water and peel.  Peel just the eggs, NOT the potatoes!  That red skin gives it great taste and appearance.
3. In a large bowl, mix the onion, mayo, celery sees and salt.  I like to actually use a hand mixture for this.
4. Chop the potatoes and eggs into bite-sized pieces, and drop into the large bowl with the mayo mixture.
5. Mix GENTLY, tossing it lovingly to just mingle the potatoes and eggs with that great mayo mixture.  If you mix too aggessively, you get moosh, not salad!

Description: 
A good potato salad is heaven.  This wonderful one that they serve at Red Hot & Blue Restaurants is just superb.  After some clandestine research, I have THE recipe.  So easy, so delicious.  Makes a big serving for about 12...but they will love you for it.
