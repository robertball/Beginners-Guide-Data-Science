This healthy smoothie leaves you filled, while making you feel better. The psyllium husks inside expand to leave you feeling full, and keep your digestive tract clean. The Ester-C boosts the immune system (and has a buffer that's easier on your stomach). Daphne's Tip: Freeze this smoothie and make ice pops!
