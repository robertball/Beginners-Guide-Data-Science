Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) frying chicken, cut up
2 cups buttermilk
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 teaspoon celery seeds
Vegetable oil for deep-frying
2 cups Kikkoman Tempura Batter Mix

Directions:
Wash chicken and pat dry. In a large bowl, stir together buttermilk, garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasoning and celery seeds. Place chicken in buttermilk mixture and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.
In a large frying pan or wok, heat oil to 325 degrees F. Drain chicken in a colander to remove excess buttermilk. Place tempura batter mix in a large paper bag; add chicken. Close top and gently shake bag to coat chicken with tempura batter mix. Remove chicken and fry, turning pieces over after 3 minutes. Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides.
