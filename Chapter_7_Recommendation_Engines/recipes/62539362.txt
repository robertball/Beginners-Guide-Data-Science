Ingredients:
1 16-ounce loaf of Italian bread or French bread
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
2 large cloves of garlic, smashed and minced
1 heaping tablespoon of freshly chopped parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
Slice the bread however you like. Mix the butter, garlic, and parsley together in a small bowl. Spread butter mixture over the bread halves. Place on a sturdy baking pan (one that can handle high temperatures, not a cookie sheet) and heat in the oven for 10 minutes.
Bump the heat up to "broil" and let go for 2-3 minutes until the edges of the bread begin to toast. Watch carefully while broiling. The bread can easily go from un-toasted to burnt.
