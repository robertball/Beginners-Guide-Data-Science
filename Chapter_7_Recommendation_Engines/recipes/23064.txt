Description: 
This recipe comes from my friend who is a guide in Alaska - it's excellent for sandwiches, on rolls with sharp Cheddar cheese. Yum yum!  Slow cooked in a slow cooker so even the toughest of roasts or stew meats will work; eventually the meat just falls apart! Also good served over hot cooked rice. Delicious!
