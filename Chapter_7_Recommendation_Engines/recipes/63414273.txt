Ingredients:
Filo Dough / Pie crust / no crust
1 red onion
2 whole eggs
4 egg whites
3 Tbsp Flour
2-4 oz Nova Lox
=======
To taste
Fine Herbs
Thyme
Rosemary
Salt/Pepper

Directions:
Set oven to 350 and bake pie shell.  I use Filo dough because you can use very thin sheets and it bakes very fast.
Caramelize or near caramelize a whole, chopped red onion.  Set aside.  Whip the flour into the eggs by sprinkling it lightly bit by bit over top the eggs.  When you have the right texture it should be thick(ish)
Stir in any herbs you wish you use.  You could also use a pesto or whatever.  This part is simply about flavor.  Add the onions and stir in, and pour into the baked shell.
Shred the Nova lox and drop it on top of the mixture.  Push the initial pieces of lox under the surface and continue to do the same until you have used as much lox as desired.
