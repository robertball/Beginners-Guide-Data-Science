Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
1 1/2 pounds assorted chicken parts
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 cups uncooked white rice
1 (24 ounce) jar ORTEGA® Thick & Chunky Salsa
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
COOK bacon in large saucepan over medium-high heat until crispy; remove from saucepan.  Crumble bacon; set aside.  Add chicken to saucepan; cook, turning frequently, for 5 to 7 minutes or until browned on all sides.  Remove from saucepan.  Discard all but 2 tablespoons drippings from saucepan.
ADD onion, bell pepper and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes or until crisp-tender.  Add rice; cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in salsa, broth, tomato sauce, salt and cumin.  Bring to a boil; place chicken over rice mixture.  Reduce heat to low.  Cook, covered, for 20 to 25 minutes or until most of moisture is absorbed and chicken is no longer pink near bone.  Sprinkle with bacon.

Description: 
Rice is a standard ingredient of the midday Mexican meal. When flavored with broth, tomatoes, chiles or cheese, it becomes a meal in and of itself.  Arroz con Pollo is certainly the most well known Mexican rice dish. Use long-grain white rice for best results.
