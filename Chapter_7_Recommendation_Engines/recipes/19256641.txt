2 packages active dry yeast

Stir in enough flour to make a soft dough.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Round dough into a ball and place in a buttered bowl; turn over to grease both sides. Cover with a dish cloth and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch down; cover and let rest 10 minutes. form into two loaves. Place in greased 9x5x3-inch loaf pans. Brush tops with melted butter. Cover and let rise for about 1 hour, until nearly double in size. Bake at 375Â° for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from pans immediately and cool on racks.
Brush with more melted butter while hot for a softer crust.
