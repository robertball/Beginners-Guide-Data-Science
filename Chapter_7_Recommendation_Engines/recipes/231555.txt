Ingredients:
1 cup butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (16 ounce) package linguine
½ cup unsalted butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
¼ cup pine nuts
4 cups arugula
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Spread squash into a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper over squash; toss to coat.
Roast in the preheated oven until squash is browned and softened, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and keep warm.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 11 minutes. Drain linguine, reserving 1 cup pasta water.
Melt butter in a pot over medium heat until bubbling and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Cook and stir garlic and pine nuts in the brown butter until fragrant, 2 minutes. Add linguine, arugula, 1 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and enough pasta water to moisten to the mixture. Toss until Parmesan cheese melts.
Transfer linguine mixture to serving plates and top with roasted squash and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.
