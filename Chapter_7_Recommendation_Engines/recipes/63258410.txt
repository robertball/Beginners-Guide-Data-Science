Ingredients:
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
4 Denver cut steaks, 3/4-inch thick (2 pounds total)
Salt and ground black pepper
2 fennel bulbs, white parts only, cut into quarters
Vegetable or canola oil
Wedges of lemon
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese

Directions:
Heat the grill to medium-high.
In a spice grinder or using a mortar and pestle, grind the fennel seeds. Sprinkle the ground seeds over both sides of the steaks, then rub into the meat. Season the steaks with salt and pepper. Season the fennel bulb quarters with salt and black pepper.
Soak a crumpled paper towel with oil. Clasping the paper towel with tongs, oil the grates of the grill. Grill the fennel quarters for 10 minutes, turning once during cooking. Grill the steaks for 4 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare. Remove the steaks from the heat and allow to rest for 8 to 10 minutes.
To serve, arrange 2 fennel quarters on each plate. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice over them, then top with a sprinkle of blue cheese. Serve with the steak.
