Ingredients:
1 eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices
salt to taste
2 eggs
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup wheat germ
2 cups tomato sauce (such as PregoÂ® Heart Smart)
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Sprinkle the eggplant slices with a little salt on each side. Place onto a baking sheet, and set aside for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, blot with paper towels to remove the moisture that has accumulated. Meanwhile, beat the eggs and milk together in a mixing bowl; set aside. Mix the Parmesan cheese and wheat germ until evenly combined; set aside.
Dip the dried eggplant slices into the egg, allow excess egg to drip off, then press into the Parmesan cheese mixture until coated on both sides. Gently shake off any excess Parmesan cheese, and place the eggplant slices onto a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining eggplant slices.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. While the eggplant slices are baking, cook and stir the tomato sauce and cayenne pepper in a saucepan over medium heat until hot. When the eggplant is done, pour the sauce over top, and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese to serve.
