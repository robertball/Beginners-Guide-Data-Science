Ingredients:
1 pound ground chicken
1  egg
½ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons tomato paste, divided
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  onion, chopped
1 cup crushed tomatoes
1 cup chicken stock
4 slices provolone cheese
4  whole wheat hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Combine chicken, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Form mixture into 4 patties. Press gently to flatten.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet. Cook patties until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate.
Cook and stir onion in the drippings left in the skillet until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, and chicken stock. Cook until thickened and reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
Return patties to the skillet; cover with tomato sauce. Place 1 slice of provolone cheese over each patty. Cover skillet and cook until cheese melts slightly, about 1 minute.
Place patties on buns; spoon tomato sauce on top.
