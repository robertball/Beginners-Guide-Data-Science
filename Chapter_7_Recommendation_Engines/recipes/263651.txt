Ingredients:
1 cup cacao butter
1 cup cacao beans
1/2 cup honey

Directions:
Place cacao butter in small pot. Fill a bigger pot with enough boiling water for the small pot with butter to dip into but not submerge. Lower the bottom of the small pot into the water. Stir to melt the cacao butter, keeping the pot rim above the water, 10 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, blend cacao beans in a food processor until smooth and peanut butter-like in consistency, at least 10 minutes to allow beans to expel oil and start smoothing out.
Add honey to the melted cacao butter in the pot. Stir, but don't worry if it doesn't liquefy fully; the consistency will improve in the next step.
Add blended cacao beans to the pot; mix well using a spoon. Pour mixture into a 7-inch baking pan. Freeze until solid, at least 1 hour. Cut with a knife or break into chunks.
