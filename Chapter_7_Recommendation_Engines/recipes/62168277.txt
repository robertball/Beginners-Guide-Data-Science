Ingredients:
1lb bag large shell pasta
1/2 c milk
2 c shredded mild cheddar cheese
1 c mix shredded colby jack cheese
1/2 lb thinly sliced smoked mozzarella cheese
1/2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp liquid smoke
black pepper, sea salt, butter

Directions:
boil water with sea salt in large pot.
at the same time, heat milk in medium saucepan, and add both shredded cheeses, liquid smoke, black pepper to taste, and olive oil. cook on low-med, stirring consistently, until smooth and completely melted.
add pasta to boiling water and cook 9 minutes (al dente)
preheat oven to 375 degrees, and use butter to grease a 9x9 glass baking pan.
when pasta is done, drain but do NOT rinse, but put back in pot. add cheese sauce and stir until every piece covered by cheese. (it will be very stringy at this point).
add pasta to glass pan to cover bottom, then top with a layer of smoked mozzarella. add another layer of pasta, and finish with layer of smoked mozzarella.
bake in 375* oven for 8-10 minutes, until cheese has melted, or, if you wish, until top layer is golden brown.
