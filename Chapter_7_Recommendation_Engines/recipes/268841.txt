Ingredients:
1 cup water
5 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 large eggs
1/2 cup grated Gruyere cheese
1 1/2 thin slices deli ham, finely chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine water, butter, and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil. As soon as the mixture boils, remove from heat and pour in 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour in a single motion. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon until well combined. Stir in eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, until a smooth, sticky paste forms. Mix Gruyere cheese and ham into the dough until well combined.
Drop large tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving ample space between each dollop, as gougeres will rise during baking.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and puffed up, about 20 minutes. Transfer gougeres to a plate and allow to cool.

Description: 
All you need to make gougeres, the French version of a cheese puff, is a good choux pastry recipe, add cheese and, in this case, ham and that's it!Â Gougeres are generally used as an aperitif, but my children love to eat them with vegetable soup!
