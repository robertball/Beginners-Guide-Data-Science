Ingredients:
1 cup warm water
1 pkg. quick rise yeast (1/4 oz.)
1 tsp. sugar
1 tsp. salt
2 T. veg. oil
2 cups flour
additional 3/4 cup flour

Directions:
Combine water and yeast to soften. Add sugar. Let set 5 minutes. Add salt, oil and 2 cups flour. Beat with mixer until smooth. Stir in 3/4 cup flour by hand. Knead lightly on floured surface, adding more flour as needed until nice and elastic. Put in greased bowl, turning once to grease surface. Cover with towel and let rise until double. (About 1 hour in warmed oven). Makes two thin crusts. Top as desired and bake in very hot oven 450 degrees until done. Time will vary with what type of pan you use, and how heavily you top it. I always use my stoneware coated with cooking spray, and it turns out perfect every time!
