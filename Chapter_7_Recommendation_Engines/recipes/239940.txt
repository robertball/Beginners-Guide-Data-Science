Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup cornmeal
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 1/4 cups milk, or more as needed
1 cup canned pumpkin
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons oil, divided, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk flour, cornmeal, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and cloves together in a large bowl. Beat milk, pumpkin, eggs, 2 tablespoon vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in another bowl. Add milk mixture to flour mixture and stir until batter is well-combined.
Heat about 1 tablespoon oil in a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
