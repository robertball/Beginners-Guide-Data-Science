Ingredients:
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed
2 zucchini, ends trimmed and halved lengthwise
2 yellow squash, ends trimmed and halved lengthwise
1 large red onion, sliced into 1/2-inch thick slices
2 red bell peppers, halved and seeded
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Arrange asparagus, zucchini, yellow squash, red onion, and red bell peppers on preheated grill; cook until vegetables are tender and slightly charred, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove vegetables from grill and cut into bite-sized pieces.
Whisk olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl to make the dressing. Toss vegetables with dressing in a bowl. Serve warm or at room temperature.
