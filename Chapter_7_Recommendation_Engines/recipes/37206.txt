Ingredients:
1 (12 pound) uncooked country ham
2 quarts cider vinegar
1 tablespoon whole cloves
Hot biscuits
Quick Buttermilk Biscuits
1/2 cup butter or margarine
2 cups self-rising flour
3/4 cup buttermilk
Butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
PLACE ham in a large container. Add water to cover, and soak 24 hours. Drain. Scrub ham 3 to 4 times in cold water with a stiff brush, and rinse well.
PLACE ham, fat side up, in a large roasting pan. Pour vinegar over ham; sprinkle with cloves. Cover with lid or aluminum foil.
BAKE at 325 degrees for 4 hours or until meat thermometer registers 140 degrees. Remove from oven, and cool slightly. Slice ham, and serve with hot biscuits.
QUICK BUTTERMILK BISCUITS: CUT 1/2 cup butter into flour with a pastry blender until crumbly; add buttermilk, stirring just until dry ingredients are moistened. TURN dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead 3 or 4 times. ROLL dough to 3/4-inch thickness; cut with a 2 1/2-inch round cutter, and place on a lightly greased baking sheet. BAKE at 425 degrees for 13 to 15 minutes. Brush biscuits with melted butter.
