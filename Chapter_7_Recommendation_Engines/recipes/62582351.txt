2 cloves or garlic finely chopped
1/4 cup flour
1 3/4 cups of heavy cream
2 cups sliced mushrooms
1 cup diced cooked ham

1/2 small onion cut in one inch strips
1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
sea salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste

Directions:

- Let bubble for a few minutes stirring constantly
- Add mushrooms, ham, green & red pepper and onion
- Continue cooking while stirring on medium low heat for about 5 minutes
