Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoons bacon bits
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
3 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
2 cups shredded cabbage
1 cup sliced carrots
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 bay leaves
1 cup frozen green peas
3/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute the bacon bits and onion in the oil for about 5 minutes, or until onion is tender. Stir in the flour to coat well, then quickly pour in the chicken broth. Stir constantly for 3 minutes, or until somewhat thickened.
Next, add the cabbage, carrots, salt, ground black pepper and bay leaf. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir in the peas and sour cream 1 minute before serving. Allow to heat through and remove bay leaf.
