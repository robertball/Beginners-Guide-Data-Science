Ingredients:
1/2 Lb penne pasta, uncooked
4 slices of bacon
1/2 of a sweet onion or shallot, thinly sliced *optional
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 chicken breasts
1 cup cream
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (Grate from the block, not the green can)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Prepare pasta as directed on package, making sure not to over cook. DRAIN THE NOODLES BUT DO NOT RINSE THEM. *You need the starch on the penne to help thicken the cream sauce.
Cook your bacon in a large, non-stick skillet, until it's nice and crispy. Remove, and let cool on a paper towel; reserving at least 2 Tbs of the bacon drippings in the skillet.
.
While the bacon is cooking, slice your chicken into strips and then into bite size pieces. Season it with salt and pepper and set aside. (If I am out of fresh garlic I sprinkle it with garlic powder.) Add onion to bacon drippings and cook for a few minutes; just until they start to soften. Add garlic and cook for another minute or two; just until fragrant. Add chicken and cook for about 8 to 10 minutes. Just until it's lightly browned on each side. Add cream and let simmer for a few minutes. When cream is bubbling nicely, add the Parmesan cheese, stirring well. *Sauce might seem a little thin, no worries! It'll thicken as it simmers another minute or two. Add in your cooked penne and let heat through. Crumble your bacon and add it to the mix; lightly stirring. Garnish with additional Parmesan if you like.
