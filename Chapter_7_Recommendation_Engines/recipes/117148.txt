2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 garlic clove, minced
2 (4 ounce) fillets salmon

Directions:
Line a small baking pan with foil; coat the foil with nonstick cooking spray. In a small bowl, combine the syrup, soy sauce and garlic. Place fillets skin side down on prepared pan. Brush half of the syrup mixture over salmon. Broil 6 in. from the heat for 7 minutes. Brush with remaining syrup mixture. Broil 6-8 minutes longer or until fish flakes easily with fork.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, bring the broth, mushrooms and pepper to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 5-6 minutes or until mushrooms are tender. Return to a boil. Stir in couscous. Cover and remove from the heat; let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Serve with salmon.

Description: 
Reports Trisha Kruse of Boise, Idaho, This tantalizing glaze was inspired by a chicken dish I enjoyed in Vermont. I decided to try it with salmon...and it's just as good!
