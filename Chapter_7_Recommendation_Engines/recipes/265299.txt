Ingredients:
2 nopales (cactus pads)
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 Roma tomatoes, thinly sliced
2 serrano chiles, thinly sliced
1/2 cup thinly sliced pickled red onion, or to taste
1 lime, juiced
2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 tablespoons cotija cheese
2 avocados, halved and pitted
2 tablespoons roasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Brush both sides of nopales with 1 tablespoon oil and season with salt and pepper. Place on the hot grill and cook, turning halfway through, until tender, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove from grill and let cool until safe to handle. Slice nopales into 1/2-inch strips.
Layer tomatoes, serrano chiles, and onion on a serving plate. Place grilled nopales on top; drizzle with lime juice and remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle cilantro and oregano on top. Add cotija cheese.
Slice each avocado half while still in the skin; use a spoon to gently scoop sliced avocado onto the salad in a fan shape. Top with sesame seeds and additional salt and pepper.
