Ingredients:
DRY INGREDIENTS:
2 cups gluten free flour (I prefer Bob's Red Mill all purpose)
2/3 cups dry baking cocoa powder
1 cup coconut sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup mini dark or semi sweet chocolate chips
WET INGREDIENTS:
6 ounce of fat free plain Greek yogurt
3/4 cup buttermilk, almond milk, or soy milk
3/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoon gluten free vanilla extract
optional, sliced almonds to sprinkle on top before baking

Directions:
Using two bowls, one for wet ingredients, one for dry, mixing up each.  Combine when ready and scoop into prepared muffin cups.  Can line with cupcake liners.  Makes about 14 or so depending how full.  Not too full, or they spill over a bit.  Bake in 350 oven for 17-20 minutes.  I prefer mine just underdone a little to keep a moist gooey goodness.  Fudgy!  Best when cooled down and chips have firmed again.  Depends on your likes.

Description: 
Easy & fast. Rich but not too rich.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Using coconut sugar is a healthy alternative to sugar as it is high in magnesium, low glycemic.  Or so I've read that.  Deep dark satisfying for the choco-holics in all of us.
