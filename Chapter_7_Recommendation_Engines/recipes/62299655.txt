Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1/4 cup white wine
1/4 teaspoon salt
fresh ground pepper
1 pound white fish, such as talapia
1/4 cup fat-free Greek yogurt
2 teaspoons chipotle pepper in adobo, minced
2 teaspoons honey
1/2 pound shredded cabbage and carrots
1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion
2 tablespoons cilantro chopped

Directions:
Combine oil, lime juice, wine, salt and pepper in a large plastic bag, add fish and seal. Marinate for about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine yogurt, chipotle and honey. Add cabbage mixture and onions and stir until coated. Refrigerate.
Heat a large non-stick over medium-high head and add the fish. Cook 3 to 5 minutes, until done, turning once. Set aside and let rest about 5 minutes.
While the fish rest, lightly toast tortillas in your skillet.
To build tacos, flake fish with a fork and add to tortilla. Top with slaw and serve.

Description: 
I loved the tenderness of the fish and the crunchiness of the slaw, the creamy zesty flavor of the fish with the smokey spice of the chipotle in the slaw. We will absolutely make this again.

I served it with a wonderful black bean recipe. The taco with slaw is only 274 calories with 4 grams of fat and 5 of fiber.
