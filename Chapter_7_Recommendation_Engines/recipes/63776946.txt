• 1 package Moon Rabbit Biscuit and Scone Mix
• 1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese plus more for topping

In a large bowl combine Moon Rabbit Biscuit and Scone Mix by following package directions.
Add in 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and parsley. Form into a disk, cover in plastic wrap and refrigerator for 30 minutes
Lay on a gluten floured surface and gently form. Gently press the dough into a rectangle until it is about 1/2 and 3/4-inch thick.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Remove biscuits from refrigerator and place on your gluten free flour work surface. Take your biscuit cutter and form your biscuits and place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet touching each other.
Sprinkle a 1/2 teaspoon of fresh parmeasan cheese on each biscuit.
Bake for 20 minutes and enjoy!
