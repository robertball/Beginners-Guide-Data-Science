Ingredients:
3 Quarts Water
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 1/2 cups fresh lemon juice
10 -15 tea bags

Directions:
Fill a 4 quart plastic or glass container (clear works best) with 3 quarts of water. Combine 1/4 cup of water and sugar in microwaveable measuring glass (Pyrex). Microwave 2.5 minutes or until sugar is dissolved. Will be super hot, be careful removing from microwave. Add lemon juice and sugar to the 3 quarts of water. Stir well. Add 10 to 15 tea bags, depending on how strong you want the tea, I use 15. Set in direct sunlight for several hours, 4-6 hours. Cool in fridge.
