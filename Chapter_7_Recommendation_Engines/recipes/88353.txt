Ingredients:
4 ears corn, shucked
1/2 cup light sour cream
4 teaspoons finely chopped fresh cilantro
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon fresh lime juice
Salt and ground black pepper
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Place corn on a microwave-safe plate; cover tightly with plastic wrap. Microwave on high power until corn is fully cooked, 8 to 10 minutes. (Leaving plastic wrap in place, corn can be made up to 2 hours ahead.)
Mix sour cream, cilantro, chili powder, lime juice, salt and pepper. Cover and chill until ready to serve. (Makes 1/2 cup.)
About 10 minutes before serving time, heat butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add corn and cook, turning with kitchen tongs every few minutes, until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Serve immediately, with sour cream spread passed separately.

Description: 
For simplicity, keep it on the cob. To make it special, cook it twice: first in the microwave, then in a skillet till the ears turn golden-brown. Instead of butter, pass this chili-lime-cilantro sour cream. Unlike butter, sour cream adheres to the kernels, and its rich tartness is a pleasant contrast to the sweet corn.
