Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
4 eggs
1 cup chocolate milk
1 cup white sugar
1 cup finely shredded coconut
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1/4 cup chocolate chips, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Mix flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a small bowl.
Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and frothy, about 3 minutes. Add chocolate milk, sugar, coconut, and oats; beat until thoroughly combined, about 2 minutes. Slowly add flour mixture to the bowl and beat together until no lumps remain in batter.
Scoop batter into muffin cups, filling each 2/3 of the way full. Sprinkle a few chocolate chips on top of each muffin.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool, about 25 minutes, before transferring to a serving plate.
