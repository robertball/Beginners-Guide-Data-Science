Ingredients:
•1 red sweet pepper, diced into tiny pieces
•1/2 green sweet pepper, diced into tiny pieces
•2 bunches of long green onions, finely chopped
•3 cauliflower florets, cut into very tiny pieces
•3 large cloves of garlic, finely chopped
•15 jalapeno peppers, cut into little pieces
•20 Manzanella olives, sliced in half
•2 plum tomatoes. Diced into small pieces
•2 stalks of celery, chopped
•2 carrots, slices into small julienne pieces
•1 and 1/2 cups of extra virgin olive oil
•1 and 1/2 cups of cider vinegar
•1 Tbls of salt
•1 Tbls of freshly ground black pepper
•2 17oz air-seal square glass jars

Directions:
•Simply mix all the vegetable together in a large bowl.
•Season with salt and pepper.
•Place the vegetable mixture in the two jars.
•Add equal portions of oil and vinegar to both completely covering the vegetable.
•Tightly seal the jar and refrigerate for at least two days before using.
•The giardiniera should last refrigerated around 2 weeks.
The most difficult part of this recipe is waiting the two days.
NOTE:Just for reference this is a recipe I have made for many years. The texture of the vegetables are still crisp after being cured. If you are looking to make a giardiniera like you find in a jar then just add one cup of salt water to the vegetables and let them soak for 12 hours in the fridge, rinse them thoroughly, then jar them. Or you can par boil the veggies before jarring them. Either way should work.
