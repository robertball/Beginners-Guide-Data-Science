Ingredients:
4 cups hot water
3/4 cup sugar or 1/2 c. honey
1 cup oil
6 Tbsp. yeast
3 eggs
5 cups. flour
1 Tbsp. salt

Directions:
Stir together water sugar, oil, and yeast.
Add eggs, salt and flour.
Gradually add another 5-6 cups flour, kneading well after each addition.  When dough follows the hook around and no longer sicks to the side of the bowl or the middle column it is ready (approx 10 min.)
Immediately shape into whatever rolls or buns you want and place on greased pan.  Let rise for approx. 10 min.  Bake @425 deg. F for 10 min.
