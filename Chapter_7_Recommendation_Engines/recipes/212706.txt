Description: 
I wanted a pie that combined the best-loved flavors of the season: apples, cranberries, cinnamon, and nutmeg! We had 5 different types of pie this Thanksgiving, and this pie received the most compliments. It was so good, I'm seriously thinking about entering it in our county fair this summer!
