Ingredients:
1 cup of Turkey Drippings (if you have less add up to 4tbs butter to drippings you have to equal one cup)
1/4 cup flour
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 cups turkey or chicken stock
3 tbs butter
salt and pepper
optional (diced giblets)

Directions:
1) Roasting a 12lb turkey will yield about 1 cup of drippings. If you estimate you have less add up to 4 tbs of butter to the roasting pan to compensate.
2) Place pan over medium heat until drippings start to bubble. Add 1/4 cup flour and wisk to form a paste. Brown the flour for about 3-4 minutes.
3) Add 1/2 cup dry white wine, which helps deglaze the pan and adds flavor. Cook off alcohol for 1 minute, while whisking. If you don't wish to cook with wine add 1 tbs tomato paste to help deglaze and add complexity.
4) Slowly add 2 cups of turkey or chicken stock, whisking constantly. You are looking for a caramel color. Add more stock as needed to achieve desired consistency.
5) Finish gravel with 3 tablespoons butter cut into small pieces; add little by little while whisking. This makes for a shiny gravy.
Season with salt and pepper
Note: If you want diced giblets in gravy add after wine. For a richer gravy, substitute brandy or cognac. For mushroom gravy add after flour step and cook mushrooms until juices are released. Chopped fresh herbs may be added after step 4.

Description: 
I have always been intimidated by turkey gravy, and found this article on how to make it.  The recipe is by David Kiser of the Central Market Cooking School in Houston. He says that achieving perfect gravy involves an understanding of the process: a roux made from drippings and flour into which stock is stirred.
