Ingredients:
Potatoes - in the UK we would call them waxy rather than floury - around 1 1/2 pounds.
Vinegar - I use a herb vinegar, but white wine or apple works too - 1 Tablespoon
Vegetable oil - 1 Tablespoon
Freshly ground black pepper
Onion - 1 medium, peeled and diced
Gherkins - 6 small, 4 large or to taste - finely diced
Beef stock cube dissolved in 1 to 1 1/2 cups hot water (or use good quality beef stock)
Lemon jiuce.

Directions:
Boil the potatoes in their skins in salted water until almost done. Remove from the water and allow to cool, this additional cooling should complete the cooking process.
In a mixing bowl, or in a salad bowl, put the vinegar, oil, pepper, onions and gherkins.
When the potatoes are luke-warm, strip off the peel and either grate the potatoes or chop them into the mixture.
Mix throroughly.
Then add half or so of the stock. Mix.
Adjust the taste and the consistency by adding more stock, salt, pepper as required.
Finally add a dash of lemon juice to bring out the flavours.

Description: 
This is a salty, vinegary, tasty potato salad as a change to one more mayonnaissey, and is quite useful for cutting through fatty accompaniments like ham. Please be aware that the final taste depends so much on the quality and structure of the ingredients, and on your own taste, that the amounts must be approximate only. Also, if you use the stock cube, then it's unlikely you will need much more salt.
