Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup light cream
1 cup lemonade
flour for dusting

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place the flour in a mixing bowl with a hollow in the middle; add the cream and lemonade; mix until combined into a very sticky dough. Pour the mixture onto a floured surface; roll with a floured rolling pin until the mixture is approximately 1 inch thick. You may need to sprinkle extra flour on top, given the stickiness of the mixture. Cut into rounds and place on a floured baking sheet with each round a few centimeters apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops of the scones are lightly browned and sound slightly hollow if you tap them, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This very simple scone recipe has just three ingredients! It's great for beginners and those who don't feel like fiddling with more complex scone recipes. This type of scone recipe is quite common in Australia. Serve warm with the topping of your choice. In my family, we love scones with cream and fresh strawberries, but they're great with butter and jam, or anything else you want to try.
