Ingredients:
2 squares unsweetened chocolate
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 stick of margerine (no substitutions, must be margerine)
1 cup sugar
1 tsp. vanilla extract
2 eggs
1/2 cup flour
Optional - 1/3 cup walnuts, or pecans, or mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Grease and lightly flour a 8x8 square baking pan and set aside.
In a saucepan, melt unsweetened chocolate, chocolate chips and margerine on low heat until completely melted and smooth.
Add one cup of sugar and mix in well
Add vanilla extract and mix well
Add eggs one at a time.
Mix well until batter is smooth and glossy
Add flour and mix until incorporated into batter
Put batter into prepared baking pan.
I like to put the nuts on top of the batter, but you can
mix the nuts in if you prefer.  Also, some people prefer to add mini chocolate chips in place of the nuts.
Bake at 350 for 30 to 35 minutes.
