Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter, divided
4 large portobello mushrooms, stems removed
1 dash garlic powder
1 tablespoon butter
2 pounds scallops
1 cup Japanese mayonnaise, such as Kewpie brand
1/2 teaspoon chili-garlic sauce, or to taste
2 tablespoons green onions, chopped

Directions:
Melt 1/4 of the 3 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium-high heat, add a mushroom cap, and cook on both sides until completely soft to the center, about 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining butter and mushrooms, and place the cooked mushrooms upside-down on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet; sprinkle with garlic powder.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source.
Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the scallops, and cook until just firm, and lightly browned on both sides. Divide scallops among mushroom caps. Stir together mayonnaise and chili sauce in a small bowl, and spoon over the scallops.
Broil until the mayonnaise has developed brown patches and is hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with green onions to serve.

Description: 
This is a nice dish to serve guests for dinner or even at a special lunch. It's extremely presentable and will wow everybody at the table. Be sure to use the Japanese mayonnaise recommended in this recipe, not American-style mayonnaise because the flavors are entirely different. Japanese mayonnaise is more flat/sour tasting while American-style mayonnaise is extremely sweet. American-style mayonnaise will ruin the recipe completely.
