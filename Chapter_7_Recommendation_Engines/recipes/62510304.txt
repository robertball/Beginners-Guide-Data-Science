Ingredients:
2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon corn starch (if not being used right away)

Directions:
Mix well.
Homemade baking powder will clump together if it isn't used right away, but you can prevent this by adding 1 teaspoon of corn starch to the baking powder mixture. Store the baking powder in an airtight container.

Description: 
Commercial baking powder preparations often contain undesirable ingredients (such as aluminum compounds). By making your own baking powder, you'll have complete control over your ingredients. And you can easily make this in a pinch if you run out!
