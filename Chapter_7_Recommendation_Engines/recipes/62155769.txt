Ingredients:
1 cup fresh pineapple, chopped and drained (canned should be fine if fresh is not available)
2 tablespoons cream cheese
1 + 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 cup whole milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 slices good bread
1 tablespoon butter
Hot fudge for topping (I use home made)

Directions:
Mix the pineapple and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon.  Spread the slices of bread with cream cheese, then made sandwiches with about 1/4 cup of pineapple mixture in each (about 1/2 of the pineapple should remain, set this aside).
Mix the milk, egg, sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon in a shallow dish.  Place the sandwiches in the custard mixture, flip once they have soaked for a few seconds on one side.
Heat a non-stick frying pan to medium heat, melt the butter in the pan.  Fry on both sides until golden brown.  Serve topped with the remaining pineapple mixture and hot fudge.
