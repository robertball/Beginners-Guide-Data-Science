Ingredients:
1 cup warm water
2/3 cup uncooked bulgur
1/2 cup 2 Tbsp. hummus, divided
1/4 cup sunflower seeds
2 Tbsp. minced shallots
2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
1/2 tsp. kosher salt
1/4 tsp. black pepper
4 green Swiss chard leaves (about 5 oz.)
1 cup julienne-cut red bell pepper
1 cup julienne-cut English cucumber (about 1 large)
1 cup shaved carrot
1/2 cup alfalfa sprouts

Directions:
Combine 1 cup warm water and bulgur. Soak 30 minutes-1 hour. Drain well; squeeze out excess water.
Add 1/2 cup hummus and next 6 ingredients (through black pepper); toss.
Remove stems of each chard leaf. Finely chop stems to measure 1/2 cup; add to bulgur. Discard remaining stems.
Place chard leaves in a large bowl; cover with warm water. Let stand 10 minutes. Drain; pat dry with paper towels.
Place leaves on a cutting board. Arrange 1/2 cup bulgur mixture down center of each leaf; top evenly with bell pepper, cucumber, carrot, and sprouts. Fold in edges of leaf; roll up, jelly-roll fashion.
Spread remaining 2 tablespoons hummus evenly between leaves to seal. Secure with wooden picks.

Description: 
Chard stems are wonderfully crisp and salty - don't toss them. Chop and stir a few handfuls into the bulgur.
