3-4 lb chuck roast
4 c onions, coarsely chopped
2 cloves garlic, peeled, coarsely chopped
2 carrots, peeled, big chunks
2 ribs celery, big chunks
1.5 t salt
1/2 t pepper

Dough:

1/2 c expandex modified tapioca starch

Sear meat in oil in dutch oven. Remove to bowl.
Deglaze pan by sauteing onions over medium heat until lightly colored. Add garlic for last few minutes.
Return meat to pan. Arrange carrots and celery around meat. Pour stock to halfway up side of meat. Salt and pepper.
Simmer gently for 2.5-3 hours. Allow the juices to concentrate but not boil dry.
Let meat cool in pot. Cut 1/4 of meat into chunks and grind with medium blade in meat grinder with the onions, garlic, and juices (fine, not pasty).
Make dough: Add wet to dry. Mix well. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at least 30 minutes. Working with 1/4 of the dough at a time, roll as thinly as possible on rice-flour-dusted board. Cut into 2-3 inch squares.
Place 1 t filling in center of square. Fold into triangle and seal with water-moistened finger. Don't worry about tiny tears in the surface.

Description: 
Kreplach for the gluten-challenged. The noodle is sturdy yet tender enough to be worth the effort and the moniker. Add a dash of tabasco to the filling for a little more umph.
