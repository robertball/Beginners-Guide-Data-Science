Ingredients:
2- 12 ounce bags of fresh, whole cranberries washed and separated.
2 cups white sugar.
1 cup water.
1/3 cup water mixed with 1/3 cup orange juice.
2 envelopes unflavored gelatin (such as Knox)

Directions:
Mix the gelatin in the 2/3 cup water/orange juice and set aside to soften.
Combine the berries with the water and sugar in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  You will hear the berries begin to "pop" as they cook.  Reduce to a simmer and continue to cook (about 20 minutes)until all the berries have opened, are soft and break down.  Stir often.
Remove from heat.
Using an immersion blender or a stand blender, puree the berries until smooth and no lumps remain.
Return the saucepan to the stove and bring the sauce to a simmer.  Add the gelatin and mix thoroughly until fully combined.
Remove from heat.
Cool to room temperature and pour sauce into a glass bowl.
Cover surface with plastic wrap and chill for 24 hours.
