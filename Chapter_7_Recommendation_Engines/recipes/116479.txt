Ingredients:
1 pound bulk Italian sausage
6 eggs
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup ricotta cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 (10 inch) pastry for a double crust pie
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
In a skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Separate one egg and set the yolk aside. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg white and remaining eggs. Add spinach, mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, salt, garlic powder, pepper and sausage; mix well.
Line a 10-in. pie plate with bottom pastry. Add filling. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie; place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in pastry. If desired, cut out holly leaf and berry shapes from pastry scraps; place on top crust. Beat water and remaining egg yolk; brush over top.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
