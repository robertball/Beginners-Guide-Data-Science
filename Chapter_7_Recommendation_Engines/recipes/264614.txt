Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
2 tablespoons warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1 tablespoon dried thyme
1/2 tablespoon ground dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Stir 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons water, olive oil, and yeast together in a bowl. Set aside in a warm place for 10 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil 2 large baking sheets.
Mix flour, thyme, rosemary, and salt together in a separate bowl. Make a well in the center and slowly pour in the yeast mixture, stirring gradually using a fork. Knead gently by hand until a smooth dough forms, 2 to 3 minutes. Add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time if dough is sticky. Let rest in a warm place for 5 to 10 minutes.
Lightly flour a clean work surface and a rolling pin. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces; shape each into a ball. Roll out each ball into a 6-inch circle. Place 4 tortas on each baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 6 to 7 minutes. Flip tortas over and bake until golden brown, 6 to 7 minutes more. Watch closely towards the end to ensure that they don't burn. Transfer to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
These Spanish olive oil tortas are somewhere between a flatbread and a crisp bread in texture and are delicious alone (with soup, for example), or topped with whatever you like - cream cheese, cold meat, pesto, antipasto. You choose!
