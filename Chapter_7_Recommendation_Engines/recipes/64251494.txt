Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/4 cup (2 ounces) regular cream cheese, cut into cubes
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, melted
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 large egg
2 tablespoons milk
1 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
36 maraschino cherries (from an 8oz jar)
1/4 cup granulated or decorative sanding sugar, for rolling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.
In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
Combine sugar, cream cheese, and melted butter in a large bowl and whisk until mixture forms a smooth paste (a few lumps are ok). Whisk in oil. Add egg, milk, and almond extract and stir until smooth. Fold in flour mixture until incorporated and no dry ingredients remain.
Pour 1/4 cup or so of sugar into a small bowl. Dough will be soft, but should still be workable. If not, refrigerate it for 15 to 20 minutes until it is. Use a medium cookie scoop to portion out about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dough. Press a cherry in the center, shape into a ball around it, then roll in sugar to coat. Arrange on prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie.
Bake for 11 to 13 minutes, until cookies are set and cracked. Cool on the baking sheet for 3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
