Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste
2 eggs
3/4 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 extra-ripe bananas, mashed
1 cup walnuts, crushed using a rolling pin

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Combine oats, whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, white sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium-sized bowl.
Lightly beat eggs in a large bowl. Stir in milk, oil, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Add bananas and mix together well. Add 1/2 the flour mixture and stir to combine. Add remaining flour mixture and stir. Stir nuts into the batter.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.
