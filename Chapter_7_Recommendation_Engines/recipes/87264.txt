1/3 cup Italian salad dressing
1 lemon, zested and juiced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the butter in a 9x9 inch baking dish, and melt in the oven. Remove from heat, and mix in Italian salad dressing, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce.
Arrange the chicken tenderloins in the baking dish, coating with the melted butter mixture. Season both sides of chicken with lemon pepper, garlic salt, and onion powder. Sprinkle with lemon zest.
Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken juices run clear.

Description: 
I love lemons on everything and created this quick and easy recipe one night. You can reduce the lemon juice for a less lemony taste. I use tenderloins for a shorter cooking time.  It is even better if you have the time to marinate. The leftover juice is great served with rice or to dip with Texas Toast or rolls.
