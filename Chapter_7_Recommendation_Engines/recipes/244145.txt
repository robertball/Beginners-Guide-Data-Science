Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained
10  marinated artichoke hearts, marinade reserved
2 tablespoons capers, or more to taste, brine reserved
½ cup bread crumbs
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
2 tablespoons lemon juice, or more to taste
½ cup water

Directions:
Place tofu in a resealable plastic bag; freeze until completely solid, at least 24 hours. Defrost tofu in the refrigerator or a bowl of cold water.
Slice tofu into 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Gently squeeze each slice to release water.
Whisk 2 to 4 tablespoons artichoke heart marinade and about 1 teaspoon caper brine together in a bowl; pour enough over each tofu piece so that it absorbs the marinade.
Place bread crumbs in a bowl. Press each tofu piece into the bread crumbs until evenly coated.
Heat olive oil in a skillet; cook tofu until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer tofu to a plate, reserving oil mixture in the skillet.
Cut artichoke hearts into small pieces. Add artichoke hearts, capers, lemon juice to oil mixture in skillet; pour in water. Bring liquid to a boil, add tofu, and simmer until sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
I am experimenting with non-meat dishes. I love chicken piccata and decided to try it with tofu. It is great the first day, but 3 days later, it's heavenly.
