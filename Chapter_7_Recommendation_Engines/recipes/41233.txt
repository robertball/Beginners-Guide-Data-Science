Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup butter
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla sugar
2 tablespoons golden syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together the flour and baking soda.
In a separate bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, vanilla sugar, and golden syrup; mix well.  Stir in the flour and mix until just incorporated.  Form dough into two, 1 inch thick elongated rolls the length of your cookie pan.  Place them on the cookie pan with enough space in between for them to spread.
Bake in preheated oven until they are light golden brown and have flattened; about 20 to 22 minutes if using margarine, or 13 to 15 minutes if using butter.  Remove from oven and let cool slightly for about 3 minutes.  Cut diagonally into 1 to 2 inch strips while still warm.  Remove individual cookies to cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
This is a recipe that my husband's nana has made for years. They are the easiest cookies I have ever made.  The ingredients were harder to find than it was to make the cookies. They are like potato chips, you cannot eat just one!
