Ingredients:
3 cups sifted cake flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter at room temperature
2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
1 cup coconut milk
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour 3 9-inch cake pans. Whisk together the cake flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
In a separate large bowl, beat the butter and sugar with electric mixer until fluffy; beat in eggs, one at a time. Gradually beat in the flour mixture in several additions, alternating with the coconut milk, and stir in the almond and vanilla extracts. Divide the batter between the 3 prepared cake pans.
Bake the cakes in the preheated oven until they are lightly browned,  20 to 25 minutes. A wooden toothpick inserted into the center of each cake should come out clean. Cool in pans for 10 minutes before turning out the cakes to finish cooling completely on wire racks.
