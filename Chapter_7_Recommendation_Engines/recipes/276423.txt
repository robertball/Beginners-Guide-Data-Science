Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 fresh pineapple
1 tablespoon chili-lime seasoning (such as Tajin速)

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
Cut the top and bottom of the pineapple off with a sharp knife, then cut lengthwise into 8 wedges. Cut off the peel and remove the core.
Brush olive oil onto the preheated grill. Place pineapple wedges on the grate and cook until grill marks appear, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Sprinkle chili-lime seasoning over pineapple wedges and serve.

Description: 
Fresh pineapple sprinkled with Tajin速 is one of my favorite snacks, and I also love grilled pineapple, so I decided to combine the two ideas and the result was delicious! If you like things extra spicy, feel free to use Tajin速 Habanero.
