Next stir in wine, mushroom soup and cream cheese until well-blended. Continue to heat (without boiling) mixture for about 5 minutes, sauce should be creamy and all cream cheese should be melted in. Place chicken in single layer in baking dish and pour the above mixture over. Cook for 50-55 minutes, approximately 1h 15m if chicken is frozen. Cook pasta about 15 minutes before chicken is done. Drain pasta and serve chicken and sauce over the quinoa. Top with sun-dried tomatoes and parmesan cheese.
