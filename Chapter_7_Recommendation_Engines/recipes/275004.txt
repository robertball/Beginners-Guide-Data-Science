Ingredients:
1 (8.8 ounce) package 2-pack naan bread
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 small tomato, thinly sliced
2 slices prosciutto
4 ounces sliced fresh mozzarella cheese, or more to taste
freshly cracked black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven; preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Brush naans with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic salt and red pepper flakes. Place 3 to 4 slices of tomato on each naan and layer with prosciutto. Top with mozzarella slices and season with pepper.
Place pizza on the preheated pizza stone. Bake until cheese is melted and bubbling, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from oven and let sit for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

Description: 
Simple ingredients; bold taste. Great for weeknight meals--only takes minutes and you can put it together with your kids. It's the closest thing to the pizza I ate in Italy.
