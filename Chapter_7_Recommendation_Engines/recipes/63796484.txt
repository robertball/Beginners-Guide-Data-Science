Ingredients:
Dressing
1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1/4 teaspoon table salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Salad
2 quarts mixed greens, washed & dried

Directions:
1. Combine vinegar, salt, and pepper in bowl with fork. Add oil, then whisk or mix with fork until smooth, about 30 seconds. The dressing will separate after 5 to 10 minutes, so use immediately or cover and refrigerate; mix again before tossing with greens.
2. Place greens in large salad bowl. Drizzle with dressing and toss until greens are evenly coated. Serve immediately.

Description: 
For best results, use at least two kinds of greens. A blend of mild, delicate greens, such as Boston and leaf lettuces, and peppery greens, such as arugula and watercress, is ideal. Romaine adds crunch and texture and is welcome in most salads. If you like, add mild fresh herbs, such as chives, tarragon, or basil, in small amounts. For variations of Basic Vinaigrette dressing, see related recipes.
