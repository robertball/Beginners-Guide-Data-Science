Ingredients:
Red Velvet Cookies:
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
3/4 cup light sour cream
4 tablespoons red food coloring
1 egg
3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
4 tablespoons dark cocoa powder (such as Hershey's® Special Dark®)
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
Chocolate Chip Cream Cheese Frosting:
4 1/4 cups powdered sugar, divided
4 (8 ounce) packages Neufchatel cheese, softened
1 cup butter, softened
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (12 ounce) package miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Combine brown sugar, butter, and white sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Mix in sour cream, food coloring, and egg.
Combine 2 1/2 cups flour, dark cocoa powder, regular cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until well combined. Place dough in the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a piece of greased and floured parchment paper.
Spread remaining 1/2 cup flour on a clean, dry surface and use some to coat a rolling pin. Roll chilled dough to a thickness of approximately 1/4 inch and cut cookies with whatever shape cookie cutter you like. Place 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in batches in the preheated oven until cookies bounce back immediately after being touched, about 7 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, 8 to 10 minutes more.
Stir 4 cups powdered sugar, Neufchatel cheese, butter, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until creamy. Fold in chocolate chips. Transfer frosting into a resealable plastic bag.
Cut one corner off the plastic bag and pipe frosting onto 1/2 of the cookies. Top with remaining cookies and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup powdered sugar.

Made these for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day while he was gone for the military. They kept and shipped well and were a hit amongst his whole unit. Trial and error went into this recipe and it has become a family favorite.
