Ingredients:
2 ribs celery, diced
1/2 sweet onion (Texas 1015 if you can get it) diced
1 carrot, diced
2 cloves garic, minced
1 tbs oil
2 lbs ground beef (90/10 or 85/15)
1 cup bread or cracker crumbs
1 egg
1/2 cup milk
salt and pepper
1 can cream of mushroom soup (condensed)
1 can milk

Directions:
In a skillet, sautee the celery, onions, carrot and garlic in oil until soft but not brown.
In a bowl, add the cooked veggies, the bread crumbs, the egg, milk, and salt and pepper. Mix thuroughly with hands.
Shape into a loaf and set into a large pan (like a brownie pan) lined with foil.
Bake at 350 for 45 minutes.
About 10 minutes before the loaf is done, mix the can of cream of mushroom with the milk and heat through.
Take the loaf out of the oven and pour off most off the grease. Pour the soup mixture over the loaf and return to the oven for 10 minutes.
Take the loaf out of the oven and remove the loaf from the pan. Whisk together the drippings and the soup mixture left in the pan to make gravy, serve on the side.

Description: 
My grandmother from Port Arthur, TX made this meatloaf and it's STILL my favorite! I make it now for my kids and they love it as much as I do! It's a great change from the sweet or tomato-y meatloaves that are the usual! The gravy is amazing with mashed potatoes!
