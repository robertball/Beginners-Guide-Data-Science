Description: 
This labor of love is not your traditional red meat sauce. Bolognese is a delicious meat sauce that is refined and simmered for hours to bring out the great flavors of all the ingredients. Combine it with tagliatelle or with your favorite pasta to create a satiny, creaminess from the pasta starches that make this a memorable meal. Serve with a loaf of crusty Italian bread.
