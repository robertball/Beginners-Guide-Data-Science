Ingredients:
6 slices Nature's OwnÂ® Perfectly Crafted Multigrain Bread
1 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise
1 medium yellow squash, halved lengthwise
1 medium Japanese eggplant, halved lengthwise
1 red onion, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt

3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
3 cups arugula
1 pound assorted color tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup finely shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Brush bread, zucchini, squash, eggplant, and red onion with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt, garlic powder, and black pepper.
Grill zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant, and red onion, covered, on grill rack, directly over medium-high heat for 6 to 8 minutes, or until tender, turning once halfway through grilling. Remove vegetables and set aside to cool slightly.
Grill bread on grill rack directly over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes or until toasted and lightly charred, turning once halfway through grilling. Remove bread and set aside.
Cut grilled, cooled vegetables into 1-inch pieces. Transfer to a very large bowl. Toss with remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and red wine vinegar. Add arugula, tomatoes, 1 cup Parmesan cheese, and basil and toss gently to combine.
