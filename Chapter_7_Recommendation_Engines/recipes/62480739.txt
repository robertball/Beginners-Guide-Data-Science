Jan's Easy Peanut Butter Recipe

Ingredients:
2 16 ounce jars dry roasted, unsalted peanuts.
2 teaspoons kosher salt (or to taste)
3 tablespoons honey (or corn syrup)
3 - 4 tablespoons peanut or canola oil

Directions:
Put all ingredients in to a food processor.
Process until smooth or the consistency you prefer.  This will take several minutes and you will need to scrape down the bowl occasionally.
Taste and adjust sweetness or salt levels.
You will notice the mixture becomes very warm during the processing and may appear a bit "loose".  The friction heats the butter up and will become thicker when refrigerated.  You don't want it too thick so that it cant process and you also don't want it too thick and un-spreadable once chilled.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
Can be used for sandwiches or in your favorite cookie recipes.

Submitter: 
What's for dinner, mom?
Description: 
Not the highly processed peanut butter you get at the store.  This easy, fun for the kids to make, recipe is not as smooth but packed with peanut flavor.  You can adjust the sweetness and salt level to your preference.
