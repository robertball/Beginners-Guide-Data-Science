Ingredients:
1/2 pound bulk mild Italian sausage
1/2 onion, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
6 cups water
1 bunch Swiss chard, chopped
2 cubes chicken bouillon (such as KnorrÂ®)
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat and stir in the sausage. Cook and stir until sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.
Stir onion and red bell pepper into sausage; cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes.
Pour water into the pot; add Swiss chard, chicken bouillon, garlic salt, and Italian seasoning. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low; Simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 20 minutes.
Sprinkle soup with Parmesan cheese before serving.
