Ingredients:
3 apples - peeled, cored, and diced
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup coconut oil
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup sorghum flour
1/2 cup almond flour
1/2 cup rice flour
1 teaspoon xanthan gum, or more as desired
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 teaspoon ground ginger
1/3 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup hemp hearts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an 18-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
Combine diced apples and lemon juice in a bowl.
Combine sugar and coconut oil in a large bowl and beat using an electric mixer until evenly blended. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract.
Stir sorghum flour, almond flour, rice flour, xanthan gum, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and salt together in a bowl, making a well in the center. Pour sugar mixture into well and stir just until batter is combined; fold in apples and hemp hearts using a spoon or a spatula.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed and a toothpick comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool muffins in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
