Fold in chocolate chips. Spoon into a greased 9-in.x  5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-70 minutes or until the bread tests done with a wooden pick. Cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This recipe was originally for Banana-Raisin Bread, but a cousin who didn't like the raisins would pick them out of the bread before he'd eat it. Upon discovering this, my Aunt Mary decided that chocolate chips would be a great substitute for the raisins. Her son sure loved that touch!
