Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 teaspoon white sugar
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups water
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Combine 1/2 cup warm water and 1 teaspoon sugar in a bowl; add yeast. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 10 minutes.
Mix flour, 2 cups water, butter, and salt into yeast mixture and stir until smooth. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Stir 1/4 cup sugar, vanilla extract, and baking soda into flour mixture until batter is smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter, about 1/4 cup per waffle, onto the griddle until waffles quit releasing steam, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
These waffles are so light and crispy right off the griddle, they're just like fresh funnel cakes....but with so much less guilt! Crunchy on the outside with a tender middle, you'll swear they've been fried!
