Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 (3 ounce) packages Oriental-flavor ramen noodle soup, seasoning packet reserved
1/2 cup slivered or sliced almonds
1/4 cup sesame seeds
1 (16 ounce) package broccoli coleslaw mix
1/2 cup chopped green onion
1/2 cup salad oil
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons soy sauce

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave. Crush the ramen noodles into small pieces; stir the crushed noodles, almonds, and sesame seeds into the butter. Spread the mixture onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crunchy, 8 to 10 minutes; allow to cool completely.
Toss together the coleslaw mix and the green onion in a large bowl.
Whisk together the salad oil, vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, and reserved seasoning packets in a separate bowl; stir the noodle mixture into the dressing. Pour the dressing over the coleslaw mix and toss to coat.
