Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) container refrigerated pizza crust
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons ranch seasoning mix
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
3 thin slices red onion, separated into rings
1 medium tomato, diced
1 1/2 cups cubed, cooked chicken
6 slices cooked bacon, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread pizza crust out onto a greased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges just start to brown, 7 to 8 minutes.
Combine sour cream and ranch mix in a bowl and spread onto the warm pizza crust. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Top with red onion, tomato, chicken, and bacon. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is browned to your liking and cheese is melted, 6 to 10 minutes more.
