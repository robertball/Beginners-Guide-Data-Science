Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or to taste
1 pound fresh pizza dough
2 tablespoons minced garlic, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Grease a rimmed baking sheet generously with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Place pizza dough on the baking sheet and stretch to fit in an even layer. Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil on top; sprinkle garlic over oil. Spread garlic over the dough with your hands until evenly coated. Sprinkle rosemary, basil, thyme, parsley, salt, and black pepper on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 25 minutes. Slice into squares and serve.

Description: 
Forget about making the dough - go out and buy dough from your local mom and pop pizza place - and load it up with minced garlic and fresh herbs! Place a shallow dish out with some garlic, herbs, salt, and black pepper with olive oil drizzled in it to dip the bread in, too!
