Ingredients:
4 ounces white chocolate
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon gelatin
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1 cup DannonÂ® All Natural Plain Yogurt
1/2 cup strawberries or raspberries
2 tablespoons water, or as needed
1 tablespoon sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Break up the chocolate into chunks and place in a small glass bowl. Microwave for 2 minutes at 50% power, stir. Heat for another minute if not fully melted. Allow mixture to cool for five minutes.
Place the water in a small saucepan. Sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let sit for one minutes then stir and cook over a medium low flame until fully dissolved. Let cool 5 minutes.
Mix the whipping cream into the warm chocolate, stir until smooth. Place Dannon(R) All Natural Plain Yogurt in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Whisk gelatin mixture into the yogurt. Whisk white chocolate mixture into the yogurt and combine well.
Use a one half cup measuring cup to portion the pudding into small ramekins, martini glasses or large shot glasses. Chill overnight.
Puree fresh fruit in blender or food processor. Add a couple tablespoons of water as needed. Strain fruit puree through a sieve. Add sugar to taste. Pour a tablespoon of puree over pudding and serve.
