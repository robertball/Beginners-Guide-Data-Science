Ingredients:
1/4 teaspoon butter, softened
2 teaspoons heavy cream
2 eggs
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon fresh chives, minced
1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese, grated

Directions:
Rub the inside of a 6 ounce ramekin with butter.
Pour cream into the ramekin, then crack the eggs on top of the cream without breaking the yolks.
Use a spoon to position the yolks towards the center of the ramekin, then sprinkle with salt, pepper, chives, and Parmesan cheese.
Bake at 375Â° until the whites of the eggs have set and the yolks are still soft, 12 to 15 minutes.
Remove from oven, and allow to set for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
