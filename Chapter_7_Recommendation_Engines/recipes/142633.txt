Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
3 cups cubed bread
1 onion, minced
3 cups cooked ham, cut into one inch cubes
1 (10 ounce) can cream of celery soup, undiluted
1/2 cup milk
1 1/2 cups instant rice
1 1/2 cups water
1 (15 ounce) can green beans, drained
6 slices American cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil a 9-inch baking dish with spray cooking oil.
Place the bread cubes in a small bowl. Melt the butter in a large skillet, and pour half over the bread cubes. Toss cubes and set the bowl aside.
Add the onion to the remaining butter in the skillet and cook over medium heat until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the chopped ham. Stir in the cream of celery soup and the milk. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring. Remove from heat.
Put the rice and water into the baking dish. Top with the drained green beans. Then spoon the ham mixture on top of the green beans. Cover with the slices of American cheese, then sprinkle over all with the bread cubes.
Bake uncovered until cheese melts and edges bubble, about 45 minutes.
