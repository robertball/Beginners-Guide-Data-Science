Ingredients:
1 loaf unsliced bread
1 cup butter softened
1/2 pack of dry onion soup mix.

Directions:
In a bowl mix together the butter and onion soup. Set to one side.
Slice the bread 7/8th of the way though (do not cut all the way though)
Butter each slice of the bread on both sides. You can be as a light or heavy as would you like but remember it has to do the whole loaf.
Wrap tight in aluminum foil. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour.
