Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons SPLENDAÂ® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups currants
2 teaspoons caraway seeds
1 3/4 cups buttermilk
1 large egg, lightly beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees  F. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets. Set aside.
Combine flour, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, baking powder, soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Cut butter into dry ingredients with a pastry blender until mixture is crumbly.  Stir in the currants and caraway seeds.
Combine egg and buttermilk; add to dry ingredients, stirring until dry ingredients are moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead for 1 to 2 minutes or until dough is smooth.
Divide dough into 2 equal parts; shape each into a ball. Place on separate baking sheets. Slightly flatten each ball; cut a 1/2-inch deep cross in the top of each loaf.
Bake for 45 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when tapped. Remove to a wire rack; cool 5 minutes. Cut into wedges.
