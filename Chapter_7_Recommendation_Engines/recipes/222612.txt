Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked white rice
2 cups reduced-sodium beef broth
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup orange juice
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon beef broth
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup cubed firm tofu
2 large carrots, sliced
2 cups broccoli florets
2 cups cauliflower florets
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup quartered fresh mushrooms
1 cup fresh snow peas
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/4 cup slivered almonds

Directions:
Bring rice and beef broth to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Combine cornstarch and ginger in a small bowl. Stir in orange juice, soy sauce, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic until blended.
Heat 3 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon oil, mushrooms, snow peas, and tofu; continue cooking until mushrooms soften, about 3 minutes. Push vegetable mixture to one side of skillet and cook and stir egg in remaining space until set; combine egg with vegetables. Stir in orange juice mixture and boil until thickened, about 2 minutes.
Serve over rice and top with slivered almonds.

Tons of veggies and a splash of orange juice give this stir-fry a bright color and a tangy taste.
