Ingredients:
2 large chicken breasts
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp harissa
1/2 tsp dried thyme
Pepper
2 cups broccoli florets
1 large bell pepper (any color) cut into 1" strips
1 medium red onion, cut into wedges
About 2 cups summer squash, sliced about 1/2" thick
1 tbsp olive oil
Salt & pepper
1 tsp za'atar
Lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat lightly greased grill pan over medium-high heat.  (or saute pan or grill)
Pound chicken breasts to about 1/2" thickness
Mix harissa, 1 tbsp oil, thyme and pepper and brush onto chicken. Grill about 4 minutes on each side.  Remove chicken and set aside.
Meanwhile, toss veggies with olive oil, salt & pepper.  Add to grill pan, in batches if necessary ( you want them in a single layer) and grill for about 5 minutes, turning occasionally, until crisp tender.
Cut chicken into 3/4" slices and add to the veggies in the pan. Add za'tar and cook, stirring or shaking, to incorporate some of the harissa flavor onto the veggies.
Squeeze a little fresh lemon juice over and serve

Description: 
I was looking for a way to use up some of the more exotic items in my cupboard as well as some garden produce and came up with this quick, spicy meal! I did this in a stovetop grillpan, but this could also be sauteed or adapted to the grill.  Harissa is spicy and a little bit smoky, so cook in a well-ventilated area.
