Add the paprika and quinoa to the skillet and stir to coat.  Stir in the stock and sauce and heat over medium-high heat to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium.  Cover and cook for 15 minutes or until the quinoa is tender.  Stir in the peas.  Return the chicken to the skillet.  Cook until the chicken is cooked through.
