Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can seasoned black beans, rinsed and drained
2 ears corn, kernels cut from the cob
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon lime juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pound tilapia fillets
cooking spray
1/4 cup blackened seasoning
4 (6 inch) corn tortillas
1 lime, cut into wedges
1 teaspoon Louisiana-style hot sauce (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine black beans, corn, olive oil, lime juice, and salt in a bowl. Gently stir until beans and corn are evenly coated; set aside.
Lay fish fillets on a clean work surface and pat dry with paper towels. Lightly spray each fillet with cooking spray and sprinkle 1/2 of the blackened seasoning over the top. Flip fillets over, spray with cooking spray, and sprinkle with the remaining seasoning.
Place fish in a single layer in the basket of the air fryer, working in batches if necessary. Cook for 2 minutes. Flip fish and cook 2 more minutes; transfer to a plate.
Place bean and corn mixture in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 10 minutes, stirring halfway through.
Place fish into corn tortillas and top with bean and corn mixture. Serve with lime wedges and hot sauce.

Description: 
Blackened fish tacos made simple in the air fryer. Cooking the fish quickly at a high temperature in the air fryer results in a crispy, blackened crust while the fish stays moist and flaky.
