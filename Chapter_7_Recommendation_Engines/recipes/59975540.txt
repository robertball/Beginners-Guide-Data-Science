1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard
3/4 cup ketchup
3 teaspoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon oil

Directions:
Preheat grill to 400 degrees F.  Saute the ground beef in a skillet on the grill. Stir in the garlic powder, mustard, ketchup, and brown sugar; mix thoroughly. Reduce heat, cover and simmer in a closed grill for 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Coat onion rings and peppers with oil and place in grill basket or foil. Cook along with the beef mixture for about ten minutes on each side.
When grilled vegetables are done, remove from direct heat and set aside until Sloppy Joes are ready. Serve the Sloppy Joes on warm buns with the grilled onions and peppers on top.
