Ingredients:
2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons Irish whiskey
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon minced green onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon crushed dried rosemary
4 (8 ounce) flat iron steaks

Directions:
Combine the olive oil, whiskey, soy sauce, green onion, garlic, pepper, parsley, thyme, and rosemary in a large, sealable plastic bag; seal and shake to mix. Add the steaks to the marinade. Seal the bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Remove steaks from marinade; discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to come to room temperature before cooking.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook the steaks until they are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, 6 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Cover the meat with two layers of aluminum foil and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before serving.
