Description: 
I whipped this delicious soup up on a chilly day when a friend and I both craved our favorite cold weather combo, grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup. Although it only takes a minute to throw together, this soup tastes anything but ordinary. Enjoy! The tortellini is actually half of a 9 ounce package.
