Ingredients:
1 Pork Roast
1-2 cloves of garlic, cut in small pieces
1 medium onion, chopped
1/4 cup each water and olive oil
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp each soya and worshershire
Mixture of 3 mustards: Dijon, dry powdered mustard and regular yellow mustard to equal about 1/2 cup or as desired

Directions:
Cut garlic into small pieces
Cut small slits in roast (on all sides)
Place garlic pieces in slits
Wisk all remaining ingredients in a bowl.
I adjust the amounts of mustards to my liking. (I add more dijon if I am cooking for someone who loves Dijon, I even add a fourth mustard: Spicy dijon, if i feel like it)
Marinate the roast for 2 hours in the mustard mixture
Cook 3 hours at 350, leave covered for first hour.
Serve with roasted potatoes, carrots, asparagus.... Yummy!
