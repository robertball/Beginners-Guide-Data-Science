Ingredients:
24 oz, thickly sliced mushrooms (baby portobellos are best)
2 tbs olive oil
kosher salt
black pepper
2 tbs butter
1 large onion, peeled and sliced
1 cup dry white wine
3/4 whiskey (jack daniels is good)
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 cup heavy cream
12 oz mostaciolli, cooked al dente

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Drizzle mushrooms with a little olive oil, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.  Set aside.  In a large pot, heat additional olive oil along with the butter over medium heat.  Throw in the sliced onions and saute for a couple of minutes, or until beginning to turn translucent.  Pour in wine and whiskey and allow to bubble for a minute or two.  Pour in broth and allow the liquid to reduce for a couple of minutes.  Stir in cream and reduce heat to low.  Add mushrooms, salt, and pepper and simmer until sauce thickens.  Toss in cooked pasta, using a little hot pasta water is sauce needs a little thinning.  Taste for seasonings and add if needed.
