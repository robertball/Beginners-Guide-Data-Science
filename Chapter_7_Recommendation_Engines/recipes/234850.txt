Ingredients:
2 (1 1/2 pound) boneless pork tenderloins
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1/2 lemon, juiced
6 leaves fresh sage, finely chopped
1 lemon, zested
1 (1 pound) package bacon
3 apples - peeled, cored, and quartered
2 lemons, juiced, or more to taste

Directions:
Season pork tenderloins with salt and black pepper.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tenderloins in hot oil until browned on each side, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove from heat and cool.
Preheat oven to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C).
Stir juice from 1/2 lemon, sage, and lemon zest together in a bowl until a paste forms; spread paste over each tenderloin.
Wrap bacon strips around each tenderloin and place in a baking dish. Scatter apples around tenderloins and drizzle juice of 2 lemons over meat and apples.
Cook pork in the preheated oven until apples are tender and pork is slightly pink in the center, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a combination of several pork recipes. The lemon/lime juice makes it absolutely divine, and the apples and bacon complements the tenderloin beautifully. Serve with wild rice, corn, or zucchini patties.
