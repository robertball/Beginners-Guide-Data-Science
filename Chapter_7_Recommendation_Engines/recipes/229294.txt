Ingredients:
3 tablespoons peanut oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 pound boneless pork chops, cut into bite-size pieces
1 cup leftover cooked rice, preferably several days old
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon fish sauce
1 cup mung bean sprouts
1/2 small white onion, chopped
10 grape tomatoes, halved
3 dried Thai chile peppers, or more to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 egg, beaten
1 green onion, chopped
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/2 lime, juiced

Directions:
Heat a large wok over high heat until small wisps of smoke rise from the wok. Pour peanut oil into the wok and quickly stir garlic into the hot oil, followed by pork. Cook and stir until pork is browned and no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes.
Stir rice into pork mixture; add soy sauce and fish sauce. Cook and stir mixture for about 30 seconds. Mix mung bean sprouts, onion, grape tomatoes, dried chiles, and cilantro into rice. Cook and stir until mung bean sprouts are slightly wilted and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
Push the fried rice up the sides of the wok, leaving a bare spot in the center. Pour beaten egg into the bare spot and scramble egg until firm and no longer runny, about 1 minute. Stir fried rice with scrambled egg, sprinkle with green onion and white pepper, and remove from heat. Squeeze lime juice over the top and toss rice lightly to combine. Remove dried chiles before serving.

Description: 
Thai pork fried rice with bean sprouts for some crunch. Make sure all of the ingredients are at room temperature before starting. Cold ingredients cool down the wok, which makes it difficult to stir-fry properly. Make sure the rice is not moist. I use rice that is was cooked about three days prior. If you're cooking the rice just to make this dish, use 10 to 15% less water.
