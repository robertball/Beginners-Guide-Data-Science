2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup shortening
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/4 cup cold water
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar

Directions:
Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut in shortening until it resembles coarse crumbs.
Mix egg, water, and vinegar together in a separate bowl. Pour into flour all at once and blend with a fork until dough forms into a ball. Divide into 3 equal-sized rounds.
Wrap with plastic and chill in a refrigerator until ready to prepare.
