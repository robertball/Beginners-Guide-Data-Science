1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 4oz can diced green chilies

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix the cream cheese, Jack cheese, chilies, garlic, and green onions.
Fill wonton wrappers with approximately 1 tsp cheese mixture each. Fold wrappers into triangles and press the edges with a moistened fork to seal.
