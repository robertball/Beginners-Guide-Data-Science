Ingredients:
1 (2 to 3 pound) chicken, skinned and quartered
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons ground allspice
2 tablespoons plain yogurt
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar

Directions:
Make cuts in the chicken flesh, almost to the bone. Pour 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice over the chicken and rub in the salt.
Combine the tandoori spice, yogurt, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, oil and the vinegar. Coat the chicken with the mixture, rubbing well into the cuts. Place the chicken in a 13x9 inch pan, cover with foil and refrigerate overnight, turning occasionally.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake covered chicken at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour. Remove foil the last 15 minutes of baking.

Description: 
This recipe was from my sister, Paula, who lived in northern England with her English husband.  Indian food and 'takeaways' are very popular there.  I serve this dish with rice and a spinach salad with tomato wedges, hard boiled eggs, cucumber slices, feta cheese and black olives. Doubling the marinade will provide plenty of sauce to go over the rice.
