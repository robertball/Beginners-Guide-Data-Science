Ingredients:
3	24 oz 	Whole Mushrooms
2	Sticks ( 4oz)	butter
1	1 oz	Dry Ranch dressing Mix (I use Hidden Valley Original)
1	.6 oz	Dry Italian dressing mix

Directions:
I use an 8 quart crock pot.  (Mushrooms will shrink to about ¼ the original size when fully cooked.  If you don’t have a crock pot big enough to start the process, cook in the oven at 350 degrees in an appropriate sized baking dish or aluminum roaster.  Then transfer to crock pot/chaffing dish to serve. )
Rinse mushrooms and add to crock pot.
Add sticks of butter to top of mushrooms.  Cook on high.
Stir at least every ½ hour.
After 1 hour add both seasoning packets.
Stir every ½ hour until they are fully cooked down.
Turn down to low or warm to serve.
Total cook time approximately 2 hours.

My aunt makes these for get togethers.  Several relatives now have fork scares on the back of their hands fighting for these.
