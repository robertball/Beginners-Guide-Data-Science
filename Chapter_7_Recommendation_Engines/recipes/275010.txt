Ingredients:
2 cups self-rising flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1 cup milk
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Combine flour, sugar, and cocoa in a large bowl.
Combine milk, butter, and eggs in another bowl. Stir into flour mixture just until moistened. Fold in white chocolate chips.
Fill each prepared muffin cup 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before removing from the muffin tin. Serve warm.

Description: 
These are like inside-out chocolate chip muffins. The generous amount of white chocolate makes them satisfying for those who have a sweet tooth, but the cocoa helps to balance the sweetness. Warning: They are seriously addictive!
