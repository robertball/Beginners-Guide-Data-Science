Ingredients:
2 cups flour
2 Tbsp brown sugar
1 Tbsp white sugar (or Splenda)
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree
1 HEAPING tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp ground cloves
pinch of nutmeg, if desired
1 large egg
1 1/2 cups milk (skim or 1% is fine)
2 Tbsp apple sauce OR vegetable oil
2 Tbsp lemon juice

Directions:
Combine the flour, sugars, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and whisk it together.
In another bowl combine remaining ingredients – Then slowly add in the flour mixture and whisk just until moist. You’ll probably have a few small lumps, that’s OK.
Heat a non-stick electric griddle to 350 (or lightly spray a skillet with non-stick spray and heat over med-high heat.)
Pour batter by the 1/4 cup and cook about 2 mins per side.
Serve with warm maple syrup, pecans or walnuts
