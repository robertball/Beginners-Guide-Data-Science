Ingredients:
2 cups whole milk
3/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Stir milk and sugar in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved. Slowly stir in heavy cream.
Pour milk mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Submitter: 
Zero
Description: 
Just like what you get at Cold Stone Creamery®, Maggie Moo's®, or Marble Slab Creamery. Only better because it's homemade, and a whole lot cheaper. It's great on it's own, but you can also top it off with cookies, fruit, candy pieces, or whatever else you like. 

You will need an ice cream maker for this.
