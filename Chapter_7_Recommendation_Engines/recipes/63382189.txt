Ingredients:
1 Cup Vanilla Light Silk
1 Cup Mixed, frozen, unsweetened blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries
2 Tablespoons Danon Light and Fit Vanilla Yogurt
1 Packet Blueberries and Cream instant oat meal
1 Packet Sweetener (I use Splenda)
1 Scoop Vanilla EAS Soy Protein Powder

Directions:
Add Silk, frozen berries, yogurt, sweetener, and soy protein powder into blender. Blend well, with a good blender approximately 30 seconds. If you are adding the oatmeal, this is where you would do that also and then increase the silk to 1 and 1/2 cups.

Description: 
Smooth, yet rich enough to enjoy, the protein powder gives it a little more kick and lots more energy for the person drinking it! The oat meal makes it more filling, this is great for a meal replacement.Modified from: Soy Protein added Berry Bliss Breakfast Smoothie
