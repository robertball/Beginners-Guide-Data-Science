Ingredients:
Dozen eggs
Water
Ice (optional)

Directions:
Rinse refrigerated eggs briefly under room temperature water (or let eggs sit on the counter for about 15 minutes)
Bring a pot of water (enough to cover all eggs) to a boil.
Very gently lower eggs into the boiling water with a slotted spoon.
Return to a gentle boil.
Boil 13-15 minutes depending on how firm you want your yolks to be.
Remove pot from heat & pour out the hot water.
Instantly fill pot with running cold water to cool the eggs. Add ice if needed.
Gently crack the egg shells all around. Don't remove the shells now. Place the cracked eggs back in the cold water.
Let eggs stand in the cold water bath for 15 minutes.
Peel and remove egg shells. Serve as you wish and enjoy!
