1 can (300 mL) sweetened condensed milk
1 bag (200g) toffee bits
Topping:
1 bag (200g) semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 oz white chocolate, melted (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Line a 9-inch square baking pan with parchment paper so that it overhangs ends for easy removal.

Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until light golden.
Filling: Pour sweetened condensed milk into microwaveable 8-cup bowl. Microwave on medium power for 4 minutes, stirring after 2 minutes. Stir in toffee bits. Microwave on med-low or defrost power for 8 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes, or until golden brown and thickened. Pour over baked crusts. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Topping: Melt semi-sweet chocolate chips. Spread lightly over filling. Drizzle white chocolate over. Let set completely before cutting into small bars.
