1 pound boneless pork shoulder, cubed
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger root
2 (3 ounce) packages chicken flavored ramen noodles with seasoning packets
3 cups water
1 1/2 cups sugar snap peas
3 green onions, chopped
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons cornstarch

Directions:
Place the pork and ginger into a slow cooker, and sprinkle the seasoning packets from the ramen noodles over them. Pour in the water. Cover, and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours.
About 10 minutes before you are ready to eat, turn the slow cooker up to High. Break the ramen noodle bundles into quarters, and place them into the slow cooker along with the sugar snap peas and green onions. In a small cup, stir together the soy sauce and cornstarch. Stir into the slow cooker. Cover, and cook for about 5 more minutes. Serve immediately.
