Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups almond flour
1 cup brown rice flour
1/2 cup sorghum flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup unsalted butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place almond flour, brown rice flour, sorghum flour, sugar, cinnamon, allspice, cardamom, ginger, and salt together in a large resealable bag; seal and shake well to combine.
Mix butter and flour mixture together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined.
Roll dough into walnut-size balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets; flatten balls slightly.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, about 27 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
