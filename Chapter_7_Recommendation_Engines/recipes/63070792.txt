Ingredients:
2 lb. Ground Beef
1 small Onion, diced
1 can Enchilada Sauce (we use Medium heat)
1 can Chicken w/Rice Soup
1 can Cream of Mushroom Soup
1 small can Green Chilis (chopped/diced)
1 small bottle of Taco Sauce (again, we use Medium heat)
2 C. Cheddar or Mexican Blend Cheese
Corn Tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Brown the ground beef in large skillet.  Add the onion halfway through the browning process.  When browned, drain the beef and onion.  Return beef/onion to skillet & add the enchilada sauce, the soups and the green chilis.  Let simmer for 15 minutes.  While mixture simmers, tear corn tortillas into large pieces.
Layer the meat mixture in bottom of 9x13, then tortillas, taco sauce & lastly the cheese.  Continue to layer, making sure to have enough cheese to cover the top on the last layer.  Bake for 30-40 minutes.
We normally serve with either a chopped lettuce, tomato and sour cream for the top or with a salad, along with tortilla chips for the side.

Description: 
My family loves mexican food AND lasagna, so this is the best of both worlds.  Don't let the soups deter you from making this - you'll never know they're in there.  My family asks for this often!
