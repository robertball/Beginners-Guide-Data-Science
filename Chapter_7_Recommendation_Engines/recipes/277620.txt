Ingredients:
2 medium ripe bananas
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup white sugar
1/3 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup safflower oil
2 eggs, slightly beaten
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup oat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
Topping:
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons melted butter, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 23 muffin cups with paper liners.
Mash bananas in a large bowl. Add pumpkin puree, sugar, buttermilk, safflower oil, eggs, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla extract; mix by hand until well incorporated.
Mix together all-purpose flour, oat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to banana-pumpkin mixture and stir gently until blended. Use a medium scoop to fill prepared muffin cups with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tins for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.
Mix together sugar and cinnamon for the topping in a small bowl. Baste each warm muffin with melted butter and sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar mixture.

My daughter asked me to make pumpkin muffins one day and I had ripe bananas and came up with these. They are outstanding! Much better than any pumpkin muffin I've ever had. Moist, wonderful, terrific!
