Ingredients:
2/3 cup coconut flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup butter, cut into small cubes
2 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 cup coconut cream, chilled
1/4 cup stevia powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 eggs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a cupcake pan with paper liners.
Combine coconut flour and baking powder in a large bowl.
Place butter and cream cheese in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until melted, about 30 seconds. Stir until well combined. Add coconut cream, stevia, and vanilla extract; stir well.
Pour butter mixture over coconut flour mixture. Stir well. Mix in eggs. Divide batter evenly among the cupcake cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool completely, at least 2 hours, to avoid crumbling.
