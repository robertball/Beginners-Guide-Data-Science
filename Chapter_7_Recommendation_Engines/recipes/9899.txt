Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup shortening
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix shortening and sugar well.  Add eggs.  Mix dry ingredients together and add to shortening mixture until dough is stiff and doesn't seem sticky (you may not need to add all of the flour).
Roll out on a floured board.  Cut into shapes. Decorate with sprinkles or colored sugar.  Re-roll trimmings and cut into shapes until all of the dough has been used.
Bake on lightly greased cookie sheets for 8 to 9 minutes.
