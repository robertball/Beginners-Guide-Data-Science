Ingredients:
1/3 cup sugar, divided
3 tablespoons water
1 Cara Cara orange, cut into 8 slices
1/4 cup maple syrup

Directions:
Combine 1/3 of the sugar and water in a large skillet over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Add orange slices. Sprinkle some sugar over the exposed side; cook until sugar dissolves into the orange slices, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and repeat on the second side. Drain water.
Flip orange slices and cover with some more sugar; drizzle some maple syrup on top. Cook until sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and repeat on the second side. Repeat until orange slices appear candied, scraping any melted sugar off the bottom of the skillet and onto the slices. Transfer to a plate and let cool, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This was an ad hoc creation for someone who couldn't eat strawberries. They are very sweet and 2 to 3 slices satisfies even an ardent sugar monger. The name is inspired by Anthony Wilford Brimley. We eat the slices slightly warm but they can benefit from time in the refrigerator.
