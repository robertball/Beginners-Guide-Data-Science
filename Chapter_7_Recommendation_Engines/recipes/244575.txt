Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch pieces
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 medium green bell peppers, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 poblano chile, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano leaves, crushed
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups Swanson® Mexican Tortilla Flavor Infused Broth
1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped green chiles, undrained
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
1/3 cup sour cream

Directions:
Stir the flour, salt and black pepper in a large bowl. Add the pork and toss to coat.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the pork to the saucepan in batches and cook until well browned, stirring occasionally. Remove the pork from the saucepan.
Reduce the heat to medium.  Heat the remaining oil in the saucepan. Add the onion, green peppers, poblano chile, jalapeno peppers and oregano and cook for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally.  Add the garlic and cook and stir for 1 minute.
Stir the broth, green chiles and cilantro in the saucepan. Return the pork to the saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, uncovered, for 1 hour or until the pork is fork-tender, stirring occasionally. Serve with the sour cream and additional fresh cilantro.
