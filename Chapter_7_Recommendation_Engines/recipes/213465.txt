Ingredients:
4 boneless pork loin chops
1/4 cup apple juice
1/4 cup maple syrup

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the pork chops in the hot pan, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Pour in the apple juice and maple syrup; reduce heat and simmer until the juice has reduced and thickened slightly.
Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
Pork chops with a sweet glaze.  My grandkids love this as do their friends. If your family prefers you can spice it up your way, my family likes it as is.  Great with either mashed or sweet potatoes.
