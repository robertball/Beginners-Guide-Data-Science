Ingredients:
1 pound rigatoni
1/2 pound Italian sausage, casings removed and broken into chunks
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup minced yellow onion
1 red bell pepper, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup dry white wine
4 cups canned diced tomatoes, undrained
1 pinch red pepper flakes
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup grated Romano cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
4 ounces crumbled goat cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 13 minutes; drain.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot oil until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion, red bell pepper, and garlic to sausage mixture; cook and stir until peppers are tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir white wine into sausage mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until slightly reduced, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring frequently, until sauce thickens, 10 to 15 minutes.
Mix rigatoni, Romano cheese, and fresh basil into sausage mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until cheese melts and flavors blend, about 3 minutes. Ladle into bowls and top with goat cheese.
