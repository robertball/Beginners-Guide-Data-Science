Ingredients:
- 650 g ground coconut
- 125 g melted margarine
- 36 yolks passed through a sieve
- 1 kg sugar
- 1 cup glucose syrup
- 2 to 3 tablespoon water

Directions:
Mix the glucose syrup and the water into a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until it is melted. Grease 50 cupcake pans with the help of your fingers.
Blend the coconut and the sugar using your hands and mix well for 5 minutes. Add the melted margarine. Put the mixture in the refrigerator overnight.
Add the yolks and mix well. Pour the mixture into the cupcake pans.
Place the cupcake pans into another baking pan with 1–2 cm of water, and bake at 150–180ºC until a golden brown crust forms and an inserted toothpick comes out clean. The quindins should be left to cool in the pan, then removed while still warm by upturning the mold and gently prying them out.

Description: 
Quindim is a very popular Brazilian baked dessert. It was created by African slaves in 17th century Brazilian Northeast, where coconuts were abundant and sugar (from sugarcane) was a major industry. The use of yolks was very common due the Portuguese tradidition of using those in their sweets and pastries. The word itself comes from a Bantu language, and originally meant the gestures, and demeanor, and humor characteristic of adolescent girls.
