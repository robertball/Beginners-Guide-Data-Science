Ingredients:
Equal parts Ketchup and Grape or Current Jelly
(1 cup of each makes lots of sauce)
Store bought frozen meatballs or your favorite meatball recipes, prepared.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375
If using a homemade meatball recipe, be sure to brown the balls in a skillet until well cooked and only a hint of pink remains.
Mix jelly and ketchup in a oven proof casserole dish and add meatballs. Stir to combine. If jelly remains a bit lumpy, that's fine.
Cover dish with tin foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and stir well. Return to oven and bake uncovered until browned, and bubbly, about 15 minutes more. Check with a thermometer to insure that the meat reaches at least 160 degrees.

Description: 
These meatballs are super easy to whip together and tastes like a lot of effort was made. This basic recipe can be jazzed up with the addition of Worcestershire, a pat of butter, and/or garlic powder, but it is still delicious without. Serve these meatballs with rice and your favorite vegetable for a complete meal without much fuss.
