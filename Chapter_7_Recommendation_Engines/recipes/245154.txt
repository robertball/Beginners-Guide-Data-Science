Ingredients:
5 cups sliced peeled tart apples
1 2/3 cups white sugar, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup table cream (18%)
1/3 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir apples, 2/3 cup sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg together; distribute apple mixture into a 9x9-inch baking dish that is at least 2 inches deep.
Whisk flour, remaining 1 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir egg, cream and melted butter together in a cup; pour egg mixture into flour mixture and stir until all ingredients are moistened. Using the back of a spoon, spread batter over apple mixture to seal apples in completely.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 50 minutes.

Description: 
Tart, firm apples bake to juicy tenderness under a delicious topping, which is a cross between cake and biscuit. This goes really nicely with a custard sauce such as Bird's CustardÂ®.
