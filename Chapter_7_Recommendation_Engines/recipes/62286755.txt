Ingredients:
3 medium yellow squash, cut in chunks
2 medium zucchini, cut in chunks
1 pint cherry tomatoes
1 medium eggplant, peeled and cut in chunks
1 large onion cut into wedges
8 medium mushrooms
3 tbsp olive oil, divided
3 tbsp italian seasoning, divided
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Spray two sheet pans with cooking spray. In a bowl, large enough to hold everything at the end, toss each vegetable(by itself) with some olive oil, italian seasoning, salt and pepper.
In a single layer place eggplant and onion on one cookie sheet and squash, zucchini, tomatoes and mushrooms on the other.
Roasting time is to desired doneness, approximately 30 minutes.  Convection setting if available yields nice results.  Check occasionaly and flip veggies around to produce even results.
As the veggies are done I return them to the same large bowl I had tossed them in originally and sprinkle on a little more italian seasoning.
Serves best warm but reheats nice.
