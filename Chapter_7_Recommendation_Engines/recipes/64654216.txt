Ingredients:
Filling: 2/3 cup finely chopped pecans
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
Rolls:
2 cans (8 oz each) Pillsbury™ refrigerated crescent dinner rolls or 2 cans (8 oz each) Pillsbury™ refrigerated Crescent Dough Sheet
Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, softened
2 to 3 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Heat oven to 375°F. Grease 13x9-inch pan. In a small bowl, mix filling ingredients.
If using crescent rolls: Unroll 1 can of the dough into 1 large rectangle; press into 13x7-inch rectangle, firmly pressing perforations to seal. Spread filling over the rectangle. If using dough sheets: Unroll 1 can of the dough; press into 13x7-inch rectangle. Spread filling over the rectangle.
If using crescent rolls: Unroll second can of dough; press into 13x7-inch rectangle, firmly pressing perforations to seal. If using dough sheets: Unroll second can of dough; press into 13x7-inch rectangle.
Place over filling; press dough onto filling. Cut stacked dough into 8 (13-inch) strips. Twist each strip 5 or 6 times, pressing the extra filling into rolls. Shape each into a coil; place in pan.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately remove from pan; place on cooling rack.
In a small bowl, stir glaze ingredients, adding enough milk for desired drizzling consistency; drizzle over warm rolls. Serve warm.
