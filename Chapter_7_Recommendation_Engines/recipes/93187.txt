Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) can Pillsbury® refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
1/2 cup hot bean dip with jalapeno peppers
1/4 cup Old El Paso® chopped green chiles
1/4 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup finely shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
Guacamole, if desired
Sliced ripe olives, if desired

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Unroll dough and separate into 4 rectangles; firmly press perforations to seal. Cut each into 6 squares. Gently press squares into 24 ungreased miniature muffin cups (dough will not completely cover inside of cup; do not press too much).
Spoon about 1 teaspoon bean dip into each cup. Top each with 1/2 teaspoon chiles, 1/2 teaspoon bell pepper and about 1 teaspoon cheese.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until edges are deep golden brown. Cool in pan on wire rack 5 minutes; remove from muffin cups. Garnish each with guacamole and olives.
