Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups of flour
1 and 2/3 bottles of dark beer (I use Shiner Bock and believe it makes the BEST batter)
3 tablespoons of Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning, plus more for salting onions once cooked
1/2 tablespoon of Cayenne pepper
2 large yellow onions, sliced and separated in rings (Vidalia works best)
2 quarts of vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Whisk together dry ingredients
Add one beer, and then as much of the second beer as you need to reach the consistency of pancake batter.
Dip onions in batter and cook until golden.  Shake off excess oil.
If desired, salt again with more Creole Seasoning. They're excellent both ways!
