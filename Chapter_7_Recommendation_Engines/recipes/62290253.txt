Ingredients:
3 cups chopped cooked chicken breast
2 eggs
4 3/4 cups chicken broth, divided
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 teaspoons salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
1/4 cup butter
2 cups chopped onion
1 1/2 cups thinly sliced celery
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 quarts chicken broth
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups chopped carrots
3 cups chopped cooked chicken breast

Directions:
In a blender or food processor, combine 3 cups cooked chicken, eggs, 3/4 cup chicken broth, 1 cup flour, parsley, 2 teaspoons salt, pepper and tarragon.  Process until smooth.
In a large pot, bring 4 cups chicken broth to a boil.  Drop dumpling mixture by rounded spoonfuls into boiling broth.  Simmer, uncovered, 5 to 8 minutes, until well formed and slightly browned.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Reserve dumpling cooking liquid.
In a large pot melt butter over medium heat.  Cook onion, celery and garlic in butter until onion is translucent.  Stir in 1/2 cup flour until fully incorporated.  Pour in 2 quarts chicken broth, stirring constantly.  Bring to a boil.  Introduce 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and carrots.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes.
Stir in dumplings, reserved liquid and 3 cups cooked chicken.  Simmer 15 minutes more before serving.
