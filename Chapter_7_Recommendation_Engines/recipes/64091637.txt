Ingredients:
1 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup old fashioned oatmeal
3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 egg
1 1/4 cups milk
cooking spray

Directions:
In a Cusinart, blend together oatmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl.
Whisk together oil, egg, and milk until combined. Add to dry ingredients, mixing only to combine. Refrigerate batter for 60 minutes.
Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Spray with cooking spray. Pour batter into the hot skillet, about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until bubbles appear on the sides and center of each pancake. Flip and cook until golden, about 1 to 2 minutes.

Anybody can add water to a boxed pancake mix, but you're better than that! These pancakes are not too thick, not too thin, but tender, light, buttery, and delicious.Modified from: Old-Fashioned Pancakes
