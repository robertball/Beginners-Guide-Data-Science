Ingredients:
2 large stalks celery - coarsely chopped
1/2 of a medium yellow onion - coarsely chopped
1/2 cup bread crumbs
2 eggs
1/4 - 1/2 cup water (You can substitute ketchup if you wish.)
1 Tbsp. Italian herbs
Salt and Pepper to taste
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef (I use 90% to 93% lean.)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Place the onion and celery into a food processor or blender and pulse 4 - 5 times (mince, don't pulverize the veggies)
Combine well veggies,  bread crumbs, eggs, water and herbs in a large bowl.
Add the ground beef and mix well with the other ingredients.
Form into a loaf and pat to work out splits and air pockets
Grease or spray a loaf pan
Place the meatloaf into the pan and bake at 350 degrees for an hour or to 160 degrees.
Let rest for 10 minutes when done.

Description: 
I've tried a lot of different meatloaf recipes over the last few years, but my family keeps wanting me go back to this simple, basic recipe. It's a classic and always pleases. You can spice it up (or dress it down) with Worcestershire sauce, horseradish, ketchup, or any number of things mixed right into the meatloaf.
