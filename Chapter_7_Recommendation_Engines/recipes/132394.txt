Description: 
This is one of the best, easiest, and tastiest vegetarian chili recipes I've ever tasted. Whenever I make it, my friends devour it. Best eaten with tortilla chips, Cheddar cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. What a treat! The recipe creator's name is Doc Meromorphic. He is a good friend of my family.
