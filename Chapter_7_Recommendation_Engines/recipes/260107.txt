Ingredients:
2 cups fresh blackberries - rinsed, drained, and lightly crushed
2 cups white sugar
2 sprigs fresh thyme, or to taste (optional)
2 sprigs fresh sage, or to taste (optional)
1 cup white vinegar

Directions:
Wash and sterilize a bowl or jar. Add blackberries; cover with sugar. Add thyme and sage. Stir well to combine. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap. Refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until a pool of juice and syrup forms around the blackberries, 1 to 2 days.
Remove thyme and sage from the bowl. Place a fine mesh strainer over a separate bowl and pour in blackberry mixture. Press lightly on the solids to expel all the juice.
Sterilize a glass jar or bottle. Pour in juice and add vinegar. Cover with a lid and shake gently to dissolve any remaining sugar. Let rest until flavors intensify, at least 1 day.

Description: 
This is the cold-process method for making a shrub. This is one of those 'don't have exact measurements' recipes, but if you get the ratios close, it is hard to mess it up. Although I'm usually a fan of using fresh ingredients, frozen fruit/berries actually work well and sometimes give a little more juice (don't tell!). I combine the shrub with sparkling water to make a nice soda. It can also be used in cocktails and salad dressing.
