Ingredients:
8 large potatoes, peeled and boiled (I use russets)
1/2 cup sour cream
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup milk
1/2 to 1 tsp minced garlic
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Mash potatoes with sour cream, cheese, and butter. Gradually add milk. If you like firmer potatoes, add less milk. Stir in garlic and salt and pepper. Pour into greased 9x13 baking dish. Bake uncovered 30 min at 400 degrees.

Description: 
This is my mom's recipe, and she makes it whenever we have meatloaf or meatballs, and also at thanksgiving. It is very creamy and is delicious even without gravy or butter. I love the crust it gets when baked in the oven, and we usually fight over who gets to scrape around the edges of the pan!
