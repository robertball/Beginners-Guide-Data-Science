Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups plain yogurt
2 tablespoons roughly chopped walnuts
3 tablespoons golden raisins (sultanas), roughly chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 large cucumber - peeled, seeded, and diced

Directions:
Place yogurt into a fine-mesh sieve lined with a coffee filter and allow to drain, about 20 minutes. You should end up with about a cup of thick yogurt.
Heat a small skillet over medium heat, add walnuts, and toast while stirring until nuts start to turn golden brown and become fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Allow to cool.
Mix yogurt, sultanas, walnuts, dill, mint, salt, and pepper in a large bowl, add cucumber and toss to combine. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a Persian recipe and my favorite cucumber salad. Cucumbers are combined with toasted walnuts and sultanas and a light dressing of yogurt, fresh dill, and fresh mint. For best results refrigerate salad for about 1 hour.
