Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 stalk celery, sliced
1 carrot, cubed
1 slice bacon, sliced into small strips
2 pounds beef heart, rinsed and cubed
2 teaspoons beef bouillon granules
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 cup red wine
3 cups water, or as needed
1/4 cup prepared mole sauce
1 parsnip, cubed (optional)
2 large potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
1 cup canned lima beans

Directions:
Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over low heat. Add onion, garlic, celery, carrots and bacon. Cover, and let the vegetables sweat for about 10 minutes.
Remove vegetables to a plate to make room, and place the beef heart in the pan, adding a bit more oil if necessary. Saute over medium heat until browned. Return the onion mixture to the pan, sprinkle in the cumin and beef bouillon. Pour in the red wine, mole sauce, and enough water to cover. Put the lid on the pan, and simmer over low heat for 2 hours.
Add the parsnip and potato to the stew, and stir in the beans. Continue to simmer for another 30 minutes, until vegetables are tender. I hope you enjoy making and eating my creation.

Description: 
Beef Heart is inexpensive and lean, but it's unusual to find in the grocery.   My recipe is the only version I know of that is southwest style, in fact, this is fusion cuisine, because this is not an authentic southwest recipe.  Mole adds a wonderful richness to this dish. You might want to make a pan of cornbread, it's great with this.  Serve with red wine, and a salad of jicama, cabbage, and celery.
