Poem by Amanda Richard**:
"Apologies to all my friends
who love their rats and mice
I had a critter in my house
that wasn't cute or nice
All day he'd nap, but as night fell
he'd venture out to snack
He loved my chocolates, and my bread
and Pringles by the stack
The straw that broke the camel's back
was when he chewed a hole
right through my bag of garlic toast
and all the garlic stole
I tried a sturdy wooden trap
he laughed and took my cheese
I set a bunch of sticky ones
he passed them by with ease
And then I came to Amazon
(there's so much that they sell)
I found this cheap and simple trap
that works so very well
The bait goes in the little hole
and then just set the trap
Relax and have a glass of wine
And wait to hear the snap
The final step's the easiest
Just lift the latch and dump
You'll never, ever touch again
a mouse's furry rump"

Directions:
Look at recipe photo of mouse on the top of Christmas tree. Laugh.
Retrieve mouse (from Christmas tree or snap trap).
Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl. Use care if using live mouse-- it will splash.
Salt and pepper to taste.
Lightly grease a glass casserole dish. Pour mix into dish.
Cover dish lightly with plastic cling wrap and place in microwave.
Microwave on high until mouse explodes.*
Remove from microwave and view casserole through cling wrap.
Recite poem while removing cling wrap.
Serve mouse casserole to cat.
