Ingredients:
1.5 pounds ground beef
1/2 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons garlic, minced
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1 cups raisins
1 (8 ounce) jars green olives, drained and finely chopped
1 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
1/4 cup water or white cooking wine
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 bunch cilantro

Directions:
Brown the ground beef in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat until crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Pour off any excess grease, then stir in the onion and garlic; cook for 2 minutes before adding the red pepper, green pepper, raisins, olives, tomato paste, water, salt & pepper(if needed) and cilantro. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 10 minutes, or until the peppers have cooked to your liking.
