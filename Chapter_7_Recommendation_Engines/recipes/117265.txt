Ingredients:
1 pound uncooked spaghetti, broken into 3-inch pieces
4 pounds ground beef
2 large onions, chopped
1 large green pepper, chopped
4 cups milk
4 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup, undiluted
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
4 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Cook spaghetti according to package directions. Drain and place in two greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dishes; set aside.
In two Dutch ovens or stockpots, cook the beef, onions and green pepper over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. To each pot, add 2 cups of milk, two cans of tomato soup, one can of mushroom soup and 1 cup of cheese. Bring to a boil.
Spoon over spaghetti (spaghetti will absorb liquid during baking). Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until bubbly and top is lightly browned.
