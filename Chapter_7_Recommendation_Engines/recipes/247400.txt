Ingredients:
1 large zucchini, grated and drained on paper towels
3/4 cup chopped leeks (white and light green parts only)
2 large eggs, beaten
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup vegetable oil for frying
20 Original Snack Factory速 Pretzel Crisps速, or more as needed
Ranch dressing (optional)

Directions:
In medium bowl, combine zucchini, leeks, eggs, panko, and salt and pepper.
Heat 1/2 inch oil in large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Form small patties from the zucchini mixture using a spoon; add to hot oil in batches. Cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels.
Arrange Pretzel Crisps(R) on a serving tray. Top each crisp with a mini zucchini fritter. Add a drop of ranch dressing, if desired. Serve.
