Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup hot sauce (such as Texas PeteÂ®)
1 cup canola oil
1 cup cornstarch
1 pound frozen cooked, peeled, and deveined shrimp, thawed

Directions:
Combine butter and hot sauce in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and keep warm.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Place cornstarch in a shallow bowl and lightly dip shrimp into the cornstarch.
Fry shrimp, working in batches, in the hot oil until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Add shrimp to the butter-hot sauce and allow to sit for 3 to 4 minutes.

Description: 
This is an easy dish for ball games or to take to parties. I like to make sure additional sauce covers the shrimp when served.
 Serve with blue cheese or ranch dressing, if desired.
