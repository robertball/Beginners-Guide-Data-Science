2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 cup raisins (optional)

In a medium mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. Beat until well mixed. Pour over bread, and lightly push down with a fork until bread is covered and soaking up the egg mixture. Bring a kettle of water to a boil. Place bread pudding baking pan in a large roasting pan and carefully pour boiling water around pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the middle of the pudding comes out mostly clean.
