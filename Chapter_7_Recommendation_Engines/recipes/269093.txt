Ingredients:
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 shallot, minced
1 teaspoon whipping cream
9 tablespoons cold butter, divided
1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
12 sea scallops
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 oranges, peeled and sectioned
1 tablespoon chopped inner celery leaves, or to taste

Directions:
Bring wine, orange juice, and shallot to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until about 2 tablespoons of liquid remains, about 10 minutes. Add cream; simmer until mixture is almost evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes more.
Whisk in 8 tablespoons cold butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until incorporated. Remove from heat. Strain and discard shallot, then whisk in vanilla.
Rinse scallops and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Heat oil and remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add scallops; cook, turning once, until browned and opaque, 3 to 5 minutes total. Transfer to a serving platter.
Top scallops with the orange sauce, orange sections, and celery leaves.
