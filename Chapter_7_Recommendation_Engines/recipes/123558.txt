Description: 
'This is such an easy way to make a wonderful beef stew,' beams Doris Sleeth of Naples, Florida. 'You don't need to brown the neat first-just combine it with hearty chunks of carrots, potatoes and celery...and let it all cook together in a flavorful gravy. My daughter Karen came up with the recipe for her busy family.'
