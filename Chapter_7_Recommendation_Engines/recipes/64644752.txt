Ingredients:
1 1/2 flour
1 c sugar
1/4 c cocoa powder
1/2  tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
1/3 c cold vegan butter like earth balance
1/2 c soy milk or other vegan milk
1/2 c coffe
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp apple cider vinegar or other vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees,  butter and flour an 8" round pan.
First mix all the dry ingredients [Flour, sugar, cocoa powder,salt, baking soda] in a large bowl, wisking until smooth.
Cut the butter into the dry mixture like you would pie dough, be sure to get a very even crumb. None to big and none to small, coating the dry mixture with the butter.
Add soy and coffee, then vanilla and vinegar. Using a mixer (I use a hand mixer), blend smooth and continue to beat for 2 min.
Pour into prepared pan, bake for 35-40 min. Let cool in pan at least 10 min befor taking it out. Recipe adapted from Sue's Vegan Chocolate Cake @Allrecipes
