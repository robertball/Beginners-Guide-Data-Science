Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
½ cup cane sugar or unpacked light brown sugar
1/3  cup cocoa powder
1/3 cup ground cacoa nibs
1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
½ tsp sea salt
1½ cups flour
1/3 cup chocolate chips (optional )
1 c. nut of choice, coarsely chopped (opt)
Wet Ingredients:
1 cup mashed banana (about 2-3 large bananas)
¼ cup applesauce or banana (unsweetened is preferable)
2 tbsp chia seed
½ cup plus 3 tbsp plant milk of choice or hot coffee
2 tbsp maples syrup/ agave syrup/ honey
1 tbsp apple cider or white vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Prepare pan or muffin tins. Mix together dry ingredients in a small bowl. In another mix the wet ingredients. Do not mix wet into dry until ready to bake then mix just until moist overall, fill pan quickly as the vinegar will cause a rise and we want it in the pan not the bowl. Bake 15 to 20 minutes for muffins, 38 -42 for bread until an inserted toothpick comes out almost perfectly clean (not counting melted chips).  Cool in pan about 10 min. (From CearasKitchen)
