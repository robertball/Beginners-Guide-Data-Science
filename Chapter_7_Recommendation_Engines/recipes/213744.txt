Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground dried red chilies
2 serrano chile peppers, seeded and chopped
2 large onions, chopped
2 (15 ounce) cans garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2/3 cup water
salt to taste
3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
2 large tomatoes, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the cumin and ground red chilies, and cook for a few seconds until the spices are fragrant. Add the serrano chiles, onions, garbanzo beans, lemon juice, and water; season to taste with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vegetables are tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle with ginger, tomatoes, and cilantro to serve.
