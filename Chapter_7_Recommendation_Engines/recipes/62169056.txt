1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce
1 egg lightly beaten
1 cup mashed ripe bananas
1 3/4 cups quick cooking oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
In a large bowl mix together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
In a seperate bowl cream together the butter with the sugars.
Add the egg, vanilla, applesauce, and bananas and mix well.
Add the wet mixture to the flour mixture and stir well until smooth.
Add in the oats and mix again.
Drop by spoonfuls a couple inches apart onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake for 9-12 minutes or until edges and tops are just starting to brown.
Remove cookies from pan immediately and cool on wire racks.
Once cooled store the cookies in a freezer bag and they will get even more moist.
