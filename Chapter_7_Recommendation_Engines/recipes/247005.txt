1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup LAND O LAKES® Butter, softened
1/2 cup mashed cooked pumpkin
1/4 cup milk
1 LAND O LAKES® Egg
1 teaspoon vanilla
Filling:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons LAND O LAKES® Butter, softened

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
Combine flour, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and salt in bowl. Set aside.
Combine brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter in bowl; beat at medium speed until creamy. Add pumpkin, milk, egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla; beat until well mixed. Add flour mixture; beat at low speed until well mixed.
Drop batter by level measuring tablespoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake 9-10 minutes or until set and lightly browned around edges. Cool 2 minutes on cookie sheets; remove to cooling rack. Cool completely.
