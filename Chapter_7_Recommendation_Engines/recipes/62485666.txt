Ingredients:
4 large tomatoes
20 fresh basil leaves
20 small balls fresh mozzarella cheese (often labeled bocconcini)
salt and pepper to taste

1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
20 toothpicks

Directions:
Cut the tomatoes into 1" cubes, and slice the basil leaves into strips.
Using a toothpick, spear a tomato cube, a piece of basil (fold a couple times to make an "S" shape), a mozzarella ball, and another tomato cube.
Place on a serving dish and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Drizzle the vinegar and oil over each serving.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Description: 
A great way to serve tomato mozzarella salad.  Great presentation and always a hit. You can find the bite-sized mozzarella at most supermarkets.  If they are on the larger side, cut them in half.Modified from: Tomato and Mozzarella Bites
