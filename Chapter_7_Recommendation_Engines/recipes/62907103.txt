Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
12 ounce box of favorite pasta (I use bow tie)
6 qt water with:
2 tsp dried Thyme, 1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder, and 2 tblsp chicken base
1 (10.75) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
2 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup onion, minced
1 tsp dried Thyme
1/2 tsp garlic powder
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
2 cup frozen peas (optional)
1-1/2 cup crumbled buttery round crackers
1/2 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Poach chicken in a large pot of simmering water and spices. Cook until no longer pink in center, about 15 minutes. Remove from pot and set aside. Bring chicken cooking water to a boil and cook pasta in it. Drain. Cut chicken into small pieces, and mix with noodles.
In a separate bowl, mix together mushroom soup, chicken soup, sour cream, onion, and peas (or any vegetable of your choice).  Season with thyme, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mix well and then gently stir together cream soup mixture with the chicken mixture. Place in a 2 quart baking dish.
Melt butter in microwave and then mix with crumbled crackers. Top casserole with the buttered crackers.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 30-40 minutes, until heated through and browned on top.
