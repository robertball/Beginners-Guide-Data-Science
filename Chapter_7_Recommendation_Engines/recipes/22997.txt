Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 pound rotini pasta
8 ounces frozen mixed vegetables
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake chicken breast halves in a preheated oven until the juices run clear.  About 30 minutes if thawed, 45 minutes if frozen.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
4 minutes before the pasta is ready, add frozen vegetables.  When pasta is cooked, remove pasta and vegetables from heat, drain.   Cut chicken into small cubes and add to the pasta-vegetable mix.  Season with olive oil, pepper, salt.
