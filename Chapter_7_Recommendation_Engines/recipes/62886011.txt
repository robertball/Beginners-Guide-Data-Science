Ingredients:
1 tablespoon wine vinegar (red, white or champagne)
1 1/2 teaspoons very finely minced shallot
1/2 teaspoon regular or light mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/8 teaspoon table salt
Ground black pepper
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon fresh minced parsley or chives
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme , tarragon, marjoram, or oregano

Directions:
Combine vinegar, shallot, mayonnaise, mustard, salt, and pepper to taste in small nonreactive bowl. Whisk until mixture is milky in appearance and no lumps of mayonnaise remain.
Place oil in small measuring cup so that it is easy to pour. Whisking constantly, very slowly drizzle oil into vinegar mixture. If pools of oil are gathering on surface as you whisk, stop addition of oil and whisk mixture well to combine, then resume whisking in oil in slow stream. Vinaigrette should be glossy and lightly thickened, with no pools of oil on its surface. Add herbs just before use.

Description: 
A basic vinaigrette that holds together. This is my basic go-to dressing recipe. I just add or remove herbs and spices to change it's character to fit whatever menu I'm serving it with. Stolen from Cook's Illustrated, Sept. 2009.
