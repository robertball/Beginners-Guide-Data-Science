Ingredients:
3 slices bacon, diced
3 shallots, sliced
4 ounces chicken breast, cut into small cubes
4 teaspoons curry powder, divided
3 egg yolks, beaten
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed (optional)
3 cups cooked jasmine rice
1 red Thai bird chile pepper, finely chopped
2 tablespoons whole cilantro leaves
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons fish sauce
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
4 ounces tiger prawns, peeled and deveined
1/4 cup chopped fresh pineapple
3 green onions, finely chopped

Directions:
Place bacon in a wok or large skillet; cook and stir over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and reserve bacon drippings in the wok. Cook and stir shallots in bacon drippings over medium-high heat until fragrant and light brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir chicken into shallots and cook without stirring until browned on one side, 45 seconds to 1 minute; stir. Continue cooking until chicken is browned, about 1 minute. Add 2 teaspoons curry powder; stir until chicken is coated.
Make a well in the center of chicken and pour oil into center of the well; add egg yolks. Cook and stir egg yolks until set, 1 to 2 minutes. Add rice and stir, breaking up rice.
Mix chile pepper, cilantro, soy sauce, remaining 2 teaspoons curry powder, fish sauce, and sugar into rice mixture; add shrimp and cook until shrimp is cooked through and pink, about 2 minutes. Fold pineapple, green onions, and bacon into rice mixture.

This is a Bangkok street food style recipe which I snagged on a recent trip there. Serve and enjoy. Try a hollowed pineapple shell as a serving bowl.
