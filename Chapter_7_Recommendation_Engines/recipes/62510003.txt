Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter, divided
1 onion, chopped
6 to 8 medium sized tomotoes (peeled, squeezed to
get the seeds out, then chopped)
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon sugar
1.5 lbs. hamburger
12 oz. frozen corn, thawed (could substitute off the
cob sweet corn)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place 1 T. butter in sauce pan over medium heat. Add onion to pan.  Saute onions until soft, about 5 min. Add garlic, saute another couple minutes to soften garlic.  Add peeled, seeded, chopped tomotoes, salt, pepper, 1 T. butter, and sugar.  Stir and bring to simmer.  Simmer about 10 min.  Meanwhile, brown hamburger in skillet and preheat oven to 350.
Place thawed or cut of the cob corn in 9 x 9 pan. (Sometimes I add a little salt, pepper, and/or garlic salt on top of corn)
Add browned hamburger on top of corn as the second layer.
Spoon the stewed tomato mixture onto the beef as the top layer.
If making ahead or freezing, cover and place in fridge or freezer. Thaw before baking.  Baking time may vary to about 40-45 min to heat through.
If making now, place casserole in 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes or until warmed through.
