Ingredients:
1 pound ground chicken breast
1 ripe California grown avocado, cut in small chunks
2/3 cup breadcrumbs
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 chopped garlic clove
4 whole wheat buns
1 large tomato

Directions:
Mix the chopped avocado, breadcrumbs, cilantro and garlic separately.
Combine this with the ground chicken breast. Form into 4 to 5 patties.
Get a medium hot grill going and place the burgers on the grill. You only need to flip them once. These should cook quickly. Approximately 3 to 4 minutes per side.
Serve on a bun with a slice of tomato.
