Description: 
An out of this world salad that will have your dinner guests begging for the recipe. It is also versatile - summer berries are a nice alternative. I wouldn't normally tout a brand, but the only company I know that makes maple flavored balsamic vinegar is Wildly Delicious in their distinct tall blue bottles.
