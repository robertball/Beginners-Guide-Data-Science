Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
8 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 eggs
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt the butter then stir in the sugars and vanilla.
Combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Stir in the beaten eggs. Then add the chocolate chips and stir to combine.
On an ungreased cookie sheet drop cookies about 1 to 2 inches apart. Make the cookies in whatever size you like from small to big. Bake cookies at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes. The shorter time will produce a chewy cookie, the longer time a crispy cookie.
