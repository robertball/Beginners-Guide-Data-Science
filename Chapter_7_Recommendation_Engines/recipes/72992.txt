Ingredients:
1 cup self-rising flour
1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoons mayonnaise

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). If you are not using a nonstick muffin pan, grease 5 cups of a regular muffin pan.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, milk, and mayonnaise. Spoon into the 5 prepared muffin cups.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until nicely puffed and browned.
