Ingredients:
1/4 cup canola or olive oil
1/4 cup unsalted butter
2 (10 ounce) bags fresh spinach leaves
8 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
salt and pepper to taste at finish

Directions:
Melt the butter with the canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it stops bubbling. This allows the water from the butter to evaporate. Add the garlic; cook and stir for about 2 minutes, until it is just beginning to brown. Put in the spinach leaves and cook for about 5 minutes while stirring, until the leaves are dark and are about 1/4 of their original size.
