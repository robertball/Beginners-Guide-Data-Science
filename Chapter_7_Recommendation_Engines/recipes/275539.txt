Ingredients:
12 ounces ground pork
8 ounces ground Italian sausage (mild or hot)
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1 egg
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine pork, sausage, bread crumbs, egg, salt, parsley, and paprika in a large bowl and mix until evenly combined. Form into 12 equally-sized meatballs using an ice cream scoop. Place meatballs on a baking sheet.
Place 1/2 of the meatballs in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 8 minutes. Shake the basket and cook for 2 minutes more. Transfer to a serving plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining meatballs.

Description: 
Perfectly crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside--pork meatballs made in the air fryer. The best part is that you can make them ahead of time and freeze for later use. I have included those directions in the notes. Dip meatballs in marinara, if desired.
