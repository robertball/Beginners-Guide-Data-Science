Ingredients:
Corn Tortillas (6")
1-2 tsp olive oil
Eggs
Shredded cheddar cheese
salsa
diced tomatoes
sliced black olives
cooked bacon, chopped
1 can black beans
1 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp onion powder

Directions:
For the Black Beans:
Drain and rinse black beans and place in a pan and add cumin and onion powder.  Heat through on medium-low heat, cook for about 15 minutes.
Egg/Tortilla:
In a skillet sprayed with cooking spray, heat over medium heat.
Place tortilla in skillet, until slightly crispy, about 1-2 minutes, flip and cook for another 1 minute or so.
Sprinkle tortilla with cheese.
Crack 1 egg onto tortilla, being careful not to break the yoke.  Use a lid to cover the egg and cook until egg white is cooked through, about 2-3 minutes depending on how hot you have your skillet.
Serve tortilla/egg topped with a little more cheese, olives, tomatoes, salsa, and bacon and a side of black beans.
