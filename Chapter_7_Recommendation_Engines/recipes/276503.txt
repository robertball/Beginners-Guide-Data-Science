Ingredients:
1 stick salted butter, divided
1 small onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (2 pound) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups crushed cornflakes, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until starting to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 2 minutes more.
Transfer mixture to a large bowl; add cans of soup, sour cream, and pepper. Mix to combine. Stir in hash browns and 2 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese until combined. Place in a 9x13-inch casserole dish and top with remaining cheese.
Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter and combine with cornflakes. Place on top of casserole.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly around the edges and cornflakes are lightly browned, about 45 minutes.
