Ingredients:
10 cups oats
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon cinnamon
3 tablespoon apple pie spice
1 cup honey
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup maple syrup
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup raisins
1 cup dried apples
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup Crasins (or sweet, dried Cranberries)

Directions:
Preheat oven 300 F (150 C).  Mix together oats, flour, salt, cinnamon, and apple pie spice.  In a saucepan, melt butter on medium heat.  Then, add the honey, maple syrup, and brown sugar and stir until sugar is dissolved and everything is well blended (about 5 minutes).  Pour this into the oat mixture and mix until all the oats are a little wet. Then spread oats evenly onto a flat pan with sides (13 x 9 x 2). Press the oats down a little, then bake for 30 minutes. Remove from oven, stir well, but gently, again spread them over the pan, press down a little, and bake for another 30 minutes.   Take out of oven and let cool.  The oats will get crunchy as it cools.  Then, stir in the other ingredients.

Description: 
One of my favorite snacks is a good granola, the kind that keeps on crunching even after sitting in milk.  When I moved to Russia I could not find a granola that satisfied me.  So, I started trying online recipes for crunchy granola.  Every time I was disappointed.  So, after a few attempts to make my own, I came up with this.  I hope you enjoy it.
