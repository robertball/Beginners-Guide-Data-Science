Ingredients:
For the bread:
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup oat bran
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp brown sugar
1/4 cup mashed or canned pumpkin
1/4 cup milk
1/2 tsp vanilla
For the custard:
2/3 cup milk
1 egg
1/2 tsp vanilla
1tsp cornstarch
2 1/2 tbsp white sugar
1/2 cup pumpkin

Directions:
Preheat a small or toaster oven to 350F.
In a small mixing bowl, combine the flour, oat bran, baking soda, salt, and brown sugar, mixing evenly. Add in the pumpkin, milk, and vanilla, stirring only until smooth. Do not overmix.
Pour the batter into a greased ramekin and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick can be inserted and comes out clean. Once finished baking, let the ramekin cool for 5-10 minutes before taking out the bread and letting it cool for an additional 15-20 minutes. Keep the oven heated to 350F.
For the custard, combine all ingredients in a small mixing bowl and stir until smooth. Make sure there are no clumps of cornstarch in the mixture.
Cut the bread into 1-inch cubes and divide evenly among four ramekins. Pour the custard evenly over the four dishes. Place the ramekins in a larger baking dish and fill with an inch of water. Bake in the oven for 35-45 minutes, or until just set. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving, or cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator for storage.

Description: 
I was inspired to make this recipe when I saw a can of pumpkin sitting in our garage. I had been experimenting with single-serve breads and cakes, so I wanted to meld the two to create a bread pudding.
