Ingredients:
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups spelt flour, or more if needed
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chocolate chips (optional)
1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
Place an oven rack in the lowest position in the oven and place a second rack in an upper position. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat brown sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into brown sugar mixture until combined. Fold in chocolate chips and pecans. Spoon small amounts of dough onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven on the lower shelf for 5 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to upper shelf; bake until edges are lightly browned, about 5 more minutes.

Description: 
These are a heartier version of the traditional chocolate chip cookie recipes. Using spelt flour, which is higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate, is a very nice change. The cookies are easy to make and are delicious!
 Spelt flour is now available in many grocery stores and all health food stores. Try adding sunflower seeds, almonds, shredded coconut, or oats to the batter for something different!
