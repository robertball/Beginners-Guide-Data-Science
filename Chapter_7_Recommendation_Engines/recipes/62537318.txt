Ingredients:
2 cups shortening
2 cups white sugar
2 cups canned pumpkin
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon salt
4 cups all-purpose flour
For plain Icing:
3 cups powdered sugar
3 tablespoons milk
For spiced icing:
2 cups powdered sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Cream shortening, white sugar, vanilla and pumpkin. Add eggs and mix well.  Sift together the baking soda, spices, salt and flour.  Add to pumpkin mixture and mix well.
Drop from spoon or small disher to parchment lined cookie sheet.  Bake 12 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), rotating trays after 8 minutes if baking two at a time.  (top to bottom, bottom to top)
To make plain icing:  Mix the 3 cups powdered sugar and 3 Tbsp milk together, adding milk slowly and mixing until you reach a dipping consistency.  Dip cookies into icing and place back on parchment to set.  Meanwhile, prepare spiced icing:
Mix together the 2 cups powdered sugar and spices, then slowly add the 1 - 2 Tbs milk until you reach a thicker consistency for drizzling over the cookies.  After the plain icing has set, drizzle the spiced icing over the cookies and enjoy!
