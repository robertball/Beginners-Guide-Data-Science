Ingredients:
Enchiladas:
8-10 corn tortillas
1 pound of hamburger
2 blocks of cream cheese
3 chopped green onions
1 can of orignal Rotelle
1 cup of grated cheese
Sauce:
16 ounce jar of your favorite salsa
6 ounce can of tomato sauce
1 tablespoons of chili powder
teaspoon of cumin
teaspoon of corriander
1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon

Directions:
For sauce: Add salsa, tomato sauce and spices into a sauce pan.  Thin with water if necessary.  Bring to a boil, then cover and let simmer for half an hour.
(Optional: I like to add a little milk and puree the sauce in a blender before pouring over the enchiladas.)
For enchiladas:  brown and season hamburger.  Drain.  In a medium size mixing bowl, soften cream cheese in microwave until it is almost melted.  Stir in chopped green onion, hamburger, cheese and Rotelle.  Spoon mixture into enchiladas, fold and place seam down in greased baking pan.  Cover enchiladas with sauce and bake at 350 for 30-40 minutes, until dish is heated throughout and bubbly.
