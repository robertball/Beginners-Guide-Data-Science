Ingredients:
3 cups water
2 assam tea bags
2 ceylon tea bags
1/4 inch piece fresh ginger
2 dried rose buds
3 green cardamom pods
2 black cardamom pods
1/2 inch piece cinnamon stick
1/8 cup Chinese white lump sugar
1 cup evaporated milk

Directions:
Heat the water until bubbles start to form around the edges. Add the tea bags. Reduce the heat to a simmer.
Lightly crush the rose buds, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and lump sugar in a mortar. Add  to the pot and stir. Simmer until the tea bags and spices have become saturated, about 3 minutes. Add the evaporated milk. Stir and allow to simmer until the strength desired has been reached and the sugar has dissolved. Typically, this can take up to 8 minutes for a strong cup of tea. Do not boil the tea. It should be a low simmer.
Note: This uses Chinese white rock sugar to avoid any caramel overtones found in cane sugar. Plain white granulated sugar can be used but may change the flavor.

Description: 
I found this tea on a recent trip to the UAE but have learned that is popular all over the Middle East. Roughly translated karak chai means “strong tea”. It differs from Masala chai by using fewer spices, slightly stronger tea, evaporated milk, and lump sugar. I make up a big batch in the morning and drink it throughout the day. It’s nice chilled or reheated.
