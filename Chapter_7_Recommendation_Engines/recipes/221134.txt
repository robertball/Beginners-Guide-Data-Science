Ingredients:
1 cup canola oil
2/3 cup white sugar
2/3 cup ketchup
1/2 cup white vinegar
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups rotini pasta
2 tomatoes, chopped
1 small onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 cup chopped cucumber

Directions:
Whisk canola oil, sugar, ketchup, vinegar, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Set aside to let the flavors blend for 30 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse with cold water to cool; drain.
Combine cooled pasta, tomatoes, onion, green bell pepper, and cucumber in a bowl.
Drizzle the dressing over the pasta mixture and toss to coat.
Chill in refrigerator for 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
This is an excellent macaroni salad that everyone in my family has made over the years, and now I make. We have this with dinner at least once a week or every two weeks. It's a hit with everyone, as there's ketchup and sugar  in it for the kids. Just try it; you'll LOVE it!
