Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup shortening (such as CriscoÂ®)
1 egg
1 cup canned pumpkin
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
Maple Frosting:
4 cups powdered sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 tablespoon milk, or as needed
1 teaspoon maple extract, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix sugar and shortening together in a bowl. Mix in egg. Add pumpkin and vanilla extract; mix well. Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt and mix until well combined. Fold in walnuts.
Use small teaspoons or a cookie scoop to drop rounded teaspoonfuls of cookie dough onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges turn golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool.
Meanwhile, beat powdered sugar and butter together with an electric mixer until combined. Stir in milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, until a frosting consistency is reached. Fold in maple extract until thoroughly combined.
Spread maple frosting over the cooled cookies.
