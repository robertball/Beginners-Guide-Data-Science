Ingredients:
16 ounces macaroni elbows
5 ounce solid white tuna in water, 2 cans
2 tablespoon ranch dressing
2 tablespoons sour cream
1 cup mayonnaise
2 stalks celery, chopped
¼ red onion, chopped
1 mini cucumber, diced
½ sweet pickled red pepper, chopped
3 tablespoons dried cranberries
5 pitted dates, minced (Optional)
ground pepper and salt to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain, and rinse with cold water until no longer hot. Transfer elbows to a large bowl.
Stir together ranch dressing, sour cream, and mayonnaise in a small bowl.
Break up tuna to desire chunks and add remaining ingredients and lightly stir, then stir together with the elbows. Stir in the dressing. If you like salad more creamer then add more mayonnaise.

Description: 
Nothing like a serving of tuna macaroni by itself or as a side with something off the grill. I've been making variations of the salad but what I've always like to include celery, red onion, and dried cranberries. I've been known to add frozen peas, raisins and crushed walnuts. In this variation I added dates, cucumber, and pickled red pepper because they complement the sweetness of other ingredients.
