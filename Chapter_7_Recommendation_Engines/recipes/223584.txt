Description: 
I came up with this broccoli slaw side dish when I was trying to clear the fridge out prior to leaving for a vacation. Grabbed what I saw, stirred up a bowl, and gave it a cheeky title based on some of the cute terms my daughter uses for food. I used lite mayo and Splenda, and I'm sure it would be great with full-fat mayo and sugar. Saved the other half-can of garbanzos for tossing with a salad. I also used half fresh, half frozen broccoli (as that's what I had on hand), and it was all tasty.
