Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breast cutlets (or regular breast cut, pounded thin or butterflied)
2 tsp oregano (or to taste)
1 tsp red pepper flakes (or to taste)
salt and black pepper to taste
4 slices proscuitto ham
4 slices provolone cheese
1/2 cup garlic-infused butter, melted
1 cup panko-style breadcrumbs
1-2 tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Season the chicken cutlets with oregano, red pepper, salt and black pepper, to taste.
Top each chicken piece with a slice of proscuitto and a slice of cheese. Roll up or fold over and secure with toothpicks.
Dip each chicken piece in the melted garlic butter, then coat well in panko crumbs.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet on medium-high heat. Briefly brown the chicken rolls all over.
Transfer the chicken to a baking dish or pan lined with foil and/or sprayed with non-stick spray. If you have extra melted garlic butter, you can drizzle it over the chicken if you wish.
Bake at 350F until fully cooked, about 30 minutes.
