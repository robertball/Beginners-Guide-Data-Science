Description: 
Even when the garden is snow-covered, its bounty crops up in the steaming bowls Donna Quinn passes around her Salem, Wisconsin table. 'This filling soup is a favorite with our family and is often requested for company dinners,' she reports. A hint of fennel accents the flavor or this quick-to-fix bean soup...and spinach and tomatoes add color.
