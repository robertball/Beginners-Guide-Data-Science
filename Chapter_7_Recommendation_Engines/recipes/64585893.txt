Ingredients:
2 steaks
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp butter
Course salt and pepper
2 cloves garlic, chopped
4-6 sprigs fresh thyme

Directions:
Let steaks rest @ 20 minutes before cooking.
LIBERALLY sprinkle with course salt and pepper, pushing steaks into the seasonings.
Heat pan to medium or medium high, then add olive oil.
Lay steaks in pan, making sure you get a sizzle for a quick sear.
Turn steaks over every minute.
Add garlic, thyme, and butter.
Baste juices over steak frequently.
Remove from heat a little before they are cooked to your liking and let rest before serving.
