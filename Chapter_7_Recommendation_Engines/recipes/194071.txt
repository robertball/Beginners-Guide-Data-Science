Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups bow tie (farfalle) pasta
1 cup Greek salad dressing
2 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise
4 radishes, finely chopped
1/2 cucumber, peeled and chopped
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the bow tie pasta and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Place the Greek dressing and mayonnaise into a large salad bowl, and whisk together until smooth and well blended. Add the cooked pasta, and stir lightly to coat the pasta. Sprinkle on the radishes, cucumber, garbanzo beans, and crumbled feta cheese, and fold in gently.
Cover the salad and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Description: 
I was craving carbs and a Greek salad one day and that led to this wonderful creation.  Greek dressing is so underrated, but in this recipe it is the star!  This is a nice, light salad that showcases chick peas, radishes, cucumbers and feta cheese.
