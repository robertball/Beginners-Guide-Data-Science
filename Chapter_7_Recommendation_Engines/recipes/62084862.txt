Ingredients:
1 T. butter
1/2 c. chopped onion
3 chicken breast halves, cut into 1/2" pieces
1.25 oz. package taco seasoning mix
4 oz. salsa
1/8 t. chili powder
1/2 t. garlic powder
1/8 t. cumin
10 3/4 oz. can cream of chicken soup
1/2 c. sour cream
2 c. shredded cheddar cheese, divided
6 (12-inch) flour tortillas
1/4 c. milk

Directions:
In a large skillet, melt butter.  Stir in onion and chicken and cook until chicken is tender (do not drain).  Stir in taco seasoning mix.  Simmer about 5 minutes (add a little water if it thickens too much).  In a large bowl, mix salsa, chili powder, cumin, garlic, soup and sour cream.  Stir 1/4 cup of this mixture into the skillet of chicken (reserve the rest).  Fill each tortilla with 2 heaping tablespoons of chicken mixture and sprinkle with cheese (using 1 cup of the cheese)and roll up.  Place seam side down in a greased 9x13 baking dish.  To reserved sauce, add the milk.  Spoon this mixture over the tortillas and top with the remaining 1 cup cheese.  Bake uncovered 30-35 minutes or until cheese is bubbly.
NOTE:  You may double sauce if you like saucy enchiladas.
