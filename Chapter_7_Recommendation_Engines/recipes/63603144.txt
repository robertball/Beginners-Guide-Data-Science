Ingredients:
Ricotta balls:
32 oz. ricotta cheese
2 tbs. sour cream
1 cup cream wheat
2 eggs
1 tsp. vanilla
2 tsp. sugar
Breadcrubs:
8-10 oz. breadcrumbs
4-6 tbs. vegetable oil
2 tsp. sugar
hint of cinnamon
Serving ideas:
- powdered sugar
- vanilla, or other greek yoghurt
- strawberry jam

Directions:
1. Mix together all ingredients for the ricotta cheese balls in a large microwave bowl.
2. Microwave on high for 8-9 minutes, stirring in every minute until it has a play-dough consistency.
3. In the meantime, heat the oil in a large wok pan, put in the breadcrumbs, sugar, cinnamon, and toast it to golden brown. Keep it warm on the lowest setting.
3. Form small, 1-1.5 inch balls with wet hands (meatball size)
4. Boil them, just like any pasta (makes 2-3 batches). They are ready after 3-4 minutes, when they float.
5. Roll them in breadcrumbs, and serve them with powdered sugar, strawberry jam, or vanilla greek yogurt!

Description: 
This is a traditional Hungarian recipe, very fast and easy to make. Sweet, but low in sugars.
Like many Hungarian dishes, it is served after a hearty soup which counts as main dish.
Great as a fast, standalone dish for dinner.
Kid-friendly tip: loose the cheese word! I call them cream-wheat balls.
