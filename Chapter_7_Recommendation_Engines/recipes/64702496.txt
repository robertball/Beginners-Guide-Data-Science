Ingredients:
1 sweet potato
1 Tablespoon canola oil
1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon sweet paprika

Directions:
Preheat the Air Fryer to 400 degrees.
Cut the sweet potato into  1/2 inch wide fries.   Put the cut fries into a bowl and coat with the 1 tablespoon of canola oil.  Add the salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika and mix until all fries are coated evenly.
Cook in an even layer in the Air Fryer, which will result in 2 to 3 batches for 10 minutes each or  for desired doneness.
