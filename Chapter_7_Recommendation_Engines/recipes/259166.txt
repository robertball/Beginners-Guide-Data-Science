Description: 
Based off my mint tea punch recipe, this is a quick and easy way to make an adult pitcher drink that is wonderful for those hot summer nights! The mint and rum make this cocktail reminiscent of a mojito, but the tea and juices give it an added twist! Add more rum to make it stronger, or reduce the kick by adding less rum and more cold water. It's a versatile, refreshing, and above all, easy drink to make. Serve over ice, and garnish each glass with orange and lemon slices and a sprig of mint. Enjoy!
