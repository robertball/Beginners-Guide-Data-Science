Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato, thinly sliced
1 large potato, thinly sliced
1 onion, thinly sliced
4 tablespoons butter, divided
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3/4 cup vegetable broth
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon dried parsley (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In the prepared dish, make a single layer of sweet potato slices.  Place a few onion slices on top, dot with butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Repeat, alternating layers of white and sweet potatoes.
In a small bowl, or measuring cup, combine flour and broth.  Pour over potatoes.
Sprinkle cheese, bread crumbs and parsley over the potatoes.  Dot with remaining butter.  Cover.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until potatoes and onions are soft.

Description: 
I created this dish after getting tired of all those yam recipes using brown sugar and marshmallows. This makes sweet potatoes taste more like they should - a side dish rather than a dessert. Also, you can easily adapt this recipe to vegan simply by using soy cheese. It's worked well for me in the past.
