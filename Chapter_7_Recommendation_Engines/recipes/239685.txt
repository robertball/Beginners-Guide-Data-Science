Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 cup plain dry bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
1 (14.5 ounce) carton Campbell'sÂ® Sweet Onion Soup

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Thoroughly mix the beef, bread crumbs, egg and 1/4 cup soup in a large bowl.  Season with salt and black pepper, if desired.
Shape the beef mixture into a 10x4-inch loaf.  Cut the loaf crosswise into 6 mini meatloaves.  Place the mini meatloaves, cut-side down, into a 13x9x2-inch baking dish.  Pour the remaining soup over the meatloaves.
Bake for 25 minutes or until the meatloaves are cooked through.
