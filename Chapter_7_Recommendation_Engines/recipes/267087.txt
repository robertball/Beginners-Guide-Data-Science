Ingredients:
4 pounds lean ground beef
3 cups Italian bread crumbs
4 eggs
1 large onion, chopped
1/4 cup spaghetti sauce
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
Topping:
1/4 cup spaghetti sauce
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
3 drops orange food coloring, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine beef, bread crumbs, eggs, onion, spaghetti sauce, Parmesan cheese, and garlic salt in a large bowl. Push mixture down into the bottom of the bowl and smooth the top. Flip bowl over into a large cake pan with sides to hold drippings. Use fingers to mold a stem shape at the top and make a happy or scary pumpkin face in the meat.
Combine spaghetti sauce and orange food coloring in a small bowl. Paint the meat loaf surface with the sauce mixture and sprinkle Italian seasoning on the stem.
Bake in the preheated oven until inside is no longer pink, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
Drain grease from cake pan or transfer loaf to a serving plate.

Description: 
This meatloaf has great holiday spirit. It will have everyone talking and maybe laughing. Don't worry, though, they are not laughing at you, but at the smile on the food's face.
