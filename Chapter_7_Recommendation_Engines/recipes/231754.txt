Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (4 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup marinara sauce
1/2 tomato, chopped
1/4 cup sliced black olives
4 slices green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch dice
4 slices red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch dice
1 artichoke heart, quartered
1 tablespoon chopped fresh garlic
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
10 ounces cavatappi (corkscrew) pasta
2 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms in the hot oil until slightly softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add marinara sauce, tomato, olives, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, artichoke heart, garlic, basil, salt, and pepper to mushrooms; bring to a boil. Simmer until tomato sauce is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatappi in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl.
Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over cavatappi. Pour tomato sauce over mozzarella layer; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
