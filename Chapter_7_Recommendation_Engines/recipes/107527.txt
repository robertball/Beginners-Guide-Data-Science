Ingredients:
1/2 cup teriyaki sauce
1/4 cup honey
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
2 1/2 pounds beef sirloin, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 fresh pineapple - peeled, cored and cut into 1-inch chunks
skewers

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix the teriyaki sauce, honey, garlic and ginger.
Place beef and bell peppers in a large, resealable plastic bag. Pour in marinade, seal and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight.
Preheat grill for medium-high heat.
Thread a piece of beef, then bell pepper and pineapple onto skewers, leaving a small space between each item, until all ingredients are used up. Discard marinade.
Place kabobs on hot grill; cover and cook, turning once, until grill marks form on both sides and beef is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Serve.
