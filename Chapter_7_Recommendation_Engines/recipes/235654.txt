Ingredients:
oil for frying
1 (6 ounce) package chicken-flavored stuffing mix
1 pound ground chicken
1/3 cup hot sauce (such as Frank's RedHot ®)
2 eggs
1 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Frank's RedHot ®), or to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour stuffing mix into a plastic resealable bag and crush into fine crumbs using a rolling pin. Mash crushed stuffing mix, chicken, 1/3 cup hot sauce, and eggs together in a large bowl using a potato masher until just combined. Form mixture into 1-inch meatballs.
Fry meatballs in the hot oil until browned and cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle meatballs with about 1 teaspoon hot sauce.
