Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, broken into florets
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 cloves garlic, chopped, or more to taste
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/3 cup skim milk
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Toss cauliflower, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Pour cauliflower onto a large sheet of aluminum foil and wrap tightly; place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cauliflower is tender, 45 to 55 minutes. Transfer cauliflower mixture to a bowl and mash to desired consistency.
Mix olive oil and milk into mashed cauliflower mixture. Drop cauliflower mixture by the spoonful into muffin cups and top with Cheddar cheese and red pepper flakes.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool for 2 minutes before removing from the pan.

This is my spin on mashed cauliflower: delicious, cheesy bites with a spicy kick! For a thicker consistency use cream instead of milk.
