Ingredients:
12 ounce box of crisped rice cereal
2 cups white sugar
18 ounce jar of creamy or chunky peanut butter
16 ounce bottle of light corn syrup
12 ounce bag of semi sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Butter or grease 2 13" x 9" pans. In a medium sized sauce pan, combine the sugar and corn syrup and simmer at medium heat. Remove from heat once small bubbles start to form. Stir in the peanut butter to the sugar mixture until it is all melted. Pour cereal into a very large bowl. Pour contents of peanut butter and sugar mixture over the cereal until it is evenly coated. Press evenly into pans and pat lightly with spatula to even it out. In the meantime, melt chocolate in a heat proof container at medium heat in the microwave for 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds. Spread over the scotcheroos. Let cool at room temperature and slice into squares when chocolate has completely hardened.

Description: 
This makes an enormous batch that requires little measuring. The ratio of cereal to peanut butter mixture is a bit higher than the traditional versions, but it ALWAYS turns out perfect!!! This version is tad less sweet but still retains full flavor and texture. I am sure you will be pleased with the ease and the results!!
