Ingredients:
Broth:
3 (32 fluid ounce) containers vegetable broth
6 stalks lemon grass, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 tablespoons vegetable bouillon (such as Better Than BouillonÂ®)
5 whole star anise pods
Noodles and Garnish:
1 (16 ounce) package dried thin rice noodles
1 (8 ounce) package bean sprouts
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
2 limes, sliced, or as desired
1 bunch fresh cilantro
1 (.75 ounce) package fresh basil
1 bunch green onions, sliced
Flavoring:
1/4 cup teriyaki sauce, or to taste
1/4 cup soy sauce, or to taste
1/4 cup chile paste, or to taste
1/4 cup sesame oil, or to taste

Directions:
Combine vegetable broth, lemon grass, vegetable bouillon, and star anise pods in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer until flavors are combined, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove lemon grass and star anise with a slotted spoon and discard.
Place rice noodles in a bowl and cover with hot water to soften, about 10 minutes. Drain and cut into shorter pieces with kitchen shears; divide noodles equally between soup bowls. Fill bowls with hot broth to cover noodles.
Place bean sprouts, mushrooms, limes, cilantro, basil, and green onions into separate bowls. Place teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, chile paste, and sesame oil in separate bowls. Serve soup alongside garnishes and flavorings.

Description: 
I adapted this Asian pho dish from a traditional Hmong recipe for my vegetarian fiance. The broth is very basic and then each person seasons and garnishes it according to their individual tastes. There is no right way to season and garnish this dish. Be creative and feel free to add your own twist. For flavoring, use red pepper paste, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and sesame oil.
