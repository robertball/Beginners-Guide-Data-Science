Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound boneless pork, cut into thin bite-size pieces
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 head cabbage, shredded
1 onion, diced
1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups chicken broth, divided
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pork in hot vegetable oil until browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a bowl. Heat butter in the same skillet; cook and stir cabbage until wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir onion into cabbage and cook until onion is translucent, stirring often, about 5 more minutes.
Sprinkle vegetables with caraway seeds and season with salt and black pepper; pour 1/2 cup chicken broth into skillet. Raise heat to medium-high and cook until broth has nearly evaporated; pour remaining 1 cup broth into skillet. Return pork to skillet, add red and green bell peppers, and cover; cook until peppers start to soften, about 10 minutes.
