Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
4 cups grated zucchini
2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup vegetable oil

1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 3/4 cups ground walnuts
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
confectioners' sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large loaf pan with butter.
Stir zucchini, sugar, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl.
Combine flour, walnuts, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Gradually stir flour mixture into zucchini mixture until combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 80 minutes. Let cool in the pan, about 30 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar.

Description: 
This zucchini cake recipe is from my grandmother--she used to pass the zucchini through a meat mincer because they had no food processor. The zucchini cake keeps well wrapped in aluminum foil in the refrigerator and can also be frozen.
