Ingredients:
2 pounds red potatoes, chopped
1 1/2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes
3/4 cup fresh basil, chopped
3 cloves garlic, pressed
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In the prepared baking dish, toss the potatoes, tomatoes, basil, and garlic with the olive oil. Sprinkle with the rosemary.
Bake 20 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, turning occasionally, until tender.

Description: 
Simple and light. The roasted tomato gives a light and tangy flavor which balances with the starchiness of the potatoes. Use a red or yellow potato for best flavor. Garlic, fresh basil, and a hint of rosemary add to the aroma. My girlfriend loves this as a side with chicken or pork.
