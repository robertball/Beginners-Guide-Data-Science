Ingredients:
1 pound beef sirloin steaks
1 tablespoon olive oil
2/3 cup cocktail sauce
1/4 cup honey
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1/4 teaspoon seasoning salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms

Directions:
Pierce steaks all over with a fork, and place them into a resealable freezer bag. In a medium bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon of olive oil, cocktail sauce, honey, soy sauce, garlic, and seasoning salt.  Pour over the steaks in the bag, seal, and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 6 hours, turning frequently.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. When grill is heated, lightly oil the grate.
Remove steaks from marinade, reserving marinade. Grill for about 7 minutes on each side, or to your desired degree of doneness.
While steaks are grilling, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, and cook until tender. Pour in reserved marinade, and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes, or until thickened. Serve with steaks.
