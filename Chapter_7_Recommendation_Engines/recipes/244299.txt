Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend
1 cup butter, cut into small pieces
1 1/2 cups garbanzo bean flour
1 teaspoon smoked paprika, or more to taste (optional)
kosher salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Put Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese in a bowl; add butter. Cover bowl and let sit until warmed to room temperature.
Combine flour and paprika together in a separate bowl.
Mix cheese and butter together using your hands. Slowly add flour mixture to cheese-butter mixture until dough holds together in a ball. Roll dough onto a work surface, about 1/8-inch thick. Cut dough into cracker shapes using cookie cutters or a knife; sprinkle salt over dough. Arrange dough pieces on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until crackers are crisp, 15 to 18 minutes.
