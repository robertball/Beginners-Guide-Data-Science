Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon butter
4 (6 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 medium apples, cored and thinly sliced (such as Autumn GloryÂ®)
1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
2 teaspoons honey
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and add to the hot skillet, skin-side down, leaving at least 1 inch between the breasts to ensure even cooking and browning. Cook until skin is browned, about 6 minutes. Turn and cook an additional 6 minutes until browned on both sides. Transfer chicken breasts to a plate.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet and stir in apples and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes. Season with sage, rosemary, thyme, salt, poultry seasoning, and pepper; stir to combine.
While apples are cooking, whisk together chicken broth, whipping cream, honey, and mustard in a small bowl. Pour broth mixture in with the seasoned apples and onions and gently scrape browned bits from the bottom using a wooden spoon. Slide chicken breasts back into the skillet, nestling them between onions and apples.
Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
