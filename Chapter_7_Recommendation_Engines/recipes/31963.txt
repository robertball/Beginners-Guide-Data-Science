1 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
1 cup water

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until evenly brown; drain excess fat.

Description: 
This was my favorite dinner growing up. It's a quick and easy way to get picky kids to eat green beans, because of the sweet sauce. It's great served over rice, or alone.
