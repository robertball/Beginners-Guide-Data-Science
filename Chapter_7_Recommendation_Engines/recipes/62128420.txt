Description: 
This is the best Alfredo recipe I have.  Most are either too bland, or too runny.  This is nice and thick with a great blend of cheese/garlic.  Primo.  I make it often and it only takes about 10-15 minutes.  Use fresh minced garlic for the best flavour.  I also use the cream cheese that has garlic and herbs. Enjoy!!
