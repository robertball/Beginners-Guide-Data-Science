Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package wide rice noodles
1/4 cup ketchup
1 tablespoon dark sesame oil
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 eggs, beaten
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 cup fresh bean sprouts
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup unsalted dry-roasted peanuts, chopped

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add noodles, remove from heat, and let soak until noodles are softened, about 15 minutes. Drain.
Mix ketchup, sesame oil, fish sauce, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Set aside.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp; saute until firm and opaque, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove shrimp and add remaining oil to the skillet.
Pour eggs into the skillet; cook and stir until lightly scrambled, about 5 minutes. Add green onions, bean sprouts, and garlic. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the noodles, ketchup mixture, and cooked shrimp. Cook for 3 minutes more. Sprinkle with peanuts.
