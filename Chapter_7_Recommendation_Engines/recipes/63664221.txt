Ingredients:
6 bone in chicken breasts (about 2 1/2 lbs total)
1 orange, quartered and sliced
1 lemon, quartered and sliced
1/4 cup dry white wine
1 tsp fresh snipped mint or 1/4 tsp dried and crushed
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp season salt
1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper
1/8 tsp ground allspice
1 medium onion, sliced
1/2 cup pitted green olives

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix wine, mint, garlic, salt, pepper and allspice.
Pour into a large resealable plastic bag and add chicken.  Seal bag; turn to coat chicken and let marinate in refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours, turning bag occasionally.  Drain chicken, reserving citrus pieces and marinade.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Place onion slices on the bottom of a 15 x 1 inch baking dish.  Top with chicken and olives; spoon reserved citrus pieces and marinade over chicken.
Bake for about 40 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink.
