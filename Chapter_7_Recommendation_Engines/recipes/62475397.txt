Pumpkin Puree for Pie Recipe

Ingredients:
1 Sugar Pumpkin, about 8" in diameter (med to small)  Make sure you select a ripe pumpkin.  The harder the pumpkin the less ripe and the less sweet.   The stem should be dry and break off easily.  Knock on the pumpkin for a nice hollow sound.  The skin should be DULL and evenly colored orange, not a bright orange but a more muted tone.  This is a sweeter pumpkin more suited for pie.
DO NOT use pumpkins for carving.  They will taste closer to squash and are not sweet enough for baking.

Directions:
Prepare pumpkin by washing off any remaining dirt.  Break off the vine if you did not complete this task in selecting your pumpkin.
Insert knife into pumpkin and cut in half. If inserting a knife is difficult the pumpkin is still not ripe, do not use. ( I always buy two just in case!)
Scoop out the insides of the pumpkin and place each half face down onto a cookie sheet or roasting pan.
Bake in a 350 degree oven for 60-90min. or preferably as long as it takes until the pumpkin has turned a dark beautiful burnt orange color.  Think cinnamon.  You want the sugar in the pumpkin to begin to carmelize.  If unsure you can test consistancy with a spoon.  Try scraping the pulp, if it mashes into instant puree it is done, if it is still hard or stringlike fibers, it is not.
When done baking remove from oven and cool enough to handle.  Scrape pumpkin from skin into a container.    Use immediately or freeze/can in 1 1/2 c. portions for pies.  1 8" diameter pumpkin yields around 4 c. of pumpkin puree.
