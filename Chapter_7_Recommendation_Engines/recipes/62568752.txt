Ingredients:
3/4 cup all natural peanut butter ( I used half smooth and half chunky)
1/4 cup sesame paste ( tahini)
1cup Splenda
1 egg plus 1 egg white
3 Tbl milk
1/2 tsp baking powder
1tsp vanilla

Directions:
Combine all ingredients with a hand mixer for 1 minute or until smooth. Scoop with a cookie scoop or a tablespon. Bake at 375 for 8-12 minutes. They puff up but do not spread if you use cold peanut butter and tahini. They should have a light golden color.

Description: 
This is a take on the traditional low carb peanut butter cookie, my way. I added some extra flavors and moistness to make it feel like it is a traditional cookie.
