Ingredients:
1 (.75 ounce) packet honey mustard salad dressing mix
¼ cup cider vinegar
½ cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons orange juice
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
8 cups mixed salad greens
1 cup sliced fresh strawberries
½ cup fresh blueberries
½ cup fresh raspberries
8 ounces sugar snap peas
½ cup toasted pecans

Directions:
In a medium bowl, prepare the dressing according to package directions, using vinegar and oil, and substituting orange juice for the water; set aside.
Preheat the grill for high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill the chicken 6 to 8 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear. Remove from heat, cool, and slice into strips.
In a large bowl, toss together the chicken, salad greens, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, peas, and pecans. Pour in the prepared dressing, and toss to coat.
