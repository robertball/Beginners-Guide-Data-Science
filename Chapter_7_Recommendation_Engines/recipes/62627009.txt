Description: 
I love to make up my own spice mixes. I love to crush them in my hands. It is such a wonderful fragrance. Most Italian Seasoning recipes that I found didn't call for Garlic or Onion Powder. Those are two of my favorite spices that belong in everything, in my opinion. So I made up this version.
