I

Directions:
In a shaker, combine lime juice, sugar and mint leaves.
Using a wooden spoon or cocktail muddler, gently press the mint leaves to release its oils. (This gives the drink the strong minty flavor, not just the presence of the leaves.)
Add rum and shake for 10-15 seconds.
Pour into a glass filled partially with ice and add club soda.
Garnish with mint leaves and lime slices.
