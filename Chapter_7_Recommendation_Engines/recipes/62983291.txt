1 8 oz pkg cream cheese, softened

Directions:
Prepare raspberry jello as directed on box, using reserved pineapple + raspberry juice in place of 2 cup cold water (adding water to equal 2 cup, if needed).  Place jello in fridge to cool and thicken  slightly.
When jello has gelled slightly, stir in pineapple, raspberries, and banana. Put jello mixture in 9x13 container, and return jello to refrigerator to set.
Beat the cream cheese. Mix in marshmallow cream. Spread over set jello. Refrigerate.

Description: 
YEARS ago, my husband volunteered me to bring a jello salad to a potluck. I had never made a jello salad and didn't have any recipes. My sister-in-law gave me this wonderful recipe from her husband's step-grandmother. This is a must have for our holiday meals. Thank you, Karen and Ruby!
