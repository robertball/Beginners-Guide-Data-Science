Ingredients:
1 (9 ounce) package brownie mix
1 egg
1 tablespoon cold water
1 (14 ounce) package individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
1 cup chocolate fudge topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan.
In a small bowl, mix together brownie mix, 1 egg and water.  Spread into the greased pan. Bake for 25 minutes.
Melt the caramels with the evaporated milk over low heat in a heavy saucepan.  Stir often, and heat until mixture has a smooth consistency. Reserve 1/3 cup of this caramel mixture, and pour the remainder over the warm, baked brownie crust.
In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla with an electric mixer until smooth.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pour cream cheese mixture over caramel mixture.
Bake cheesecake for 40 minutes.  Chill in pan.  When cake is thoroughly chilled, loosen by running a knife around the edge, and then remove the rim of the pan.  Heat reserved caramel mixture, and spoon over cheesecake.  Drizzle with the chocolate topping.
