Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package extra firm tofu, drained and pressed
1 cup self-rising flour
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Drain tofu, place on a plate, and stack heavy plates on top of it to drain any extra moisture, at least 15 minutes. Slice into 24 bite-size pieces.
Combine flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag. Toss tofu into bag, seal completely, and shake to coat. Transfer tofu pieces to a plate, shaking off any excess flour.
Pour vegetable oil into a skillet; heat on medium-high until just smoking. Cook tofu, turning often, until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes per side.
