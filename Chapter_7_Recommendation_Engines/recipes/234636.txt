Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
1 pound ground sausage
1/2 onion, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons margarine
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Cook and stir sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir onion, bell pepper, and margarine into sausage. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir tomatoes, tomato sauce, and Italian seasoning into sausage mixture; bring to a boil. Stir in Parmesan cheese and pour over cooked spaghetti. Top with mozzarella.

Description: 
Quick and easy. I like it without the Parmesan but my husband is a cheese freak, so the more Parmesan and mozzarella, the better.
