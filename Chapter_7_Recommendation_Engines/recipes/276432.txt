Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, diced
1 bell pepper, diced
1 bunch fresh spinach, chopped
1 (12 ounce) package fiber-enriched rotini (such as Ronzoni® SmartTaste®)
4 cups water, or more as needed
1 (26.5 ounce) can pasta sauce (such as Classico®)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
6 tablespoons low-fat ricotta cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Add onion and bell pepper and cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and saute until just wilted, about 3 minutes. Pour in dry rotini pasta and stir in 4 cups water, pasta sauce, salt, and pepper.
Cover skillet and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir pasta, adding a little more water if contents seem too dry. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes more.
Reduce heat to low and stir in Parmesan cheese. Add tablespoon-sized scoops of ricotta cheese decoratively on top of the pasta. Cover and cook until Parmesan has melted and ricotta has heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
