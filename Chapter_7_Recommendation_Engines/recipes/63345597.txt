Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 can golden mushroom soup
1 small bag of frozen corn, or canned
1 pound shredded cheddar cheese
6-8 servings of mashed potatoes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Brown the ground beef and drain off the grease.
Mix beef, soup and corn in the bottom of a 9x13 pan. Cover with 1/2 of the shredded cheese.  Spread potatoes evenly on top and cover with remaining cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes.  Cheese should be bubbly and it should be heated throughout.

Description: 
This has been in my family for a long time.  I guess it's somewhat like Shephard's Pie, but I think much better.  It's always been one of my faves and now my family can't get enough of it.
