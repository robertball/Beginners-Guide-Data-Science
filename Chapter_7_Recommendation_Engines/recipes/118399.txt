Description: 
From Phoenix, Arizona, Kay Bergeron reports, 'One of the things my husband and I share is a love of Oriental food. At the end of the week, I go through the fridge, looking for leftover vegetables and meats to use in my 'leftovers chow mein'. If I have leftover spaghetti noodles, I use them to make these stir-fried noodles. Otherwise, I just cook up a fresh pot.
