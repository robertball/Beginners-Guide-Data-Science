1/2 pound broccoli, cut into florets
1/2 pound cauliflower, cut into florets
1 3/4 cups almond flour
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons coconut oil
ground black pepper to taste
coarse sea salt to taste

Directions:
Place broccoli and cauliflower in a food processor; pulse until shredded.
Combine almond flour, beaten eggs, onion, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Mix in shredded broccoli and cauliflower mixture. Roll batter into 2-inch balls.
Heat coconut oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Place fritters in the pan and flatten slightly with a spatula. Cook until crisp, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt and pepper. Repeat with any remaining fritters.
