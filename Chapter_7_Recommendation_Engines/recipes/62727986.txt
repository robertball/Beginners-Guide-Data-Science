Ingredients:
1-1/2  pounds  fresh asparagus or two 9-ounce or 10-ounce packages frozen cut asparagus
1  medium  yellow sweet pepper, 1/4-inch strips
1/3  cup  chopped onion
1  small  zucchini, halved lengthwise, sliced 1/4"  (about 1 cup)
10 slightly beaten eggs
1 cup  half-and-half, light cream, or milk
2 tablespoons  snipped fresh Italian parsley
1-1/4 teaspoons  salt
1/4  to 1/2 teaspoon  ground black pepper
feta cheese

Directions:
Butter a 2-quart rectangular baking dish; set aside.
If using fresh asparagus, snap off and discard woody bases. Scrape off scales, if desired. Cut into 1-inch pieces.
In a saucepan, bring about 1 inch water to boiling. Add asparagus, pepper strips, and onion; bring just to boiling. Reduce heat slightly; cover and boil about 1 minute or until crisp-tender. Drain well, reserving some asparagus tips for garnish. Spread asparagus-pepper mixture evenly in baking dish. Layer zucchini slices over.
Combine eggs, half-and-half, parsley, salt, and pepper. Pour over vegetables in baking dish. Bake, uncovered, in a 350 degree F oven about 35 minutes or until a knife inserted near center comes out clean. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Garnish each serving with asparagus tips, if desired.  Top with feta before fliping if using frittata pan, or sprinkle last 5 min in oven.
