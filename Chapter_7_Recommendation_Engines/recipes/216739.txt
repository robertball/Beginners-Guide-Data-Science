Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked brown rice
4 cups water
1 tablespoon safflower oil
1/3 cup leeks, chopped
2 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1 cup zucchini, chopped
1 cup carrots, chopped
1 cup yellow squash, chopped
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Bring the brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.
Heat the safflower oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the leeks, garlic, and ginger; cook and stir until the leeks have softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the zucchini, carrots, and yellow squash. Season with salt. Continue cooking and stirring until the vegetables have softened, about 2 minutes. Serve over brown rice.
