Ingredients:
2 lbs lean ground beef
2 eggs
1 package onion soup mix
1 cup old fashioned rolled oats
1 can (15oz) tomato sauce
1 can (6 oz) tomato paste
1 cup ketchup
1 tsp sugar

Directions:
Combine first 5 ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Once mixed, divide into equal parts and place in two loaf pans. **Use a 13x9 inch baking pan if you plan to use this recipe for meatloaf sandwiches.**
Place in preheated oven and bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.
Remove meatloaf from oven and drain excess grease.
Mix remaining 3 ingredients in a bowl and spread over meatloaf. Put meatloaf back in oven and cook for another 15 minutes to set the topping.
Serve and enjoy!

I can't get my husband and kids to agree on much, but they all agree that this is their favorite meal of mine. I've played with this recipe over the years and have finally gotten it the way I want it.
