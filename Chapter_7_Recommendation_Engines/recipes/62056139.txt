Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 tbs. peanut or vegetable oil
1 tsp. curry powder
4 croissants, cut in half
4 tbs. Major Gray's Chutney Sauce
4 tbs. mayonnaise
lettuce
sliced tomato
sliced red onion
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a skillet over medium heat, add the curry powder and stir a few seconds until it becomes fragrant. Add the oil, then the chicken. Cook the chicken about 5-8 minutes on each side. In the interim, spread chutney sauce on one side of the croissants and the mayonnaise on the other side. Cut the cooked chicken to fit the croissants (I cut them into slices) and layer on the vegetables. Sprinkle on a little salt and papper and serve.
