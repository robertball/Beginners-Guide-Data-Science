Ingredients:
12 frozen falafel
1/4 cup tahini
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground paprika
6 whole wheat pitas
1 head lettuce, shredded
1 tomato, cut into thin wedges
1/2 cucumber, peeled and sliced
1 low-sodium dill pickle, sliced
1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced
3 teaspoons harissa, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place falafel on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, 8 to 10 minutes.
While falafel bake, whisk tahini, water, lemon juice, garlic, and paprika together in a bowl.
Cut about 1 inch from the top of each pita to form a pocket. Add 2 falafel to each pita with equal amounts lettuce, tomato, cucumber, pickle, and red onion. Drizzle each with about 1 tablespoon tahini sauce and some harissa.

Description: 
Falafel has such a prominent taste, but the tahini and freshness of the vegetables really complement it nicely.
