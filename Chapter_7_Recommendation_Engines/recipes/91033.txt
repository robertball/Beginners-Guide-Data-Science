Ingredients:
2 beets (can substitute golden or chioga)
1/2 cup roughly chopped pistachios (can substitute almonds or hazelnuts)
2 yellow endive
4 cups arugula
1/2 cup shaved Parmesan
Vinaigrette:
1/2 cup white wine vinegar (can substitute white balsamic or champagne)
1 1/4 cups light pure olive oil
1 minced, medium shallot
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pinch white sugar
1/8 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Place washed, but not trimmed or peeled beets on top of 1 cup salt on a baking sheet, and roast in a 350 degrees F oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until fork-tender.  Let cool.  Wearing gloves or holding with a piece of plastic wrap, cut off stems, and peel.  Cut each beet in half, cut in 1/2 inch slices, then medium dice by cutting in the opposite direction.
Toast nuts in a 400 degrees F oven for 15 minutes, tossing once.
Combine all of the vinaigrette ingredients, mixing well, adding nuts when cool.
Trim the end of the endive, cut in half, separating the leaves for each half, but reforming each as 1/2 a head of endive.  For each salad, place 1/2 cup beets, 1 cup arugula, an 1/2 endive on a plate.  For each salad begin with 1/3 cup vinaigrette, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl.  Toss each of the three components, separately in the vinaigrette, making sure to toss the beets last. Top with 1/8 cup of shaved parmesan.
Repeat for remaining three salads.  Serve immediately. Reserve left-over dressing.
