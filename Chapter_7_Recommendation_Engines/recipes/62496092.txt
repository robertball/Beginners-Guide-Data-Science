Ingredients:
4 tilapia fillets
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup margarine, melted
1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced
1 cup white wine
1 1/2 tbsp dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
Rinse tilapia well in water, then coat completely in flour. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat and add fillets. Fry until golden brown on both sides, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low.
In a medium bowl, stir together all remaining ingredients. Pour mixture over fish in skillet and bring to a simmer. Allow to cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
