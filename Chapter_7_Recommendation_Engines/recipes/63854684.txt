Ingredients:
3 tsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1 lb bulk sweet Italian sausage
4 cups pizza sauce
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped
1 can refrigerated buttermilk biscuits
8 oz mozzarella cheese, cut into 20 cubes
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat oven to 400Â°F. In 12-inch skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil over medium heat. Add sausage; cook 4 to 5 minutes, breaking up and  stirring frequently, until browned. Stir in pizza sauce, 1/4 cup water, and 1/4 cup of the basil leaves; cook over medium-low heat, 2 to 3 minutes or until thoroughly heated.
Meanwhile, separate dough into 10 biscuits; separate each biscuit into 2 layers to create 20 biscuits. Place 1 cheese cube in center of each biscuit. Carefully stretch dough around cheese; pinch edges to seal completely.
Pour meat sauce into ungreased 13"x9" glass baking dish. Place biscuits, seam sides down, on top of sauce. Brush tops of biscuits with remaining oil. Bake 13 to 20 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown and sauce is bubbly. Sprinkle with shredded cheese and remaining 1/4 cup basil.
