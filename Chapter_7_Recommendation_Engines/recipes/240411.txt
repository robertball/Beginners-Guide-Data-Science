Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (12 ounce) package spaghetti
3/4 cup butter
2 large onions, chopped
2 green bell peppers, chopped
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)
1 (16 ounce) package process cheese food (such as Velveeta®), cut into small cubes
1 (16 ounce) package frozen peas
1 (16 ounce) can mushrooms, drained
1/2 cup sliced olives
1/2 cup chopped black olives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare 2 9x13-inch baking dishes with cooking spray.
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook chicken in boiling water until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to a cutting board to cool, retaining at least 6 cups water in the pot.
Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and bell peppers in hot butter until softened, 5 to 7 minutes; add cheese food cubes and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cheese is melted and smooth. Cut chicken into small pieces and stir into the cheese mixture. Stir drained spaghetti, peas, mushrooms, sliced olives, and chopped olives into the cheese sauce; divide between prepared baking dishes.
Bake in preheated oven until bubbly, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
Someone brought this to our house after a funeral. I loved it so much, I asked for the recipe, so it is not original. I have played with the ingredients several ways, and it always comes out tasty. This makes a large amount. I make it when I'm taking food to someone and have one for ourselves. I sometimes make this without the chicken. You can also use any chicken you have on hand.
