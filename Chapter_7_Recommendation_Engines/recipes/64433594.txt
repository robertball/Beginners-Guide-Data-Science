Ingredients:
1 15oz can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
2 tbsp fresh squeezed lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon) - add less if you don't like a lot of lemon flavor!
1/2 cup chopped curly parsley, finely chopped
1-3 green onions to taste, finely sliced (only the white and light green parts)
1 small can tuna, drained (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste (optional)
Olive oil to taste (optional)

Directions:
Mix beans and lemon juice.  Add parsley and green onions and mix well.  Add salt, pepper, and olive oil to taste.  Add tuna (optional) and gently stir so tuna doesn't break up too much.
