Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds boneless beef top sirloin steak, cut 1 inch thick
8 cups torn Boston lettuce
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
1/2 cup dried cherries or dried cranberries
1/2 cup pine nuts or coarsely chopped walnuts, toasted
Dressing:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In medium bowl, whisk together dressing ingredients. Remove and reserve 1/2 cup; cover and refrigerate.
Trim fat from beef steak. Cut steak lengthwise in half and then crosswise into 1/8 to 1/4-inch thick strips. Add beef to remaining dressing; toss to coat. Cover and marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes.
Remove beef from marinade; discard marinade. Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add beef (1/2 at a time) and stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes or until outside surface is no longer pink. (Do not overcook.) Remove from skillet with slotted spoon.
In large bowl, combine lettuce and reserved dressing; toss to coat. Arrange beef over lettuce; sprinkle with cheese, cherries and nuts. Serve immediately.
