1 (6 ounce) package savory herb-flavored stuffing mix
1/2 pound bulk pork sausage
1/4 cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Prepare stuffing according to package directions. Meanwhile, crumble sausage into a large skillet; add onions and garlic; cook over medium heat until meat is no longer pink.
In a large bowl, combine the stuffing, sausage mixture and spinach. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese. In a small bowl, combine cream and eggs; pour over sausage mixture.
Bake at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese; bake 5 minutes longer or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
