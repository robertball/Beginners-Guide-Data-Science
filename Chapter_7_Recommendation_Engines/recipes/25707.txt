Ingredients:
1 pound dried baby lima beans
4 1/2 cups water
salt and pepper to taste
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn
1 (14.5 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes
8 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
3 cups shredded cabbage
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream

Directions:
Wash and pick through beans.  Place them in a large pot with the water.  Season with salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until just tender.
Stir in undrained corn and tomatoes, potatoes and cabbage.  Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.  At the table, stir sour cream to taste into individual servings.

Description: 
This is a great soup that just gets better overnight, and is a family favorite.  Cook time can be shortened by using a pressure cooker to cook the beans.  Canned beans just do not give the best flavor, so I would not recommend them.  Each person adds the amount of sour cream to their bowl that suits their own taste.  It is wonderful served with a crusty bread.
