Ingredients:
4 flour tortillas
2 tablespoons crunchy peanut butter
1/2 cup marshmallow cream (such as Marshmallow FluffÂ®)
1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
cooking spray

Directions:
Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat.
Smear 1 1/2 teaspoon peanut butter onto 1 side of each tortilla in a thin layer to cover. Divide marshmallow cream equally between 2 of the tortillas; spread to cover peanut butter. Sprinkle 1/4 cup chocolate chips atop each portion of marshmallow cream and finish by putting the remaining tortillas atop the chocolate chips with the peanut butter side down.
Cook quesadillas in hot skillet until lightly browned and chocolate chips have melted, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
