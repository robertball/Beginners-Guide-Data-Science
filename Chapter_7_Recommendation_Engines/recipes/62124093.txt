Ingredients:
1 12 oz. Kabocha Squash
2 1/2 Tbsp. All-Purpose Flour
1 Tbsp. Cornstarch
1 Tbsp. Caster (Superfine) Sugar
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon
1 1/2 Tbsp. Water
2 egg yolks, beaten
To Serve (Optional):
Asian Pears
Persimmons

Directions:
Cut off the hard part from the top and bottom of the kabocha squash. Then, cut into four wedges. Scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Cut into chunks.
Steam the kabocha squash in a covered steamer for 12 to 15 minutes over medium high heat. To test if the squash is done, push a chopstick through the center. If it goes through easily, the squash is done. Remove and leave covered for about 5 minutes.
Remove the skin from the kabocha squash. Mash the flesh by using a food processor or by pushing it through a sieve with a wooden spoon.
Transfer the mashed kabocha squash to a mixing bowl. Then, add the rest of the cake ingredients and mix well.
Roll out a sushi mat (also called a makisu mat) as if you were making a sushi roll. Wet a dishtowel or muslin slightly with water and lay it on the mat. Spread the squash mixture evenly. Hold the nearest end and tightly roll up the sushi mat to the other end. Close both outer ends by rolling up or folding the muslin or dishtowel.
Put the rolled squash mixture in the sushi mat back into the steamer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for 5 minutes.
Open the sushi mat when the roll has cooled down. Cut the cake into 1 inch thick slices.
Serve cold on four small plates with peeled, trimmed, and thinly sliced Asian pears and/or persimmons.
