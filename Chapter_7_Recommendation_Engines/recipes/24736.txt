Description: 
Warm Blueberry Brie...we have this every year at our work's Christmas party. It is so tasty, it's addictive! You can also make this with raspberry sauce or sun dried tomatoes, both of which taste excellent. This will cook in the microwave in about 3 minutes. Serve with warm French baguette slices!
