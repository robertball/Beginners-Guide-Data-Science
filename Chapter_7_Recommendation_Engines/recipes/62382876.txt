In a small saucepan over medium heat, mix pineapple juice, brown sugar, soy sauce, sherry, ginger, garlic. Remove from heat just before the mixture comes to a boil, then wisk in sesame oil until blended.
Place chicken tenders in a medium bowl. Cover with the pineapple marinade, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat grill for medium heat. Thread chicken lengthwise onto wooden skewers.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken tenders 5 minutes per side, or until juices run clear. They cook quickly, so watch them closely.
