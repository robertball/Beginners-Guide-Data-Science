Ingredients:
1 kg mutton mince
1 cup masoor dal (split red lentils)
6 dry red chillies
4 black cardamom (badi elaichi)
2 sticks cinnamon (dalchini)
10 black peppercorns
6 cloves (lavang)
10 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon ginger paste
½ teaspoon turmeric (haldi) powder
Salt to taste
1 teaspoon cumin (jeera) powder
1 teaspoon coriander (dhania) powder
1 egg, beaten
Oil, for shallow frying

Directions:
Pressure cook meat and dal with water and the red chillies, cinnamon, cardamom, peppercorns,  cloves, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and salt. Release pressure and cook off excess water if any.
Let the mixture cool. Add cumin and coriander powder. Grind to a smooth paste. Add the beaten egg and mix into the meat mixture.
To make the kababs, divide the meat mixture into lime-sized balls. Wet your hands, smooth the balls, and flatten. Heat oil in a shallow frying pan and shallow-fry the kababs. Since the meat is already cooked, you just need to cook till the kababs are a nice golden brown on both sides. If you want, you can deep fry too.
Serve the kababs with chopped raw onions, tomatoes, and some lime wedges on the side.

Description: 
I have very fond memories of eating these kababs at my dear friend’s house in Hyderabad. Whenever I went to her house, I always hoped her grandma had these kababs on the menu for the day. I particularly love the complex taste and soft texture of the cooked dal and meat together.
