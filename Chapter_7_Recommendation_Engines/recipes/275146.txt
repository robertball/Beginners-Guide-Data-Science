Ingredients:
16 ounces peanut butter sandwich cookies (such as Nutter Butter®)
1/2 (16 ounce) jar peanut butter (such as Jif®)
1/2 (24 ounce) package chocolate candy melts
1/4 cup multicolored candy sprinkles

Directions:
Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
Crush peanut butter cookies in a food processor until they are crumbs. Pour into the bowl of a stand mixer and add peanut butter. Mix on medium speed until a dough forms, about 5 minutes.
Scoop dough and form 20 balls, placing them onto the prepared baking sheet. Freeze for 30 minutes so they will hold together while dipping.
Melt chocolate candy in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave, stirring frequently, in 30-second increments.
Insert a toothpick into each cookie ball and dip into melted chocolate. Return balls to the prepared baking sheet and top with sprinkles.

Description: 
I wanted a cookie ball that didn't need refrigeration. Using peanut butter instead of cream cheese gave me just that. The texture is different than that of cake balls, but they are so much easier to make and just as delicious!
