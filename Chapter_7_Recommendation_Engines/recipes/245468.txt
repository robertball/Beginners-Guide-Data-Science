Ingredients:
3 medium beets
1/2 cup goat cheese
1 large clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup full-fat Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon tahini
1 tablespoon fresh thyme
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
1/4 cup roughly chopped pistachios, for sprinkling
Crackers, pita chips, or veggies for serving
Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Wash beets. Individually wrap beets in a square of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes. Allow them to cool until they are able to be handled.
Remove the skins by hand or by rubbing with a paper towel. Cut beets into chunks. Transfer to a food processor or heavy-duty blender.
Add goat cheese, garlic, yogurt, tahini, thyme, lemon juice, salt, honey and olive oil. Pulse until smooth and thoroughly combined. Taste and adjust seasoning if desired. Transfer to a serving bowl or platter. Sprinkle with pistachios and drizzle with olive oil. Serve with crackers, raw veggies or crispy pita wedges.
