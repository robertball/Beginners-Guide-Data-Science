Ingredients:
1½ cups glutinous powder
¾ cup lukewarm water
2-3 drops green food coloring
8 tsp. grated Java dark brown sugar
1 cup fresh-grated coconut, mixed with ½ tsp salt

Directions:
Mix the rice powder with the lukewarm water and green food coloring into a firm but flexible dough.
Pull off one full teaspoon of the dough and shape it into a ball with approximately 1-inch in diameter.
Push a finger into the center of the ball to make a hole, and put in approximately ½ tsp. of the grated sugar. Seal, and roll it back into the ball shape with the palms of your hands. Prepare all the balls and set them aside.
Prepare a pot half filled with water and bring it to a boil.
Drop the balls into the boiling water. Remove the balls with a spoon once they float to the water surface and then roll the balls in the grated coconut. Serve at room temperature. Makes 30 rice balls.
