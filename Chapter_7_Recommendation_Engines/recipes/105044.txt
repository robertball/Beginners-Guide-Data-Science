Description: 
When I made this dish I left the kitchen window open.  The smell attracted several male neighbors, and when my husband came in, he said that it smelled so good, he hoped it was coming from our house and not from someone else's!  Serve with my Moroccan Couscous and Cucumber Raita on this site.
