Add Creole seasoning to the Alfredo Sauce in the jars and mix well (optional)
Pour Sauce over Chicken evenly.
Bake at 400 for about 1 hr. It can take up to 1h 30m before the chicken is cooked all the way thru.
When the chicken has about 20 minutes left start boiling your noodles in a pan on the stove top.
After everything is done place noodles on plates, chicken off to the side, and pour sauce over everything.

Description: 
Extremely easy Chicken Alfredo that only dirties two pans. I've tried this with boneless chicken and for some reason the chicken will dry out just about every time. If you use bone in though its juicy and will usually fall right off the bone.
