Ingredients:
1/4 cup red curry paste
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cups coconut milk
3 cups chicken stock
2 limes, juiced
1 lime, zested
2 cups cherry tomatoes
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 pound shrimp
1 (14 ounce) can bean sprouts, drained
1 cup chopped cooked chicken
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir red curry paste and olive oil together in a saucepan over low heat and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Pour coconut milk, chicken stock, lime juice, and lime zest into the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, at a simmer for 10 minutes.
Stir cherry tomatoes and cilantro into the soup; bring mixture again to a simmer and cook until the tomatoes are soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir shrimp, bean sprouts, and cooked chicken into the soup; cook until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. Season soup with salt and pepper.

Another free-styling super bowl creation based on the incredible laksas I have had the opportunity to try around my office in NYC. Enjoy!
