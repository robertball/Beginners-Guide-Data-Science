Ingredients:
1 lb chicken tenders or sliced strips of chicken breast
2 egg yolks
3/4 C chicken broth
4 tablespoons grated Parmesian cheese (canned works best)
3 T butter (or 2 T butter and 1 T olive oil)
1 broccoli stalk, cut into florettes
salt, pepper, lemon (optional)

Directions:
1. Beat yolks in bowl with 2 T chicken broth, add grated cheese, and stir together.
2. Coat pieces of chicken with egg batter.
3. Heat butter to sizzling in a large skillet, add chicken strips, and cook over medium heat until golden on all sides, about 4-5 minutes.
4. Remove chicken from pan and keep warm in oven.
5. Add broccoli to pan and stir in remaining chicken broth, catching up all the cooked bits in the the pan with your spoon.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cook covered for about 5-7 minutes.
6. Add chicken back to pan to heat through.  Serve over steamed white rice and pour any remaining sauce over (it will be thin, but tasty).  Garnish with lemon and sprinkle with more Parmesian if desired.
