Description: 
A beautiful, tender and mouth-watering meat casserole, so full of flavor. It forms a juicy and delightfully tasty gravy with carrots, celery and onion. Delicious served with boiled rice or couscous. My family couldn't get enough of this and were fighting to book the left-over bit for their lunch the next day. A real success.
