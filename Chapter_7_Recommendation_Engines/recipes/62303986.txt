Banana Pudding 'Stuff' Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
6-8 bananas
1 1/2 boxes vanilla wafer cookies (small ones are nice but not necessary)
1 large package vanilla or french vanilla instant pudding
cold milk
1 can eagle brand condensed milk
16 oz. cool whip

Directions:
To make 'pudding stuff': in a LARGE bowl, make the pudding using package directions, but reduce the amount of milk by about 1/4 cup (this is usually just the mix and milk mixed well with a wire whisk).  Stir in condensed milk, then fold in cool whip.  This is the 'stuff'.
Layer this with cookies and bananas: start with a very thin layer of 'stuff', cover that with cookies, cover that with a solid layer of thinly sliced bananas, cover with a more generous layer of 'stuff'; repeat until pudding is gone - end with pudding and put some of the prettiest cookies on top for decoration.  Refrigerate for 2 hrs.
Makes a large bowl full.  Easily feeds 25-30 people. Lowfat ingredients have been used successfully; but I can tell a slight difference in taste.  Still superb though.

I have been making this for years and years. I am requested to bring it to every work and social potluck. Everyone who tastes it says I make the best banana pudding they have ever eaten.  Doesn't get any better than that :)
