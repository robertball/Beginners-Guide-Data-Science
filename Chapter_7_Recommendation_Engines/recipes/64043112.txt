Ingredients:
1.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 packet fajita seasoning
10 6 inch flour tortillas
1 can green enchilada sauce
8 oz Mexican blend cheese
1 bunch scallions
Salsa
Sour cream
Guacamole

Directions:
In a slow cooker, add chicken breasts coated in fajita seasoning and 1/2 cup of water. Cook on low for 4-6  hours until tender. Shred breasts and return to crock, adding a little extra water as needed. Allow to cool for handling.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Pour a small amount of green sauce into 9x13 pan. Roll each enchilada with 2 T of cheese and 1/3 shredded chicken.  Place seam side down in sauce.  Pour the remaining green sauce over the enchiladas and sprinkle with remaining cheese.  Sprinkle diced green onions, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Uncover for a few minutes to allow them to brown.  Let rest for 10 minutes and serve with salsa, sour cream and guacamole.

I came up with these enchiladas when I was searching for a recipe that didn't contain condensed soup.  These are hearty, delicious and full of flavor!
