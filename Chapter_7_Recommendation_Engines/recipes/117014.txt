Ingredients:
1/4 pound ground beef
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
3/4 cup biscuit baking mix
3 tablespoons cold water
1 medium tomato, sliced
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
2 tablespoons sour cream
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon chopped onion

Directions:
In a skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Stir in the chili powder, salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and set aside.
Combine biscuit mix and water to form a soft dough. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of two 10-oz. ramekins or custard cups coated with nonstick cooking spray. Fill with meat mixture; top with tomato and green pepper. Combine the sour cream, mayonnaise, cheese and onion; spread evenly over top. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through.

Description: 
I love to cook and eat all types of food, writes Barbara Willmitch from Younstown, Ohio. But this tasty dish is a real hit with my daughter and her friends. It has a mildly Mexican-style flavor that both young and old can enjoy.
