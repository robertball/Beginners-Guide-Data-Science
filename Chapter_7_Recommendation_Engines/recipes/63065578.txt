Ingredients:
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup honey (I like buckwheat or sage, but try different honeys to suit your own taste)
2 Cloves of Garlic
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Place vinegar, honey, garlic cloves, salt, and pepper into a blender. Pulse to combine, then add the olive oil in a steady stream with the motor running. I have also done this with a stick blender and just in a shaker and it comes out fantastic.
