Description: 
In all seriousness, this homemade pesto recipe has changed my level of 'chefworthiness' in the eyes of friends and family. My husband swears I could make millions off of just this recipe! Of course I am still just a wannabe cookâ€¦but this simple pesto recipe could fool the best of them! The simplicity and the quality of the ingredients is what makes it so fantastic.
