Ingredients:
3 cups of flour, sifted
1 1/4 cup shortening
1 tsp. salt
1 large egg beaten
1 Tbl. vinegar
4 Tbl. water

Directions:
Cut the shortening into the sifted flour until the mixture resembles white sweet peas.
Add remaining ingredients.
Form lightly into a ball and roll out onto a floured board.
Make sure you use plenty of flour -- always roll from middle out -- and turn over once, completely, after your start to roll dough.
