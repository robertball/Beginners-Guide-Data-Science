Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole milk
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup peanut butter

Directions:
In a saucepan over medium heat, heat milk until bubbles form at edges. In a bowl, combine sugar, cornstarch and salt. Add 1/4 cup of the hot milk to the cornstarch mixture, then whisk well until all the liquid is incorporated and there are no lumps.  Pour the cornstarch mixture into the milk, whisking to combine. Continue to cook and stir until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, about 8 to 10 minutes. Do not boil. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla extract and peanut butter.
Pour the pudding into the pop molds to within 1/4 of the top, leaving room for the pudding to expand. Place the tops on the mold and freeze until frozen solid, about 4 hours. To remove from molds, run under hot water to slightly melt the side of the pudding pop, then twist the stem top and remove.

Description: 
I created this recipe after my daughter's pediatrician bugged me about her being too skinny!  That was 8 years ago, but the kids still love to eat these rich and creamy pops.  Watch out - not only are they pretty high in fat and calories, they should probably be eaten outdoors or with a wash cloth handy!!
