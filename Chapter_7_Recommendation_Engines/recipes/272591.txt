Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package orecchiette pasta
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 large chicken breasts, cooked and shredded
3 cups chopped broccoli
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons dried basil
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
salt to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in orecchiette and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and reserve 1 cup pasta water.
While pasta is cooking, combine butter and olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and saute until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add shredded chicken, broccoli, Parmesan cheese, basil, pepper, and garlic powder; toss to coat. Stir in pasta and reserved pasta water until evenly distributed. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.
