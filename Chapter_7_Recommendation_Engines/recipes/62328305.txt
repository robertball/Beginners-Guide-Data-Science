Ingredients:
1 box devilâ€™s food cake mix
1 small box Jello instant chocolate pudding mix
1 cup sour cream
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup milk
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1 cup mini semisweet chocolate chips
4 cups chopped mini peanut butter cups
Peanut Buttercream frosting:
1 cup shortening (crisco)
4 cups powdered sugar
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/3 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a VERY large bowl (4 qt), mix together everything except chocolate chips and the peanut butter cups. Batter will be thick.
Stir in the chocolate chips and 2 cups of the chopped mini peanut butter cups and mix well.
Divide batter into three 9" cake pans.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until you can stick a fork in the middle and it comes out clean.
For the frosting, cream shortening in a mixing bowl until fluffy. Add sugar and peanut butter and continue creaming until well blended.
Add salt, vanilla, and whipping cream. Blend on low speed until moistened. Beat at high speed until frosting is fluffy.
To ice the cake, place one cake layer on a cooling rack and pour frosting on top. Spread evenly with a spatula. Add second cake layer on top and repeat. Add last cake layer and pour remaining frosting over top and sides of cake. Smooth out with spatula.
Allow frosting to set for a minute and gently press remaining chopped peanut butter cup pieces all over top and sides of cake. Place in refrigerator for about an hour to set. Remove and serve.
