Turkey Sliders Recipe

Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1/3 cup goat cheese
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon hot chili flakes (optional)
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup white wine
16 mini dinner rolls, split

Directions:
Mix the ground turkey, goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, panko bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and hot chili flakes together in a large bowl with your hands until evenly mixed. Form the mixture into patties about 3-inches in diameter. Dust each patty lightly with flour on each side. This will allow patties to brown nicely in oil.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook the patties in the hot oil until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Pour the white wine over the patties, place a cover over the skillet, and continue cooking until the sliders are no longer pink inside and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. Remove the sliders to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Serve on the mini dinner rolls.
