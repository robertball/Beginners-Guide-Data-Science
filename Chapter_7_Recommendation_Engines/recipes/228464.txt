Description: 
This simple, hearty dessert of cooked, ground wheat fortified with ground nuts and sugar is central to Serbian culture. It symbolizes life and death, harvest and renewal, and is presented at certain special occasions: Slava (the family's saint day), Christmas, and memorial services. Serve by the heaping tablespoon in very small, decorative bowls, like custard cups, topped with a dollop of whipped cream.
