1 1/2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons cherry brandy

To Marinate: Combine honey, brandy and lemon juice in a nonporous glass dish or bowl. Mix together and add pineapple; coat well with marinade mixture. Cover dish and marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour.
Preheat grill to medium heat and lightly oil grate.
