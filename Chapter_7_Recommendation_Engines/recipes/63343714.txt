2 teaspoons fresh grated ginger
1/2 teaspoon fresh grated nutmeg
1 teaspoon cinnamon
3 cups frozen peaches
1 cup frozen blackberries
2 tablespoons maple sugar

Directions:
melt butter in a medium saucepan.  stir in ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon to bring out their flavor.  add maple sugar and peaches, stirring to coat.
allow peaches to simmer approximately 20 minutes, or until peaches are soft juices begin to thicken.
gently stir in blackberries and simmer just until soft (you want blackberries to retain their "pop" and not break down).
