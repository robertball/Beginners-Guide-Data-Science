Ingredients:
1 large cucumber, peeled and cut into chunks
1 1/2 cups plain Greek yogurt
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup mayonnaise
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Chop the cucumber in a food processor until nearly liquefied; strain through a piece of cheesecloth to remove excess moisture, being careful to not over-drain and lose too much of the fresh flavor.
Mix the cucumber, yogurt, garlic, sour cream, and mayonnaise together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
I whipped this up the other night after a fierce craving for a gyro struck me and I was finding a lot of recipes that weren't quite what I was looking for. I wanted a creamier version of tzatziki. I put it on a tortilla with shredded chicken, cheddar, green leaf lettuce and lots of tomatoes and feta. It was sooo good I was eating it by the spoonful! You can play around with adding a little more mayo or sour cream, as my measurements may not have been exact.
