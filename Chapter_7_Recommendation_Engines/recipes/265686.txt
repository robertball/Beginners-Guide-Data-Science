Description: 
I love soup in those large authentic pho bowls (54 ounce). The key to any soup is the stock, and the beginning of any great soup is its base and what you like to do to doctor it up with. Making this soup is a lot easier than you probably think it's going to be. Once you have a broth, then most of the work is preparing the vegetables to be a garnish for your soup.
