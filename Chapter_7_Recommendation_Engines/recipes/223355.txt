Ingredients:
1/2 cup canola oil
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
2 (3 ounce) packages chicken-flavored ramen noodles, crushed, seasoning packets reserved
1 (12 ounce) package broccoli coleslaw mix
1 bunch green onions, sliced
1 cup roasted cashews
1/4 cup roasted sunflower seed kernels

Directions:
Whisk canola oil, sugar, water, balsamic vinegar, and seasoning packets from ramen noodles in a bowl until thoroughly combined and sugar and seasoning packets have dissolved.
Toss ramen noodles in a large salad bowl with broccoli slaw mix and green onions. Pour dressing over the salad and let stand 1/2 hour to 4 hours - shorter for crunchier noodles, longer for softer ones. Just before serving, toss salad again with cashews and sunflower seeds.
