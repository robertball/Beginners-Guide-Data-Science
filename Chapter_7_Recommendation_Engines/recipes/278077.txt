Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 (16 ounce) packages frozen corn
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 cups shredded Mexican-blend cheese
2 (4 ounce) cans diced jalapeno peppers
6 slices bacon, or more to taste
2 cups shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Combine corn, cream cheese, Mexican-blend cheese, and jalapeno peppers in a bowl; mix until thoroughly combined. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and chop when cool enough to handle.
Remove dip from the oven. Top with chopped bacon and shredded Parmesan cheese. Return to the oven and bake until cheese has melted, about 10 more minutes.
