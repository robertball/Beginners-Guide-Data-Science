Ingredients:
2 lbs (900g) skinless, boneless chicken - cubed
2 cups water
1/2 cup butter
1 1/2 cup chopped onion
1 cup sliced celery
1 cup sliced carrots
1 1/2 cup diced potatoes
2 tsp. minced garlic
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon parsley
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup milk
4 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
In a saucepan, combine chicken and water, cover and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain and set aside.
In the saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and cook onions, celery, carrots, potatoes and garlic until soft.
Stir in flour and seasonings.  Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
Place the chicken mixture in bottom pie crust. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly.
Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
