Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons lemon pepper
1 1/2 tablespoons salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
2 TBL. grated lemon zest, divided
4 (6 ounce) fillets rainbow trout
1 lemon
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, lemon pepper, salt, thyme, cayenne and half of the lemon zest. Combine the lemon juice and remaining lemon zest in a shallow dish and soak fish fillets for about 1 minute.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip the trout fillets in the flour mixture so that both sides are coated. Shake off the excess and place fillets in the hot oil. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until golden brown and fish can be flaked with a fork. Discard the leftover lemon juice.
Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels briefly before serving. Garnish each serving with a wedge of lemon.
