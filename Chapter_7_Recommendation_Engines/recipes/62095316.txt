Ingredients:
1 can 10ct. biscuit
1 cup confectioners sugar
oil for deep frying

Directions:
Open the can of biscuit and cut a hole in the center. A bottle top makes a perfect hole. Heat up the grease and drop the biscuit in. Fry till brown, and flip. Mix sugar and warm water to form a thin syrup mixtire. Drop the fried biscuit in and flip. Remove and eat. Holes can also be fried, and dipped. If you prefer, sugar can be dusted over donuts after frying, verses the dipping step.
