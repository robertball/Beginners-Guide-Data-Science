Ingredients:
Donut Holes:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup whole milk
1/2 cup drained crushed pineapple
1 egg
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 cup grated carrots, packed
1/2 cup sweetened flaked coconut
vegetable oil for cooking
1/3 cup white sugar
Cream Cheese Dip:
1/2 cup cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Whisk flour, brown sugar, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt together in a large bowl.
Combine milk, crushed pineapple, and egg in a small bowl. Stir into the flour mixture. Add melted butter; mix until a soft dough forms. Fold in carrots and coconut.
Heat at least 2 inches of oil in a large pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a wire rack or baking sheet with paper towels.
Scoop a few tablespoons of dough into the hot oil using a small ice cream scoop. Fry donut holes until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer donut holes to the paper towels using a slotted spoon; let drain and cool slightly. Repeat with remaining dough.
Whisk white sugar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a shallow bowl. Roll donut holes in sugar mixture.
Beat cream cheese and 1 tablespoon butter together in a bowl until smooth. Beat in confectioners' sugar until dip is well-blended and fluffy. Stir in vanilla extract and 1 pinch salt. Serve donut holes with cream cheese dip.
