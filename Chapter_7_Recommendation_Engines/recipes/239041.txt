Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro
1 large clove garlic, thinly sliced
6 medium prawns or large shrimp, deveined, tails left on
1 1/2 cups Diamond Crystal® Kosher Salt, or more as needed
1/2 cup Chardonnay wine
1/8 teaspoon crushed saffron threads
1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal® Kosher Salt
4 whole black peppercorns
1/4 teaspoon honey
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Blend olive oil, cilantro and garlic in a bowl. Add prawns; toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Spread Diamond Crystal(R) Kosher Salt in even layer on a rimmed baking sheet to at least 1/2 inch thick, large enough to place prawns in a single layer.
Bake salt 30 minutes to prepare it for roasting prawns. Remove baking sheet from oven. Place prawns in a single layer on hot salt.
Bake 2 minutes. Turn prawns over; bake 2 minutes longer.
Brush all salt from prawns (a pastry brush works well) and discard salt.
Combine Chardonnay, saffron, remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and peppercorns in medium saucepan over medium heat. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Simmer until sauce is reduced to 2 tablespoons. Discard peppercorns.
Stir in honey and remove from heat. Whisk in butter a chunk at a time until blended. Drizzle warm sauce over prawns.
