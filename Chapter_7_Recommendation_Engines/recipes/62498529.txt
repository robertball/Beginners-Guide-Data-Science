Ingredients:
1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1/2 cup chopped shallots
4 garlic finely chopped garlic cloves
1/2 cup dry sherry
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup chopped parsley
6 (8 ounce) fillets beef tenderloin
1 egg beaten
1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed

Directions:
Lightly coat the fillets with E.V. olive oil and sear each side for 30 seconds.
In a large skillet over medium heat, combine the mushrooms, shallots, sherry, butter or margarine and parsley and saute until all the liquid is absorbed and the mixture resembles a paste. Cover the top of each steak with the mixture.
Partially thaw the puff pastry sheets and roll out pieces thin enough to cover the top, sides and bottom of each steak.
Brush each Wellie with the egg. Then refigerate until ready to cook.  Brush with the remaining egg just before putting the Wellies in the oven.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Bake steaks uncovered in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. (Note: They will be rare but will continue cooking while dish is sitting.)  Check for a temp of 117 degrees (they will cook more while sitting).
Optional Sauce: one can beef broth; one cup wine; 2 TBSPs butter.  Simmer for 20 minutes.  Add 1 C heavy cream. Simmer for 10 more minutes.
