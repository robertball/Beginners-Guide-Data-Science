Ingredients:
Flat Bread
1 1/3 cup warm water (115 degrees) water (microwave 1 min)
1 tablespoon sugar
2 1/4 teaspoons yeast
2 tbls olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3 1/4 cups all purpose flour
2/3 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 teaspoon italian seasoning
Tzatziki Sauce
2 large cucumbers, peeled and chopped in food processor
2 cups sour cream
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon dried dill
1 teaspoon creole seasoning

Directions:
DOUGH
Mix the water, sugar and yeast, cover (not airtight) let sit for 5 minutes. Stir in olive oil, salt and flour.
Cover (not airtight), and allow to rest at room temperature for 2 hours.
The dough can be used at this point but it is easier to handle when cold. Refrigerate in covered (not airtight) container and use over the next 3-4 days.
Generously flour surface and scoop out a portion about the size of an apple then flatten with the palm of your hand. With a rolling pin, roll dough into circles (doesn't have to be perfect circles. Keep work surface well dusted with flour to prevent sticking.
Coat pan lightly with olive oil cooking sray. Place one dough circle in heated pan. Mix together olive oil and herbs. Brush top surface with herb/oil mixture. Cook on both sides until light golden brown.
SAUCE
Strain chopped cucumber in mesh strainer to remove excess moisture. I reserve the cucumber juice to use later in a cucumber salad dressing. Mix the cucumber with remaining ingredients for sauce, refrigerate.
