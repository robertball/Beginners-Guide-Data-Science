Ingredients:
6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, sliced into 1" strips
1 red onion, cut into 1/2" slices
Red, green or yellow peppers cut into 1/2" slices
Avocados sliced thin
Tomatoes sliced thin
Marinade
1/4 cup olive oil
3 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
3/4 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano leaves (can substitute 1 teaspoon of fresh cilantro)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper or 1/8 red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Combine the marinade ingredients.
After rinsing the chicken, add to the marinade.
Cover and refrigerate up to 8 hours, turning occasionally. (Longer than 8 hours will turn the chicken rubbery)
Remove chicken breasts from the marinade.
Grill the chicken breasts, onion and pepper slices over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink and the vegetables are tender.
The chicken and onion will take approximately 8 to 10 minutes depending on how long you marinade it.
The pepper will take 6 to 8 minutes.
Wrap tortillas in foil and place on BBQ grill until heated through.
Place chicken, onion, pepper, tomato and avocado in warm tortillas, add your favorite condiments of salsa, cheese, or cilantro and enjoy.
