Ingredients:
2 tsp. dried parsley flakes
2 tsp. dried marjoram
2 tsp. fresh thyme
1/2 tsp. ground sage
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
4 bone-in pork loin chops (3/4 in. thick)
3 tsp. olive oil
Sauce:
1/4 c.  onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, minced
1 Tbsp butter

Directions:
In small bowl, combine the parsley, marjoram, thyme, sage, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
Brush both sides of pork chops with olive oil; rub with herb mixture.
Broil 3-4 in. from the heat for 4-5 minutes on the first side, flip chops and broil for 3 more minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 150-155°.  Remove from heat and rest pork chops under aluminum foil for 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, sauté onion and garlic in butter until tender.  Sprinkle with flour, stir until blended.  Gradually add milk.  Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.  Add cheese and wine; cook for 1-2 minutes.  Serve sauce with chops.
