Ingredients:
4 cups cooked and shredded chicken or turkey breast
1 box dry stuffing mix
4 cups frozen veggies (I use green beans, corn and carrots)
2 cups diced red potatos, skin on, 1x1x1/2 inch pieces
2 cans cream of mushroom soup
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 tbsp dried basil
1/2 tbsp garlic powder or 1 tbsp crushed/minced garlic
1/2 tbsp dried oregano
1/2 tbsp black pepper
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp dried marjoram
1 or 2 pinches dried sage

Directions:
Cook stuffing according to directions on box, set aside and keep warm.
Mix all other ingredients in large bowl.  Transfer to 9x13 baking dish.
Bake in 375 degree preheated oven for 30-45 minutes, or until potatoes are fully cooked (insert a knife into a potato chunk.  If it comes out clean or the potato breaks apart a little, you're done).
Add stuffing on top, switch to broil and cook for additional 5-10 minutes, or until top is solid and crisp.  My husband likes to add some shredded cheese on top at the end, as well.  Whatever kind we have on hand, it all tastes great!!

Description: 
Easy as... pie.  It's a pot pie, without worrying if the crust is getting soggy!!  Homey one-dish comfort food without the angst!!  My uncle showed me how to do this after Thanksgiving years ago.
