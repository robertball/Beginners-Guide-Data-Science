Image:

Ingredients:
16 artichoke quarters
1/2 pound of angel hair pasta
2 eggs
1/2 cup flour
vegetable oil for frying
4 tbsp lemon juice
1 cup of chicken stock (or 1 cup water and 1 cube of chicken bouillon)
4 tbsp sherry cooking wine
1/2 stick of margarine
parmesan cheese to taste
pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook the angel hair pasta according to directions.  Normally this pasta only takes about 5 minutes so I drop it in the water right before I am done.
Get your oil hot.
Dip the artichokes in the egg and then lightly flour them.
Then fry the artichokes until brown.
Get rid of the left over oil.
Combine the chicken stock, lemon juice, and sherry and pour this combination in the pan and heat.  Once heated put your angel hair pasta and artichokes in.  Add the butter, parmesan cheese, and pepper and you are done!
This is also served without the pasta as an appetizer.  If you prefer to do this reduce your chicken stock to 1/4 cup. And follow the rest of the recipe.
