Ingredients:
1 pound bulk pork sausage
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1 small green pepper, chopped
1 small red pepper, chopped
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained
8 slices Pepperidge Farm® White Sandwich Bread, cut into cubes
4 eggs
3 cups milk
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)
3 cups shredded mild Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Cook the sausage in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat.
Stir the celery, onion and peppers in the skillet and cook until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in the chiles. Remove the skillet from the heat.
Place half the bread cubes into a lightly greased 3-quart shallow baking dish. Layer with the sausage mixture and remaining bread cubes. Beat the eggs and milk in a medium bowl with a fork or whisk. Pour the milk mixture over the bread cubes.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Spoon the soup over the casserole. Sprinkle with the cheese.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
