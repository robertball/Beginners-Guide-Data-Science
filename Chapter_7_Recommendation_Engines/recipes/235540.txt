Ingredients:
5 tablespoons unsalted butter
6 cups 1/2-inch butternut squash cubes
2 cups chopped leeks, white and light green parts only
1/2 cup chopped carrots
1/2 cup chopped celery
2 small Granny Smith apples, cored and diced
1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
5 cups chicken stock
1 cup apple cider
salt to taste
5 slices cooked bacon, crumbled (optional)

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute butternut squash, leeks, carrots, and celery in hot butter until vegetables are softened, 10 to 12 minutes.
Stir apples, thyme, and sage into the squash mixture; pour in chicken stock and cider. Bring mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to low, cover pot with a lid, and cook until vegetables and apples are tender, about 30 minutes. Remove soup from heat and cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return mixture to pot and season with salt to taste. Garnish individual servings with crumbled bacon.
