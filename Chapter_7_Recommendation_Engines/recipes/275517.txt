Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 cups self-rising flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle fruity beer
1 1/2 cups chopped strawberries
1/2 cup loosely packed chopped fresh basil leaves
1 tablespoon coarse sugar, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
Stir flour and white sugar together in a large mixing bowl. Pour in beer and stir. Add strawberries and basil and stir until well combined; batter will be stiff and sticky. Scoop batter into the prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle the top generously with coarse sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
Fresh basil perfectly complements strawberries in this sweet beer bread. It's delicious served alongside a pork or chicken dinner or toasted as a breakfast bread. I think it's best with a fruity beer, such as one with citrus or apple flavors, but you may use any favorite beer. You may also substitute lemon-lime soda for beer.
