Ingredients:
1  cup butter or margarine
1 1/4  cups granulated sugar
1  cup brown sugar
2  large eggs
2  teaspoons vanilla
2 1/4  cups all-purpose flour
3/4  cup cocoa
1  teaspoon baking soda
40  rolo decorative candies

Directions:
In bowl, beat butter or margarine, 1 cup granulated sugar and brown sugar until light.
Beat in eggs and vanilla until batter is smooth.
In another bowl, combine flour, coca and baking soda.
Stir into sugar-egg mixture to form soft dough.
Chill dough in fridge at least 1 hour. The warmer the weather the longer the dough needs to chill to avoid a sticky mess. You can also freeze the candies and they will stay firmer inside of the cookie but they are good either way.
Place 1 tbsp of dough in palm of hand and press.
Put 1 Rolo candy into centre.
Bring up sides of dough to cover it completely.
Roll between palms to make a smooth ball.
Place remaining sugar on a plate and roll each ball in sugar.
Place on greased baking sheet and bake cookies in preheated 350Â° over for 10 minutes or until tops are cracked and firm.
Cool on rack about 10 minutes

Description: 
These are a yummy chocolate cookie with a carmel suprise in the the center. They are labor intensive but worth it! When someone asks why they are called magic cookies (everyone will) it is because There's carmel inside and I baked them. It's magic!
