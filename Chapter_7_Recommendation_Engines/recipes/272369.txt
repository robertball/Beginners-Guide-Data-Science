Ingredients:
10  skinless chicken thighs
½ cup liquid honey
¼ cup prepared mustard
1 teaspoon curry powder
¼ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon dried tarragon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Flatten chicken thighs and squeeze tightly into a square baking dish.
Combine honey, mustard, curry powder, and salt in a bowl. Spoon over chicken. Sprinkle tarragon on top.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 50 minutes, basting occasionally with the honey-mustard sauce. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
