On medium-high heat add .5 tbsp of olive oil, add diced turkey tenderloin. Add minced garlic, italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Complete cooking of meat.
Take heat down to medium and add sun dried tomatoes, spinach and pine nuts. you may add additional seasoing if you wish.
The meal can be served two ways:

Description: 
I came up with this recipe while traveling for work. I try to eat well while on the road but the kitchens available make cooking a bit of a challenge. This was super easy to make with limited cooking tools and only took 15 minutes total to make. I went with turkey tenderloin (breast) over chicken because it was cheaper but you could go either way. Take out the meat all together and it still is a flavorful vegetarian meal or side dish.
