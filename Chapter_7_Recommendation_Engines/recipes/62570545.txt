Ingredients:
5 lbs of lean hamburger meat
1 tea spoon pepper
1 tea spoon cayenne pepper
1 tea spoon oregano
2 tea spoons paprika
2 tea spoons onion salt
1 cup bread crumbs
pinch of garlic powder
Sauce
1 can (6 oz) COLD evaporated milk
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 tea spoon garlic powder
2 table spoons vinegar
Sandwich and toppings
1 large tomato (cut into small pieces)
1 med onion (sliced thin)
1 head of lettuce shredded
4 to 6 greek style pita breads

Directions:
MEAT:
Pre-heat oven at 300F  Mix all ingredients together.  Press this down tight in a pan like you would a meat loaf.  Take it out, and bake it on a grill (obviously with a cookie sheet under the grill because it will drip)
for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  Once cooked, slice into thin strips.
SAUCE:
Whip together milk, garlic powder and vinegar.  While whipping, slowly add sugar.  Sauce should be fluffy and light.  Should take about 2 minutes of good whipping.

Description: 
Ok, I know these are not ``Donnairs`` as in the true term, but this is what they are called on the East Coast!  A substitute for us that no longer have access to donnair sauce or subs!  Enjoy!
