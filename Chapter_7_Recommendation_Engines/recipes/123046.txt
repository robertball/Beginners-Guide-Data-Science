Ingredients:
48 pretzel rings or mini twists
1 (8 ounce) package milk chocolate kisses
1/4 cup M&M;'s

Directions:
Place the pretzels on greased baking sheets; place a chocolate kiss in the center of each ring. Bake at 275 degrees F for 2-3 minutes or until chocolate is softened. Remove from the oven. Place an M&M on each, pressing down slightly so chocolate fills the ring. Refrigerate for 5-10 minutes or until chocolate is firm. Store at room temperature.
