Ingredients:
150g Magarine
1 Tbsp Golden Syrup
2 Tbsp Cocoa
1 Tbsp Sugar
1 Tsp Instant coffee
250g Digestive biscuits
3 Tbsp Almond ground
1 big bar of chocolate

Directions:
Melt the margarine in a saucepan and add the syrup, sugar, cocoa and coffe and mix well.
Crush the biscuits in a big bowl(leave a few bigger bits, it makes the cake even yummier!) and mix in the almond ground.
Pour the margarine mixture into the bowl of biscuits and mix all together.
Pour mixture into a greased cake tin or any other form and press everything down so it becomes all even, best done with a spoon.
Put in a fridge to cool.
Then melt the chocolate and pour over the cooled cake and cool again until chocolate is solid.
Cut and serve. :)
You can also add a variation of nuts and dried fruits to the mixture, whatever you like.
