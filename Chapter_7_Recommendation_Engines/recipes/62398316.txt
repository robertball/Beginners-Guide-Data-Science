Ingredients:
2c. all purpose flour
2c. oatmeal
1 1/2 c. brown sugar
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. nutmeg (optional)
1 1/2 c. butter
FILLING
3-4 Macintosh apples, peeled, cored and diced small
1/2 tsp of cinnamon, or to taste
2 tbsp. granulated sugar
1/4 c. water

Directions:
Place diced apples, water, sugar and cinnamon in sauce pan and bring to a simmer and stir. Simmer for about five mins. until apples are only partiallly cooked. Set aside to cool slightly.
In a large bowl (i use my KA) add flour, oatmeal, br. sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir to combine.
Add butter by cutting it into the  flour oatmeal mixture and combine until mixture is crumbly. take a good tablespoon of crumb mix and pack lightly into your well greased mini muffin tin. you don't want to pack it too tightly or your cups will be tough and chewy. pack it just so that it hugs the bottom and sides of the tin, all the way to the top and doesn't fall into itself. make sure there are no "holes" in your cups or you will have a problem getting them out. you should have some crumble mixture left over. this will be sprinkled on top of the filling. fill your cups with appox. a tsp of the apple filling, sprinkle with the left over crumble mixture. bake at 350 deg. for 15-20 mins. or until golden brown.
