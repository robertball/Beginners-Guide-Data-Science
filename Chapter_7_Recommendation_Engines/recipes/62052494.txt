Ingredients:
4 mediums green bell peppers, 1 box spanish rice, 1/2 pound ground beef, 1 small can tomato sauce.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°.
Cook rice according to package directions and set aside.
Set ground beef in a bowl and set aside.
Gently cut off tops of peppers and set them aside for later use in this recipe.  Remove the core and all of the seeds leaving each pepper with a cavity.  Fill cavity half way with rice and the remaining way with ground beef.  Repeat with remaining peppers.
Place the tops back on the peppers.  Place peppers standing straight up in a large baking pan filled with tomato sauce.  Spoon tomato sauce over top of the peppers and continue to do so throughout cooking.  Bake covered for 45 minutes and then uncovered for an additional 10 minutes or until meat has browned.  Omit ground beef for a truly tasty vegetarian dish!
