Ingredients:
3 dried guajillo chile peppers
3 dried pasilla chile peppers
1 (4 pound) beef chuck roast, cut into 2-inch pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 onion, quartered
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon agave nectar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Place chile peppers in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Soak until soft, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add chuck roast and season with salt and pepper. Cook meat until dark brown and crispy on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes.
While meat cooks, combine softened chile peppers, onion, vinegar, garlic, lime juice, cumin, oregano, agave nectar, and cinnamon in a blender. Process sauce until smooth.
Transfer browned meat and all juices to a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Stir in sauce from the blender. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 60 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
