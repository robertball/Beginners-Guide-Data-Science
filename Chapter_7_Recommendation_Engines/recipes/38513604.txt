Ingredients:
8-10 submarine sandwich buns
1 pound bologna
1 pound ham
1 pound hard salami
1 pound turkey pastrami
1 pound sliced provolone
1 pound sliced mozzarella
1 jar banana peppers
2 large cans mushrooms, drained
2 cans sliced black olives, drained
2 jars pizza sauce
1 medium red onion, halved and sliced thin

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Tear off 10 sheets of foil, each large enough to fully wrap sub in.
Slice bologna, ham and cheeses in half.
Line up all the bottoms of the sub buns together to form an assembly line.
Start layering the meats and cheese on each bottom; make the subs as thick or thin as you like.  We use 1 whole slice each of bologna, ham and cheese, and 3 each of the salami and pastrami.
Add toppings of your liking and spoon on a few tablespoons of pizza sauce, then place top bun on.
Wrap sub tightly and place directly on the oven rack.
Bake 30-40 minutes, until heated through and cheese is melted.  The time will greatly depend on the amount of meat used.
