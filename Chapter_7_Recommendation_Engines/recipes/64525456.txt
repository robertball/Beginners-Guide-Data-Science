Ingredients:
1  1/2  pounds chicken breast strips
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
2 garlic cloves, grated
2 cups panko bread crumbs (plain, without added spices)
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon smoked paprika

Directions:
Preheat oven to 475 degrees (F).
Using a flat, metal cooling rack pour a bit of olive oil on a paper towel and wipe the rack to prevent the chicken from sticking (non-stick cooking spray can also be used).  Place the rack on top of a baking / cookie sheet.
In a small bowl, mix the mustard and garlic until combined.
In a separate, shallow bowl and using a fork,  combine the bread crumbs, olive oil,  salt, pepper, and paprika.
Dip/coat each chicken strip in the mustard-garlic mixture, and then press  it in the bread crumb mixture until it's evenly coated all over.
Lay the coated chicken strips on the baking rack and bake for 12-15 minutes until browned.
Serve warm.

Wow, this is a new favorite! I can't believe how easy, and how moist & good the chicken tasted. I made it exactly as posted and my husband and I both loved it. It's in my regular meal rotation now.

The chicken strips are first coated with a garlic-Dijon mustard mixture, then pressed in a panko bread crumb mixture before baking. The results are moist, delicious chicken with a slightly crunchy coating. Easy & delicious.
