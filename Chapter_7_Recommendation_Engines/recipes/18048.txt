Add potatoes to a large pot of boiling, lightly salted water. Boil for about 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Drain water and let cool.

Description: 
Red potato salad with a light oil, vinegar, and herb dressing. No mayonnaise. My kids love it! If you like, you can leave the skins on the potatoes for a more colorful dish.
