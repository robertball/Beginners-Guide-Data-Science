Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups coconut oil, softened
1 (8 ounce) package *vegan cream cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups organic sugar
3 eggs (3 oz tofu per egg)
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour (I use whole wheat pastry flour)
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/2 cup well-drained chopped maraschino cherries (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
Beat the coconut oil, vegan cream cheese, and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the tofu one 3 oz piece at a time, allowing each tofu piece to blend into the coconut oil mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla with the last tofu piece.  Mix in the flour, salt, chocolate chips, and walnuts until just incorporated. Fold in the maraschino cherries; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out nearly clean, about 25 minutes. Watch closely - the finished bars will be very pale in color. Remove from oven immediately if the sides begin to pull away from the pan. Cool pan on a wire rack before cutting into bars.
