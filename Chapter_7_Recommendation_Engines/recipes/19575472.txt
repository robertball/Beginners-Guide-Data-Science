Pumpkin and Chicken Chowder Recipe

Ingredients:
2 red bell peppers (about 14 ounces)
2 jalapeño peppers (about 1 ounce)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced
3 leeks, white and light-green parts only
1 pumpkin (about 2 pounds), peeled, seeded, cut into 1-inch chunks
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh-ground pepper
1 ear corn, kernels removed (1 cup)
3 14 1/2-ounce cans low-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves
1/2 cup sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Roast the peppers: Preheat oven to broil. Place the red peppers and jalapeño on a baking sheet and cook under the broiler, turning occasionally, until the skins blacken -- about 10 minutes. Seal the charred peppers in a plastic bag for 10 to 12 minutes. Peel, stem, seed and cut peppers into 1/2-inch pieces. Set aside.
Make the soup: Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until browned. Remove the chicken and keep warm. Add the leeks and pumpkin and sauté for about 5 minutes. Add the flour, cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the corn, peppers, chicken, broth and oregano and bring the soup to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer -- about 30 minutes. Garnish with sour cream if desired and serve hot.
