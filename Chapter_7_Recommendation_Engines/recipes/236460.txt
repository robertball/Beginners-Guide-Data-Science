Ingredients:
cooking spray
3/4 cup flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 (16 ounce) package miniature marshmallows, or more to taste
1 cup peanut butter
1 (6 ounce) package butterscotch chips
1 1/2 cups crispy rice cereal (such as Rice Krispies®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Beat flour, sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla extract, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; pour into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes. Pour marshmallows over the cake layer and return to oven; bake until the marshmallows puff, about 2 minutes more.
Stir peanut butter and butterscotch chips together in a saucepan over medium heat until melted; add crispy rice cereal. Spread peanut butter mixture over marshmallow layer; cool completely before cutting into bars.
