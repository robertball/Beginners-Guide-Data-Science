Ingredients:
6 thick slices bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 (16 ounce) package frozen cut green beans
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup packed brown sugar

Directions:
Fry the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until done, but not quite crisp, about 9 minutes. Drain off grease and add butter and brown sugar. Cook and stir over medium heat until sugar has dissolved; remove from the heat and set aside.
Place the green beans into a pot and fill with about 1 inch of water. Bring to a boil then cover, and steam over medium heat until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Drain off water and stir in the sugar and bacon mixture. Serve immediately.
