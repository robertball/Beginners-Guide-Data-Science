Ingredients:
6 10" flour tortillas
1 14.5 oz can of black beans
1 16 oz package of firm tofu
1 cup of salsa
1/4 cup of diced onions
1 Tbs of cumin
1 tsp of garlic powder
4 oz shredded monterey jack cheese (or more if you prefer)
salt and pepper to taste
sour cream to taste

Directions:
Preheat over to 250 degrees.
Saute onions in cooking spray for about 5 minutes, then add in cumin and garlic powder.  Next add in (drained & crumbled)tofu, 1/2 cup of salsa, and half the can of black beans(I used the rest as a side dish with rice).  Heat through, and spoon mixture evenly into tortilla shells with a little bit of the jack cheese.  Roll shells and place in baking dish that has a thin layer of salsa on the bottom.  Top enchiladas with remaining salsa and monterey jack cheese.  Place dish in preheated oven and bake for 35 minutes, or until cheese has melted and is slightly browned.  Serve with a side of rice and remaining black beans and top with sour cream!
