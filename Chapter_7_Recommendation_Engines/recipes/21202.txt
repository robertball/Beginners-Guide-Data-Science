Ingredients:
12 eggs
1/3 cup milk
3 slices cooked ham, diced
2 green onions, minced
salt and pepper to taste
4 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded
4 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1/2 cup salsa

Directions:
Beat together eggs and milk. Heat a lightly oiled skillet (or non-stick pan) over medium high heat and cook egg mixture, stirring occasionally, until firm. When almost done, stir in ham, green onions, salt and pepper.
Spoon 1/4 of the egg mixture on top of each tortilla. Sprinkle the eggs with cheese, fold over the tortilla to make a roll and top with salsa if desired.

Description: 
This is great for a special brunch or even a quick and easy dinner. Other breakfast meats can be used, but the deli ham is the easiest since it is already fully cooked.
