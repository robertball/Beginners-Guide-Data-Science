Ingredients:
3/4 cup chopped onion
1/3 cup diced celery
3 Tbls vegetable oil
1 large baking potato, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1 tsp paprika
1 Tbls chopped celery leaves
1 Tbls chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
1 pound cooked boneless chuck steak cut into 1/2-inch cubes (or any left over steak/roast will do)
1 1/2 cups beef broth
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp ground pepper
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Combine the onion, celery, and oil in a large heavy skillet.  Cook over medium heat until the veggies are soft, about 5 minutes.
Add the potato and stir to coat the cubes with oil, about 1 minute.
Add the paprika, celery leaves, and parsley and stir until they soften, 1 minute more.
Add the meat to the vegetables and stir to mix the ingredients well.  Pour in the broth and bring to a simmer, about 3 minutes.
Add the thyme, cayenne, black pepper, salt, and Worcestershire.
Adjust the heat to maintain a steady simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has become syrupy and is almost gone, about 30 minutes.  Serve warm with toast and Heinz Chili sauce on the side.

THIS is the reason hash became a breakfast favorite.  Throw away that can of hash (dog) food and settle down to a real meal.
