Ingredients:
2 boneless pork chops, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1 tablespoon Caribbean-style rub*
1 (10 ounce) package couscous
2 cups boiling water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dried cherries

2 oranges, peeled and sliced
1 medium cucumber, sliced
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons orange juice
Zest of 1 orange
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
Salt and pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons chopped pecans

Directions:
In plastic bag, shake together the pork cubes and Caribbean rub to evenly coat the pork. Skewer pork and grill over medium-hot fire for 8 minutes, turning occasionally to brown evenly.
Meanwhile, in large bowl combine couscous and boiling water and 1/2 teaspoon salt; let sit 5 minutes. Stir cherries and green onions into couscous. Arrange cucumber slices around the edge of four dinner plates; equally portion couscous mixture onto plates; topping with orange slices and pork cubes.
Stir together oil, orange juice, orange zest, brown sugar; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle over salads and garnish each salad with some chopped pecans.
