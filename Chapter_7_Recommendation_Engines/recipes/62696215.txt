Ingredients:
1 can (28 oz.) whole tomatoes with juice
2 cans (10 oz.) Rotel (diced tomatoes and green chilies)
¼ cup onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 jalapeno, quartered and sliced thin
¼ tsp. sugar
¼ tsp. salt
¼ tsp. ground cumin
½ cup cilantro (or more to taste)
½ lime, juiced

Directions:
Combine whole tomatoes, Rotel, onion, jalapeno, garlic, sugar, salt, cumin, lime juice, and cilantro in a blender or food processor. Pulse until you get the salsa to the consistency you’d like—I do about 10 to 15 pulses. Test seasonings with a tortilla chip and adjust as needed.
Refrigerate salsa for at least an hour. Serve with tortilla chips or cheese nachos.

Description: 
I have searched forever for a recipe that actually tastes like restaurant salsa. We love On the Border's salsa and this recipe comes very close. I found it on Pioneer Woman's website. Enjoy!
