Ingredients:
2 tbsp whole white or black peppercorns
1 tbsp whole coriander seed
2 tsp dill seed
2 tsp whole mustard seed
1 tsp red pepper flakes
2 tbsp kosher salt
2 tbsp dried minced garlic

Directions:
Place peppercorns into a spice grinder or mini food processor. Pulse 3 or 4 times.  Add dill, coriander, pepper flakes, and mustard seed. Pulse until seeds are broken up into a coarse mixture. For the most authentic flavour and look, do not grind into a powder.
Transfer mixture into a small bowl or container. Stir in garlic and salt. For best results, store in a sealed glass container, and shake before using.

Description: 
This is just like the steak spice you find in the Montreal delis in Canada. It is bold and spicy and good on so much more than just steak. Grinding the spice mixture at home only takes a couple of minutes and provides the freshest flavor.
