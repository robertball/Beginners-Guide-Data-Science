Ingredients:
4 slices high quality white sandwich bread, torn into quarters
2 T butter
salt & pepper
1 T minced shallot
1 tsp parsley (dried) or 2 T fresh
1/4 cup plus 5T all purpose flour
2 eggs
3 T mayonnaise
1/2 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp cayenne
1 1/4th lb cod or haddock - thick cuts at least 1" to 1 1/2" thick

Directions:
Make Breadcrumbs (you're pre-toasting them so they become extra crunchy):
Oven to 350.
Place bread, butter, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper in food processor and pulse 7 or 8 times or until coarsely ground.  Spread on tray and bake until golden brown (apx 15") stirring occasionally to break up.  Remove from oven and let cool.  Can be made up to a day in advance.
Increase oven to 425.  Take out 3 plates and a wire rack that fish will be baked on. Lightly spray top of rack.
On first plate combine bread crumbs with parsley & shallot.  Put flour on 2nd plate.  On third plate, combine eggs, mayo, paprika and cayenne.
Dry fish and season with salt & pepper.  Dip first into flour, then egg mixture, then into breadcrumbs.  Press gently so a thick layer of crumbs adheres to fish.  Transfer to wire rack and hold while you finish remaining patties.
Bake fish until center registers 140 (apx 18-25").  Serve immediately.
