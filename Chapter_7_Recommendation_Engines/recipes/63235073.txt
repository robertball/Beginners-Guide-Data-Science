Sour Cream sauce
2/3 cup sour cream

2 tablespoon lime juice (juice from one lime)
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 dash cayenne pepper
Mango Salsa

1/2 red pepper, diced

Zest and juice from one lime

Directions:
Spray fish with oil. Season the fish with a generous amount of Cajun seasoning, on both sides. Grill on medium for approximately 8 minutes, or until flakes easily.
Meanwhile, whisk together the sour cream, lime juice, ginger, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper to taste; set aside. Gently combine the mango, pineapple, avocado, lime juice and zest, red pepper, cilantro and jalapeno in a bowl.
To assemble, place a cooked mahi-mahi fillet into the center of a warmed tortilla. Place a scoop of the mango salsa onto the fish, slaw, then drizzle with the sour cream sauce.
