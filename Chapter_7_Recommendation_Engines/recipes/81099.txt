3 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon dried parsley

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium casserole dish.
In a large bowl, mix the soup, milk, water, chicken, rice, green beans, Cheddar cheese, onion, and garlic. Season with parsley, basil, dill, salt, and pepper. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish.
Bake 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven, until rice is tender. If water is absorbed too quickly, add more as needed.
