Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 large green bell pepper, diced
1 large onion, diced
2 jalapeno peppers, chopped (optional)
1/4 cup chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can black beans
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup rinsed, uncooked white rice
1 (15 ounce) can corn
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella-style vegan cheese (such as DaiyaÂ®)

Directions:
Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute bell pepper, onion, and jalapeno peppers until tender, about 3 minutes. Add chili powder, salt, cumin, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, making sure chili powder does not burn.
Stir tomatoes, beans, water, and rice into the pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is fully cooked, about 20 minutes. Check every 10 to 15 minutes if extra water is needed; add 1/4 cup at a time.
Stir corn and pepper into the chili and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve with vegan cheese.

Description: 
Made this by tweaking a family recipe to make it vegan. Great on Cinco de Mayo or football Sunday! Cornbread is a great addition to this dish.
