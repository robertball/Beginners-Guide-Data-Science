Description: 
As teenagers, Burmese boys are expected to fulfill a period of time serving as monks in the Buddhist monasteries.  During this time they live as vegetarians. My husband taught me to make this Indian meal that his would mother prepare for him during his service. Chickpeas, okra, and potatoes are combined with delicious spices and make a very filling meal. Serve over jasmine rice.
