Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups boiling water
3/4 cup bulgur
2 oranges
1 1/2 cups cubed cooked chicken or turkey
2 cups chopped seeded cucumber
2 tablespoons snipped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped green onions
1 tablespoon snipped fresh mint
1 tablespoon olive oil or salad oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
romaine lettuce leaves

Directions:
In a medium mixing bowl pour boiling water over bulgur. Let stand 30 minutes. Drain off excess liquid.
Meanwhile, finely shred enough peel from oranges to make 2 teaspoons peel. Peel and section oranges over a bowl to catch juice. Cover and chill orange sections until serving time. Measure and reserve 1/4 cup orange juice.
In a large mixing bowl stir together drained bulgur, orange peel, orange juice, chicken, cucumber, parsley, green onion, mint, oil, and salt.
Cover and chill 4 to 24 hours, stirring occasionally.
Just before serving, fold in orange sections. Serve on lettuce-lined plates.

Description: 
The oranges add freshness to this salad but you can substitute canned mandarin oranges, if you like. Continue to use fresh orange juice for the dressing though.
