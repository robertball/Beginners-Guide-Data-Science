Ingredients:
8 oz. uncooked rotini pasta
4 cups of a combination of the following:
diced salami or pepperoni
diced mozzarella cheese
diced plum tomato
halved black olives
diced green peppers
cannelini beans
2 cups Italian dressing*
Parmesan cheese for garnish

Directions:
Cook the pasta until done to desired tenderness and drain well. Al dente is best since soaking in dressing can cause the pasta to become mushy. Cool completely.
Toss with meat, mozzarella, tomato, olives, peppers, beans and dressing.
Garnish with parmesan cheese.
Chill for an hour before serving.
