Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups dried split yellow mung bean (lentil)
2 1/2 cups water
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

1 teaspoon diced jalapeno chile pepper
1/2 cup diced tomatoes

2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon cumin seed
1/2 dried red chile pepper
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Rinse split peas; soak in 2 1/2 cups water for 30 minutes.
Heat split lentils and water, with salt, until boiling.  Reduce heat to medium and cook 15 to 20 minutes, until tender and thickened.  Add more water, if necessary, to prevent drying out.  To the cooked split lentils add ginger, jalapeno pepper, tomato, lemon juice and turmeric.
Heat oil in a small saucepan and add cumin seed and red chile pepper.  When pepper is heated add garlic.  Stir mixture into split lentils and add cilantro; mix well.
