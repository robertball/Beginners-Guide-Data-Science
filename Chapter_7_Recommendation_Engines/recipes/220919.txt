Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package bow-tie pasta
1 pound ham chunks
20 grape tomatoes, halved
1/2 cup diced yellow bell pepper
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
1/2 cup diced orange bell pepper
6 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 cup shredded Romano cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
Toss ham chunks, tomatoes, yellow bell pepper, red bell pepper, orange bell pepper, green onions, garlic, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl.
Stir drained bow-tie pasta and mayonnaise into the ham mixture.
Sprinkle cilantro and Romano cheese over the pasta mixture; stir to combine.
Chill at least 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
I made up this recipe while trying to figure out a summer pasta salad to go with our kabobs that we were grilling. I threw in a little of this and a little of that and the family went nuts! To make this healthier, use fat-free mayonnaise and wheat pasta.
