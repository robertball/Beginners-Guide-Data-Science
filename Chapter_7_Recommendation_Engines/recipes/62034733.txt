Directions:
Pound the meat on a flat board till it is 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick,place the flour and bread crumbs in separate dishes (soup plates are useful) lightly beat the eggs and add a small amount of milk (about 1/3 the volume of the beaten egg)lightly season with salt and pepper put this into another soup plate,first coat the meat in flour patting lighly by hand,then using a fork to hold the meat dip into the egg, lift, drain slightly and coat with the breadcrumbs by placing in the crumbs covering and lightly pressing the crumbs in contact,when all have been prepared deep fry in cooking oil at 300F till golden brown.
