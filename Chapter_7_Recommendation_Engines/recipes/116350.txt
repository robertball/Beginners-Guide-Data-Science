1 small onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
1/4 cup chopped sweet red pepper

2 tablespoons chopped green chilies
3/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

In a small saucepan, saute the celery, onion and sweet peppers in oil until crisp-tender. Crumble the sausage into a skillet; cook over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the tomatoes, kidney beans, water, tomato paste, chilies and seasonings; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20-30 minutes or until thickened. Sprinkle with cheese.
