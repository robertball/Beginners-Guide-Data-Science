Ingredients:
4 chicken breasts, cooked and cubed
½ cup whipping cream (don’t make a mistake, it’s not that sweet stuff)
¾ cup mayonnaise
1 apple, peeled and chopped (I use golden or red delicious apples)
1 large stalk celery, chopped
3 green onions, chopped
1 Tblsp. Lemon juice
1 tsp. Sugar
Salt to taste (don’t add much)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients; add more whipping cream if salad is not moist enough.  Spread on thick pieces of French bread or any favorite bread.  I like it with lettuce and tomato too.
