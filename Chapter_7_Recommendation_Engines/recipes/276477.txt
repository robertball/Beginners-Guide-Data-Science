Description: 
This is the best horseradish sauce I have come up with, I've never tasted a better one! It's the perfect blend of creamy, spicy, and flavorful. This is the ideal compliment for so many foods in addition to prime rib: roast beef, ham, pork loin, onion rings, and chicken strips. I add extra horseradish for my taste, as I love the flavor.
