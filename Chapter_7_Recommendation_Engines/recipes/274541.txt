Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
Crust:
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, or more as needed
1/3 cup butter, melted
Filling:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 cup white sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and diced
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
Streusel:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon finely chopped walnuts, or to taste (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, cut into small pieces

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until crumbly, adding more crumbs if mixture is too wet. Press crust into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.
Beat cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar using an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract on low speed until mixture is blended. Pour filling over warm crust.
Stir apples, 2 tablespoons sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice together in a separate bowl; spoon evenly over filling.
Mix brown sugar, flour, walnuts, and cinnamon for streusel together in a bowl. Mix or cut butter into walnut mixture using your fingers or a knife until crumbly. Sprinkle over apple layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese filling is set, 30 to 35 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Cut into small squares and refrigerate until ready to serve.
