Ingredients:
1 (10.5 ounce) can Campbell'sÂ® Condensed French Onion Soup
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (4 pound) boneless pork shoulder roast
2 tablespoons semi-sweet chocolate pieces
12 (8 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
6 plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves

Directions:
Stir the soup, water, chili powder, brown sugar, cumin and cinnamon in a 6-quart slow cooker. Add the pork and turn to coat.
Cover and cook on LOW for 8 to 9 hours or until the pork is fork-tender. Remove the pork to a cutting board. Using 2 forks, shred the pork. Add the chocolate to the cooker and stir until melted. Return the pork to the cooker.
Place about 1/2 cup pork mixture onto half of each tortilla. Top with the tomatoes and cilantro. Fold the tortillas over the filling.
