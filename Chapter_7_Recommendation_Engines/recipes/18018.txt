Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
3 tablespoons butter, softened
4 cups bread flour
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup sesame seeds
2 tablespoons dry milk powder
2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select Dough cycle; press Start. Spray two baking sheets with cooking spray.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). When dough cycle is complete, remove dough to a lightly oiled surface. Divide dough up into 18 pieces. Roll each piece on an oiled board, from center of piece to the outside edges to form bread sticks. Place bread sticks at least 1 inch apart on the prepared pans.
Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden. Remove to a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
I make these bread sticks by the hundreds every year and my kids take them to school for snacks. The dough can be made in the bread machine, or you can double it and make it in a stand mixer.
