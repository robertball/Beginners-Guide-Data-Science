Ingredients:
4 cups oil for deep frying
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tablespoons salt
1 1/2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 tablespoons garlic powder
2 cups buttermilk
1/2 cup barbeque sauce
2 tablespoons steak sauce
6 chicken drumsticks
6 chicken thighs
6 chicken wings, tips removed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large, deep-sided skillet over medium heat until it reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder.
In a separate bowl whisk buttermilk, barbeque sauce and steak sauce. Add chicken parts; toss to coat.
Working in batches of 6, dredge chicken in flour and add to hot oil. Cover and fry until golden brown on one side, about 9 to 10 minutes. Turn chicken over and fry until golden brown on remaining side and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes longer. Transfer to a wire rack on a baking sheet and keep warm in oven.
