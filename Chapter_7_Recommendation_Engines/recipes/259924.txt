Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped carrot
1/4 cup chopped celery
3 sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
3 Bartlett pears, peeled and diced
1 cinnamon stick
1/2 teaspoon thyme
5 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon maple syrup, or to taste
1 tablespoon lime juice, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add sweet potatoes, pears, cinnamon stick, and thyme; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Stir chicken broth and paprika into the pot; bring to a boil. Simmer until sweet potatoes are soft, about 15 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick.
Fill blender halfway with soup. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour into a pot. Repeat with remaining soup. Return to pot.
Stir heavy cream, maple syrup, and lime juice into the blended soup. Simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
