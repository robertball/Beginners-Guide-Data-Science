1 (8 ounce) package fresh shiitake mushrooms
1 tomato, chopped
1/2 onion, chopped
9 pitted green olives, chopped
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 orange, juiced
1 lime, juiced
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon Mexican-style hot sauce (such as CholulaÂ®), or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
salt to taste

Directions:
Bring a pot of salted water to boil. Add shiitake mushrooms and boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat, drain, and rinse with cold water. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.
Chop mushrooms as if they were fish for ceviche and place them in a glass bowl. Add tomato, onion, olives, and dried oregano.
Mix orange juice, lime juice, ketchup, Mexican hot sauce, and vinegar in a separate bowl; pour over the mushrooms. Add salt and mix carefully. Refrigerate for 20 minutes to allow flavors to combine.
