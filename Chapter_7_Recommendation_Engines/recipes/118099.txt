1 medium onion, chopped
8 eggs

2 cups shredded Swiss cheese
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook the sausage, green peppers and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, salt, pepper and mustard. Stir in the sausage mixture, bread, spinach, cheeses and zucchini. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
