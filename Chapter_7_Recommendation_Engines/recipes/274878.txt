Ingredients:
¼ cup soy sauce
¼ cup fish sauce
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon lemongrass paste (such as Gourmet Garden(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, cilantro, sesame oil, ginger, Sriracha, garlic, lime juice, and lemongrass paste together in a bowl.
Put chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag, pour marinade over chicken, and marinate for 2 hours or overnight for an even better flavor.
Preheat the grill to medium-high heat and oil the grate.
Remove chicken thighs from marinade, discarding marinade.
Grill chicken thighs until they are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove from grill and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving.
