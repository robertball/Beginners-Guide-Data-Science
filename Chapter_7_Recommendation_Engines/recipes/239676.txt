Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 large onion, cut in half and sliced
1 small red bell pepper, cut into 2-inch-long strips

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion, red pepper and jalapeno pepper and cook for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring occasionally.  Add the garlic and cook and stir for 30 seconds.  Season with the salt and black pepper.
Stir in the soup, chicken and rice and cook until the mixture is hot.  Remove the skillet from the heat.
Spoon 1 cup chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla.  Sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons cilantro and the juice from 1 lime wedge.  Fold up the sides of the tortillas around the filling then fold up the ends to enclose the filling.
