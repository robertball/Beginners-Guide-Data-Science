Ingredients:
2 cups onion chopped fine
4 tbsp butter
3 cloves minced garlic
3 cups celery heart stalks sliced in half and chopped
3 cups carrots finely diced
2- 8 oz bottles of clam juice
1- 32 oz container of chicken broth
1 pound of crab meat (I use claw)
2 cups dry white wine
2- 28 oz cans of tomato sauce
1/2 cup finely minced parsley
1 tablespoon of finely minced fresh basil
1 tablespoon dry thyme
2 tablespoons kosher salt (or to taste)
1 tablespoon hot paprika (or to taste)*
1 tablespoon black pepper (or to taste)*
****The soup is very spicy and I add more than this.  Add these ingredients slowly and adjust to your preferred heat levels.

Directions:
In a large stock pot, cook onion and celery in the butter until tender.  Add garlic and cook another two minutes or until it begins to brown.
Add remaining ingredients except for the crab.  Simmer soup for 30-45 minutes or until carrots are tender.
Add crab and simmer 5 minutes more breaking up any overly large pieces.
Serve hot.
