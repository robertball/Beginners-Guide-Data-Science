Description: 
Chipotle chilies add a smokey heat that is perfect for brisket. Use dried chipotles to keep this rub dry. You can buy chipotle chili powder but that costs a lot more. The choice is yours. What ties that chipotle flavor together with this rub is a hint of orange in the form of a small piece of dried orange peel.
