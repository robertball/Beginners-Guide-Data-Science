Ingredients:
2/3c Fresh Lime Juice
1/3c Fish Sauce (I use Pitas)
1T Sugar
2t Thai roasted chilli paste (I use Sambal Olek)
3/4c Cannes low-salt chicken broth (I use my own)
1 1/2lb. ground chicken (If you have  grinder it is MUCH cheaper)
1c thinly sliced green onions
3/4c thinly sliced shallots
3T minced fresh lemon grass (you can substitute with the already minced in a tube)
1T thinly sliced thai chillies (leave out if you don't like heat)
1/2c chopped fresh cilantro (I double this)
1/3c chopped fresh mint leaves (optional)
2 heads of romaine lettuce

Directions:
Whisk first 4 ingredients in a medium bowl, reserve sauce.
Bring broth to a simmer in a heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken. Simmer until cooked through, breaking up meat with a spoon, about 8 minutes. Add green onions and next 3 ingredients. Stir until vegetables are tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in sauce, cilantro and mint. Season with salt and pepper.
