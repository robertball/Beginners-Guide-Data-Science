Ingredients:
Mongolian Sauce:
1/2 cup hoisin sauce
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
2 teaspoons sesame oil
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons hot sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
Meatballs:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 pound ground lamb
1/2 head cabbage, chopped
1 yellow onion, chopped
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated carrot
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1/4 cup chopped green onion
6 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Whisk hoisin sauce, 4 cloves garlic, red wine vinegar, soy sauce, grated ginger, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, hot sauce, white pepper, and black pepper together in a large bowl.
Mix ground beef, ground lamb, cabbage, yellow onion, panko, carrot, ground ginger, green onion, 6 cloves chopped garlic, garlic salt, black pepper, and 2 tablespoons of the hoisin sauce mixture together in a separate bowl; shape into meatballs and arrange on a jelly roll pan.
Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle, about 25 minutes. Shake pan to turn meatballs, switch oven to Broil, and cook under the broiler until browned, about 10 minutes more. Set aside to cool.
Transfer warm meatballs to slow cooker and pour hoisin sauce mixture over the meatballs.
Cook on Low, stirring intermittently, for 2 to 4 hours.

Description: 
My meatball recipe inspired by Chef John's Mongolian Pork Chops is absolutely delicious. A wonderful recipe for a party. Serve them as an appetizer with toothpicks, and they will disappear before your eyes. They can also make a meal sandwiched in a hero or over a bed of pasta.
