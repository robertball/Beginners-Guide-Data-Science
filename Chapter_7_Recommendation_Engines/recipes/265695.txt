Ingredients:
oil for frying
4 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons salt
2 tablespoons ground black pepper
1 bottle squash, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
water as needed

Directions:
Heat 2 inches of oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat.
Mix flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Dip squash slices into a bowl of water; coat with the flour mixture.
Drop a small amount of flour into the oil; if it sizzles, it is ready. Carefully lower some squash slices into the side of the pan furthest from you. Fry until light brown on both sides, flipping halfway, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining slices.
