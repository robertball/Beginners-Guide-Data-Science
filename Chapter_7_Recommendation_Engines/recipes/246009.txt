Ingredients:
1 (11 ounce) package refrigerated French bread dough (such as Pillsbury®)
1/4 cup melted butter, divided
1 tablespoon cornmeal
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon shredded Cheddar cheese
1 pinch dried parsley
1 pinch garlic powder
1 pinch onion powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet.
Roll dough out into a large rectangle on a flat work surface. Brush with 3 tablespoons melted butter and sprinkle with cornmeal. Flip dough over and scatter mozzarella cheese, Mexican cheese blend, and 1 cup Cheddar cheese on top. Fold the dough in half and press edges together with your fingers to seal.
Brush remaining 1 tablespoon butter over dough and lightly sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon Cheddar cheese, dried parsley, garlic powder, and onion powder. Make shallow cuts 1 inch apart across the top with a knife, so that you can easily pull the bread apart after baking.
Bake in the preheated oven until bread is golden brown and cheese is bubbly about 25 minutes. Cool 5 minutes before pulling strips apart.

Description: 
This cheesy stuffed bread is crispy on top, chewy inside and very cheesy, but beware... it's very dangerous. You can get addicted! I fell in love with this particular side from Domino's® and have been searching for a comparable recipe. After some trial and error I figured out one that is pretty darn close and won't cost me $12 for food, delivery fee, and tip when the craving is overwhelming late at night and my toddler is fast asleep. Serve with marinara sauce.
