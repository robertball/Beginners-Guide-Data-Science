Ingredients:
4 cups water
2 cups brown sugar
2 cups white sugar
1/4 cup dried espresso
3 cups vodka (not everclear or the "best" vodka--100 proof Smirnoff is good)
2 vanilla beans, split
2 shots chocolate liqueur

Directions:
Combine the water, both sugars and dried espresso in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.
Bring to a boil; turn the heat to low and simmer for a minimum of 1 hour to reduce the mixture and make a more syrupy consistency.
Watch constantly and stir occasionally.
Remove from heat and let cool.
Add vodka, vanilla beans and chocolate liqueur.
Pour everything into a storage container.
Age for 3-4 weeks in a cool, dark location; stirring once or twice a week.
When ready to bottle, remove vanilla beans, bottle mixture and enjoy!
