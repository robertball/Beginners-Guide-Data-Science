Ingredients:
1 cup natural creamy peanut butter
1 egg
1/4 cup Truvia (or any stevia blend of your choice)
2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tbsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Combine all ingredients in a mixer or food processor.
Roll into 1 inch balls and place on ungreased cookie sheet.
Flatten balls with a fork.
Bake at 350 for 10 minutes.
Remove from oven and allow cookies to cool on cookie sheet for 10 minutes before removing them to a wax paper lined tray. Cookies will be very crumbly until fully set. Once cookies have cooled to room temperature, place them in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to set them a bit firmer, then remove and store in an airtight container.
