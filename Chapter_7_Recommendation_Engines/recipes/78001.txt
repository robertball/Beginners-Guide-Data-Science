Directions:
Place potatoes into a slow cooker, and sprinkle with black pepper. Stir together the gravy mix and water in a measuring cup until well blended.

Description: 
Mashed potatoes made in a slow cooker. This was my first attempt at cooking without a recipe - the potatoes turned out very moist and very flavorful.  Be careful to not overcook.
