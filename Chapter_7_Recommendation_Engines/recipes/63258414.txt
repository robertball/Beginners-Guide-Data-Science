Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon brown sugar
Salt and ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
Four 12-ounce chuck roll steaks
1 large sweet onion, cut into 4 thick slices

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the oil, brown sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, cumin and cayenne. Place the steaks in the bowl and massage the mixture into the meat, making sure to coat all sides. Allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Heat the grill to medium-high.
Season the onion slices with salt and pepper. Grill the onions without flipping them for 6 to 8 minutes, or until charred and tender. Grill the steaks for 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Remove the steaks from the heat and allow to rest for 8 to 10 minutes before serving. Serve with the grilled onions.
