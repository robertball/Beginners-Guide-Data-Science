Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 slices white bread, torn into pieces
2 1/2 tablespoons 1% milk
1/2 pound ground turkey
1/4 pound turkey Italian sausages, casings removed
2 1/2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
Place bread pieces in a bowl. Pour milk over bread; allow bread to soak for 1 minute. Squeeze excess moisture from the bread and place bread in a bowl; discard milk.
Mix ground turkey, turkey Italian sausage, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add soaked bread to turkey mixture and gently mix. Form turkey mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls; place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
