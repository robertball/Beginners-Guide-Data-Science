Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 teaspoon butter
1 teaspoon olive oil
4 ounces button mushrooms, chopped
4  scallions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 (8 ounce) package reduced-fat cream cheese, softened
Â¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), or to taste
6 large poblano peppers, tops, seeds, and membranes removed

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
Melt butter and olive oil together in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms, scallions, and garlic in hot skillet until mushrooms have released their liquid and the liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir parsley into mushroom mixture, and let mixture cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
Stir mushroom mixture, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, and Creole seasoning together in a bowl. Stuff each hollowed-out poblano pepper with mushroom mixture and place on prepared baking sheet.
Broil in the preheated oven, turning once, until stuffing is hot and peppers are browned, 8 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe was an accidental creation. I had leftover stuffed mushroom filling, and we had a bunch of poblano peppers we needed to use after cleaning up our garden. It's now one of my family's favorite appetizers!!
