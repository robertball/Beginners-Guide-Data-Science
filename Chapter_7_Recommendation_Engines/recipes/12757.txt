Ingredients:
1 pound shark fillets
12 (6 inch) corn tortillas
1/4 cup canola oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 quarts vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Cut shark into strips 3/4 inch thick and 3 inches long.  Mix canola oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and Cajun style spice mix in a plastic container.  Place shark strips in container, and marinate for 1 hour.
Warm tortillas in a microwave to make them pliable.
Drain marinade, and pat shark dry with paper towels.  Place a strip of shark at one end of a tortilla, roll tightly, and secure with a toothpick.
Heat oil in a deep fryer.  Submerge taquitos in hot oil.  Fry until golden brown, no more than 3 or 4 minutes each. Drain on paper towels.
Place taquitos in a baking dish large enough to accommodate all twelve.  Sprinkle with shredded cheese.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 5 minutes, or until cheese melts.
