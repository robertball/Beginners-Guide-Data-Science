Ingredients:
2 - 8 ounce packages cream cheese
1/2 cup salad dressing (like Miracle Whip)
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
2 Tablespoons milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1 pound ground ham
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon dried dill weed

Directions:
In a microwave safe bowl microwave the cream cheese until it it soft, about 30 seconds.  Add the rest of the ingredients and mix very well until there no streaks in mixture.  Can be used right away but it really is best if made the day before so the flavors marry together

Description: 
A series of tweeks from a dip recipe resulted in this family favorite.  I get requests to make this sandwich filling for parties from my friends.
