Ingredients:
6 Large Tomatoes - peeled and chopped
3/4 cup diced green bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped sweet onion
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 medium banana peppers diced
1/4 cup Butter
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon water
1 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch

Directions:
1. In large skillet, melt butter
2. Add onion, bell pepper, garlic, banana peppers to skillet and cook for approximately 10 minutes; until fragarant
3. Add tomatoes and cook for additional 5 minutes on medium to low heat
4. Stir in the sugar, pepper and oregano
5. Simmer on low for 10 minutes
6. If tomatoes are real juicy you can mix the corn start chicken with water and mix in the tomatoes to thicken the sauce. I find if you left it simmer longer the juice will cook down.
7.  Add salt  to taste - I find I never need the salt.
