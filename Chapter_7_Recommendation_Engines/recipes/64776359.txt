Ingredients:
1 tortilla
3/4 C sauce (generally pizza sauce, but could use BBQ, pesto, etc.)
1/3 C shredded mozzarella cheese
Toppings (i.e. red onion, sausage, peppers, etc.)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the tortilla in a 12-inch cast iron pan. Spread sauce evenly across the tortilla, leaving 1/2 inch around the edges (if desired, edges can be brushed with oil and sprinkled with seasoning, i.e. rosemary). Sprinkle with cheese and toppings. Bake until the cheese is golden and bubbling (no sooner!) and the edges of the tortilla are lightly browned, about 12 to 14 minutes. Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing.
