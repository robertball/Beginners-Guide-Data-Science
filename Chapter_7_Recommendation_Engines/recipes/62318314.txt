Ingredients:
1 c. all-purpose flour
1/2 c. sugar
2 tsp. ground ginger
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg
6 T. (3/4 stick) butter, melted
1/4 c. light molasses
1 lrg. egg
1/3 c. hot water
confectioners' sugar
8 oz. Cool Whip
1 tsp. vanilla
2 c. blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Grease 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 jelly roll pan; line with waxed paper; grease paper.  Dust with flour.
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, ginger, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg.  Beat in melted margarine, molasses, egg and 1/3 cup hot tap water.  Spread batter evenly in pan.  Bake cake 15 minutes or until top springs back when touched with fingertip.
Sprinkle clean cloth towel with confectioners sugar.  When cake is done, immediately invert onto towel.  Peel off waxed paper.  If you like, cut off crisp edges of cake.  Starting at a long side, roll cake with towel, jelly roll fashion.  Place cake roll, seam side down, on wire rack; cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Fold together Cool Whip, vanilla and blueberries.  Unroll cooled cake (cake may crack) and spread cream mixture on top.  Starting from same end, roll up cake without towel.  Place rolled cake, seam side down, on long platter.  Cover and refrigerate if not serving right away.  Sprinkle with confectionersâ€™ sugar before serving.
