Ingredients:
3 Tbsp. ground flax seed
1/2 c. + 1 Tbsp. water
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 c. applesauce
1/2 c. vegetable oil
2 cups white sugar
2 cups peeled, pitted, and chopped peaches

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 16 muffin cups.
In a medium size bowl combine the ground flax seed and water. Set aside.
In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt.
To the bowl with flax seed add in the oil and applesauce. Stir the oil and flax seed mixture into the flour mixture just until moist. Fold in the peaches. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups. Almost to the top.
Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely.
