Ingredients:
1 Acorzini Squash
2 TBSP Olive Oil
1/2 cup onion, diced
1 clove garlic, crushed
12 oz. soy burger-style crumbles (such as Yves)
7 mushrooms, chopped
28 oz. can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano, undrained
1 1/2 c. cooked acini di pepe pasta (or other small pasta)
3/4 c. bread crumbs
1/2 c. shredded parmesan cheese
1 1/2 c. shredded mozzarella cheese
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Cut the squash in half, vertically.  If you are unable to cut through it, place it in the microwave for a few minutes to soften.  Scrape out seeds.
Rub inside of squash with 1 TBSP olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Place cut side down on baking tray and cover with plastic wrap.  Microwave for 15 to 20 minutes, or until squash is tender.
Preheat oven to 350.
While the squash is cooking, heat remaining olive oil in frying pan.
Add onion and cook for 3 minutes.
Add garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute.
Next, add the soy burger crumbles and mushrooms and saute for 5 minutes.
Add tomatoes, with their juice, and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
Stir in the cooked acini di pepe and the bread crumbs.
Add salt and pepper, to taste.
Spoon the mixture into the squash halves.
Sprinkle the parmesan and mozzarella cheeses on each half.
Bake uncovered at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, or until squash is slightly browned and cheese is melted.

Description: 
While shopping at the public market yesterday, I noticed an acorzini squash.  The vendor told me it was a hybrid between an acorn squash and a zucchini.  I had to try it, but if you can't find an acorzini, acorn squash can be substituted.
