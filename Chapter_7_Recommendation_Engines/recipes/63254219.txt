Ingredients:
4 fat boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 C flour
1 C panko bread crumbs
2 extra large eggs
3 T McCormick Grill Mates Dry Rub Applewood
1/2 pound sliced bacon
4 OZ shredded Gruyere cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
On a sheet tray place a cooling rack on the rack place your slices of bacon, place in the oven for approx 20 minutes or until desired crispness. Remove from oven to cool, crumble or cut into small pieces.
With a sharp pointed knife bore a hole down the length of the fatest part of the chicke breast to create a pocket, twisting the knife helps create the opening.
Stuff the chicken breast with the bacon and cheese. I found if you put a little extra bacon in last the cheese doesn't tend to leak out.
You'll need three bowls or pie plates for dredging. In the first flour and 1T of dry rub, in the second eggs and 1T of dry rub and in the third the panko bread crumbs and 1T of the dry rub. Mix each well so the dry rub is evenly distributed.
Dredge chicken in flour mix, then egg mix, finally the bread crumb mix. Place on a cooling rack on a baking sheet.
Place in the oven and back at 400 for about 20 minutes or until chicken is fully cooked through.
