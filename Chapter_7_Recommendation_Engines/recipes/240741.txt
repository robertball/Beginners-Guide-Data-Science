Description: 
My wife's specialty. Similar to fattoush, but with a different assortment of vegetables, including (of course) eggplant which gives this salad an extra zing! This dish was a hit at a holiday potluck. The salad is ready to serve, but letting the entire salad soak overnight is recommended.
