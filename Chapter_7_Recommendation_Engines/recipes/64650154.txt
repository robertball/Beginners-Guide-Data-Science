Ingredients:
3 tablespoons Mayonnaise
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and pepper to taste
5 potatoes, quartered

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook until almost done about 10 minutes. Don't overcook otherwise the potatoes will break apart. Drain, and cool.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly grease a large piece of aluminum foil.
Arrange potatoes in the prepared aluminum foil. Spoon the mayonnaise mixture over the potatoes. Place on the prepared grill, and cook until potatoes are tender and mayonnaise mixture is lightly browned about 10 minutes.
