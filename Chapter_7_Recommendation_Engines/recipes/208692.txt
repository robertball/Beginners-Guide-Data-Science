Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
5 tablespoons lemon juice, divided
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground
1 1/2 pounds leg of lamb, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
1/3 cup English or hothouse cucumber, diced
1/4 cup Kalamata olives, pitted and finely chopped
3 tablespoons red onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh oregano, chopped
1 large firm-ripe Chilean Hass avocado, halved, pitted and peeled, cut into 1/4-inch pieces

Directions:
In sealable plastic bag, combine olive oil, 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Add lamb. Seal bag and turn to coat lamb completely. Refrigerate 1 hour.
For relish, in small bowl stir together cucumbers, olives, onion, the remaining 3 tablespoons lemon juice and oregano. Stir to mix. Gently stir in avocado pieces. Cover tightly by placing plastic wrap directly on the surface of the relish.
Remove lamb cubes from marinade and thread 4 cubes onto each of 8 skewers. Grill or broil about 4 minutes per side, or until desired degree of doneness. Serve kabobs with relish.
