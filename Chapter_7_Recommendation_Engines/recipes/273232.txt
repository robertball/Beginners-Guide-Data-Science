3 large shallots, chopped (optional)
2 cups uncooked jasmine rice, rinsed and drained
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 bay leaves
3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth

Directions:
Heat butter in large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots; cook and stir until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes. Pour in rice, garlic, salt, turmeric, coriander, cumin, and bay leaves. Continue to cook and stir for 3 minutes. Add chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until broth is absorbed and rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove from heat. Discard bay leaves. Transfer to a bowl.
