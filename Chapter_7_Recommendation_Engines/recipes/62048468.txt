Ingredients:
- 1 pound firm tofu, cubed
- 1 red onion, sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 green chili pepper, chopped
- 2-3 tablespoons peanut oil
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1/3 cup hot water
- 3 tablespoons white vinegar
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

Directions:
1.  Heat the peanut oil in a wok or large frying pan.  Fry tofu until brown on all sides.  Add vegetables and cook until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.
2.  In a small bowl combine hot water, vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, cornstarch, and pepper flakes.  Pour over vegetables and tofu.  Simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, or until sauce thickens slightly.

A word of caution - this is VERY hot! If you like milder dishes, decrease the amount of pepper flakes or omit them altogether.
