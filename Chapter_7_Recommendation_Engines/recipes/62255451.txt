Ingredients:
1 cup of Granulated sugar
1 cup of Heavy cream or a can of media crema
1 cup of Whole milk
1 can of Sweetened condensed milk
3 large Whole eggs
3 large Egg yolks
Â¼ cup of Freshly squeezed orange juice
1 tablespoon of Fresh orange zest
1 tablespoon of Pure vanilla extract
1 tablespoon of Cornstarch

Directions:
Caramel:
1 cup of Granulated sugar
Place sugar in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook the sugar, stirring constantly, until the sugar has turned a deep amber color. Pour the sugar into desired mold. Let cool and set aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place all of the ingredients, except the cream, in a blender. Blend for a couple of minutes until ingredients are smooth and well blended. Then add the cream, blend again for a couple of seconds until well incorporated. Place blended ingredients into your mold where the sugar has cooled. Then put your mold in a water bath. Bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Let cool and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Serve with fresh whipped cream.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me by my Mother in law who is from Durango, Mexico. I had to beg her for years to give this recipe to me. Finally, she gave it to me for Christmas. As a reminder, there is no cream cheese in Mexico. So obviously this recipe contains no cream cheese. I added orange zest, but the original recipe calls for just pure vanilla. You can use almond extract as well.
