Ingredients:
1 c. each chopped red and green bell pepper
1/2 c. chopped onion
cornbread (or buy a 16-oz. tube of polenta)
3 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 c. salsa
2 tsp. cumin
2 c. cooked black beans (or 1 can, drained)
1 can (15 oz.) diced tomatoes
1/4 c. sour cream (optional)
1/4 c. chopped cilantro
1 small avocado, diced

Directions:
Make cornbread from a favorite recipe.
While bread is baking, saute peppers, onion and garlic for 6 minutes.  Stir in salsa, cumin, beans, and tomatoes.  Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. (I added some water from cooking beans and left uncovered.)
Place slices of cornbread on plates and top with bean stew.  Top with a T. of sour cream and cilantro, along with some avocado dices.
