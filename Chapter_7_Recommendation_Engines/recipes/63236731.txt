Ingredients:
Vinaigrette:
3 Tbs white wine vinegar
1 tsp honey
3/4 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp ground red pepper
2 tablespoons canola oil
Salad:
3 slices bacon,cooked and crumbled.  I use pre-cooked bacon so itâ€™s super quick
cooking spray
8 oz skinless, boneless turkey or chicken breast cut into 1/2 inch pieces*
1/4 tsp salt
8 cups torn romaine lettuce
1/2 C pico de gallo
1/2 C diced avocado
1/2 C (2 oz) crumbled queso fresco (feta makes a good sub, or shredded pepperjack)
1/4 C chopped green onions
1 (15oz) can black beans, rinsed and drained

Directions:
To prepare vinaigrette, combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and whisk to combine, or place in a jar and shake.   Set aside.
To prepare salad, heat a skillet to medium high heat.  Spray with cooking spray.  Sprinkle turkey or chicken with salt and add to pan.  Saute until done, about 4 minutes.
Arrange 2 C lettuce on each of 4 plates and divide ingredients among them.  If you want to be specific, each serving should have about:  2 teaspoons bacon, 5 tablespoons turkey or chicken, 2 tablespoons pico de gallo, 2 tablespoons avocado, 2 tablespoons queso fresco, 1 tablespoon onions, and about 1/3 cup beans.
Drizzle vinaigrette evenly over salads.

Description: 
For a quick no-cook meal, substitute diced rotisserie chicken or leftover turkey breast, use  pre-cooked bacon you can just zap in the microwave, and you can even buy pico de gallo.
