Ingredients:
6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, diced
2 red onions, sliced thinly
1/4 c. minced garlic (if using the jar; 2 cloves of elephant garlic otherwise)
16 oz. thick-cut bacon, cubed
2 yellow bell peppers, de-seeded and diced
1 orange bell pepper, de-seeded and diced
16 oz. mini bella mushrooms, sliced
2 - 16oz jars Chi-Chi's pineapple salsa (can substitute mango)
1 - 16oz jar Great Value medium "Thick'n'Chunky" Salsa
1 - 48oz jar white Northern Beans, undrained
4 c. Kraft Philadelphia Mexican Cheese blend
Chili powder, to taste
Chicken stock, optional

Directions:
Saute bacon in a skillet until crispy.
Drain bacon, reserving fat. Put bacon into a crockpot or roasting pan.
Using the bacon fat, saute chicken. When fully cooked and juices run clear, add chicken to bacon.
Saute onions, garlic, and bell peppers in bacon fat until tender. Add to roasting pan.
Add mushrooms, salsa, and beans to roasting pan.
Place roasting pan in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes, or until heated through.
Remove from oven, stir in all the cheese until thoroughly incorporated, and then serve.
NOTES: If desired spice is not there, can go to hot salsa, or can add chili powder. Can add stock if the chili becomes too thick. Garnish with chives, if desired.
