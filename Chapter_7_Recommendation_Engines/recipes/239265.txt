Ingredients:
2 cups grated carrots
3 eggs
1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup applesauce
2 tablespoons canola oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips, or to taste
1/4 cup dried cranberries, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line muffin cups with paper liners.
Whisk carrots, eggs, milk, applesauce, canola oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl; stir into carrot mixture until just combined into a batter. Fold chocolate chips and cranberries into batter. Spoon about 2 tablespoons batter into each prepared muffin cup.
Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes are fluffy and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
