Fried Catfish Nuggets Recipe

Ingredients:
2 lbs Catfish Nuggets
2 cups all purpose flour
1 cup spicy brown mustard
2 tablespoons thyme
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 quart vegetable oil

Directions:
Put catfish nuggets in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Shake thyme evenly over nuggets, turning them to get both sides of each nugget. Coat the nuggets with the mustard. Use hands to rub in the mustard. Cover with foil and marinate in the fridge for 24 hours, if possible.
Heat Vegetable Oil in a deep skillet on medium-high heat. Preheat oven to 250 degrees.
Add flour, baking soda, salt, and pepper to a medium mixing bowl and combine. Add a handful of nuggets to the bowl and coat completely with flour. The flour should stick nicely to the mustard.
Test the oil for correct heat. You can do this with a thermometer (should be about 350 degrees) or test the oil with a small chunk of bread. The bread should quickly float to the surface and release bubbles.
Add the nuggets, one at a time, to the oil and keep an eye on them. Each batch should be done in just a couple of minutes but just watch for a nice golden brown color. Don't hesitate to turn them gently with a fork if you feel they are browning more on one side.
Remove the nuggets and set them on a lined serving dish. Put the dish in the warm oven while you continue this process with the rest of the nuggets. I recommend waiting a minute between batches so the oil has time to reheat.
Serve with ketchup or tartar sauce.
