Ingredients:
1 butternut squash - peeled, halved lengthwise, and seeded
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 small onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
2 pinches cayenne pepper (optional)
2 (15.5 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
12 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
2 (10 ounce) cans mild enchilada sauce
8 flour tortillas, or more if needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pierce butternut squash flesh several times with a fork and place face-down on a greased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 45 minutes. Scoop squash flesh from skin.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onions are soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix cumin, coriander, and cayenne into onion mixture. Add squash, black beans, and 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese; cook and stir until heated through.
Pour a thin layer of enchilada sauce into an 11x7-inch baking dish. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce into a large dish with sides. Dip both sides of each tortilla into enchilada sauce. Fill tortillas with sweet potato mixture and roll tortilla around the filling. Place rolled tortillas, seam-side down, in the baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and sweet potato mixture; top with remaining Cheddar cheese. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the oven until heated through and cheese is melted, about 40 minutes.
