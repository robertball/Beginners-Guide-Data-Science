Description: 
Adds great robust flavor when added to pasta sauces, gravy, soups, homemade breads, roasted vegetables, sprinkled over pizza. Especially good and when used to make a marinade for chicken breasts and other meats. It also makes a delicious dipping oil when combined with olive oil and freshly grated Parmesan!
