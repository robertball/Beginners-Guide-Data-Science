Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
3 eggs
1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling
1/2 cup applesauce

Directions:
Mix the box of cake mix, eggs, pie filling and applesauce  till moist. Use a microwave safe bundt pan or substitute a microwave safe bowl that has a microwave safe cup or cone placed in the middle of it (to mimic a bundt pan).  Pour mixture into the bowl around the cup.
Bake on high for 6 minutes 30 seconds,  turn and bake for another 6 minutes 30 seconds on high. Remove from oven and cover bowl with a dish and let stand for 5 minutes (this finishes the cooking process).
Turn cake over onto dish and remove cone (cup) for a delicious quick dessert. Good hot with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping.

Description: 
Easy fast cake that can be made in the microwave in approximately 12 minutes.  My favorite combinations are:  chocolate cake mix with cherry pie filling or yellow cake mix with apple pie filling ( I add a bit of cinnamon for flavor to this one.)
