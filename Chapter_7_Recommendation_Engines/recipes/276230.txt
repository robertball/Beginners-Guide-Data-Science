Ingredients:
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
6 paper cups (9 fl oz)
3 cups low-fat vanilla yogurt, or more as needed
6 popsicle sticks

Directions:
Place chocolate chips and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
Spoon melted chocolate evenly into the 6 paper cups, filling cups about 1/5th or 1/6th high (leave some chocolate for decorating). Using your finger draw 3 dots with the remaining chocolate on the insides of the cups near the chocolate bases to make little ghost expressions.
Fill each cup with about 1/2 cup of yogurt, adding more if necessary to cover the ghost faces. Stick a popsicle stick in the center of each cup and freeze until solid, 3 to 4 hours.
Remove paper cups from the popsicles by either cutting them off or peeling them off by the seam of the cup.
