Ingredients:
3 ripe avocados - peeled, pitted, and cubed
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup maple syrup
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon water, or as needed

Directions:
Place the avocados, cocoa powder, maple syrup, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and salt in the work bowl of a food processor, and blend until smooth and creamy. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed to make the pudding the desired consistency. Eat right away, or chill and serve cold.

Description: 
In my journey to applying the 90/10 (okay 80/20) rule to my food ethic – that is, 90 percent good for you and 10 percent … not so much – I'm always on a quest to find dessert holy grails. If I'm going to indulge in dessert, it better be good. Medjool dates, by themselves, no matter how exponentially sweet, are not going to cut it when I want something velvety, chocolatey and rich.
