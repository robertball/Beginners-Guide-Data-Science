Scalloped Potatoes and Ham by Tammy Recipe

Ingredients:
5 Tablespoons butter
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1/2 cup flour
3 cups 2% milk
6 medium-large red potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/4" thick
3 cups cooked ham, cubed
Salt, pepper, garlic powder, Alpine Touch seasoning
Optional: 2 cups Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375. Grease or Spray 2 quart casserole dish.
Melt butter in large skillet, add onions, saut√© over medium heat until tender, about 3-4 minutes.
Add flour to butter and onions, cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.
Gradually whisk in milk, mix well. Continue to cook over medium heat until sauce thickens, 3-4 minutes. Add pepper, salt and seasoning to sauce. Reduce heat and keep warm.
Slice potatoes as uniform as possible, about 1/4" thick.
In the greased casserole dish, layer half the potatoes, half the ham, and half the sauce mix, also half the cheese if using.  Repeat the layers. (I sprinkled each layer of potatoes with salt).  Add pepper and seasoning.
Cover with foil (and I also covered with the casserole dish lid). Bake 1 hour. Remove from oven, poke around and "lift" around the casserole. Recover and cook for another 20 minutes, more or less, until potatoes are tender. Remove from oven and let stand for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley if desired.
