Ingredients:
For the Stock:
1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken
1 large yellow onion, quartered
3 tablespoons salt, or to taste
3 tablespoons sunflower seed oil
4 bay leaves
1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
1 teaspoon garlic powder
For the Soup:
8 carrots, cut into 1/8-inch slices
4 stalks celery, diced
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns, crushed
4 cups cooked white rice

Directions:
Place chicken into a stockpot and fill with water to cover. Bring to a boil; add onion, salt, oil, bay leaves, peppercorns, sage, oregano, herbes de Provence, and garlic powder. Cover loosely with a lid and continue to boil, at least 2 hours, up to 4 hours.
Remove chicken carefully from the stockpot onto a plate; set aside. Pour stock through a strainer into a deep bowl; set aside.
Fill the stockpot with water that equals the amount of strained stock in the bowl. Bring to a boil.
While water is boiling, remove meat from chicken, throw away all bones, and shred chicken chunks with 2 forks.
Pour chicken stock into the boiling water and add chicken meat, carrots, celery, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and let simmer for 30 minutes.
Place cooked rice into bowls and pour the soup over.
