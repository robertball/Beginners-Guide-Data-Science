Ingredients:
6 Large Russet potatoes
4 Large hard boiled eggs (chopped)
1/2 sm-med white onion (grated)
1/2 cup chopped dill pickles
1 cup mayo
1/8 cup dill pickle juice
1 heaping Tablespoon each, yellow and Dijon mustard (more or less to taste)
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

Directions:
Wash potatoes and place in a pot, add water to cover and bring to a boil. Lower heat to medium-high and cook just until fork tender. Do not overcook!
Place hot potatoes into cold water to cool. Using a sharp knife scrape skins off potatoes and rinse.  Into a large bowl, dice into 1" pieces. Add chopped eggs and pickles, toss lightly using a large cooking spoon.
In a pile add mayo, mustards, onions and remaining ingredients. Use a folding motion to combine them. Once combined, continue to fold into the potatoes and eggs.
Refridgerate immediately and for at least a couple of hours before serving.
