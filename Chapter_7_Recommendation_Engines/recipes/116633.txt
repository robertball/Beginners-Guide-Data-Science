Ingredients:
1 3/4 pounds butternut squash
1 large onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
5 cups chicken broth
1 bay leaf
CILANTO CREAM TOPPING:
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup whipping cream
1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro or parsley

Directions:
Cut squash in half lengthwise; discard seeds. Place squash cut side down in a greased or foil-lined baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 40-50 minutes or until tender. When cool enough to handle, scoop out pulp; set aside.
In a large saucepan, saute onion and garlic in oil until tender. Add the flour, salt, curry powder and cayenne until blended. Stir in broth. Add bay leaf. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Cool to room temperature.
In a blender or food processor, place half of the broth mixture and squash; cover and process until smooth. Repeat with remaining broth mixture and squash. Return to the saucepan; heat through. Combine the topping ingredients; place a dollop on each serving.
