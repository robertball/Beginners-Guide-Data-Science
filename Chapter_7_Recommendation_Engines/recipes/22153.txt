Description: 
Indian dal is a spiced lentil, split pea, farina or dried bean mixture that is cooked almost to a smooth texture. Sambar takes dal several steps further, adding a variety of fresh vegetables. This version of sambar is flavored with just a sampling of the spices and fruit loved by the Indians: coriander, fenugreek, cinnamon and tamarind.
