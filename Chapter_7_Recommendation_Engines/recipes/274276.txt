Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, juice reserved
1/3 cup water, or as needed
Sauce:
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 green bell pepper, chopped

Directions:
Mix together ground beef, ginger, garlic powder, and pepper until well combined. Form into 1 1/2-inch meatballs.
Saute meatballs in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove meatballs to a plate, reserving the pan drippings.
While the meatballs are cooking, pour juice from the canned pineapple into a liquid measuring cup and add enough water to make 1 cup. Mix brown sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl.
Add pineapple juice and brown sugar mixtures to the warm pan drippings. Add vinegar and soy sauce and bring to a boil. Cook until sauce thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Add meatballs, pineapple chunks, and green pepper. Simmer until meatballs are no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes.
