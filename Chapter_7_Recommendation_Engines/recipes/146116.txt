Ingredients:
2/3 cup water
1/2 cup whiskey
1/2 cup pineapple juice
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup diced onion
1/3 cup teriyaki sauce
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup liquid smoke
1 teaspoon minced garlic
4 (8 ounce) rib-eye steaks

Directions:
Whisk together the water, whiskey, pineapple juice, brown sugar, diced onion, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, liquid smoke, and minced garlic in a bowl.
Lie the steaks in the bottom of a baking dish. Pour the marinade over the steaks; refrigerate overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.
Grill steaks to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Allow steaks to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

I love the steak at a restaurant I frequent. I developed a recipe at home through trial and error. I feel it comes pretty close. This is a flavorful way to grill steak. Hope you enjoy!
