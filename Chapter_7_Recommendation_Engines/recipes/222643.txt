Ingredients:
3 large baking potatoes
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups prepared Alfredo sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Scrub and dry potatoes, then prick several times with a fork and place onto a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Remove and cool slightly. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise; scoop out pulp, leaving a thin shell.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Combine Alfredo sauce, garlic, pepper, and thyme in a small bowl. Stir in 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Combine potato pulp and cheese mixture; mix well. Spoon mixture into potato shells; sprinkle with 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are hot and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.
