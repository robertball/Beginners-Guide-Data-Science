Ingredients:
1 lb lean ground beef (or turkey)
1 egg
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 soft loaf of bread, crust removed
1/2 cup milk
1 package frozen spinach, thawed, fluid
squeezed out
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
1 ball fresh mozzarella, sliced into 6 thick portions
2 beefsteak tomatoes sliced thick
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp minced garlic
1 tbsp dried basil
1 tbsp dried oregano
salt
pepper
oil for frying

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Heat 2 tbsp oil in skillet over medium heat.
Break bread into pieces, place with milk in sauce pan.  Heat over medium heat until bread soaks up milk, remove from heat and cool. Mash together with fork.
Blend meat with egg, spices, garlic, parmesan cheese, spinach and bread mixture in medium mixing bowl.  Form meat into six even meat balls, flatten slightly.  Dredge meat in bread crumbs and fry in oil until browned on both sides, approximately 3 minutes on each side.
Place meat balls in non-stick pan, place a slice of tomato on top of each meat ball, sprinkle with salt, pepper and additional basil or with a fresh basil leaf. Place a slice of mozzarella on top of tomatoes.
Cook in oven, uncovered until completely cooked and mozzarella has melted.
Serve immediately with warm crusty bread, salad and a nice wine. Makes an excellent appetizer.
