Description: 
Whenever you make these cookies for someone, be sure to bring along several copies of the recipe!  You will be asked for it, I promise!!! NOTE:  I make icing with confectioners' sugar and milk. I make it fairly thin, as I 'paint' the icing on the cookies with a pastry brush. Thin enough to spread easily but not so thin that it just makes your cookies wet and runs off.Modified from: The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies
