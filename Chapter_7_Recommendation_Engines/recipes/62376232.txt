Ingredients:
3 ears of corn (approx two cups if using frozen corn kernels)
3 large green onions
1 cup diced red bell pepper (or one small pepper)
1 TBS olive oil
1 16 oz can of black beans, rinsed
3 TBS of cilantro, chopped
¼ tsp garlic salt
¼ tsp cracked black pepper
¼ tsp cumin
¼ tsp chili powder
juice of one lime

Directions:
Using a sharp knife, place each ear of corn in a bowl and slice off kernels.
Slice 3 green onions into small rings- removing the root end.
Remove stem and seeds. Chop bell pepper into a small dice.
In a large skillet, heat 1 TBS of olive oil over medium heat.
Add corn, red pepper and green onion.
Cook over medium heat, stirring every couple minutes for about 8 minutes, or until cooked to your desired consistency (I like mine a little crunchy).
Add in rinsed black beans, cilantro, spices and juice of one lime.
Stir to combine and serve warm, or chill and eat as a cold salad.
