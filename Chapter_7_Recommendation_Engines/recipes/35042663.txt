Ingredients:
3 cups chicken broth
10 frozen chicken tenders
1 bay leaf
2 tsp dried oregano
1 small onion
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 tsp chili powder
1 tsp cumin
1 small can chopped green chiles
1 cup enchilada sauce (La Preferida or La Victoria)
2 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
8 whole wheat tortillas or corn tortillas, as you wish

Directions:
Simmer chicken in broth with onion, bay leaf & oregano, covered, for 10 minutes.
Remove chicken to bowl & shred.  Add 1/2 cup cooking liquid, tomato paste & spices, green chiles.  I stir some shredded cheese into the chicken filling as well.
Put a small amount of enchilada sauce into the bottom of your baking dish.  Roll chicken filling into each tortilla, place seam side down into pan.  Once all tortillas are rolled, pour remaining sauce over all & top with shredded cheese.
Bake at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes.

Description: 
these are the best I've ever made.  Today I started the chicken cooking in the slow cooker while I helped at school & went to the store.  This is the dish I take to people when they've had a new baby; gets rave reviews every time!
