Ingredients:
2 tb Olive oil
2 cup Coarsely chopped onions
6 cup Vegetable broth or water
1 1/2 cup Brown lentils
1/3 cup Coarse bulgur
1/4 teaspoon Crushed red pepper flakes; (optional)
1  Clove garlic; up to 2
Pushed through a press
3 cup Finely diced plum tomatoes; seeded
(fresh or canned; drained)
1 1/2 tbls Finely chopped fresh mint OR 1 1/2 tsp. dried mint; plus more to taste
1 1/4 tbsp Salt or to taste
1 cup Loosely packed minced fresh parsley
(Plus more to taste)
1 tb Fresh lemon juice; (1-3 lemons)

Directions:
Over medium-high heat, heat 2 tbsp. water  in the cooker. Cook the onions, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Add the broth and stir well to scrape up any browned bits sticking to the bottom of the cooker. Add the lentils, bulgur, and red pepper flakes, if using.
Lock the lid in place. Over high heat, bring to high pressure. Lower the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 10 minutes.  Quick-release the pressure. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape.
Stir in the garlic, tomatoes, mint, and salt. Simmer until the garlic loses its raw taste, about 2 minutes.  Blend in the parsley and lemon juice. Taste and add more mint, parsley, and lemon juice, if you wish. (I like the soup very lemony and use about 3 tablespoons for the pot-full, but this is a matter of taste.) Serve in large soup bowls.
