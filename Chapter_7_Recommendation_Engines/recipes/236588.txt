Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup margarine
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup mashed bananas

1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (10 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained and chopped
1/2 cup shredded coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 12 muffins cups or line with paper liners.
Beat sugar and margarine together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; stir in eggs. Stir bananas into margarine mixture; stir in vanilla extract.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; stir into margarine mixture until just combined. Fold oranges and coconut into batter. Spoon batter into muffin tins.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
I have a long-tested banana bread recipe that is one my Grandma used to make. I have changed it up to add some coconut and mandarin oranges. I took them to work and people said they were wonderful.
