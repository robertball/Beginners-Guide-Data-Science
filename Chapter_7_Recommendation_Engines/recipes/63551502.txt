Season the chicken breasts with the salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder.
Pour the blue cheese dressing and Frank's Red Hot sauce all over and mix until it is completely coated.
Put it in the fridge for 4 hours to marinate.
Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
Cut the bacon in half or in thirds, depending on its size.
Wrap each chicken piece and skewer it.
Cook for approximately 5-7 minutes on each side until the bacon is crispy and the chicken is cooked through.
