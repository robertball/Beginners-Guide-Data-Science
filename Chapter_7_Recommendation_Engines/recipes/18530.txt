Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package pie crust mix
6 fresh peaches - pitted, skinned, and sliced

1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Make crust mix according to package directions. Roll dough out so that it fits an 8 inch skillet or frying pan; make sure there is overhang.
Place peaches into pastry lined pan. Sprinkle with sugar, salt and cinnamon. Dot with butter.  Fold the dough edges over towards center; leave a small space in center uncovered. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes until fruit is bubbly and crust is browned.
