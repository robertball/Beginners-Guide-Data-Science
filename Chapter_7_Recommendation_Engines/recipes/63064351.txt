Description: 
Condensed potato, shrimp and oyster soups are heated with cream, thyme and white pepper for an easy seafood soup.   I had complaints that it was a bit bland, so we added Old Bay Seasoning and some oyster crackers and it was great.  Cream of Shrimp soup can be hard to find.  I found mine at Marsh.  The cost was a bit higher than I anticipated, but overall a good value if you can get shrimp on sale and have coupons for the soup.Modified from: Simple Seafood Soup
