Ingredients:
2 Boxes of Kiwi Mussels New Zealand
1 Heapping tsp Masago
2 Cups of Kewpie Mayo
2 tsp of Sriracha

Directions:
Pre-heat your broiler or toaster oven to 425 degree Broil. If using live mussels, cover and steam in a basket or colander over boiling water just until the mussels pop open (chuck any that remain closed; they're dead). Then take them off the heat immediately. Discard the shell not connected to the meat and arrange the mussels on the half shell, meat side up, on a foil-lined baking pan.
If you are using frozen mussels (which are usually pre-cooked), simply arrange the mussels in the same way on the baking pan. The mussels will defrost slightly while you put the sauce together.
To prepare the sauce
Add Kewpie mayo with the Sriracha and fully incorporate it into the sauce.
Do a taste test here. If you would like the sauce to be hotter, add a little more Sriracha. If you want it to be milder, add a few squirts of Kewpie mayo.
The consistency and viscosity of the sauce should be like pancake batter or a softened milk shake.
Once you've reached this stage, add the masago and stir slowly to distribute it evenly into the sauce.
Then spoon the sauce over each mussel. Put just enough to cover the meat completely.
Place the mussels under the broiler or toaster oven to cook.
Check frequently and rotate the pan occasionally to even out the browning and compensate for hot spots. Cook until the sauce bubbles and gets golden brown with a few dark spots forming. The total cooking time should not exceed 15 minutes.
Serve immediately.
