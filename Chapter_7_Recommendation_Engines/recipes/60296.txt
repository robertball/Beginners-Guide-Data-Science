Ingredients:
2 cups split pea flour
1 cup self-rising flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water, or as needed
1/2 small onion, minced
2 1/2 cloves garlic, minced
1 green onion, chopped (green part only)
2 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Sift the split pea flour, self-rising flour, and baking powder into a large bowl. Stir in turmeric, cumin, and salt. Gradually stir in enough water to make a very thick batter. Stir in onion, garlic, and green onion.
Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot, drop tablespoonfuls of the batter into the pan, and fry until golden brown on both sides. Remove to paper towels to drain.
