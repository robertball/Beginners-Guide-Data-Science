Ingredients:
oil for frying
4 pork chops, cut into 1" cubes
1/2 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 (15 ounce) can chunk pineapple, drained, juice reserved
1 medium onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
10 white mushrooms, quartered
3/4 cup cashews
salt and pepper, to taste
2 teaspoons cornstarch
red pepper flakes, to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.
Mix together flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper on a plate or in a bag. Dredge pork pieces in the flour mixture. Fry pork pieces in the oil for 6 minutes, turning every 1 to 2 minutes, until evenly browned and cooked through. (You may have to do this in two batches). Set pork aside on a plate covered with paper towel to drain excess oil.
Drain and discard all but 2 tablespoons of the oil in the pan. Reduce heat to medium and add in the peppers, onionn mushrooms, and cashews with salt and pepper to taste. Stir fry for about 5 minutes, until onion starts to soften. Add in the drained pineapple chunks until they warm up.
Meanwhile, to make glaze: in the microwave or in a small saucepan over medium high heat, heat the reserved pineapple juice until hot. Stir in the cornstarch until smooth.
Pour glaze over veggies and simmer until it thickens. Add pork back into the pan and stir until coated with glaze. Sprinkle red pepper flakes to taste and serve over rice.
