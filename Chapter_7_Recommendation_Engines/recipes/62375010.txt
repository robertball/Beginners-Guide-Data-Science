Ingredients:
4 pounds beef sirloin roast
3 carrots, chopped
3 stalks celery, chopped
ADD: 1 lb of baby new potatoes
ADD: 1 cup of Sherry
ADD: 5 handfulls of Sam's Club restaurant croutons
ADD: *4 (not just 1) cloves garlic, minced
1/2 (.75 ounce) packet dry brown gravy mix
2 tablespoons water
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
10 fluid ounces cola-flavored carbonated beverage

Directions:
1. Braise the roast, including sides. No, the old-fashioned belief that this sears in the juices is not true ... but, the belief that a braised roast tastes better is true. Ref. Joy of Cooking. This causes a chemical reaction, and changes the texture of the roast.
2. In a small bowl, combine the brown gravy mix and water, mixing into a smooth paste. Add onion soup mix, cream of mushroom soup and cola-flavored carbonated beverage. Pour over the roast.
3. Put braised roast in a slow cooker instead of the oven. Then sprinkle carrots, celery and minced garlic around roast. Make sure the carrots and potatoes are in the liquid mix, so they'll get a good soaking. Add the croutons last, so they'll be on top.
4. Place a strip of foil on top of the crock pot (to help keep in steam and juices), then place cover on crock pot. Cook for 4 hours.
