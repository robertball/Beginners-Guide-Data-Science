Ingredients:
1 pound Italian sausage
1/2 pound of bacon
1/2 pound ham
5 stalks celery
2 carrots
2 onions
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans
2 (15 ounce) cans cannelloni bean
1 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoon hot pepper sauce
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
6 cloves crushed garlic

Directions:
Boil sausage in a large pot of water to draw out fat, about 10 minutes. Cut into bite size pieces and add to giant pot.
Bake bacon at 425' until nearly crisp - drain well on paper towels (fat and grease does not can well.)  Once cool chop into bite size pieces and add to pot.
Trim ham steaks of all bone and fat.  Dice into bite size pieces and add to the pot.
Dice celery, carrots, onions into small pieces and all to the pot along with all spices, herbs and garlic.
In a small bowl mash one can of cannelloni beans with tomato sauce to form a thick, smooth mixture.
Wash the remaining beans in a colander to remove the packing liquid in the cans before add the beans to the pot.
Finally add stewed tomatoes (with liquid) and Worcestershire sauce to the pot.  If you are not canning you can stew all of the ingredients in the pot for 2-3 hours on low heat or in crock pot.
To can, fill (prepared) jars with well mixed stew with 1" head space.  Pressure can for 40 minutes, following ALL canning guidelines.

Description: 
Great recipe for canning a thick chili/stew of all kinds of pork and beans. I usually quadruple it and it lasts my family at least 6 months (along with other canned foods).
