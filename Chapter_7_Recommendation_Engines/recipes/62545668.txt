Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chopped almonds (previously soaked for at least 2 hours)
2/3 cup tahini sauce
juice of 1 lemon
2 cloves garlic (crushed)
1 medium tomato
10 thin slices of oil packed sundried tomatoes (soaked in water at least 2 hours before making)
100g stoned olives (I like to use the large green ones)
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1/4 tsp salt (preferably sea salt)

Directions:
Just take all of these ingredients and mix them in the food processor until you get a mushy paste that is kind of like mushy hummus.  You can play around with the taste as you wish by adding or reducing the olives or any of the other ingredients.  Or if you want to soften the texture, you can use more olive oil or even better, I like to use the olive oil that comes with the sundried tomatoes.
Store the mixture in a sealed jar in the fridge.
