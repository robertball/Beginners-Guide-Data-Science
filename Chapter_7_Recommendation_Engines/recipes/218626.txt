Ingredients:
1/2 pound thick-sliced peppered bacon
1 tablespoon bacon drippings
1 cup mayonnaise
3 large tomatoes, diced
2 large cucumbers, diced
kosher salt to taste
freshly cracked five-peppercorn seasoning to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin (optional)

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. When cool, crumble the bacon into a large salad bowl. Reserve 1 tablespoon of bacon drippings, and let cool.
Mix the bacon drippings and mayonnaise into the crumbled bacon until thoroughly combined; stir in tomatoes and cucumbers. Season to taste with kosher salt, five-peppercorn blend, and cumin. Allow to chill for at least 1 hour before serving (overnight is better).
