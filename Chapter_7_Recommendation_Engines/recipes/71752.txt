Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups water
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup water
1/4 cup maple syrup, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup cottage cheese
2 tablespoons grape jelly

Directions:
In a saucepan, bring 2 1/2 cups of water to a boil. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining water and cornmeal. When the water boils, gradually add the cornmeal mixture so that the water stays at a boil. Cook, stirring frequently to prevent lumps, for 30 to 40 minutes. Mix in the maple syrup and cinnamon, adjusting to taste if desired. Spoon into bowls to serve and top with cottage cheese and grape jelly.

Description: 
Cornmeal is simmered in a thick pudding sweetened with maple syrup. I'm not sure where this recipe came from, my mother would make it for us before school on cold winter days.
