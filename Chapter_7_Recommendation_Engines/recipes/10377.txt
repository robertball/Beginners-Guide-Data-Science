Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup shortening
1/2 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt.  Set aside.
In a large bowl , cream the vegetable shortening and the two sugars.  Beat in the egg and vanilla. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients.
Fold in the chocolate chips and the nuts.  Cover and chill for 2 to 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Drop cookie by teaspoonfuls onto shiny lightly greased cookie sheets. Bake 10-12 minutes and transfer to wire racks to cool. Take out of oven when lightly colored -  they will darken after being taken off cookie sheet.
