Ingredients:
1 package dry yeast
1 cup warm water
1 egg  beaten
2 tablespoons butter
4 cups all-purpose flour  divided
1 tbs sugar
¾ tsp salt
¼ tsp garlic salt (add more for taste)
3 small canned or fresh jalapeno peppers seeded and chopped (for more spice seeds are ok!)
1 cup shredded Monterrey sharp cheddar cheese
1 jar diced pimientos drained
1/3 cup minced onion (optional)

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes.  Combine dissolved yeast, egg and butter mix until butter is melted
Combine 3 cups flour, sugar, salt and garlic salt. Gradually add flour mixture to yeast mixture, beating at medium speed or use wooden spoon.  Beat in peppers, cheese pimiento, onion and enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead 1 minute.  Shape dough into a loaf; place in  a greased 9 x 5 x 3-inch pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes or until doubles in bulk.
Preheat oven to 450. Bake 40-45 min or until done and loaf sounds hollow when tapped.  Remove from pan and cool on wire rack.
*Makes 1 loaf.
