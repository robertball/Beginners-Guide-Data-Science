Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup mashed pumpkin
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1/4 cup cashews, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch cake pan with cooking spray.
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir in mashed pumpkin. Mix in honey, milk, oil, and egg until batter is smooth.
Pour batter into the greased cake pan. Gently press cashews into the batter for decoration.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pan, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
Very healthy and easy to make. The natural sweetness comes from the pumpkin and honey. The recipe makes a very small cake because I only had a little bit of leftover pumpkin. Created this primarily for Mom, who's watching her weight but loves cake.
