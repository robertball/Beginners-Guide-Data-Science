Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 (6.5 ounce) cans minced clams
10 drops hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢), or to taste
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until crisp. Drain, crumble and set aside.
In a medium bowl, stir cream cheese until smooth. Stir one can of clams with juice into the cream cheese. Drain the other can, reserving the juice, and stir those clams in as well. Mix in the hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and lemon juice. Stir in crumbled bacon. Cover and refrigerate dip and reserved clam juice for one hour.
Remove dip from the refrigerator, and stir in just enough of the reserved clam juice to make the dip soft enough to dip a chip into.

Description: 
Pieces of bacon really enhance this spicy clam dip, that has been a mainstay in the family for over forty years.  Best served with ridge type potato chips. Serves around ten, although two can do a number - once you start!!
