Ingredients:
8 Tilapia filets (thawed, if frozen)
lime juice
4 T honey flavored Greek yogurt
1/2 c finely chopped pecans
1/2 c shredded, sweetened coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400*.
Lightly spray bottom of 9X13 pan with cooking spray.
Lightly squirt lime juice onto one side of filets and then place lime side down into pan.
Spread each filet with a thin layer of yogurt.
Combine coconut and pecan.
Divide equally between the 8 filets and lightly press mixture down onto filets.
Bake for about 15 min or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
If desired (and for extra crispness), place under broiler for about 2-3 minutes or until topping reaches desired golden color.
