Ingredients:
1/2 battle of House Italian Dressing
1 can of Sliced Black Olives
1 large Cucumber
1 block of Monterrey Jack Cheese with Jalapeno  Peppers
1/2 of anOnion
1/2 of a Green Pepper
1 Box of Tri-Color Rotini Pasta Cooked and chilled
1 lb of Deli Ham sliced thick
About 20 Cherry Tomato

Directions:
First cook your pasta and either chill it in the fridge, or toss in the strainer under cold water until it's really cold. You will need a fairly large salad bowl. Cut up all the vegetables into small pieces, size isn't that important, cut them as small as you like. Cut the block of cheese and ham into the desired size of small chucks as well. Put it all in the bowl and pour the dressing over it, sometimes it takes more than a half a bottle, but using the amount of ingredients above it usually takes only half a bottle.
