Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
Pinch of salt
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 - 2 cups powdered sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
In a small saucepan mix together the flour, milk and salt and cook over low heat until it forms a smooth paste with no lumps.
Place in refrigerator and let cool completely.  (Cover with cling wrap to prevent a film from forming.)
With an electric mixer beat cooled flour mixture until light and fluffy.
Add the butter and beat until smooth.  Gradually add the sugar, beating well after each addition.
Stir in the vanilla.
Makes enough to frost one 9x13 inch sheet cake or one/ two layer cake.

Description: 
A smooth creamy frosting that at first sounds weird with the flour/milk paste. This is a family favorite from way back.Modified from: Mom's Buttercream Frosting
