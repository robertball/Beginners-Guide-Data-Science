Ingredients:
8 medium red or russet potatoes, cubed large
4 teaspoons garlic, minced
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup half-and-half or cream
1/4 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon steak seasoning
2 teaspoons garlic salt
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Add 1 teaspoon of the garlic to the water for flavor. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 10 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork.
Drain the potatoes, and add the butter. Mash until the butter is melted. Mix in the half-and-half, milk, steak seasoning, garlic salt and remaining minced garlic. Mix potatoes with an electric mixer until smooth.
