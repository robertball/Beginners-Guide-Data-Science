Ingredients:
1 15oz can chick peas, drained and rinsed
1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat over to 500G. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place a tea towel on the counter. Pour the chickpeas onto the tea towel and place another tea towel on top. Gently rub the chickpeas until completely dry. Carefully trasfer the chickpeas to the prepared baking sheet.
Drizzle chickpeas with oil and roll them around until coated.
Sprinkle garlic powder, salt, onion powder, and cayenne over the chickpeas and roll them around until coated.
Roast the chickpeas for 20 mins, and then shake the pan gently to roll the chickpeas around. Roast for 10 to 15 mins more, until golden and lightly charred.
Cool on the pan for 5 minutes then serve.
