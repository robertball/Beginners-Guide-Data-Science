Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound bulk Italian sausage
1 small yellow onion, cut into medium dice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
6 cups chicken broth
2 medium carrots, cut into medium dice
2 small zucchini, cut into medium dice
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style stewed tomatoes
1 (14.5 ounce) can great Northern beans
1 cup bite-size pasta, such as corkscrew or small shells
Salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups spinach - packed, washed and torn

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a soup kettle or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, stirring frequently, until browned, about 7 minutes.  Stir in onion, garlic and Italian seasoning. Cook until onions are tender, about 2 minutes.
Stir in broth, carrots, zucchini, tomatoes, beans, pasta, salt and pepper; cover and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until vegetables and pasta are tender, about 15 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in spinach. Cover and let stand until spinach wilts, about 5 minutes.
