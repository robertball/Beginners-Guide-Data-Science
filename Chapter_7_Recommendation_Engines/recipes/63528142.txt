Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 lb. cauliflower florets
1-3/4 lbs. (28 oz) undrained canned tomatoes, diced or crushed
2 cups prepared vegetable or beef bouillon
1 chopped onion
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
2 tsp. curry powder
1/8 tsp. ground cumin

Directions:
Combine ingredients in a crock pot on high heat. Cover and cook about 5 hours or until cauliflower is tender. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot or cold.
Use a potato masher to mash the cauliflower before serving. It’s like eating a spicy tomato soup with rice. Or allow the soup to cool, puree in a food processor, reheat and serve as a “creamy” soup.  Serve with grilled chicken or other “lean” option.
