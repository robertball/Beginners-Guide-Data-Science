Ingredients:
2 cups bread flour
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 egg
1/3 cup milk (whole or 2%)
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup either blueberries, chocolate chips, or raisins (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and grease a cookie sheet.
Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Rub the butter into the flour mixture until it is the consistency of wet sand.
Whisk together the egg, milk, and vanilla extract. Pour into dry ingredients and stir until combined. Fold in blueberries for blueberry scones, chocolate chips for chocolate chip scones, raisins for raisin scones, or none of the above for butter scones.
Using a spoon, divide the batter into 12 equal round portions and drop onto the cookie sheet. Bake for 25 minutes, rotating half way, or until golden brown on the bottom.
