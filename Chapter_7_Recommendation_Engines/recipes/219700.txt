Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar, packed
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats
1 cup crispy rice cereal
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup toffee baking bits
1/2 cup chopped salted pretzels
1 cup milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat  oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
In a bowl, mash the butter with the white and brown sugar until the mixture is creamy and well blended. Beat in eggs and vanilla extract. In a separate large mixing bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, salt, rolled oats, rice cereal, coconut, pecans, toffee bits, pretzel pieces, and chocolate chips. Stir the butter mixture into the dry ingredients until evenly mixed.
Drop the dough by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Using a fork, flatten the cookies.
Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms are just starting to brown, about 12 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for about 5 minutes before removing to finish cooling on racks.
