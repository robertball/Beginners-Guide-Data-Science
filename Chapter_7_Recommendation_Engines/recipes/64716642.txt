Ingredients:
4  tilapia fillets
2 tbsp butter, melted
Kosher salt and pepper, to taste
Paprika, to taste
½ cup (1 stick) butter
½ cup dry white wIne
¼ cup heavy cream
1 shallot, chopped
2 bay leaves
½ tsp black peppercorns
½ tsp dried thyme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Add the wine, shallots, bay leaves, black peppercorns, and dried thyme to a small saucepan.
Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and let boil down for about 10-15 minutes.
Place the tilapia fillets, skin side up, on a cutting board and brush with a bit of melted butter.
Season with salt and pepper, then place skin side down a baking sheet covered with foil.
Brush the other side with melted butter and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of paprika for color.
Transfer the tilapia to the preheated oven and bake for 8-10 minutes.
Whisk in the butter, about a tbsp. at a time.
After all of the butter has been added to the sauce, strain it through a fine mesh strainer.
Keep warm until ready to serve.
Remove the tilapia from the oven and plate with your favorite sides. (We love this with sautéed spinach and rice.)
Serve with the beurre blanc and enjoy!
