Ingredients:
6 - 8 pork chops
3 tablespoons mayo
4 tablespoons mustard
1/3 cup ketchup
1/4 cup worcestershire
2 teaspoons lemon juice
3 teaspoons garlic powder
3 teaspoons cayenne pepper
Sprinkle of cilantro
Sprinkle of sage
black pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Mix all ingredients into a bowl with a whisk. This will create a fairly thick sauce that is an orangish color which will smell strongly of mustard however this will cook off.
3. Dip pork chops into mixture and then place into 9x13 glass baking dish. Allow sauce to coat chops thickly. Bake for 50 minutes in oven.
4. Remove chops and pan fry for about 3 minutes on each side with some of the sauce from the baking dish.

Description: 
I made these chops for my family and they could not believe I had made the recipe up from the condiments in the fridge. They are spicy, zingy and delicious. The entire family could not stop raving and my nine year old called them marvelous.
