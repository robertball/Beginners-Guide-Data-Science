Ingredients:
8 cups warm water
8 cups brewed French-roast coffee
1 cup kosher salt
1 (1 ounce) package dry French onion soup mix
1 onion, diced
1/4 cup minced garlic
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 (6 pound) standing beef rib roast
2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste
2 teaspoons onion powder, or more to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir warm water, coffee, kosher salt, onion soup mix, onion, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce in a 16-quart stock pot until salt and onion soup mix has dissolved. Lay roast in the brine and cover pot; refrigerate at least 8 hours. Turn roast over at least twice during brining.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Remove roast from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Place roast on a rack in a roasting pan with the fat side down; sprinkle with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Flip roast and season other side the same way. Let roast stand until it reaches room temperature, about 1 hour.
Place roast into preheated oven and bake for 1 hour.
Turn off heat and leave meat in the hot oven, without opening oven door, for 3 hours. Turn oven back on and set heat for 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Let roast reheat until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the roast reads 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare, 30 to 40 minutes.
