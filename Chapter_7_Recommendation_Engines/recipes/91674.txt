3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups crisp rice cereal
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 cup coconut
3/4 cup sesame seeds
3/4 cup sunflower seeds

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the cocoa powder, rice cereal, oats, coconut, and sesame seeds. Set aside.
In a saucepan over medium heat, stir together the peanut butter, brown sugar, honey, and vanilla. Cook and stir until melted and loose. Pour over the cereal mixture, and stir to coat evenly. Press lightly into a buttered 9x13 inch baking dish. Cool for about 1 hour to firm, then cut into squares.

Description: 
This is an easy, healthy, but yummy, no-bake snack that disappears quickly whenever I take it along. You can easily substitute other ingredients for the cereal part such as ground or chopped nuts, flax seeds, etc. If you don't have enough of one thing, just add more of another.
