1/4 cup chopped almonds
Salad:
1 head cabbage, shredded
3 carrots, shredded
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1/2 red onion, chopped
Dressing:
1/3 cup olive oil
1/4 cup cider vinegar
2 tablespoons peanut butter, slightly melted
2 tablespoons maple syrup
2 tablespoons tamari (gluten-free soy sauce)
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup crispy chow mein noodles, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread almonds onto a baking sheet.
Bake almonds in the preheated oven until toasted and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven and cool almonds.
Combine cabbage, carrots, red bell pepper, and red onion in a large bowl.
Whisk olive oil, vinegar, peanut butter, maple syrup, tamari, ginger, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth; pour over cabbage mixture and toss to coat. Refrigerate salad until chilled and flavors blend, about 2 hours.
