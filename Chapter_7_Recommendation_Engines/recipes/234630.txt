2 pounds bacon, cut in half lengthwise
2 (3 ounce) packages thin breadsticks (such as AlessiÂ®)

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil or parchment paper and spray with cooking spray.
Wrap 1 bacon strip around each breadstick, leaving about 1 inch uncovered on each end. Place wrapped breadsticks on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over breadsticks.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp and browned, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool breadsticks on a piece of parchment paper or waxed paper sprayed with cooking spray.
