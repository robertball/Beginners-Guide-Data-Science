Ingredients:
1 large boneless chicken breast
2-3 cups chopped broccoli
1 T. sesame seeds
1 med. onion
1-3 cloves garlic, to taste
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/8 cup flour or cornstarch
1 tsp ginger
1/4 tsp. black pepper
4 T. olive or sesame oil

Directions:
Dice chicken and slice thin. Chicken will be easiest to cut while frozen.
Dice onion and mince garlic; saute in 2 T. oil until onions are translucent and soft.
Add in sesame seeds and ginger, then slowly add soy sauce and remaining 2 T. oil over low flame.
Add chicken. When chicken begins to brown, add broccoli.
Simmer, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, then slowly add flour/cornstarch until gravy thickens.
Serve over brown rice.
