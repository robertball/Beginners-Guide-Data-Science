Ingredients:
12 thick slices day-old, white bread
4 eggs
2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into pats and chilled
1 1/4 cup heavy cream
1 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
powdered sugar, garnish

Directions:
Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with non-stick spray and set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine brown sugar with 1 teaspoon cinnamon and nutmeg. Mix well.
Cut bread slices into 1 1/2-inch strips and lay down a layer of bread strips inside loaf pan.
Sprinkle 1/3 of brown sugar mixture over the layer of bread, then add a layer of butter pats over the sugar, using 1/3 third of the butter.
Repeat with another 2 layers of bread, sugar and butter. Press down on bread with your hand to make sure it’s compacted.
In a large bowl, beat together the eggs, heavy cream, vanilla and remaining cinnamon.
Pour batter slowly over the loaf, making sure to allow time for the bread to absorb all the liquid. Pay attention to the corners of the pan.
Cover pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 325º F, remove plastic wrap, cover pan with aluminum foil, and bake (on a rimmed baking sheet) for 1 hour.
Uncover and bake for another 20-25 minutes.
Remove from oven and let rest 10 minutes, then place serving plate face down on top of loaf pan and invert loaf.
Slice and serve, garnished with powdered sugar.
