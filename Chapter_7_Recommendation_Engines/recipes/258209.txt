Ingredients:
6 cloves garlic, peeled
4 teaspoons dill seed
2 teaspoons black peppercorns
3 pounds kirby cucumbers (or other unwaxed, small-seeded 4- to 5-inch pickling cucumbers)
2 1/4 cups apple cider vinegar
2 1/4 cups water
6 3/4 teaspoons pickling salt

Directions:
Divide garlic, dill, and peppercorns between 2 clean quart jars. Wash cucumbers and trim away blossom ends. Cut each into 6 to 8 spears. Pack spears vertically and snugly into jars.
Stir together vinegar, water, and salt in a small nonreactive pot, and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir and reduce heat, if necessary, until salt dissolves. Remove from heat. Pour or ladle hot brine into jars, covering cucumbers and leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Tap jars gently to remove any air bubbles. Add more brine if necessary to leave 1/2 inch headspace. Wipe rims clean with a damp paper towel.
Let cool completely to room temperature, about 1 hour. Apply clean lids. Refrigerate at least 48 hours before eating for best flavor. (Flavor improves with time.) Store in refrigerator up to 1 month.
