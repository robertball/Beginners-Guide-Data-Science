Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package angel hair pasta
1/3 cup salted butter
1/3 cup olive oil
1 jalapeno pepper, sliced
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
3/4 cup dry white wine
salt and ground black pepper to taste
24 peeled and deveined medium shrimp
1 (4 ounce) jar capers
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes; drain.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir olive oil, jalapeno pepper, and red pepper flakes into the melted butter; cook until the flavors of the peppers infuse into the butter mixture, about 10 minutes. Remove and discard the jalapeno slices if desired; they will make this dish really hot if you leave them in. Stir white wine into the butter mixture; cook another 5 minutes. Add shrimp and capers. Increase heat to medium; cook and stir the shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes. Add drained pasta to the shrimp mixture; toss to coat. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
I don't know where I had this. It must have been a restaurant, and I couldn't find any recipes that are close to what I remember. So this is my take on it. I make this for my wife and I. She really loves it.
