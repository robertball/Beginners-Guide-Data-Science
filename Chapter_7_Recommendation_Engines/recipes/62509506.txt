Ingredients:
Dough:
3 & 1/3 cups crushed cookies (vanilla wafers, sugar cookies, lady fingers, be creative)
2 tablespoons water
1 & 3/4 cups confectioner's sugar
1/3 cup butter
4 tablespoons rum (substitute vanilla, almond extract, according to taste)
3 tablespoons powdered cocoa
12 vanilla wafers or small round sugar cookies to seal the bottoms of the cookies
Filling:
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons rum (substitute with vanilla, almond extract or whatever you want the filling to taste like)
1 tablespoon sweetened condensed milk
1 egg yolk
3/4 cup confectioner's sugar

Directions:
Crush cookies.
Mix in the remaining ingredients and work into a dough until smooth.
Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour, or until firm. In the meantime, whip together the ingredients for the filling.
Once set, divide the dough into uniform balls (judge how big to make the balls according to the size of your mould).
Coat the mould in butter then cocoa (or sugar, depending on the effect you want). Roll the balls in cocoa (or sugar).
Push the dough into the mould and make a hollow in the cookie.
Use a pastry bag (or ziploc with a hole in the corner) to fill the cookies and stick a small cookie on the bottom to cover it. Then carefully remove from the mould.
Frost with confectioner's sugar, cocoa, ganache, or decorate as you wish.
Store beehives in a cool place. Make 2-3 days in advance to enhance the flavour.
