Ingredients:
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
3/4 teaspoon ground mace
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
5 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 1/4-inch-thick strips

Directions:
Place the yogurt, water, lemon juice, vinegar, olive oil, onion, and garlic into a large mixing bowl. Whisk in the salt, black pepper, cumin, nutmeg, clove, mace, and cayenne pepper until evenly blended. Mix in the lamb strips to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator 12 to 24 hours (the longer the better).
Heat a large skillet over high heat. Cook the lamb strips in a single layer in batches until the fat melts and the meat has browned and is no longer pink on the inside, about 5 minutes, turning occasionally.

Description: 
This is a wonderful Middle Eastern dish that I was introduced to by a friend of mine from Lebanon. This recipe yields an absolutely amazing tasting and tender final product. Shawarma can be used in pitas, be put on fattoush, on hommus, or eaten plain.
