Ingredients:
1/2 cup coconut spread
1 cup creamy peanut butter
4 cups confectioners' sugar
1/3 cup Rich's non-dairy cream

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat butter and peanut butter until light and fluffy. Slowly beat in 1/2 of  the confectioner's sugar. Mix in 1/4 cup of the cream. Beat in the remaining confectioners' sugar. If necessary, add a little more cream or milk until the frosting reaches a good spreading consistency. Makes enough to frost one 2 layer 9 inch cake or one 9x13 inch cake.

Description: 
If you like peanut butter you'll love this frosting - it's a heavier butter-cream consistancy. Nothing light and fluffy here!Modified from: Peanut Butter Frosting
