Ingredients:
1 egg
3 tbsp dark brown sugar
4 tbsp milk
1 (or 2) ripe bananas
4 tbsp oil
1 tsp vanilla
1 c. wholewheat flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
pinch of salt
1 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 c. coconut
3/4 cup walnuts
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 and line muffin trays (I get more than 24).
Put all the ingredients, except the walnuts and chocolate chip in a food processor and process until all is mixed.
Then add walnuts and chocolate chips and process briefly, just until walnuts are chopped up and chips are added throughout.  Spoon mixture into muffin cups 3/4 to the top.

Description: 
The recipe calls for one, but I also use 2 bananas. Very healthy.  Also very easy.  I found the recipe somewhere online looking for a 1 banana muffin and changed it to make it my own.  My family loves these.  Especially my grandkids.
