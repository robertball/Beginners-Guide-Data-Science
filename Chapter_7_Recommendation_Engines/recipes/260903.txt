Ingredients:
1 cup chopped walnuts
2 (1 pound) loaves frozen bread dough, thawed
1 cup brown sugar
1 (5.1 ounce) package non-instant vanilla pudding mix
1/2 cup butter
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons milk
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)

Directions:
Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan and sprinkle the bottom with walnuts. Tear thawed dough into pieces and place into the pan.
Combine brown sugar, pudding mix, butter, 3 teaspoons cinnamon, and milk in a saucepan. Cook over low heat until dissolved, 6 to 8 minutes. Pour over the dough. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Cover rolls with a clean kitchen towel and let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
Allow to cool, about 5 minutes. Flip rolls out of pan and serve warm.
