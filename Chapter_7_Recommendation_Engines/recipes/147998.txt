Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups canned pumpkin
2 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
4 beaten eggs
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup miniature chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8x4 inch loaf pans.
Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a bowl.
In another bowl, mash the pumpkin, and stir in the sugar, oil, and eggs. Pour the flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture, and stir lightly to combine. Use a rubber spatula to fold the pecans and chocolate chips into the batter. Gently run the spatula through the center of the bowl, then around the sides of the bowl, repeating until fully incorporated.
Fill the prepared loaf pans about 3/4 full, and bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until the bread has risen, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
Every time I make this, it goes so quickly! It's moist, tender, and flavorful. I was surprised how much I like this, and I don't even like chocolate. It can be made into muffins, loaves, or even a Bundt cake.
