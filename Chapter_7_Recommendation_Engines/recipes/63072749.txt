Description: 
Parsnips and green apples come together for a healthy dessert. Great for those who are watching calories and fat and trying to eat more fruits and veggies. If you're really health conscious, you can omit the butter and add water to the pan in its place. Cook longer for desired texture; cook less or not at all for a health RAW dessert.
