Ingredients:
For the tea:
2 cups whole milk
2 cups water
1/4 cup sugar
4 black tea teabags
;
For the syrup:
1 cup water
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
;
For the boba:
4 cups water
1/2 cup quick-cook tapioca boba

Directions:
Mix milk and water in a small pot and heat while stirring occasionally until hot, but not boiling. Add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Add the teabags and steep until color changes to a milky brown and the aroma of the tea can be smelled over the milk. Pour into a pitcher and set aside to cool.
Boil 1 cup of water. Pour into a small bowl and add the white and brown sugars. Stir until completely dissolved.
Bring 4 or more cups of water to a boil in a small pot. Add the boba and let boil for 7 minutes. Turn off heat and let sit for another 7 minutes, until soft and chewy, then drain and place boba into syrup. Let sit in syrup for at least fifteen minutes.
Spoon the boba into glasses or cups, then add ice and pour in cooled tea. Serve with wide boba straws.

Description: 
A recipe I came up with after some research and experimentation. Large amounts of tea can be made beforehand, and the boba cooks so quickly that any bubble tea cravings can be easily satisfied.
