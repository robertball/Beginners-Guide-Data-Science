Ingredients:
vegetable oil for frying
2 cups buttermilk
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 tablespoon salt
1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper
12 large fresh scallops

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pour buttermilk into a bowl. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl.
Immerse 4 or 5 scallops in the bowl of buttermilk. Transfer to the flour mixture; roll around until thickly coated.
Lower scallops gently into the hot oil. Cook until golden and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining scallops.

Description: 
I experimented with some ways to cook scallops one night with my family. This was everyone's favorite and it has become a regular dish at our family fry nights. If serving as a main dish, make twice as many servings as people (about 8 scallops per person).
