Title:
Chicken Thighs Stuffed with Spinach and Sun Dried Tomatoes Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken thighs
1 1/2 Cups frozen spinach, thawed and warmed
1/8 Cup sun-dried tomatoes (marinated in oil)
1/4 Cup finely shredded mozzarella cheese (I use lowfat)
2 Tbsp shredded fresh Parmesan cheese
salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste
1 Tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 and defrost spinach in the microwave, drain.  Pound the chicken inside a gallon-sized Ziploc bag until even in thickness, about 1/4 inch thick. I use a heavy glass bottle to pound mine. Pat dry with a paper towel and set aside.
Combine spinach, tomatoes, cheeses and seasonings in a bowl. Spinach should be warm enough to melt the cheeses and hold all the ingredients together. Heat oil in a pan.
Divide the mixture between the thighs, and roll, securing with toothpicks. Place each roll seam-side down in the pan and brown 3-4 minutes on each side.
Transfer chicken into the oven for 20-25 minutes to finish cooking.  Serve with pasta or roasted potatoes.
