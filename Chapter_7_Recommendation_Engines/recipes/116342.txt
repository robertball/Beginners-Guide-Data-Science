Ingredients:
2 (3/4 inch thick) boneless pork loin chops
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
3/4 cup water
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 small tart green apple, cored and chopped
2 tablespoons raisins
1 1/2 cups crushed chicken stuffing mix
2/3 cup condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted

Directions:
In a skillet, brown meat in oil for about 5 minutes on each side. In a saucepan, combine the water, butter, apple and raisins; bring to a boil. Stir in stuffing mix. Remove from the heat; cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
Transfer to a greased shallow 1-qt. baking dish. Top with meat. Spoon soup over meat and stuffing. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a meat thermometer inserted into pork chops reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

I've loved this recipe since the first time I tried it. The apples and raisins give a nice homey flavor to the stuffing.
