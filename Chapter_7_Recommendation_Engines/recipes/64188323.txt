Ingredients:
2 2/3 c cream, 1/2 and 1/2-or some milk
5 Tbs butter
1 lb. fettuccine
1 c (2 oz.) fresh grated Parmesan
ground black pepper
pinch of nutmeg

Directions:
Bring 4 qts water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add 1 Tbs salt and the pasta to the water. Stir to separate pasta. Cook pasta until almost al dente. Combine 1 2/3 c of the half and half and the butter in a saute pan large enough to accommodate the cooked pasta. Heat over low until the butter is melted and the cream comes to a bare simmer. Turn the heat off and set aside. (I found that this took the length of the time it took the pasta to cook, so I never turned it off and set it aside).
Drain cooked pasta and add it to the saute pan. Add the remaining 1/2 c of cream, Parmesan, pepper, and nutmeg. Cook on very low heat, tossing to combine the ingredients, until sauce is slightly thick, 1-2 minutes. Serve immediately in heated pasta bowls.
