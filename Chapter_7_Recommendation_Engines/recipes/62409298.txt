Ingredients:
3 or 4 filets of Tilapia (or other favorite white fish)
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup shredded cheese (I used cheddar. I've made it before with Parmesan and it was amazing. If I was planning a trip to the store specifically to get ingredients for this dish I would pick Parmesan.)
Juice of 2 lemons
4 chopped garlic cloves
--pinch each of salt and black pepper

Directions:
Mix all ingredients (except for the fish. definitely not the fish.) in a bowl
Lay out a piece of foil
Rub sauce mixture on both sides of fish
Fold foil over and make a little packet for the fish
Put all the packets into the crockpot
Cook on LOW for 2-4 hours; fish should flake easily with a fork. PLEASE take care when taking the packet out of the crockpot and when opening it. It will be hot.
