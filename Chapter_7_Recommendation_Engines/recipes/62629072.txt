Ingredients:
3/4 cup milk, warmed
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 tsp salt
3/8 cup sugar
3 eggs, lightly beaten
juice and zest of 1 lemon
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp cardamom
1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
2 1/4 tsps yeast
4 tsps vital gluten
4 cups flour
1 cup golden raisins, soaked in hot water if not plump and juicy

Directions:
In the pan of the bread machine add the milk, butter, salt, sugar, eggs, lemon juice, lemon zest and vanilla.
Add the flour, vital gluten and yeast.
Start the dough cycle, when the paddles start mixing, check the dough to make sure it is not too dry or too wet, add flour or milk if needed.
Once dough cycle is completed, place dough on a lightly floured surface and knead in drained and dried raisins.
Traditionally Paska is baked in 1 lb coffee cans, the dough can be divided in half and each baked in a coffee can or two 9x5 loaf pan or I use two of my 6 cup casserole dishes or I use my pot pie pans and make 8 small loaves to give away.
Whichever style of pan you use make sure it is greased and allow the covered dough to rise for 1 hour in a warm, draft free spot.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Bake for 15 minutes, cover lightly with foil to stop over browning then bake for another 15 minutes.
Allow to cool for 10 minutes in the pans before gently removing and finish cooling on a wire rack.
Paska bread can be brushed with melted butter or brushed with a vanilla glaze (1 1/2 cups icing sugar and 1/4 cup milk) and decorated with sprinkles, allow to dry before slicing.
