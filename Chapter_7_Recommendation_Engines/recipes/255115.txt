Ingredients:
1 pound mild Hatch chile peppers - halved, stemmed, and seeded
1 pound mild breakfast sausage
1/2 pound bacon, sliced into small strips
1 large onion, diced
2 1/4 cups water
1 1/2 cups uncooked jasmine rice

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; arrange chile peppers cut-side down on top.
Roast under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes.
Place blackened peppers into a bowl and seal tightly with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins. Chop flesh.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and bacon; cook and stir until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain excess grease. Add onion; cook and stir until golden, 3 to 5 minutes.
Pour water into the skillet; bring to a boil. Add rice. Reduce heat; simmer until water is absorbed and rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Fold in chopped peppers before serving.
