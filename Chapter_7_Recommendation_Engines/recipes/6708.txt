4 cups whole bran cereal
2 cups boiling water
1 cup shortening
3 cups white sugar
4 eggs
4 cups buttermilk
5 cups all-purpose flour
5 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Mix cereal and boiling water together in a metal bowl, and allow to cool.
Cream shortening, sugar, and eggs in a large bowl.  Add buttermilk and cooled cereal mixture. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until flour is moistened.  Batter should be lumpy.  Put batter into a one gallon wide mouth jar.  When using mix, use a ladle to get batter out of the jar; don't mix or stir.
When ready to use, spoon batter into muffin tins.  Bake at 375 degrees F (195 degrees C) for approximately 15 minutes.
