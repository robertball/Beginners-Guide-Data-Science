Description: 
This dish is inspired by the Chinese noodle dish  dandanmian which is known as tantanmen in Japanese. Many ramen shops in Japan serve tantan ramen and it's one of the spicy options for a ramen. For this recipe, I've used the same ground meat for tantan ramen on top of pasta noodles and it was just as great as the ramen.
