Ingredients:
butter-flavored cooking spray
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup cold butter
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 cups sliced fresh strawberries
1 cup fresh blueberries
1 kiwi, peeled and sliced
1 cup unsweetened pineapple juice
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a 12-inch round pizza pan with butter-flavored cooking spray.
Combine flour and confectioners' sugar in a bowl. Cut in butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press into prepared pizza pan to make a crust.
Bake in preheated oven until very lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
Beat cream cheese, 1/3 cup white sugar, and almond extract until smooth; spread over completely cooled crust. Arrange strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi decoratively over cream cheese mixture.
Mix pineapple juice, 1/2 cup white sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice in a saucepan until smooth; bring to a boil. Cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Cool slightly and drizzle over fruit. Refrigerate until chilled.

Description: 
Almond extract makes all the difference in this updated version of the traditional fruit pizza. Kiwi makes the topping completely fresh and adds beautiful color. Use low-fat cream cheese for a slightly lighter version. Any clear juice (apple, pear, peach, etc.) may be substituted for the pineapple.
