Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Olive Oil
1 Turkey Neck
4 tablespoons Unsalted Butter
1 cup Onion (medium dice)
1/2 cup Celery (medium dice)
1/2 cup Carrot (medium dice)
1 small bunch Fresh Thyme
1 Bay Leaf
4 tablespoons Flour
4 cups Turkey Stock
Drippings from Roast Turkey

Directions:
Place a cast iron stock pot over medium high heat. When the pan is hot, add the olive oil along with the turkey neck. Brown the neck on all sides, about 5 minutes, remove to a plate, and then add the butter to the pan.
When the butter has melted add the onion, celery, carrot, thyme and bay leaf with a large pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes, until all of the vegetables are aromatic and slightly caramelized.
Next stir in the flour to coat the vegetables and absorb the butter. Add the turkey neck back to the pan. Whisk in the turkey stock and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally for 45 minutes.
After 45 minutes, whisk in any pan drippings from roasting your turkey, and give the gravy a taste, adding more seasoning if necessary. Strain through a fine mesh strainer and keep warm.
