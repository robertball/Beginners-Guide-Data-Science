Ingredients:
3 pounds bone-in chicken breast halves, skin removed
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 large onion, cut in half and sliced
1 small red pepper, cut into 2-inch long strips
1 small green pepper, cut into 2-inch long strips
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup white wine
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Healthy Request® Condensed Golden Mushroom Soup
3 cups hot cooked regular brown rice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Season the chicken with the salt and black pepper.
Heat the oil in a 6-quart saucepot over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and cook for 6 minutes or until browned on both sides.  Remove the chicken from the saucepot.
Reduce the heat to medium.  Add the onion and pepper strips to the saucepot and cook for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally.  Add the garlic and cook and stir for 30 seconds.
Increase the heat to medium-high.  Add the wine to the saucepot and heat to a boil, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the saucepot.  Cook for 1 minute or until the wine is reduced by half.
Stir in the tomatoes and soup.  Return the chicken to the saucepot and heat to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low.  Cover and cook for 25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.  Serve the chicken and sauce over the rice.  Sprinkle with the parsley.
