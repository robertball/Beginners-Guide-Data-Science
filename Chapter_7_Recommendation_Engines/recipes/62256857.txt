Place the rice and water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and cook 20 minutes. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the beef and onion until evenly browned.
Remove and discard the tops, seeds, and membranes of the bell peppers. Immerse peppers into gently boling water for 3 minutes. remove and invert on paper towl to drain. Arrange peppers in a greased baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward. (Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary so that they will stand upright.)
