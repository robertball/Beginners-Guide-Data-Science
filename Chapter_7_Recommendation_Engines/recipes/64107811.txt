Ingredients:
4 cups kale, washed and stems removed
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoon of chinese chilli oil

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place the kale into a large mixing bowl, and drizzle with the olive oil. Toss until evenly coated, then sprinkle with the chili powder and kosher salt, and toss again. Spread the seasoned kale onto a baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, then stir the kale, and continue roasting until the edges become brown and a little crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This recipe was adapted from one of my favorite methods of preparing broccoli and cauliflower - roasting at high heat with the bold flavor of chili powder. The result with kale is a little outrageous - fiery flavor with a unique crispy texture!Modified from: Chili-Roasted Kale
