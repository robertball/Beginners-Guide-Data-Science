Ingredients:
1 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream (yogurt)
1/2 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons grated onion
1/2 teaspoon ground dry mustard
4 drops hot sauce/tabasco
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons heavy cream (omit)
1-2 teaspoons horseradish (prepared, grated-like Beavers extra hot)
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, ketchup, onion, mustard, hot sauce, Worcestershire, and horseradish until smooth.
Use as spread for Reuben sandwiches.
To make sandwiches you need: rye bread, veggie deli "meat" slices (like  roasted turkey or Field Roast tomato loaf), sharp white cheddar, and sauerkraut.  Toast bread, spread Russian dressing, layer veggie "meat" slices on both sides of bread, add slices of cheddar.  Put back in toaster oven to melt cheese.  Close up sandwich with sauerkraut in between.  Yum!
