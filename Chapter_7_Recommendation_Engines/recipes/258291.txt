Description: 
This is the recipe for the authentic pesto from Sicily. It combines a traditional pesto with Sicilian delights: ricotta cheese and tomatoes. It has a light and refreshing flavor. Enjoy it with tubular pasta so the pesto finds its way inside the tubes for a burst of Sicilian flavor with every bite! Seeding the tomatoes first allows the mixture to be thicker so it sticks better to the pasta.
