Ingredients:
4 tsp minced fresh gingerroot
1 garlic clove, minced
1 Tbl canola oil
1/2 cup sherry or chicken broth
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 Tbl sesame seeds
1 tsp grated orange peel
3/4 tsp hot pepper sauce
4 bone-in pork loin chop (6 ounces each)
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 Tbl water

Directions:
In a large saucepan, cook ginger and garlic in oil for 1 minute; remove from the heat. Stir in the sherry or broth, honey, soy sauce, sesame seeds, orange peel and hot pepper sauce. Pour 1/2 cup into a small bowl; set aside. Pour remaining marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add pork chops. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine cornstarch and water until smooth; add reserved marinade. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until thickened.
Drain and discard marinade from pork. Using long-handled tongs, moisten a paper towel with cooking oil and lightly coat the grill rack. Grill chops, covered, over medium heat for 4-5 minutes on each side; basting occasionally with sauce or until a thermometer reads 145Â°. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with remaining sauce.

Description: 
Basting chops with this tangy sauce makes them extremely tender and savory. My family requests this dish for the terrific taste. I make it for them often because it's on the lighter side.
