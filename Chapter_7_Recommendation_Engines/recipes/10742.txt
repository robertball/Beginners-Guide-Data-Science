Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
3/4 cup corn syrup
1 1/2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1 cup shortening

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease 2 baking sheets.
Combine flour, baking soda, and spices.  In a large bowl, cream shortening and sugar.  Beat in the egg.  Beat in the corn syrup and cider vinegar.  Gradually blend in the dry ingredients.
On a floured surface, roll out dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch.  Using a 1 1/2 inch round cookie cutter, cut dough into rounds and place 1 1/2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets.  Bake for 8-12 minutes--until firm to the touch.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
A Welsh friend passed this recipe on to me.  Vinegar adds a very faintly sour taste that enhances this cookie.
