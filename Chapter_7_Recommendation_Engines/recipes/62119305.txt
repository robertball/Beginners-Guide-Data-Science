Chop onion.  Cook ground beef.  Drain. Add onion, salt, and pepper. Cook apprx. 5 minutes (until onions become transparent).  Prepare rice according to directions on box/bag.  While it's cooking, put drained tomatoes, drained corn,  cream of mushroom, chilies, ground beef, and salsa in a bowl and mix.  (If using fresh chilies, peel and chop before adding.)
when rice is finished, add to the mixture.  Add 1 Cup of cheese.  Mix.  Spoon into 9X13 in baking dish.  Cover with remaining cheese and crushed Ritz crackers.  Bake un covered for 40min.  Serve hot.  *I reccomend serving in a tortilla (like a burrito) or to stuff bell peppers.
