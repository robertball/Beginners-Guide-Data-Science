Ingredients:
1+1/2	        large yellow onions, peeled and diced
4—6 long ribs	celery, diced
2 pats	        butter (or 1 tbsp olive oil)
.
12-oz pkg	unseasoned bread cubes w/flavor packet
1/2 tsp	        salt
1 can	        whole berry cranberry sauce
1 stick	        butter, melted
1/2 c*	        chicken broth
.
1@ 6+1/2-7+1/2 lb  bone-in turkey breast w/ pop-up timer
1/2 tsp	           salt

Directions:
Melt the 2 pats of butter in a large sauté pan and sauté the onions and celery until the onions are translucent; set aside to cool slightly.
Place a slow cooker plastic liner bag in a 6-quart slow cooker.
Place about 2/3 of the dressing cubes in the liner bag; add about 2/3 of the seasoning packet (save remaining cubes and seasoning for another use).
Gently stir in the 1/2 teasponn of salt, cranberry sauce, melted butter, onion-celery mixture and chicken broth until well mixed, taking care not to pierce the plastic bag.
Rinse the breast and cut off any excess skin, but leave the skin covering the breast; pat it dry; season it with salt.
Move the dressing cubes to the sides of the cooker and place the turkey breast in the center so that the pop-up timer is visible; squish the breast down if it makes the lid ride up.  If that doesn’t work, seal the cooker with foil and place the lid on top of it.
Cook on high for 4 to 4+1/2 hours or until the pop-up timer pops up; if you are not ready to serve when it is done, turn the cooker to warm and leave the lid on.
When ready to serve, place the breast on a cutting board and let it set up for 10 minutes before carving; discard skin.
If the dressing has too much liquid, spoon it into an ovenproof pan with a slotted spoon and bake it uncovered for 15 or 20 minutes to dry it out.

Description: 
My cranky, old 1934 oven is very small and slow, so I devised this method of cooking holiday meals.  The slow cooker keeps the turkey breast moist, and cooking the dressing in the same cooker gives it a wonderful flavor.
