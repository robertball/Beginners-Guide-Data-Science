Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups peanut butter
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup shortening
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup white sugar, or to taste
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine peanut butter, 1 cup white sugar, brown sugar, butter, and shortening in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Stir in vanilla extract. Beat in eggs.
Sift flour, cream of tartar, 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Gradually add to the egg mixture and mix well.
Mix 1/4 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon together in a shallow bowl. Roll dough into 1-inch balls, roll in cinnamon-sugar, and place on a baking sheet. Flatten each ball slightly with the bottom of a drinking glass, or by making a criss-cross pattern with the tines of a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly browned, about 8 minutes. Do not overbake. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
