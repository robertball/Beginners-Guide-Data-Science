Ingredients:
1 (18 ounce) package mini bagels, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried basil
2/3 cup olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Mix oregano, garlic powder, and basil in a small bowl. Pour olive oil into a separate bowl. Brush bagel slices with olive oil on both sides; wipe any excess oil from pieces using a paper towel. Sprinkle a small amount of oregano mixture onto each bagel piece. Arrange seasoned bagel slices onto a cooking rack.
Bake in the preheated oven until bagel chips are browned and crisp, about 1 hour. Let cool 10 minutes.
