Ingredients:
olive oil as needed
4 golden beets, scrubbed
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 shallots, minced
2 yellow carrots, peeled and chopped
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken broth
1 bulb fennel, chopped, fronds reserved
1 bunch fresh dill, chopped
4 ounces crumbled goat cheese
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Brush 2 pieces of aluminum foil with olive oil and place 2 beets onto each. Wrap and place on a baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until softened, about 1 hour.
Remove beets from the oven and let cool until safe to handle, 15 to 30 minutes. Peel and chop cooled beets.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Cook shallots and carrots in the hot oil for 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and continue to cook and stir for 5 minutes more.
Pour vegetable mixture into a food processor, working in batches, and puree until smooth. Add beets and process.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook fennel and dill in the hot oil for 7 to 10 minutes. Set aside.
Pour pureed mixture into a pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and mix in goat cheese; add heavy cream and continue stirring until mixture is even and light yellow in color. Stir in sauteed fennel and dill and heat through, about 5 minutes. Pour into serving bowls and sprinkle with reserved fennel fronds.

Description: 
I wanted to do a yellow soup when I made this recipe. My food processor was too small, so I tried using an immersion blender, but that didn't end well. So I just pureed it in batches. It turned out to be really good, it was very thick and hearty.
