Ingredients:
2 egg whites
1 cup white sugar
1 pinch salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pound pecan halves
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Beat egg whites until soft peaks begin to form.  Add sugar, salt and vanilla; beat until stiff peaks form and turn glossy.  Fold in nuts and coat well with the egg white mixture.
Melt butter in a 9x13 inch baking pan by placing pan in the oven.  Evenly spread coated nuts over melted butter in pan.
Bake for 30 minutes, stirring and turning nuts about every 8 minutes, or until butter no longer remains in pan.  Place hot nuts on foil and allow to cool.  May be stored in an airtight container for several weeks!

Description: 
I make these wonderful sweet nuts using pecans every year for Christmas. They are a true delight, especially if you are a lover of nuts. If pecans aren't your forte, substitute walnuts. Happy Holidays!
