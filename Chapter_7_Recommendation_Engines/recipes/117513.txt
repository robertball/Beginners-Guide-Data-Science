Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package German chocolate cake mix
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
4 eggs, lightly beaten
FROSTING:
1 cup sugar
1 cup evaporated milk
1/2 cup butter, cubed
3 egg yolks, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups flaked coconut
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Prepare cake batter according to package directions; set aside.  In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth.  Add eggs; beat on low speed just until combined.
Pour half of the cake batter into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish.  Gently pour cream cheese mixture over batter.  Gently spoon remaining batter over top; spread to edge of pan.
Bake at 325 degrees F for 70-75 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour.
For frosting, combine sugar, milk, butter and egg yolks in a heavy saucepan.  Cool and stir over medium-low heat until thickened and a thermometer reads 160 degrees F.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in vanilla; fold in coconut and pecans.  Cool until frosting reaches spreading consistency.  Frost cooled cake.  Refrigerate leftovers.
