Ingredients:
2 1/2 (16 ounce) packages frozen whole-kernel corn, thawed
3/4 light cream
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Combine corn, cream and salt in a large stockpot or Dutch oven. Stir together the sugar and cornstarch to prevent lumps, then stir them into the corn. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer until thick, about 20 minutes. The longer it cooks, the thicker it will be.
