Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup shortening
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 cups dried figs
3/4 cup golden raisins
1/4 cup slivered almonds
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup hot water
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, 1/3 cup sugar and baking powder. Cut in shortening and butter until mixture resembles small peas. Stir in the milk and egg until the dough comes together. Divide dough into two pieces, wrap and refrigerate for about 2 hours or until easy to handle.
In a food processor or blender, grind the figs, raisins and almonds until they are coarsely chopped. In a medium bowl, stir together the 1/4 cup of sugar, hot water, cinnamon and pepper. Stir in the fruit mixture, cover and set aside until the dough is ready.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece of the dough out to a 12 inch square. Cut each piece into 12 3x4 inch rectangles. Using a heaping tablespoon of filling for each rectangle, spread filling along one of the short sides of the rectangle. Roll up from that side. Place rolls, seam side down, on an ungreased cookie sheet. Curve each roll slightly. Snip outer edge of the curve three times.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Glaze with your favorite confectioners' glaze.
