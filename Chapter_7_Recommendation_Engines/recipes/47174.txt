Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 large carrots, peeled and diced
1 medium head cabbage, chopped
1/2 head cauliflower, chopped
2 leeks, sliced
6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
4 teaspoons tomato paste
1 quart water
1/4 cup milk or light cream
1 tablespoon butter
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add carrot, cabbage, cauliflower and leeks. Cook, stirring constantly, for a few minutes until cabbage wilts. Stir in the garlic and tomato paste, and continue to cook for another minute or two, stirring constantly to prevent the garlic from burning. Stir in 2 cups of water, then cover and simmer for 10 minutes.
Pour in the diced tomatoes and the remaining 2 cups of water, and return to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Reserve 2 cups of the liquid, and puree the remaining soup in a blender or food processor. Return the blended mixture to the reserved liquid, and stir in milk and butter. Return to a boil, and cook for 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.
