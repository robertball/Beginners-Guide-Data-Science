Description: 
Hoisin sauce has an interesting story behind it. I probably should have said confusing rather than interesting. According to my extensive research (5 minutes on Wikipedia), 'hoisin' is a romanticisation of the Cantonese word for seafood. What? Why? It's traditionally served with pork, isn't it?
