Ingredients:
1 Reynolds KITCHENS速 Slow Cooker Liner
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 medium green bell peppers, chopped
2 small onions, chopped
2 (15 ounce) cans red kidney beans, undrained
2 (1.25 ounce) packages chili seasoning mix
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes and green chiles
Shredded cheese (optional)
Sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Line a 5 to 6-quart slow cooker with a Reynolds KITCHENS速 Slow Cooker Liner. Fit liner snugly against bottom and sides of bowl; pull top of liner over rim. Set aside.
Brown ground beef, bell peppers, and onions in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until beef is no longer pink. Drain well.
Spoon beef mixture into the lined slow cooker. Add beans, seasoning mix, tomato sauce, and diced tomatoes and green chilies to beef mixture; stir gently with wooden or plastic spoon.
Cover and cook 6 to 7 hours on Low or 3 to 3 1/2 hours on High, until hot and bubbly throughout.
Carefully remove lid to allow steam to escape. Stir gently and serve chili directly from slow cooker liner. Serve directly from lined slow cooker. Top with cheese and sour cream, if desired.
Do not lift or transport liner with food inside. Remove all food and cool slow cooker completely before lifting liner from slow cooker.
