Ingredients:
3 large beets
extra-virgin olive oil
balsamic vinegar
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and cut into bite-size pieces
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 (10 ounce) package mixed salad greens
1/4 cup shelled pistachio nuts
1/4 cup dried cherries
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cut stems off beets and place whole on a baking sheet. Roast until fork tender, about 45 minutes. Allow to cool; peel and dice beets into large bite-sized pieces. Toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar in a bowl; season with salt and black pepper.
Toss diced avocado with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a separate bowl; season with salt.
