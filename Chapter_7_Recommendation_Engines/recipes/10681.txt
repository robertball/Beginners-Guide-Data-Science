Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 cup margarine
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).   Grease cookie sheets with non-stick cooking spray (I use butter flavored) and set aside.
Combine cream cheese, margarine, and sugars.  Blend in egg and vanilla.  Add dry ingredients and mix well.  Add chocolate chips and mix.
Bake 15-18 minutes or until edges are slightly browned.  Enjoy!

Description: 
This is a slightly healthier version of traditional chocolate chip cookies because margarine and cream cheese replace straight butter.  They bake up moist and cake-like and have a delicious taste.  I always gets rave reviews!
