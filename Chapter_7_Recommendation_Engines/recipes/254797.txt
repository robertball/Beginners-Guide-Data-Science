Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups fresh figs
3 eggs
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup flax seed meal
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/4 cups old-fashioned oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Place half of the figs in a blender; blend until smooth. Chop remaining figs with a sharp knife.
Beat eggs, applesauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together with an electric mixer in a bowl until frothy. Mix in flour, blended and chopped figs, flax meal, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and baking powder. Slowly add flour with mixer on low; fold in oats. Spoon batter into muffin cups.
Bake in preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes.
