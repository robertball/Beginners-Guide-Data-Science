Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
8 ounces linguica sausage, sliced
1 onion, sliced
1 green bell pepper, chopped
4 pounds chicken parts
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 cup dry white wine
1 cup chicken broth
2 bay leaves
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 orange, cut into wedges

Directions:
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add sausage, onion, and bell pepper; saute until vegetables are softened and sausage is browned, about 10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate, leaving drippings in the pot.
Combine oregano, basil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and rub on chicken. Add chicken to the pot, raise heat to medium-high, and brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.
Stir sausage and vegetable mixture into the pot with wine, broth, bay leaves, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer, covered, until chicken is no longer pink in the centers, 35 to 45 minutes.
Remove and discard bay leaves. Serve chicken with orange wedges.
