Description: 
We adapted this recipe from one that has been our favorite for a long time. This is a great slow cooker beef stew that you can start in the morning on a cold, chilly day, and have a warm and delicious stew ready that evening. Don't forget to brown the meat. It makes a big difference! Serve with warm french bread for a yummy winter meal.
