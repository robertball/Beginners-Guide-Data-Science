Ingredients:
1 cup cubed whole-wheat country bread

4 medium tomatoes, divided
3 tablespoons reduced-fat mayonnaise

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
Freshly ground pepper, to taste
5 cups chopped hearts of romaine lettuce
3 slices center-cut bacon, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
1.Preheat oven to 350°F. Toss bread with oil and spread on a baking sheet. Bake, turning once, until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
2.Cut 1 tomato in half. Working over a large bowl, shred both halves using the large holes on a box grater. Discard the skin. Add mayonnaise, chives (or scallion greens), vinegar, garlic powder and pepper; whisk to combine.
3.Chop the remaining 3 tomatoes. Add the tomatoes, romaine and croutons to the bowl with the dressing; toss to coat. Sprinkle with bacon.

Description: 
Here’s a salad version of America’s favorite sandwich. We use shredded tomato as a base for the creamy tomato-and-chive dressingadding great tang and flavor along with extra vitamin C.
