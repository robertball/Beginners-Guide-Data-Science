Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups orange juice
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 (3 inch) cinnamon stick
4 large pears, peeled, halved, and cored
1/2 cup fresh raspberries

Directions:
In a large saucepan, bring the orange juice, brown sugar and cinnamon stick to a boil. Reduce heat; cook and stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Add pears; cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until tender but firm.
Using a slotted spoon, place each pear half in a dessert dish. Garnish with raspberries. Drizzle with poaching liquid.

Description: 
These pears are very simple to prepare, but so elegant, assures Edna Lee of Greeley, Colorado. I love to serve them when fresh raspberries are in season. They make a beautiful presentation for special occasions and are always well liked by both young and old. TIP: I've occasionally used home-canned pear halves and no one ever knows the difference, Edna says.
