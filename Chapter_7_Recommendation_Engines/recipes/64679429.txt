Ingredients:
12 beef short ribs, well-seasoned
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 lb regular-cut bacon, diced
3 tablespoons Olive Oil
5 carrots, finely diced
3 shallots, finely minced
2 medium onions, finely diced
1/4 cup red wine
6-8 cups beef broth (enough to almost cover the ribs)
3 sprigs fresh thyme
3 sprigs fresh rosemary

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.  dredge ribs in flour.  Set aside.
In a large Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until completely crispy and all the fat is rendered. Remove the bacon and set aside. Drain off any excess fat.
Add the olive oil to the pan with the bacon fat and raise the heat to high. Brown the ribs on all sides, about 45 seconds per side. Remove the ribs and set aside.
Lower the heat to medium. Add the carrots, shallots and onions to the pan and cook for 2 minutes. Splash in the wine and scrape the bottom of the pan.   Add the broth, 1 tablespoon kosher salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper and bring to a boil. Taste and add more salt if needed. Add the ribs to the liquid; they should be almost completely submerged. Add the thyme and rosemary sprigs (whole) to the liquid. Finally, add the cooked bacon.
Put on a lid and transfer to the oven. Cook until the ribs are fork-tender and falling off the bone, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove the pan from the oven and allow to sit for at least 20 minutes with the lid on before serving. At the last minute, skim the fat off the top of the liquid. (You can also refrigerate the mixture, then remove the solid fat from the top.)
