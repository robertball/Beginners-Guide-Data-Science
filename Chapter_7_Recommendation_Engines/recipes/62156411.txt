Ingredients:
2 sticks melted butter - no salt
1 lb (1 box) brown sugar, light or dark
3 large eggs
2 tbs pure vanilla
2 cups flour
2-1/2 tsp baking powder
Mix these 2 ingredients together until sugar is dissolved
Add 3 eggs and 2 tbs pure vanilla and mix together
Sift in 2 cups flour with 2-1/2 tsp baking powder and mix all together
Spray a 9X13 pan with baking spray and line with foil with edges to hang over pan then spray the foil with baking spray (I used butter flavor).
Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes. This is the perfect amount of time, you don't want to take these out while they are still gooey.
Remove from oven and use foil edges to lift out of pan and onto a rack to cool. Once cool cut into small squares. Small because they are super sweet.
They set up best over night. Chewy, yummy and oh so buttery and butterscotch tasting.

Directions:
Pre heat oven to 350 degrees
Spray a 9X13 pan with baking spray and line with foil with edges to hang over pan
Spray the foil with baking spray
Mix these melted butter and brown sugar until sugar is dissolved
Add the eggs and vanilla and mix together
Sift in the flour and baking powder and mix all together
Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, they should be firm when removed, not gooey.
Remove from oven and use foil edges to lift out of pan and onto a rack to cool. Once cool cut into small squares.

Description: 
So easy, so chew, so buttery!  Not a cake like brownie at all.  This is butterscotch heaven in a pan.  To me they are best straight up, nothing else added, but feel free to add nuts, dried fruit, white chocolate chips, anything!
