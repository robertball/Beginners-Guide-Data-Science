Ingredients:
2/3 pound ground beef (85% lean)
2 cups mayonnaise
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish
1 1/2 teaspoons white wine vinegar, or more to taste
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground paprika
4 hamburger bun bottoms
2 hamburger bun tops
2 tablespoons minced onion, or to taste
1/2 cup shredded lettuce, or to taste
2 tablespoons dill pickle slices, or to taste
2 slices American cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Shape ground beef into 4 flat patties that will fit the hamburger buns. Place them on a tray lined with waxed paper; transfer to the freezer.
Mix mayonnaise, mustard, pickle relish, white wine vinegar, onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika in a bowl to make sauce. Refrigerate for 10 minutes.
Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Toast buns in batches until lightly golden, 1 to 2 minutes.
Layer some of the sauce, 1 tablespoon minced onion, 2 tablespoons lettuce, and pickles on 2 bottom buns. Layer some of the sauce and remaining 1 tablespoon minced onion, 2 tablespoons lettuce, and American cheese on the other bottom buns.
Season patties with salt and pepper. Cook in the hot skillet 2 at a time until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place 1 patty over each bottom bun; stack and cover with top buns.
