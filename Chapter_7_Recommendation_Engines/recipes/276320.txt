Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) whole chicken
1 pound carrots, peeled and sliced
1 pound celery, sliced
2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1 large onion, chopped
1 bunch fresh dill
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
10 cups warm water as needed

Directions:
Clean chicken and remove some, but not all, fat. Place in a 2-quart soup pot with carrots, celery, tomatoes, and onion. Tie all dill sprigs into a bunch with kitchen string; add to the pot with salt and pepper. Add water until chicken is covered by 2 inches.
Cook over medium-low heat until chicken is just about cooked through, about 3 hours. Remove chicken to a platter and allow to cool slightly, 15 to 20 minutes. Cut meat off the bones, place meat back into the pot, and discard the bones. Cook over medium-low heat until heated through, about 30 minutes longer. Remove dill before serving.
