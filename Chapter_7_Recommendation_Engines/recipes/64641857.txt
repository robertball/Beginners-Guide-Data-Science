Ingredients:
1 8.5-ounce box corn-muffin mix (Jiffy)
1 16-ounce can corn, drained
3/4 cup milk
2 cups Shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese
4 TBSP melted butter
1 tsp onion powder , or 2 TB dried onion flakes [or 1 small onion , diced , but if using fresh onion, saute until soft, before adding]
1.5 cups ham, diced small
1 cup sour cream [I used reduced fat]- **Nonfat Greek Yogurt works great too!**
3 eggs, beaten
1/4 c fresh parsley, finely chopped

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and pour into a 9 x 11 inch baking dish that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Bake for 45-50 minutes, until lightly browned and knife inserted in center comes out with no color on it. The casserole will likely look wet because this dish is quite moist and wonderful. As long as that wet is CLEAR then the eggs are done cooking .
Please keep in mind differing baking dish sizes will cause the bake time to differ. Start checking for doneness at 40 minutes and adjust accordingly.***
