Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup orange juice
2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
2 cups apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
1 cup HERSHEYÂ®'S Cinnamon Chips
confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt; set aside.
In a large bowl, combine sugar, eggs, oil, orange juice and vanilla. Beat on high speed of an electric mixer until blended. Beat in flour mixture. Fold in chopped walnuts. Pour 1/3 of batter into prepared pan. Mix together chopped apples and cinnamon chips, and sprinkle 1/2 of mixture over batter in pan. Repeat layers, ending with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar before serving.
