Ingredients:
1 clove garlic
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained and rinsed
1 (6 ounce) can black olives, drained and liquid reserved
1/4 cup olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Place garlic in food processor and pulse until garlic is minced. Add garbanzo beans; puree until chickpeas have broken down into a paste. Pour in liquid from olives, 1 tablespoon at a time; puree until fully incorporated, about 2 to 3 tablespoons liquid in total.
Keep food processor running and slowly drizzle olive oil into hummus until smooth and desired consistency is reached. Add olives to the hummus and pulse 3 to 7 times until olives are chopped and evenly distributed.

Description: 
My husband claims store-bought hummus is too gritty so he never liked it. But by adding extra liquids it makes it 'smooth like butta.' Now he's a hummus fan! One can of chickpeas makes so much that what used to be an expensive 'when-it's-on-sale' kind of treat is now a delicious snack I can have anytime!
