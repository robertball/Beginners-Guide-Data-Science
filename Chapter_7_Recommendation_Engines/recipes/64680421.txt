Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic minced
2 Tbsp butter
1/2 cup cubed carrot
1/2 cup frozen corn
1/2 cup frozen peas
1 medium potato cubed
1/2 to 1 cup sliced button mushrooms
2 - 3 cups turkey broth (I used left over gravy combined with broth to make mine)
1 1/2 cups cubed leftover turkey
1/2 package Tenderflake puff pastry
1 bay leaf
1/2 tsp summer savory, or thyme
salt and pepper to taste
cornstarch or flour for thickening

Directions:
Melt butter and sauté celery, onion and garlic until translucent.
Add mushrooms and sauté until water from mushrooms dissipates.
Add vegetables, turkey, broth / gravy mixture, seasonings and simmer until vegetables are cooked.  Thicken sauce to desired consistency using a broth / cornstarch or broth / flour mixture.  Usually about 1 - 2 tablespoons flour or cornstarch...less if you included leftover gravy.  Pour into greased 12" deep dish pie plate and top with puff pastry.  Slash pastry for venting, and brush with beaten egg.   Dredge with a teaspoon of salt if desired.   Bake for 25 minutes at 400 degrees or until golden and pastry has puffed up.  Let rest for 10 minutes  before serving.
