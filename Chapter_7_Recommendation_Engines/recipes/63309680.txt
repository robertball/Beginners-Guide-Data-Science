Ingredients:
1 cups dried cherries, chopped
1/3 cup hot water
6 Tbsps shortening
6 Tbsps butter, softened
1-1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
2 eggs
3 tsps grated orange peel
1-1/2 tsps vanilla extract
3 cups quick-cooking oats
1-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup (6 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
1. In a small bowl, soak the cherries in hot water for at least 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, cream the shortening, butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, orange peel and vanilla. Combine the oats, flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Stir in the chocolate chips and cherries with liquid.
3. Drop by rounded tablespoons 2-in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350* for 12-14 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool for 1 minute; remove from pans to wire racks.
