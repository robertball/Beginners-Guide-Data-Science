Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut in half width wise
1-2T olive oil
4T butter
9 sage leaves, washed and patted dry
Salt to taste

Directions:
Using the "B" blade, spiralize sweet potato halves into long spaghetti like ribbons.
In large non stick pan, heat oil over medium heat.
Add sweet potato and cook, stirring often for 6-7 minutes, or until the potato begins to soften, add more oil as necessary to keep the sweet potato from sticking.
Remove from pan and keep warm
In same pan,  add butter and allow to melt then foam.  Once butter foams, add sage leaves and swirl in pan 2-3 minutes or until the butter is a rich caramel color and the leaves have turned a dark green grey color.  Remove bay leaves and set aside.
Toss sweet potato with sage butter to coat well.  Season with salt to taste and garnish with crisped sage leaves.
