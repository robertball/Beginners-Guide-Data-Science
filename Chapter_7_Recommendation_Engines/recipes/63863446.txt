Ingredients:
3 Lbs. Boneless Center Cut Pork Loin Roast
1 1/2 Tsp Salt
1 Pinch Marjoram
1 Pinch Basil
2 Tsp Black Pepper
1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder
2 Tbs Butter
1/2 Tsp Red Pepper Flakes
1/2 Tsp Thyme
1 Tsp Oregano
1/2 Tsp Mustard Powder
2 Cloves Garlic
16 ounces of beer (your choice)
3 Tbs Flour
1/2 Tsp Onion Powder
1 Tbs Garlic Salt

Directions:
1.  Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
2.  Melt butter in a skillet over medium low heat, and stir in the black pepper, red pepper flakes, thyme, oregano, mustard powder, garlic, basil, and marjoram.  Cook and stir until thickened and fragrant, easy to spread, but won't run.  Remove from heat.
3.  Spread on top of roast evenly.  Salt the top of the roast.
4.  Pour beer into bottom of roasting pan and cover with foil.  Bake in oven for 45 minutes.  Remove foil and bake for additional hour.
5.  Increase oven temperature to 425 and cook for 30 minutes longer. (Adjust times to size of meat and desired doneness.  I like my pork well done, always minimum of 180 degrees).
6.  Remove roast from pan, whisk in flour, onion powder and garlic salt to make gravy over a medium low heat.  Warm and stir until thickens and then serve.  Add additional liquid (water/stock/flour) to desired consistency and quantity.

I tried this when we were bored with boring pork and boring gravy.  The rub has a kick and the gravy was a hit with the kids!
