Ingredients:
1 family size box plain brownie mix
1 8oz block cream cheese, softened
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Combine brownie mix, 1 egg, and vegetable oil until crumbly.  Reserve one cup for topping.  Pat remainder into ungreased 9x13 inch baking pan.  Bake at 325 degrees for 10-12 minutes.  Remove from oven, allow to cool for 15 minutes.
In separate bowl, beat sugar, cream cheese and one egg until smooth, soft and light.  Stir in chocolate chips.  Spread over baked brownie layer.
Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture.  Bake 15 to 20 more minutes, until cream-cheese layer is set.  Allow to cool thoroughly before cutting, store in refrigerator.

Description: 
A rich, chocolatey dessert that goes great with a casual dinner.  Everyone asks for the recipe when I bring these brownie bars to potlucks.  Be very careful not to overbake -- if you're using a dark pan, consider lowering the temperature of the oven to 300 degrees.
