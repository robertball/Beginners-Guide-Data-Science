Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables
2 1/2 cups cubed cooked chicken
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
3/4 cup milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
8 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled (optional)
BISCUITS:
1 1/2 cups biscuit/baking mix
2/3 cup milk
1 (2.8 ounce) can French-fried onions

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the vegetables, chicken, soup, milk, 1 cup cheese and bacon if desired. Pour into an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cover and bake at 400 for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, in another bowl, combine biscuit mix and milk. Drop batter by tablespoonfuls onto chicken mixture. Bake, uncovered, for 20-22 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown. Top with onions and remaining cheese. Bake 3-4 minutes longer or until the cheese is melted.

Description: 
'This cheesy chicken casserole gets its vibrant color from frozen vegetables and its unique flavor from crumbled bacon,' reports Debbie Vannette of Zeeland, Michigan. 'The biscuit-topped dish has become a regular at our dinner table since my sister-in-law shared it with us after the birth of our son.'
