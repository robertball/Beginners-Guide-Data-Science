Ingredients:
1 C butter, softened
1/2 C sugar
1/2 tsp orange oil
1/4 tsp cinnamon oil
2 C all purpose flour
water

Directions:
Cream together the butter, sugar and oils. Add the flour and mix to combine. If it's too dry, add water a teaspoon at a time to bring it almost together.
Form the dough into a ball with your hands and roll out to 1/4" thickness on a lightly floured surface. Cut into desired shapes (I used small Christmas ornament cookie cutters).
Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet for 10-15 minutes, until the bottoms are light brown. Cool on racks.
Makes about 60 small cookies
