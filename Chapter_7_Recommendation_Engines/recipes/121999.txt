Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups butter (no substitutes), softened
1 cup sugar
3 eggs, separated
3 cups all-purpose flour
TOPPING:
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 cup finely chopped almonds
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg yolks; mix well.  Gradually add flour.
Using a cookie press fitted with a bar disk, press dough into long strips onto ungreased baking sheets. Beat egg whites until stiff; brush over dough. Combine topping ingredients; sprinkle over strips. Cut each strip into 2-in. pieces (there is no need to separate the pieces).
Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until edges are firm (do not brown). Cut into pieces again if necessary. Remove to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
When I was young, I could hardly wait for the holidays because I knew these rich cookies would make an appearance on the cookie tray. Now I make them for holidays throughout the year.
