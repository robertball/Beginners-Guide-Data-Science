Remove solid butter and squeeze under very cold water to remove any remaining buttermilk.
Remove the remaining buttermilk from the bowl. You should have about 2 cups of buttermilk as a result of the process.
Return butter to the bowl with desired amount of salt and 1/2 cup of olive oil.   Cover the bowl with plastic wrap to minimize splatter.
Whip with the whisk on medium speed until well combined. Gradually increase the speed to high. Butter should whip for about 15 minutes and increase in volume by at least half.
Place in air tight container and refrigerate.  You may divide into smaller portions, wrap well and freeze.
