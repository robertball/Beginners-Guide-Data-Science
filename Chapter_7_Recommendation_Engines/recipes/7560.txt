Ingredients:
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup poppy seeds
2 cups sifted cake flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
7 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Wash angel food tube pan in hot soapy water to ensure it is totally grease-free.
Combine milk and poppy seeds in small bowl.  Let stand 2 hours.  Bring the eggs to room temperature.
Sift flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into medium mixing bowl.  Make a well in center.  Add the vegetable oil.  Separate the eggs and add the yolks, vanilla and lemon flavoring.  Add poppy seed mixture to well. Set aside.  Don't beat yet.
In large mixing bowl beat egg whites and cream of tartar until very stiff.  Using same beaters beat egg yolk/flour mixture until smooth and light.  Pour 1/4 at a time over beaten egg whites folding in with rubber spatula until all traces of flour disappear.  Do not stir.
Pour into ungreased 10 inch angel food tube pan.  Bake in oven for 55 minutes.  Increase heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake 10 to 15 minutes more until an inserted wooden pick comes out clean.  Invert pan to cool.  Ice with Vanilla Glaze, Caramel Icing or Seafoam Frosting.
