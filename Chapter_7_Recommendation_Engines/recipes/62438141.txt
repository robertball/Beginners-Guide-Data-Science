Ingredients:
2 English Muffins (hard toasted)
1/3 cup + 2 tbsp egg beaters
1/2 tsp Southwestern Chipolte flavor - Mrs. Dash(sprinkle to your taste)
5-10 sprays of "I can't believe it's not butter" topping spray (optional)

Directions:
Toast 4 halves of Thomas' English muffins (Multi Grain, Low sodium) so they are dry as a bone but not too brown (this is to remove all moisture and not be soggy when the eggs are added).
Spray Pam non-stick spray to a microavable plate that is large enough to hold all four muffin halfs level.
Push down surface of muffins on plate so they can hold as much egg as possible.  Pour egg beaters on muffins (eggs may run over, but will stick to other side of muffin instead of plate.)
Sprinkle Mrs. Dash to amount desired.
Microwave for about one minute.  Obviously microwave longer if liquid egg is still present!
