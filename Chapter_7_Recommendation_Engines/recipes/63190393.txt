Ingredients:
2 tsp vegetable oil
2 carrots, diced
1 medium zucchini, diced
3 small yellow squash, diced
1 small onion, diced
2 tsp minced garlic
1 tsp dried thyme
1 cup pearled barley
4.5 cups chicken or vegetable broth
2 tbsp butter, optional
.5 cup grated parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large skillet, heat 1 tsp vegetable oil over medium heat. Add carrots and cook 2-3 minutes. Add zucchini and yellow squash and cook until tender. Set aside.
In a large saucepan, heat broth until hot but not boiling.
In another large skillet, heat 1 tsp vegetable oil over medium heat. Add onion and cook until tender. Add garlic and cook 1-2 minutes. Add barley and cook 2-3 minutes, stirring often. Add two cups of hot broth and reduce heat to simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is absorbed. Add broth in half cup increments, letting each addition absorb before adding the next. When barley is tender, add butter and parmesan, mixing well. Salt and pepper to taste (suggested 1 tsp salt and half tsp pepper). Add sauteed vegetables and heat through.
