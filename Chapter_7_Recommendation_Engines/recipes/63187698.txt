Ingredients:
1 cup  Organic Steel Cut Oats
1-1/2 cups  Organic Oat Bran
2-1/2 cups  Organic Brown Rice Flour
1 cup  Organic Flax Seed Meal “if” your dog is allergic to Flax Seed. Replace with either Quinoa Flour “or” more Brown Rice Flour
1-1/2 cups low sodium (Beef or Chicken) broth
2 tablespoons Honey
2 tablespoons Organic Virgin Coconut Oil (alternatives: Organic Virgin Olive Oil or Fish Oil)
2 eggs beaten
3 sprigs  Fresh Organic Rosemary **OPTIONAL**

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. Lightly grease three cookie sheets with virgin coconut oil or virgin olive oil.
Combine Steel cut oats, oat bran, brown rice flour, flax seed meal, in a large bowl. Add eggs to oat mixture. Mix together broth, honey, and oil, then add to Oat mixture, mix well to make fairly stiff dough.  If you can’t form a ball without dough cracking then add more water, 1 Tablespoon at a time, until a ball could be formed without cracking. Dough will be sticky.
Roll dough out between two sheets of plastic wrap to ¼ inch thick and then cut using cookie cutter or cut into strips 1”x1-1/2”. Place on cookie sheets 1/2 inch apart.
Bake 2 hours (turn over half way thru cooking at 60 minutes) until dry and the edges turn a light golden brown. Let completely cool before serving.
TIP:  **OPTIONAL** For a preservative, add sprigs of "Fresh Organic Rosemary" when boiling water for broth, strain, let cool before adding to oat mixture.  Organic Rosemary: Long used as a food seasoning, rosemary is also a natural antibiotic and antiseptic which increases blood flow to the brain and rejuvenates the senses.
