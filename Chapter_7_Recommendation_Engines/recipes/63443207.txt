Ingredients:
8 ounces pignoli (pine nuts)
½ cup granulated sugar
½ cup confectioners’ sugar
¼ cup all-purpose flour
Dash salt
1 8-ounce can almond paste
2 egg whites, slightly beaten
½ teaspoon almond or vanilla extract
Confectioner’s sugar for dusting

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Line 2 cookie sheets with silpat liners or parchment. Place pine nuts “pignoli” in a shallow dish.
Combine granulated sugar, confectioners’ sugar, flour and salt in a medium bowl and lightly toss.
Place almond paste in a mixing bowl of an electric mixer and mix to break up. Add beaten egg whites and mix on low speed until smooth. Add almond extract and flour mixture and beat until flour is blended in, about 30 seconds. Do not over beat.
Using a teaspoon or a scooper, scoop up a rounded spoon of dough and push dough side into the pine nuts so that they stick to dough. Ease dough out of scoop so that pine nuts are facing up on baking sheet. Place 2? apart and re-apply any loose nuts.
Bake cookies for about 25 minutes. Use the shorter baking time if you like soft cookies; the longer baking time if you like them chewy. Cool 1 minute and remove to a rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners’ sugar.

This is one of my husbands favorite cookies.  Being raised by an Italian mother and working in his grandfathers Italian grocery store has made him a true lover of all italian cooking.
