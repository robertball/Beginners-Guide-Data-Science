1 small (8x8) brownie mix
1 (3.9 oz.) instant chocolate pudding mix
1/2 cup cold water
1 (14 oz.) can sweetened condensed milk
2 (8 oz.) containers Cool Whip, thawed
1 1/2 cups toffee chips or 6 Heath or Skor bars.

Directions:
Prepare brownie mix according to package directions, bake and cool completely.  Cut into 1 inch squares.
In a large bowl, combine pudding mix, water and condensed milk.  Mix until smooth, then fold in 1 container of Cool Whip until no streaks show.
If using candy bars, chop into semi-fine chips.
In a trifle bowl or other clear bowl, layer 1/2 of the brownie cubes, 1/2 half of the pudding mixture, 1/2 half of the remaining Cool Whip, and 3/4 cup of toffee chips.
Repeat layers, cover and chill for 8 hours before serving.
