Description: 
This filling lends itself to your modifications.  As is, this is a favorite for Superbowl Sunday, stag parties, or any place where there is men and beer.  Beer and Dynamite parties are classic in my hometown area, and very popular for fundraisers because it's inexpensive to make and good.  Get a big pot and make a lot.  They freeze well.
