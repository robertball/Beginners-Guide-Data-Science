Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
1/2 pound processed American cheese, cubed
salt and pepper to taste
4 (14.5 ounce) cans yellow wax beans, drained
1 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, and stir in flour to form a thick paste. Gradually blend in milk, stirring constantly, and bring to a low boil for approximately 1 minute. Reduce heat, and stir in mustard, processed American cheese, salt and pepper. Continue stirring until cheese is melted.
Place 1/2 the beans in a medium baking dish. Layer with 1/2 the processed cheese mixture and remaining beans. Top with remaining processed cheese mixture.
Melt remaining butter in a small saucepan, and mix in bread crumbs. Top the bean and processed cheese layers with the bread crumb mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, until lightly brown.
