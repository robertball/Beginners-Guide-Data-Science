Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon coconut extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup chocolate coated coconut and almond candy pieces (such as Hershey速's Almond Joy速 Pieces)
1 cup flaked coconut
1/4 cup chocolate coated coconut and almond candy pieces (such as Hershey速's Almond Joy速 Pieces)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until fluffy.
Beat in the egg, vanilla extract, and coconut extract.
Combine both amounts of flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; mix into the butter mixture until just combined.
Fold in the chocolate chips, 1/2 cup almond candy pieces, and flaked coconut until evenly distributed.
Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and place 3 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges become golden brown, 9 to 11 minutes.
Immediately after removing from the oven, press a few of the remaining 1/4 cup almond candy pieces into each cookie decoratively.
