Ingredients:
1 lb. extra lean ground beef
1 envelope dry onion soup mix
1 regular sized can pork and beans
1 cup water
1/3 cup (or to taste) ketchup
1/3 cup (or to taste) prepared yellow mustard
1/3 cup (or to taste) packed brown sugar

Directions:
In a large skillet, brown beef over medium high heat, breaking it up as you stir, about 10 minutes.  Drain if necessary and return to skillet.
Reduce heat to medium/medium-low, and add the remaining ingredients, and stir to combine.
Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, about 15-20 minutes until onions are rehydrated and liquid is reduced to desired consistency.

Description: 
Growing up, Mom made a dish we called That Stuff, basically a one dish chili mac.  When she came up with this, it didn't have a name, so we always called it, That Other Stuff.  It's a thirty minute, one pan dish that satisfies the family as well as the wallet.  It's especially good on a cold, wet, winter night.
