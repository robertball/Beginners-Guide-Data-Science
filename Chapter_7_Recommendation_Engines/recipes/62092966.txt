Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs zucchini
salt
Olive Oil
1 cup white wine vinegar
1/2 cup sugar
1 large pinch red pepper flakes
6 garlic cloves chopped
1 large bunch of basil chopped
zest from 1 lemon
juice from 1 lemon

Directions:
Slice the zucchini in 1/3 inch slices long ways. Salt and put on paper towel for 2 hours to get rid of excess water.
Once water is drained put oil in a pan on medium heat. In batches brown zucchini slices. About 3 minutes each side. Transfer to a container with a lid. Keep browning until all zucchini is done.
Chop garlic and basil and place in the container with zucchini. Zest and juice the lemon and add them to the container.
In a saucepan add the sugar, white wine vinegar and red pepper flakes and bring to a boil. Transfer the mixture to the zucchini container. Cover and refrigerate. Can be kept this way for up to a week.

Description: 
I have a ton of zucchini in my garden already this summer. I'm trying to come up with new ideas on what to do with it...This is the best recipe so far...Yummy, great with cheese or in an antipasta platter. Let sit overnight in the refrigerator for best results and add other veggies like onions or red bell peppers for a little extra zing.
