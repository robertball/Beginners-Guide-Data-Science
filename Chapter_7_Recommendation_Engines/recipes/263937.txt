Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
5 large portobello mushrooms, diced (optional)
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 banana pepper, seeded and diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
1 (16 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
6 ounces bottled Bloody Mary mix
1/2 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/2 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Combine black beans, kidney beans, and pinto beans in a large bowl and cover with fresh water; soak for at least 15 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add mushrooms, onion, bell peppers, and banana pepper. Cook until they sweat their juices and are slightly tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic; cook 2 to 3 minutes more.
Drain beans and add to the pot with the vegetables. Add crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, Bloody Mary mix, and tomato paste. Add chili powder, salt, oregano, sugar, black pepper, cumin, and cayenne pepper.
Simmer over medium-low to medium heat, uncovered, until as thick as desired, about 1 1/2 hours.

Description: 
This recipe is a great way to use up ingredients in your fridge, including Bloody Mary mix. Feel free to throw in other random veggies you may have in your fridge. I enjoy serving with diced red onion, shredded Cheddar cheese, and sour cream.
