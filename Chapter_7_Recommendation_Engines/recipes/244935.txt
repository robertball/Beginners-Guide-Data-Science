Ingredients:
1 bone-in pork chop
4 cups water, or more as needed
1/4 onion
2 teaspoons chicken base
1 clove garlic

Directions:
Cut bones and fat from pork chop and cut meat into small pieces. Place bone, fat, and meat in a saucepan; add water, onion, chicken base, and garlic. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover saucepan, and simmer, adding more water every hour, 5 to 6 hours.
Strain broth into a bowl and separate bones from the meat. Put meat and 1/2 of the broth in a blender; blend. Return blended broth to broth in saucepan and mix well.

Description: 
Wanted to make tonkotsu without big amount of bones for one serving. Pig trotters consist of bone, meat, and cartilage, so, it's liquified. I used liquified pork and some bones for flavor with some chicken base.
