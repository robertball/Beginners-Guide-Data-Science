Ingredients:
6 cups shredded lettuce
1/2 cup diced onion
1 (12 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 green pepper, roasted, peeled and chopped
2 tomatoes, diced
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup crushed corn chips
Salsa Dressing:
1/2 cup salsa
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon minced cilantro
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
1 clove garlic, crushed

Directions:
Line a large serving platter with shredded lettuce. Layer onion, corn, roasted green pepper and tomatoes.
To roast pepper: Arrange oven rack so that green pepper will sit about 3 to 4 inches below broiler. Place pepper on oven rack: broil until skin blisters and turns black. Keep rotating until all sides are done. Remove with tongs. Put in paper bag to sweat. When cool enough to handle, peel off skin.
To prepare dressing: combine salsa, water, canola oil, lime juice, cilantro, sugar and garlic in container with tight fitting lid. Shake well. Drizzle dressing over salad and top with cheese and corn chips.
