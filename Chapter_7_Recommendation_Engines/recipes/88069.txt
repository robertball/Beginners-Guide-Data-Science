Ingredients:
4 large fresh tomatoes, coarsely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 lemon, zested
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 loaf ciabatta bread, split in half horizontally
1/3 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons olive oil
black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a saucepan over medium heat, stir together tomatoes, garlic, salt, lemon zest, and brown sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until tomatoes release their juices, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
Cut each half of ciabatta into 2 or 3 pieces. Place cut-side up on a baking sheet, and bake in preheated oven until golden brown.
Meanwhile, stir lemon juice, olive oil, and pepper into the tomato mixture. Cook, uncovered, over medium heat until mixture is thick, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat, and spread tomato sauce over sliced bread. Serve hot.

This bread goes great with any Italian or Mediterranean meal. I've also cut the bread into smaller pieces and served it as an appetizer.
