Ingredients:
1 (1 pound 1.5 ounce) pouch Betty Crocker® sugar cookie mix
1/3 cup unsweetened baking cocoa
3 tablespoons instant coffee granules or crystals
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
3 tablespoons hazelnut-flavored syrup for beverages
1 egg
1 1/2 cups toasted hazelnuts, chopped*
1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
2/3 cup Betty Crocker® Rich & Creamy chocolate frosting
4 1/2 teaspoons hazelnut-flavored syrup for beverages

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, stir together cookie mix, cocoa and instant coffee. Add butter, 3 tablespoons syrup and the egg; stir until soft dough forms. Stir in 1 cup of the nuts and the chocolate chips.
On ungreased cookie sheets, drop dough with rounded 1 1/2 tablespoon-size cookie scoop or by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart. Press each mound to flatten slightly.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until set. Cool 3 minutes; remove from cookie sheets to cooling racks. Cool completely, about 15 minutes.
In small bowl, stir frosting and 4 1/2 teaspoons syrup. Spread about 1 teaspoon frosting on each cookie. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup nuts.
