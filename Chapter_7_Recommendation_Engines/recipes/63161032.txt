2-3 jalapeno peppers
1 tablespoon Lime juice

2 clove garlic, peeled
1 teaspoon ground cumin
salt to taste

Directions:
Split jalapenos in half and, depending on how hot you want it, remove some of the seeds AND membrane.
Clean cilantro, dry on paper towels and remove stems.
Put onion, pepper, garlic and cilantro in food processor and pulse until blended.  Add tomatoes, cumin and salt and pulse until just blended, leaving the tomatoes slightly chunky.

Description: 
This is better than any jar salsa.  While we like it really spicy, if I'm having friends over, I tone it down for those who can't take the heat.Modified from: Speedy Homemade Salsa
