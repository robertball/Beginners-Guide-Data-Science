Ingredients:
Shortbread Crust:
1 cup butter
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
Tart:
1/2 cup heavy or whipping cream
3 tablespoons margarine or butter
7 ounces semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
1 ounce unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped
1/8 cup raspberry/chocolate swirl chips (optional)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 pint raspberries (about 1 1/2 cups)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream butter and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy. Stir together flour and baking powder; blend into butter mixture. Pat into a 9 inch pie plate.
Bake in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until edges are lightly browned.
Cool Shortbread Crust.
In 2-quart saucepan, heat heavy cream with margarine or butter to boiling over medium-high heat. Remove saucepan from heat; add semisweet and unsweetened chocolates and whisk until melted and smooth. Whisk in vanilla.
Pour hot chocolate ganache into cooled crust; spread evenly. Sprinkle tart with raspberries. Refrigerate until chilled and firm enough to slice, about 1 hour.
If tart has been refrigerated more than 1 hour, let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving for best flavor and texture.
