Ingredients:
For the Cake:
Cooking spray
1 box Duncan Hines Devil's Food cake mix
1 pkg. chocolate instant pudding
1 (12 oz.) pkg. semisweet chocolate chips
1 3/4 cup milk
2 eggs
For the Glaze:
1 cup (2/3 pkg.) semisweet chocolate chips
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
For the Decoration:
1/3 package chocolate chips

Directions:
For the Cake:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a non-stick bundt pan with cooking spray.
Blend dry ingredients in a large bowl, then add milk and eggs. Mix by hand, approximately 2 minutes. Using non-stick bundt pan sprayed with cooking spray, bake cake 45-50 minutes, or until the top springs back lightly when touched. Do not overbake.
Cool 15 minutes before removing from pan. Then let cool completely on rack.
For the Glaze:
Melt butter and corn syrup together over low heat and stir in chocolate chips. Add vanilla when chocolate chips are melted and drizzle glaze around the top of the bundt cake allowing some to drip down the sides. Let cool 15 minutes.
Decoration:
Using some of the remaining 1/3 pkg. semisweet chocolate chips, arrange clusters of chips around the top of the cake to form a crown before serving.
