Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 1/3 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine sugar, flour, and baking soda in a bowl. Add butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract; stir, adding more flour if needed, until batter is thick but smooth.
Scoop batter onto a nonstick baking sheet using an ice cream scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
