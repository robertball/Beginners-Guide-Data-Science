Ingredients:
¼ cup butter
1  onion, very finely chopped
2 stalks celery, very finely chopped
¼ cup all-purpose flour
2 quarts chicken stock
1 (18 ounce) jar crunchy peanut butter
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
2 tablespoons roasted peanuts, or to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and celery in hot butter until soft, about 8 minutes. Stir flour into butter to incorporate. Gradually whisk chicken stock into flour mixture. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.
Remove saucepan from heat. Stir peanut butter and evaporated milk into stock until peanut butter melts into the mixture. Return saucepan to low heat. Cook at a simmer until flavors have blended, about 15 minutes. Garnish with roasted peanuts to serve.
