Ingredients:
1 package (10 ounces) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
2 packages (4 ounces each) crumbled feta cheese
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
6 to 8 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
Pinch pepper
6 to 8 bacon strips

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the spinach, feta cheese, mayonnaise and flour; set aside. Cut a 2-in.-deep pocket in the side of each chicken breast half. Lightly fill each pocket with spinach mixture. Sprinkle with pepper.
Wrap a strip of bacon around each piece of chicken; spoon 1 tablespoon of spinach mixture on top of each. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 325Â° for 50-60 minutes or until juices run clear.
