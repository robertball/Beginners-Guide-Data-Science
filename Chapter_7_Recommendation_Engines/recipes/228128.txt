Ingredients:
1/2 cup raisins
1 cup warm water
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small red onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried cilantro
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 cups vegetable broth
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1 cup quinoa
1/2 cup diced roasted red peppers
1/4 cup toasted almonds
salt to taste

Directions:
Soak raisins in 1 cup warm water in a bowl while you complete remaining steps.
Heat olive oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in curry powder, cumin, cilantro, and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Stir in vegetable broth, garbanzo beans, and quinoa. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low heat, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes.
Drain raisins. Lightly toss quinoa mixture with raisins, roasted red peppers, and toasted almonds. Season with salt.
