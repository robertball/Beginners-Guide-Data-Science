Description: 
This is one of my favorite recipes handed down from my great aunt. It is simple to make and looks very pretty for the holidays or any type of shower - baby shower, wedding shower or even house warming party. This recipe will serve several, but for the holidays when I know there will be more than 10 people, I double the recipe. Hope you enjoy!!
