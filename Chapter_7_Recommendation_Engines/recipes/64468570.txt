Ingredients:
6 large eggs
1 bunch kale
handful goldfish crackers
2 tbsp cocoa powder
19 chocolate chips
grated parmesan to garnish

Directions:
1. Crack eggs into mixing bowl.  Beat until frothy.
2. Chop kale coarsely, or even leave whole if you dare!
3. Add kale, cocoa, and 13 chocolate chips to batter. Mix thorougly
4. Crush goldfish crackers.   Sprinkly evenly over a muffin tray.
5.  Pour egg mix into 6 muffin cups. Sprinkle lightly with parmesan.  Scratch that.  Get bored and dump too much parmesan onto three of the cups, leaving none for the other cups.  Place remaining chocolate chips in a random muffin cup.  Live dangerously.  Do this blindfolded.
Turn oven on to 350Â°.  Bake Dinomite's Fluffy Bites until they are cooked to your satisfaction.  Serve immediately.
