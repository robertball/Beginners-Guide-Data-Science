Ingredients:
6 hot dogs
6 slices of bacon
6 hot dog buns
Favorite hot dog toppings (suggestions: ketchup, brown mustard, chili sauce)

Directions:
Line a cookie sheet with foil and heat the oven to 300 degrees. Cut the really fatty end off of the bacon slices so they are about an inch shorter. Wrap each hot dog with one slice of bacon at a slight angle. If you don't overlap the bacon, it should cover most of the hot dog. Lay the hot dogs on the foil so that the loose ends of the bacon are on the bottom. Bake 10-15 minutes, until the ends of the dogs are brown, then turn over to bake the other side for 5 minutes.
