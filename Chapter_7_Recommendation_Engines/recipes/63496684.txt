Description: 
My mom from German decent, would serve pork with sauerkraut, and mashed potatoes from time to time. one of them being in the new year. Contrary to popular belief, sauerkraut is not a national German dish, and is actually eaten mostly in Russia, United States, and France. During World War I, due to concerns the American public would reject a product with a German name, American sauerkraut makers relabeled their product as Liberty cabbage for the duration of the war.
