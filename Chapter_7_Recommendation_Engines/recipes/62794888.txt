Ingredients:
2 Cups Leftover Pot Roast, cut into 1/2” cubes
2 Cups (approx 1 lb) Carrots, finely diced
2 Cups (approx 2 lbs) Potatoes, finely diced
1 Onion, finely chopped
1 stick salted Butter, divided
salt and pepper to taste
2 Cups Beef Stock (Broth is too thin)
1/4 Cup Flour
6 - 9” Pie Crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Cut up beef, potatoes, carrots, and onions, keeping them separate. Place beef in a large bowl.  Melt 1.5 Tbs butter in large skillet. Add carrots and cook until fork tender, add to beef. Repeat with onion and 1 tbs. of butter; and potatoes with 2.5 tbs.
Melt remaining butter to skillet. Whisk in flour and cook over medium heat until combined and just starting to turn golden. Add beef stock and cook until thickened. Add gravy to beef and veggies.
Make your pie crusts (I like Krusteez pie crust mix) or take pre-made out of fridge to warm slightly. Unroll or roll dough out 1 at a time to about 10" round. Place dough into pie plate and fill half the pie with filling - roughly 1 1/4 cups. Fold dough over filling (to make a “half pie”) and crimp edges. Repeat until all dough and filling are used. With a sharp knife cut vents into the top of pasties.
Bake at 375 degrees for 45-55 minutes or until they are golden brown. Let cool 10-15 minutes in pans before serving. For left overs,  let cool to room temp before covering with foil or transferring to storage containers.  To freeze - once completely cool; remove from pan, wrap with foil, and place in a ziplock bag.  To reheat - microwave for 4-5 minutes on high or bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until center is hot.

I decided to try making pasties with my leftover pot roast. Pasties have always been a favorite except for the chewy meat, this solves that issue and the flavor is amazing!
