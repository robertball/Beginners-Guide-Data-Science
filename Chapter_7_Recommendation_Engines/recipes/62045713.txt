Ingredients:
2 C. sugar      2 C. butter
1 C. ground nuts, preferably walnuts
9 oz. milk chocolate candy bars (I use Hersheys)

Directions:
Combine sugar and butter in heavy pan; bring to a rapid boil. Stir constantly (this is very important).  When mixture begins to turn light tan, put in candy thermometer and cook to 300 degrees.  Remove from stove and stir in nuts; pour into 10"X15" jelly roll pan (do not butter it).  While still hot, place chocolate on top and let melt.  Spread chocolate out smoothly.  Place in refrigerator; when cold, break into pieces.
