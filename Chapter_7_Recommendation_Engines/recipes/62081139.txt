Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups flour (sifted, then measured)
1 egg
2 TBSP. sour creme
1/2 cip lukewarm water
1 tsp. salt

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in the food processer.  It will ball up like a piecrust.  Wrap this dough in plastic for 20 minutes.
Prepare filling for pierogi dough.  (I use saurkraut filling and ricotta cheese filling)
Roll dough out very thin on a small amount of flour.  Roll too thick and you will have a hard, rubbery dough.
Cut into 4" squares, or some people cut circles out of the dough.  Add about 2-3 TBSP. of filling to the center of your dough. (depending on the size of your squares)  It helps  seal the edges of pierogi to put a little water on the edges of your dough
then fold over the filling like a turnover, and press edges of dough together sealing the filling inside.
Place these pierogis in a pan of slow boiling water to which a tsp. of salt has been added.  When pierogis are cooked, the will float to the top.  Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a pan of melted butter. (not margerine) Fry both sides.  Eat and enjoy or they may be frozen for later use.  Layer in a pan after you fry them and then cover and freeze.

Description: 
Every Christmas Eve, we have Pierogi as part of our Polish tradition for the meatless meal.  This dough recipe is one of the best I have tried (of many) and because Pierogi is so good and depends as much on great dough as well as great filling, this is worth your effort to try.
