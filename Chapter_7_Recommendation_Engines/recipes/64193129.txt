Ingredients:
*The Crust*
A 9×13 baking pan
1 lb. roll of Pillsbury Sugar Cookie Dough
*The Caramel Layer*
1 (14 oz.) bag of caramels
1/2 cup heavy cream
*The Cookie Dough Layer*
3/4 cup (1 – 1/2 sticks) butter, softened to room temp.
2/3 cup brown sugar
2 tbs. heavy cream
1 – 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
1 cup all purpose flour
1/4 tsp. salt
3/4 cup mini semisweet chocolate chips
*The Chocolate Top Layer*
1-1/2 cups regular semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
A sprinkle of Sea Salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a 9×13 baking dish and line with parchment for extra insurance.
Press the cookie dough evenly down into the pan like a crust.
Bake according to the package directions, let it cool and set aside.
While the cookie crust is baking, combine the caramels and heavy cream in a medium saucepan over low heat.  Let melt, stirring occasionally until smooth, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the cookie dough layer.  Into a large bowl add the softened butter, brown sugar, flour, salt, heavy cream and vanilla.  Mix until it’s combined, fluffy and light in color  Stir in the mini chocolate chips.
Pour the melted caramel layer evenly over the cooled cookie crust.
Spread the cookie dough gently over the caramel layer.  Be careful not to press too hard into the caramel.  You want to be sure and keep the two layers separate.
Melt 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips with 1/4 cup peanut butter either in a saucepan, or in the microwave for a few seconds, stirring until combined and smooth.
Pour it over the cookie layer.
Evenly spread the chocolate over the top and sprinkle with salt.
Refrigerate for at least an hour and serve.
