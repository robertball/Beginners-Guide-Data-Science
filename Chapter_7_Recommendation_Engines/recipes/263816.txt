Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
2 (15 ounce) cans corn, rinsed and drained
6 Roma tomatoes, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste
3 serrano peppers, chopped, or more to taste (optional)
3 cloves garlic, chopped, or more to taste
1/2 cup lime juice, divided
4 avocados, sliced
2 (8 ounce) packages fajita-size flour tortillas
2 (8 ounce) packages crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Combine black beans, corn, tomatoes, onion, cilantro, serrano peppers, and garlic in a large bowl. Mix in 1/4 cup lime juice. Refrigerate mixture until flavors mingle, about 1 hour.
Place avocado in a container with remaining 1/4 cup lime juice, to prevent browning.
Place 5 tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave until warm and pliable, about 30 seconds. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Scoop bean mixture into tortillas; garnish with avocado slices and feta cheese. Serve cold.

Description: 
These vegetarian tacos are perfect for a hot summer day. Served cold, and a snap to put together, even the kids can do it! Always a hit at summer parties, and guilt free too. 
I came up with this recipe several years ago, because I wanted something tasty, quick, and nutritious, that wouldn't heat the house up. It's also great if you have limited access to a kitchen (think college dorms). Just a sharp knife and a spoon is needed to make this fresh summer recipe.
