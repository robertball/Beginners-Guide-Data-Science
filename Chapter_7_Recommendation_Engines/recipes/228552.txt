2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/4 cup pecan halves (optional)

Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.

Whisk eggs, milk, vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt in a bowl; pour over bread and allow to set for 1 hour at room temperature or cover and refrigerate overnight.

Uncover and bake in preheated oven until fluffy and golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.
