Ingredients:
3 sourdough pretzels, crushed
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 (16 ounce) package whole wheat elbow macaroni
6 slices bacon, chopped
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
2 carrots, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle beer
2 1/2 cups milk
3 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Combine the crushed pretzels and parmesan cheese in a small bowl. Set aside.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water, and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well.
Place the bacon in a large, deep pot, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Place the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Pour off the bacon fat, reserving 2 tablespoons of the fat.
Melt the butter in the saucepan with the reserved bacon fat over medium heat. Stir in the onion, celery, carrots, and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the flour, and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 3 minutes. Gradually whisk the mustard, the beer, and finally the milk into the flour mixture; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook and stir until the mixture is thick and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir in the cheese, bacon, red pepper, salt, and pepper. Turn off the heat, and stir in the cooked macaroni. Sprinkle with the pretzel and cheese mixture before serving.

Description: 
Inspired by cheddar beer soup and mac and cheese.  Use a beer that isn't too hoppy, and remember the quality of the beer influences the quality of the final dish.
