Ingredients:
1 pound lean thick-cut bacon
aluminum foil

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat.
Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place a cooling rack on top. Place bacon on rack, making sure no pieces are overlapping.
Place baking sheet on the grill grate, close the lid, and cook for 12 minutes or until desired doneness. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess grease.
