Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds butternut squash, peeled and cut into cubes (I've used frozen before)
3 ounces goat cheese
2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, minced
Kosher salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Once boiling add in a big pinch of salt and the cubed butternut squash.
Cook the butternut squash until soft, about 10-15 minutes depending how big your cubes are.
Drain the water out of the pot and add in the goat cheese, milk, rosemary, salt and pepper.
Mash with a potato masher or immersion blender/stick until desired mashed consistency is reached.
Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed.
