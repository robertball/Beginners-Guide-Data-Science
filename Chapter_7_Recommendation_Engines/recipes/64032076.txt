Ingredients:
1 1/4 lb asparagus (white or green), tough stem ends snapped off, then cut on the diagonal in 1" chunks
1/2 lb snow peas, stemmed and strings removed, cut on the diagonal in 1" chunks
3 medium sized scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
15 small red radishes, trimmed and thinly sliced
1/4 cup fresh snipped dill
3 tablespoons canola oil
1 teaspoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 to 4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice

Directions:
Blanch the asparagus in a large kettle of boiling water for 1 minute. Add snow peas to boiling water and blanch snow peas and asparagus for 1 more minute. Drain and pat dry.
Place the asparagus and snow peas into large mixing bowl. Add the scallions, radishes and dill; toss lightly. Quickly whisk the oil with sugar, salt and pepper and drizzle evenly over salad. Toss carefully and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 hours (best at room temperature)
When ready to serve, drizzle 3 tablespoons of the lime juice over the salad, toss carefully but thoroughly, taste. Add remaining lime juice if you prefer the salad to be more tart. Allow salad to sit 30 minutes at room temperature if it was refrigerated.
