Ingredients:
4 Medium Purple Radishes, sliced
Washed and Chopped Radish Greens from 1 bunch of fresh Radishes
1 Clove of Garlic, Minced
1 1/2 teaspoon Butter
1 Tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1 Ounce Feta Cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Heat Butter and Olive Oil in a sauce pan over medium low heat.  Add garlic, saute until garlic is soft and fragrant approximately 1 minute.  Add Radishes and saute them for 1-2 minutes, to bring out their sweetness.  Add the greens and saute until done, 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat and add the Feta Cheese, stir.  You can substitute sweet onion or shallots for the garlic.  A larger bunch of Radish greens will yield enough for 2 servings.

Description: 
It seems like such a waste to throw away or compost beautiful greens.  Radish greens have slightly peppery taste similar to Arugula. They are best fresh from the Farmers Market.
