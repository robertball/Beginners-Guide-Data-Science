Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups milk
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a bowl, combine oats, flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt. Combine milk, eggs and butter; stir into dry ingredients just until blended. Fold in pecans. Pour batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle; turn when bubbles form on top of pancakes. Cook until second side is golden brown.

Description: 
When I was a schoolteacher, these hearty pancakes--topped with my favorite syrup and fresh fruit--were the perfect energy booster for my hectic days. I still love their nutty flavor.
