Ingredients:
1 cup pineapple juice
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup light soy sauce
2 tablespoons of chili garlic sauce (or more if you like it spicy....like my godson)
2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins or strips
skewers

Directions:
In a small saucepan over medium heat, mix first 4 ingredients. Remove from heat just before the mixture comes to a boil.
Place chicken tenders in a medium bowl. Cover with the pineapple marinade, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat grill for medium heat. Thread chicken lengthwise onto wooden skewers.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken tenders 5 minutes per side, or until juices run clear. They cook quickly, so watch them closely.
