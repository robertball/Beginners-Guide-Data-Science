Ingredients:
1/3 cup melted butter
3 ripe bananas, or more to taste, mashed
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup coconut flakes
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup unsweetened cacao nibs
1/4 cup flax seeds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
Use a wooden spoon to mix butter into the mashed bananas in a large mixing bowl. Mix in sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Sprinkle baking soda and salt over the mixture and blend in. Add all-purpose and whole wheat flours; mix just until combined. Gently mix in coconut, walnuts, cacao nibs, and flax seeds.
Spoon batter into the muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
