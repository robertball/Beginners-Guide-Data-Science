Ingredients:
One 6 ounce package Canadian bacon
Six small eggs
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp pepper
Cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 F.  Spray muffin pan with cooking spray.  Arrange 2 pieces of Canadian bacon in each muffin cup, overlapping them.  (Candadian bacon molds more easily if it is warm.)  Place a pinch of shredded cheddar cheese into bottom of each cup.  Crack egg one at a time into a custard dish or measuring cup, and slide it into muffin cup.  Sprinkle with garlic powder and pepper.  Bake for 12-15 minutes depending on how well done you prefer your eggs.
