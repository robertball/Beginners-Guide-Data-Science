Ingredients:
1 Tenderflake® Deep Dish Pie Shell, thawed according to package instructions
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
2 eggs
1 cup pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie mix)
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat sugar, flour and cream cheese with electric mixer on low speed until smooth; reserve a scant 1/2 cup (125 mL). Add pumpkin pie spice, eggs and pumpkin. Beat on medium speed, scraping bowl constantly, until smooth. Pour into Tenderflake(R) Deep Dish Pie Shell.
Mix reserved cream cheese mixture and the milk. Spoon over pumpkin mixture. Cut through cream cheese and pumpkin mixtures with the tip of a paring knife in S-shaped curves to create a marbling effect.
BAKE in the bottom third of the oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 30 minutes. Cover loosely and refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving. Store in refrigerator.
