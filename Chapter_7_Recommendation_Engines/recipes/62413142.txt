Description: 
Al was my step Dad who was a wonderful man and a great cook!  One of his specialties was his Bloody Mary, and no matter how many pitchers he prepared for company, they always wanted more.  My only modification has been to add a bit of horseradish.  But you can serve that on the side instead.
