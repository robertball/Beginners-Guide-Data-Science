Ingredients:
1 (18 ounce) jar smooth peanut butter
1 1/4 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
36 milk chocolate candy kisses (such as Hershey's KissesÂ®), unwrapped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Stir peanut butter, 1 1/4 cup white sugar, and eggs together in a bowl; roll into small balls.
Place remaining 1/2 cup white sugar in a bowl and roll balls in sugar until coated. Arrange balls 1 inch apart on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until very lightly browned on the bottom and the edges are beginning to crack, 12 to 14 minutes. Immediately press a chocolate kiss into the center of each cookie. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 to 2 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 15 minutes.
