Ingredients:
1 box yellow or white cake mix
1 package instant butterscotch pudding (dry)
3 eggs
1 cup sour cream
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup water
2 cups peeled, cored, and chopped apple (2 large or 3 medium)
1/2 cup brown sugar
1-1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Grease and flour a 10 inch bundt pan.
Combine chopped apple, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl.
In a large, separate  bowl, combine cake mix, pudding mix, oil, sour cream, eggs, and water.
Mix well on low speed until completely blended, about 1-2 minutes.
Pour 2/3 of batter into prepared pan.
Top with apple mixture. (Discard any accumulated juices.)
Finish by adding remaining batter and smooth top to cover the apples completely.
Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until top is dry and springs back when touched firmly.
Allow to cool in pan on a rack for 15-20 minutes.
Turn out of pan onto rack and allow to cool completely.
When cool, place on a serving plate, and dust with powdered sugar.
Best if allowed to mellow overnight.

Description: 
Autumn comfort food at its finest! A showcase dessert with its lovely, amber color. Firm, tart apples work best, but you may use any leftovers lurking in the fridge that you need to use up.
