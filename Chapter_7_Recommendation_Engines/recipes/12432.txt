Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup shortening
1 1/4 cups ice water
1 teaspoon salt
5 1/2 cups thinly sliced potatoes
2 carrots, shredded
1 onions
1/2 cup diced rutabaga
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 pound lean ground pork
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons monosodium glutamate (MSG)
1 cube beef bouillon
1/2 cup hot water

Directions:
Whisk together flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut shortening.  Make a well in the center of the mixture, and quickly stir in ice cold water.  Form dough into a ball.  Set aside.
Dissolve the bouillon cube in the hot water.  Combine uncooked vegetables, uncooked meats, salt, pepper, monosodium glutamate, and bouillon.
Roll out pastry dough into 6 x 8 inch rectangles.  Place about 1 1/2 cups of filling in the center of each rectangle.  Bring 6 inch sides together, and seal.  Cut a slit in the top of each pasty.  Place on dull, not black, baking pans.
Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 45 minutes.
