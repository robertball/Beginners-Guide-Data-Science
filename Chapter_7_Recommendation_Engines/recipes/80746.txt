Description: 
I was bored and hungry, and wondering what I was going to do with some left-over pesto and some pesky sun-dried tomatoes that I wanted to get out of the fridge. I'm also a low-carber, so pasta was out of the question. It may seem kind of a weird combination, but the sun-dried tomatoes gave the tuna salad a nice sweetness and added an interesting texture.
