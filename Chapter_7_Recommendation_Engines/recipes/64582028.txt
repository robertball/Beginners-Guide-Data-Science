Ingredients:
4 large yellow onions
1 tsp horseradish
6 cups beef broth
4 cloves garlic
1 tsp sugar
2 sprigs thyme
1 sprig rosemary
salt
1 bay leaf
pepper
4 tbsp butter

Directions:
Peel and slice onions into 1/4-inch rings.
Saute with butter in pan, adding chopped garlic and the sprinkle of sugar halfway through. Saute, stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent and carmelized (about 10-12 minutes)
Add all but one cup of broth, thyme, rosemary and horseradish to crockpot. Turn on high and add onion mixture.
Pour remaining broth in onion pan and heat, deglazing and capturing the flavor left in the pan from the onions. Add to crock pot, cover and let cook for 4 hours on high.
Serve (after removing bay leaf, thyme and rosemary sprigs) with homemade croutons and your choice of cheese. Enjoy!!
