Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups black rice
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 shallot, minced
1 zucchini (courgettes), cut into 1/2-inch cubes, or more to taste
5 ounces peeled prawns
1 cup dry white wine
1 bunch chives, chopped
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add rice and cook until tender, about 18 minutes.
Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shallot until translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir zucchini into shallot mixture.
Mix prawns and white wine into zucchini mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until wine evaporates and prawns are fully cooked, 5 to 10 minutes.
Drain rice and stir in chives. Toss rice with the prawn mixture and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil over mixture.
