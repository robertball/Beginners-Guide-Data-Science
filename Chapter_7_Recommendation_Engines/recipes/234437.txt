Ingredients:
8 hot dogs
8 slices bacon
oil for frying
8 hot dog buns, split and toasted

Directions:
Wrap each hot dog with a strip of bacon; secure with a toothpick. Refrigerate wrapped hot dogs while heating oil.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry hot dogs in batches in the preheated oil until bacon is crispy and browned, 2 to 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Serve hot dogs in toasted buns.
