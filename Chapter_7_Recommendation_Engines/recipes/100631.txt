Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root

2 thin pineapple slices
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons lowfat plain yogurt
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
4 thick slices (3/4 inch thick) sourdough bread
1 cup iceberg lettuce, shredded

Directions:
Whisk together olive oil, vinegar, garlic, and ginger.  Toss the steaks and pineapple in the marinade, and refrigerate for one hour.  Meanwhile, whisk together mayonnaise, yogurt, orange juice, coriander, and curry powder in a separate bowl.
Preheat a grill for medium-high heat. Remove the steaks and pineapple from the marinade, and discard marinade.
Grill the filets and pineapple for about 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.  Spread the mayonnaise mixture onto 2 slices of sourdough bread. Top with steaks, lettuce and remaining slices of bread.
