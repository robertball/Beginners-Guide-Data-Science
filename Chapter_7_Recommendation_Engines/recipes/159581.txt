Description: 
I used to visit my friend Teresa in Brownsville, TX. We would cross the border to this open air vendor/food stand to eat this. The cook did not or could not hide her ingredients, so we know what was put in this dish. You can serve this with rice, beans, or make it into wraps. The ingredients are very forgiving, so feel free to increase or decrease the amount stated.
