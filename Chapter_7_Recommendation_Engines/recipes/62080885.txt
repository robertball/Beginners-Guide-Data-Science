Ingredients:
3 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup sugar
1 cup vinegar
1 tbsp dry mustard
1 tbsp flour
3 quarts salad dressing
1/2 cup mustard
1/4 cup vinegar
salt & pepper to taste
20-25 pounds of potatoes
3 dozen eggs, hard boiled
2 large onions
1-1 1/2 cups of celery

Directions:
Boil until thick and cool until cool: 3 beaten eggs, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 cup vinegar, 1 tbsp dry mustard and 1 tbsp flour.  Then add the salad dressing, 1/2 cup mustard, 1/4 cup vinegar, salt, and pepper.  Then pour over potatoes, onions, 3 dozen hard boiled eggs and celery. I think this is better if made the day before serving it.
