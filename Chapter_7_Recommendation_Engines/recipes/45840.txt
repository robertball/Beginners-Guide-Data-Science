Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound ground beef
5 medium potatoes - peeled and cubed
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 cup chopped green chile peppers
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 cups water
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Crumble beef into pot and cook, stirring frequently, until well-browned. Drain excess fat, and return to the stove.
Add potatoes, stewed tomatoes, green chilies, onion, and water to the pot with the beef, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 1 hour to blend flavors. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.
