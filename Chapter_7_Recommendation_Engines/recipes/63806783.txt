Ingredients:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breast
4 large or 6-8 small whole wheat tortillas
green olives optional

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Cut each chicken breast into 4 equal tenders lengthwise. Season with your favorite seasonings.
3. Cut tortillas into thin strips, approximately 1/2 inch wide.
4. Heat a non-stick skillet to medium high, or spray an ordinary skillet with cooking spray. Brown the chicken tenders for 2-3 minutes.
5. Take the tenders out of the skillet and allow to cool for 1-2 minutes, or until just cool enough to handle. Starting at one end, wrap each chicken tender with tortilla strips, overlapping when starting a new strip and leaving a gap at the top for the mummy's face.
6. Place wrapped tenders on a baking sheet and bake for approximately 10 minutes.
7. Allow mummies to cool for a minute, then decorate with olive slices for eyes, or use a condiment of choice to create faces. Serve immediately.
