Ingredients:
-pie crust for double crust pie
-1 stick salted butter, softened
-8 oz tube marzipan or almond paste, broken into small pieces
-2 Tbs flour
-2 eggs, slightly beaten
-4 large bartlett pears, peeled, cored, and sliced lengthwise into 1/4 inch strips
-sugar, for sprinkling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line a 9 inch pie dish with the bottom crust.  In a food processor, blend the butter and marzipan until smooth, then add flour and eggs and continue mixing until very smooth.  Pour into pie crust.  Mound the sliced pears over marzipan cream, cover with the top crust and flute the edges.  Make a few slices in the top crust to vent.  Bake at 375 for about 45 min, keeping an eye on the crust for overbrowning.  If the edges or the top begin to get too dark, just cover loosley with foil.  Remove from oven and sprinkle with sugar.  Cool completely before serving to give the filling a chance to set.

Description: 
A different take on a pear pie, using sweet almond paste (marzipan) in the cream filling.  The almond flavor delicately compliments the pears, without too much sweetness.  Select pears that are just ripe, not too firm or too soft.
