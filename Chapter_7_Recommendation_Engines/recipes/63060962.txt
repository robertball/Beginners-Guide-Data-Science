Ingredients:
3 tablespoons trans-fat-free margarine
2 tablespoons hot-pepper sauce, or more to taste
1 teaspoon canola oil
3 (6-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 24 (1") cubes
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 celery stalks, cut into 24 (1") pieces

Directions:
Melt margarine in a medium nonstick saucepan. Whisk in pepper sauce and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until slightly thickened; set aside.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper, add to pan, and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 6 minutes. Add margarine mixture to pan and gently toss chicken until well coated, 1 to 2 minutes.
Remove chicken from pan and skewer each cube with a toothpick. Skewer 1 piece of celery at the base of each. Arrange on a platter and serve with dip.
