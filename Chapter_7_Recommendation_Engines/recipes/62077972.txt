Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1/2 cup sugar
10 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 eggs
1/4 cup Kahlua coffee liquer
4 cups graham wafer crumbs
2 cups shredded coconut
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup butter
4 cups confectioner's sugar
4 tablespoons vanilla custard powder
1/4 cup Bailey's Irish Cream liquer
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup Gran Marnier orange liquer

Directions:
Crust: Mix butter, white sugar, cocoa powder, eggs in a heavy saucepan or double boiler. Once eggs have been incorporated into mixture, add Kahlua and cook over low heat until mixture is of a custard like consistency.
Combine graham wafer crumbs, coconut and chopped walnuts together and then add to the melted mixture.  Mix well and pack into a buttered 13 by 9 inch cake pan.  (You can also line with greased wax paper for easy removal if you like, only remove the wax paper before cutting).
Filling: Cream butter, confectioner's sugar, custard powder and Bailey's Irish Cream.  Beat until creamy and spread over the base crust. Refrigerate until hardened.
Topping: Melt semi-sweet chocolate chips and butter in a double boiler. Quickly stir in Gran Marnier liquid.  Drizzle over the custard filling until completely covered.  Refrigerate until hard.
Cut into 2 inch by 1 inch bars with knife.  Run knife under hot water periodically to make cutting easier.

Description: 
This is a variation of the classic Nanaimo Bars, but it tastes like a B-52 shooter.  I was tempted to call these Campbell River Bars because you need a drink if you live in nearby Campbell River - but decided against it.  These are a great alternative to Nanaimo Bars or Rum Balls.
