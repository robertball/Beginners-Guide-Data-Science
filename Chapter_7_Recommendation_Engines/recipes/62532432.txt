Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1/2 cup unsalted butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup water
8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
Additionally, I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1 tsp. vanilla to apples.

Directions:
Melt butter in a sauce pan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add white sugar, brown sugar and water; bring to a boil. Reduce temperature, and simmer 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work of crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
Bake 15 minutes at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
Tired of ordinary old apple pie? Well this fabulous recipe adds a delicious twist to the apply classic. Sliced, unadorned apples are mounded into a pie crust and topped with a lattice crust. Then, just before baking, a sweet, thick sugar syrup is poured carefully onto the crust. An hour later, the apples are tender and fragrant and the crust a glistening brown.Modified from: Grandma Ople's  Apple Pie
