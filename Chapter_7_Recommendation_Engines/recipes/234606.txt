2 tablespoons olive oil
2 large onions, sliced thin
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
Salt and ground black pepper
12 ounces cheese (your choice), cut into slices to fit buns
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
24 slider buns, about 2 1/2 inches in diameter

Directions:
Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and saute, until caramelized. Stir in thyme, a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper, and the apple butter. Cook to heat through.
Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees F.
Set bun bottoms on a sheet pan and top each with a portion of cheese. Top cheese with a portion of flavored onions.
Spread each bun top with a portion of mustard and cap each sandwich. Bake sliders until cheese melts, 5-7 minutes. Serve.
