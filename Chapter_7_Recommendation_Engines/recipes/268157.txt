Ingredients:
1 turkey neck and giblets
6 cups chicken broth
2 large white onions, sliced
1 cup sliced carrots
1 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup celery leaves
6 cloves garlic, peeled
1 bay leaf
1/2 cup turkey drippings, or to taste
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons butter, softened
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut turkey neck in half. Set liver aside.
Combine neck, giblets, broth, onions, carrots, wine, celery, garlic, and bay leaf in a pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Add liver and simmer for 30 minutes more.
Mix flour and butter together to form a thick paste.
Remove and discard neck and giblets. Strain broth, pressing vegetables to extract liquid. Discard vegetables. Add turkey drippings. Add flour mixture gradually and stir until smooth. Bring to a boil and cook until desired thickness is reached, 7 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
My mother has made this old-fashioned giblet gravy every Thanksgiving for as long as I can remember! It is delicious with turkey and mashed potatoes. Start making this while the turkey is cooking since it requires about two hours of simmering.
