Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons Monin lavender syrup
1 cup butter, softened
1 2/3 cups granulated white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 egg whites

Directions:
In a bowl, combine 1 cup of granulated white sugar and dribble 1 tablespoon of Monin lavender syrup into the sugar; whisk vigorously until combined, and set aside for 2 hours (there should be no large clumps of wet sugar).  Whisk again and set aside until dry (reserve the Â½ teaspoon for creaming into the butter).  The lavender flavoured sugar will be sprinkling on top of the cookies at a later stage
In a bowl, cream butter, 2/3 cup granulated white sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of Monin lavender syrup; combine flour, cornstarch and salt; add to the creamed mixture.  Divide dough in half.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until easy to handle
On a lightly floured surface, roll out one portion of dough to 1/4-in. thickness; cut into 1-1/2-in. squares.  Repeat with remaining dough
Place 1 in. apart on un-greased baking sheets.  Prick with a fork several times.  Bake at 325 degrees for 18-22 minutes or until edges are lightly browned; cool for 1 minute before removing to wire racks to cool completely
In a small bowl, whisk egg whites and brush on the top side of each cookie.  Dust cookies with the flavoured lavender sugar; store in airtight containers.  Yield: about 4 dozen
