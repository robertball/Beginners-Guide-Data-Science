Ingredients:
2 cups milk
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup white sugar
1 pinch salt
1 dash vanilla extract
1 pinch ground nutmeg (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Whisk milk, eggs, sugar, salt, and vanilla together in a bowl until completely combined. Pour egg mixture into 6 custard cups; sprinkle tops with nutmeg. Place cups in a baking pan and fill pan with enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the custard cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until custards are set, about 1 hour. Cool completely.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite foods when I am feeling blah. It is sweet and comforting and full of mild protein. Use custard cups or one casserole bowl.
