Ingredients:
4 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (2 pound) London broil

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together garlic, soy sauce, oil, ketchup, oregano, and black pepper. Pierce meat with a fork on both sides. Place meat and marinade in a large resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate 6-8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat grill for medium-high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Place steak on the grill, and discard marinade. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes per side, depending on thickness. Do not overcook, as it is better on the rare side. Let rest for 10 minutes, slice thin and serve.
