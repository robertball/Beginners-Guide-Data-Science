Description: 
This recipe is a family tradition at Christmas time. I only make it at Christmas time because, although it's super simple, fast and easy to make, frankly, it's addicting and I can't quit eating it until it's all gone.!  Take a bite and it disintegrates into a mouth full of heaven!  ENJOY!
