1 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar

1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup hot water
4 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup butter at room temperature
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.
