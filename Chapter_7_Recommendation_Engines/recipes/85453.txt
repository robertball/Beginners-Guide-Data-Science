Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, chopped
2 eggs
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons matzo meal
1/2 cup potato starch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 inch square pan.
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the unsweetened chocolate. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer for about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low, and pour in the chocolate and butter, then stir in the vanilla. In a separate bowl, stir together the matzo meal, potato starch and salt. Use a spoon to stir into the chocolate mixture until well blended. Mix in the walnuts or chocolate chips if using. Pour into the prepared pan and spread evenly.
Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until the brownies are dry on top and begin to pull away from the sides.

Description: 
My family always complained that baked goods that were kosher for Passover tasted terrible, so I took my regular brownie recipe and created a flour and leavening-free version that tastes just as good as the non-Passover version!
