Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 ½ pounds chicken tenders, halved lengthwise
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
¾ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups cubed mango
1  red onion, sliced
1  red bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch strips
1  green bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch strips
2 tablespoons agave nectar
2 tablespoons lime juice
12 (6 inch) corn tortillas, warmed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.
Combine chicken, olive oil, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Add mango, onion, peppers, agave, and lime juice; toss until fully coated. Spread 1/2 of the chicken mixture in a single layer on each baking sheet.
