Ingredients:
8 lean chicken thighs, skin removed
salt
fresh pepper
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1 cup fat free chicken broth
1 tbs honey
1 tbs tomato paste
1 tsp butter
1 large shallot, thinly sliced (3/4 cup)
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 tbs light sour cream
2 tbs fresh chopped parsley

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine vinegar, honey, 3/4 cup chicken broth and tomato paste.  Boil about 5 minutes, until it reduces down to about 3/4 cup.  Remove from heat.
In a large skillet, melt butter over medium low heat and add chicken.  Cook on both sides until brown about 608 minutes.  Remove chicken and set aside.  Add the shallots and garlic to the skillet and cook on low until soft, about 5 minutes.  Pour the sauce over the chicken, add the wine, remaining broth salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer about 20 minutes until tender.  Remove the chicken, add sour cream and stir into the sauce (if sauce dries up, add more broth).  Boil a few minutes then return chicken to skillet.  Top with fresh parsley.
