Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 cup grated onion
1 packet dry spaghetti sauce mix
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook the beef, garlic, and onion in a large pot over medium-high heat until the beef has browned; stirring often to break up the meat.  Stir in the sauce mix, tomato sauce, and tomato paste.  Reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 30 minutes, adding water to thin if needed.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This recipe is one my mom used to make and everyone always loved it! It is quick and simple and very delicious!  I've found it easy to mash the beef with a potato masher.
