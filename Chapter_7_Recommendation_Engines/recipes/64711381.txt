Ingredients:
2 zucchinis, thinly sliced
1/4 cup of flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
Pinch ground black pepper
1/2 cup ranch dressing
1/2 cup whole wheat bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
Non-stick cooking spray

Directions:
Heat air fryer to 400 degrees.
Mix flour, salt, and pepper together in one bowl.
Pour ranch dressing into a second bowl.
In a third bowl, mix together bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, and garlic powder.
Dredge each piece of zucchini in flour mixture, then dip into ranch dressing, coating both sides and shaking off excess dressing.  Follow by dipping into the bread crumb mixture, pressing the breading lightly onto the zucchini chip.
Spray the basket of the air fryer with non-stick cooking spray, then place breaded zucchini chips in the basket in a single layer.  Cook for 5-6 minutes, until browned.  Repeat with the remaining zucchini chips.
Serve with ranch dressing to dip if desired.

Description: 
Ranch dressing gives these breaded zucchini chips a zesty flavor.  Cooking them in an air fryer gives you the crispiness, but not the guilt, vs. traditional frying.
