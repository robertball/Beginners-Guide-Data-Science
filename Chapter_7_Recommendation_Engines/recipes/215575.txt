Description: 
KM style watermelon is a really cool refreshing way to do watermelon! It is especially satisfying on a hot day. GREAT addition to any barbecue! Most refreshing if allowed to chill until cool in the refrigerator, but not required. Will keep in refrigerate for a week or so, but it'll probably be eaten all before then.
