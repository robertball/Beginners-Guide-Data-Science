Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 cup soy milk
1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/3 cups mashed ripe bananas
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 cup dried figs, chopped

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease two 8.5 x4.5 inch pans.
Mix together the eggs, soy milk, brown sugar, oil, and mashed bananas in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside. In a large bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon; pour in the egg mixture, and stir just until combined. Divide batter into prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
