Ingredients:
1 cup fresh coconut milk
1 cup uncooked white rice
1/2 cup water
1 slice ginger
2 pandan leaves, or more to taste
1 pinch salt
Spicy Paste:
4 fresh red chile peppers
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 large onion, chopped
Garnish:
1/2 cup anchovy fillets, or more to taste
1/2 cup finely chopped peanuts, or more to taste
4 hard-boiled eggs, halved lengthwise
1 cucumber, peeled and sliced

Directions:
Combine coconut milk, rice, water, ginger, pandan leaves, and rice in a rice cooker and stir a few times. Cover and cook according to manufacturer's directions until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Put chile peppers in a blender or food processor and grind into a paste.
Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add ground chile peppers and cook until incorporated, about 2 minutes more.
Heat another pan over medium heat. Add anchovies and peanuts and roast until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
Divide cooked rice into 4 individual serving bowls in a rounded shape. Add 2 tablespoons of spicy paste, a pinch of anchovy-peanut mixture, 2 hard-boiled egg halves, and a portion of sliced cucumber to each bowl.
