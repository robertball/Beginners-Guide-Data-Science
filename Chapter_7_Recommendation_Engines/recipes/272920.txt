Ingredients:
cooking spray
8 slices bacon, or to taste
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 (4 ounce) can diced jalapenos (such as Ortega(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
½ cup sour cream
½ cup mayonnaise
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
2 pounds shredded cooked chicken

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a casserole dish with cooking spray.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble.
Mix 1/2 of the bacon crumbles with 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, jalapenos, sour cream, mayonnaise, and garlic salt. Add chicken and mix well. Pour mixture into the prepared casserole dish and spread evenly. Top with remaining bacon and cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and casserole is heated through, about 30 minutes.
