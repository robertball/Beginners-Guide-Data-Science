Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound chicken livers, trimmed and chopped
1 medium onion, sliced
1  green bell pepper, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
7  mushrooms, sliced
1 (14.5 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes, drained
1 cup white wine
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups chicken stock
Â¾ cup milk
1 cup dry polenta
4 ounces Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and bell pepper, and season with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until tender. Add mushrooms and garlic to the skillet, and cook for a few minutes until fragrant. Move the vegetables to the sides of the skillet, and add the chicken livers.  Cook livers for 5 minutes, turning frequently.
Stir tomatoes and wine into the skillet, and turn the heat to medium-high. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until most of the liquid is gone. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, pour chicken stock into a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Slowly pour in polenta while stirring vigorously. Cook for a few minutes, then stir in milk. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about 5 minutes, until thick. Stir gorgonzola into the polenta until melted.
Spoon polenta onto plates, and cover with the chicken liver sauce.
