Pour limeade into a large pitcher with a lid; stir in water, rum, grenadine syrup, lime juice, and bitters until well mixed. Cover pitcher and freeze punch until slushy, 8 hours to overnight.

Description: 
I make this fun and refreshing drink every 4th of July. It starts out with a slush base. The bitters off-set the sweetness just the right amount, and it's a beautiful color. Can be served in a punch bowl, or individual servings. Garnish with cherries, orange slices or other desired fresh fruit.
