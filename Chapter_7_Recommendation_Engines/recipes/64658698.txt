Ingredients:
Brewed Coffee
1/2 Tsp vanilla
1/2 can of pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie mix) approximately 7.5 ounces
1 drop of Thieves essential oil (bonus points of immune system support with your coffee treat)
If you don’t have Thieves oil, you can use 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.
1/2 cup milk
1 tbsp vanilla flavored coffee creamer (or if you want to use heavy cream or an unflavored milk alternative just double the vanilla)

Directions:
Blend all ingredients except the coffee in your blender. Add three tablespoons to a cup of brewed coffee (6-8 ounce cup) and stir well. Add the sweetener of your choice if desired and enjoy. Freeze the rest in a muffin tin, spooning out 3 tablespoons each into 4 muffin cups. Just like that you’ve got a week worth of pumpkin spice latte goodness.
Brew a cup or a pot of coffee.
