Ingredients:
2 large bell peppers
1/2 cup of dry barley
1 cup of refried beans (Ortega sells "reduced fat" beans without lard)
a dash of black pepper
a sprinkle of daiya (optional)

Directions:
Measure out 1/2 cup of barley to about 1 1/2 cups of water. Pour the barley in with the water and bring it to a boil.
Once the water has started boiling, cover the pot and lower the heat to a simmer. Let it simmer for around 30 minutes, or until most of the water is absorbed.
When most of the water is absorbed, remove the barley from the burner and leave the top on for another 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, steam your bell peppers for 5 minutes.
Remove the peppers from the steamer and rinse under cold water. Then cut off the tops and discard, or save them to cover the filling in the peppers for when they are ready to be baked.
Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
Move the barley to a large bowl and mix in 1 cup of refried beans.
Sprinkle in the black pepper and mix well.
Stuff the peppers with the barley and refried beans mixture. If desired, sprinkle with daiya cheese.
Bake in a small corningware dish, upright. If the peppers are too tall for the top to fit, cover instead with aluminum foil.
Bake for 30 minutes and then let cool for at least 5 before servings. The contents will be very hot!
Enjoy!
