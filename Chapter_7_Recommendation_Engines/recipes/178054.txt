Ingredients:
2 (10 inch) whole wheat tortillas
3 cups fresh spinach leaves
2/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 green onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon chili powder

Directions:
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Place 1 tortilla onto the skillet. Sprinkle about half the Cheddar cheese evenly over the tortilla. Top with the spinach, green onions, garlic powder, and chili powder. Cover with the remaining Cheddar cheese. Place the second tortilla on top.
Cook until the bottom tortilla starts to develop a bit of color and starts to crisp, about 3 minutes. To flip and cook the other side, slide the quesadilla off the non-stick pan onto a dinner plate, cover with another dinner plate and flip. The crispy tortilla side should now be on top. Slide the quesadilla back onto the pan and cook until the bottom tortilla starts turning crisp, about 3 minutes more. Slide onto a cutting board, and cut into 8 wedges to serve.

Description: 
This is a super quick, easy, and light dinner. This also makes a great snack or appetizer. It looks like a lot of spinach at first, but it shrinks down a lot in no time during cooking. Other types of tortillas can be used if whole wheat isn't available. Serve with salsa and sour cream.
