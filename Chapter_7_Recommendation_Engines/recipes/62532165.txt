Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 cloves minced garlic
sea salt (or kosher salt)
14.5 ounce can diced tomatoes
8 ounce can tomato sauce
2 teaspoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a large pan, heat the extra virgin olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onions and garlic.  Cover to sweat them for 3 - 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and sugar.  Stir and turn the heat to medium high; bring to a boil.
Turn the heat down to medium, and add the red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and black pepper.  Simmer, partially covered for about 10 minutes, or until sauce is reduced by about 1/3.  (If serving with pasta, this is a good time to cook the pasta.)
Stir in the grated parmesan cheese.  Serve over freshly cooked pasta, or reserve for another use.
