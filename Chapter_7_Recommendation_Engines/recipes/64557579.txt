Ingredients:
Fresh Asparagus, Trimmed - 2 Pounds
Olive Oil - 1/4 Cup
Garlic, Minced - 4-6 Cloves
Fresh Lemon Zest - 1 Teaspoons
Dried Oregano - 1 Teaspoon
Red Pepper Flakes - 1/4 Teaspoon
Salt - To Taste
Black Pepper - To Taste
Feta Cheese, Crumbled - 1/2 Cup
Lemon - 1

Directions:
1. In a small sauce pan heat the olive oil, garlic, lemon zest, oregano, and red pepper flake over low heat just until the garlic starts to become golden.  Remove pan from heat and cool about 10 minutes. (Garlic will continue to brown a bit more)
2. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
3. On a rimmed baking sheet, toss asparagus with infused oil until well coated. Arrange asparagus into a single layer, using a second baking sheet if necessary. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss Feta evenly over asparagus.
4. Roast asparagus in preheat oven 10-12 minutes until it reaches desired tenderness.
5. Cut lemon in half and squeeze lemon over asparagus and serve.

I got this recipe from 'Gonna want seconds'  Thanks
It’s important that all the asparagus gets well coated  with the infused oil so make sure you toss it well and spread the garlic out a bit, dont just pour it on top of the asparagus.

I toss the whole thing  right on the baking sheet I’m going to use then straighten the asparagus out into a single layer.

You may need to use 2 baking sheets in order to get a single layer depending on the thickness of your asparagus.

You don’t want to crowd the asparagus or it won’t roast properly.
