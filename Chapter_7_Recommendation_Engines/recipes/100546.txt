Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package firm tofu, drained
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon mirin (sweetened rice wine)
2 teaspoons sesame oil, or to taste
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1 large tomato, seeded and chopped
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
Â¼ cup chopped cilantro
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Place tofu between two plates, and weigh down with a heavy book.  Allow tofu to drain for 1 hour, pouring out the expelled liquid every 20 minutes.
Whisk together the soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil, and rice vinegar in a small bowl.  Heat the oil in a small pan over medium heat, stir in the garlic and ginger, and gently cook until lightly golden; stir into the soy sauce mixture.
Cut tofu into bite-sized pieces, and toss together with the tomato, onion, and cilantro.  Pour in the dressing and toss to coat.  Garnish with a sprinkle of sesame seeds.
