Ingredients:
2 large links hot Italian Sausage
2 Liters chicken Broth
2 large carrots sliced
2 large potatoes, diced
3 stalks celery, sliced
1/2 large onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, crushed
3 bay leaves
1 14oz. tin crushed tomatoes
1/2 bag coleslaw mix
heavy cream to taste.
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Brown and crumble sausage in dutch oven or soup pot.  Add all ingredients except cream.  Bring to boil and simmer 45 minutes to 1 hour, till all veggies are tender.  Once soup is ready to serve add a bit of heavy cream to each individual bowl.  Some people might not like this addition and that is why I add it to the bowls rather than in the pot.  Enjoy!!
