Description: 
I 'inherited' this recipe from the family that owned the building where I rented my first apartment. It's one of my favorites and very easy to prepare. It's great for company because you can mix the loaf in advance, then simply pour on the sauce before putting it in the oven...it's the sauce that makes it so good!
