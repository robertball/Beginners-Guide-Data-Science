Ingredients:
5 tbsp. flour
1 c. milk
1 c. sugar
1 c. butter, softened
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Combine flour and milk in a cup/shaker and shake to mix. Pour into a saucepan and heat over low heat, stirring as it thickens into a paste, being careful to not scorch. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely.
Beat butter for 4 minutes, add sugar and beat with mixer for 4 minutes more. Add this to cooled flour/milk paste and add vanilla. Beat until smooth and fluffy. Ice cooled cake as soon as possible.
