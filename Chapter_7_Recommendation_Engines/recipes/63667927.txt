Ingredients:
1 sheet nori
Olive oil, for brushing
Salt, to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300*F.
Cut the nori sheets into thin strips. There should be folded lines on the nori for you to follow along to cut.
VERY lightly oil a cookie sheet and place the nori on a baking sheet in a single layer, I placed them smooth side down.
VERY lightly brush the nori with oil and sprinkle with sea salt. It should stick to the oil.
Bake for about 3-4 minutes, until the nori chips become dry, green, and crispy.
