Ingredients:
Citrus Sake Sauce:
6 tablespoons Holland House® Sake Cooking Wine
1/4 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
1 teaspoon grated or minced fresh ginger
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro (optional)
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
Stir Fry:
1 (14 ounce) package firm tofu, drained
1 tablespoon cooking oil
1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen sugar snap peas
3 medium carrots, thinly sliced
3/4 cup thinly sliced onion

Directions:
Stir together sauce ingredients. Set aside while preparing stir fry.
Pat tofu dry with a towel to remove excess water. Cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add oil and tofu; stir frequently until tofu is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add snow peas, carrots and onion. Stir-fry about 5 minutes until vegetables are cooked, but still crisp. Stir in prepared sauce and cook 1-2 minutes until sauce is slightly thickened. Serve immediately.
