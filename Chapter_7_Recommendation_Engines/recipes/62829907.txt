Ingredients:
1/2 lbs. Ground Lamb
1/4 C. Minced onion ( I prefer shallots)
1 ts. Minced garlic
1 minced hot chili
2 Ts minced parsely
Salt-Pepper to taste
1 C. greek yogurt (place in cheesecloth to drain in fridge overnight)
1 Ts chiffonade mint.
2 Ts olive oil
little cornstarch

Directions:
Combine Lamb,onion,garlic,1Ts oil, parsely and chili. Season with salt and pepper let rest in fridge.
For the wrappers- in Lg bowl place flour and slowly add 1 3/4 C cold water and remaining oil. Stiring constantly with two forks, a mixer or the good ol' fashion way-your hand.
Place dough on a floured surface and knead until smooth. Place i clean bowl, cover and place in fridge for about 1.5 hrs.
If you are impatient as I tend to be cheat and buy canned biscuits.
Roll out dough in to 1 inch ropes, cut into 3/4in. pieces. Now roll those out into 2in circles.
Now fill ea. circle with desired amount of meat filling. Fold to form 1/2 cirle pleating edges as you go.
After that dust with a touch of the starch and drop into salted water at a rolling boil. When they float, cook for 2min then drain.
Place yogurt into saute pan over med. heat. When the yogurt has warmed through add dumplings and mint give a good toss and serve.
