Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup frozen corn
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 cup salsa
1 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere'sÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15.5 ounce) can great northern beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Cook and stir turkey in a skillet until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute corn, celery, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add ground turkey. Stir in tomatoes, salsa, chicken broth, chili powder, cilantro, cayenne, Creole seasoning, cumin, and oregano. Simmer over medium-low heat until flavors combine, about 30 minutes.
Add beans to the pot and simmer for 15 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese and stir until completely melted.

Description: 
This is the best white chili variation, and it is healthier than most. This won first prize at our company chili cook-off.  The other contestants were mad when they learned how easy the recipe is and that I had prepared it an hour before the competition. I make a double batch and fill a gallon-sized zip-top bag and freeze for great leftovers.
