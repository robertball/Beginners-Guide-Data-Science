Ingredients:
2 cups (300 g) raw peanuts
1/4 cup (80 g) light corn syrup, agave nectar, or rice syrup
2 tablespoons (30 g) light brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt or “fleur de sel”

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 C).
Lightly oil a baking sheet or line it with a silicone baking mat.
In a bowl, mix together the peanuts, corn syrup, and light brown sugar, until the peanuts are well-coated.
Sprinkle the salt over the peanuts and stir just a few times, but not enough to dissolve the salt.
Spread the peanuts evenly on the baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes, stirring three or four times during baking, until the nuts are deep-golden brown and glazed.
Cool completely, then store in an airtight container immediately, to preserve their crispness.
Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Makes 2 cups.

Description: 
These are terrific as a snack... when served to company make sure you have lots on hand as they disappear very quickly. They are really good as well if you dip them in bittersweet chocolate...
