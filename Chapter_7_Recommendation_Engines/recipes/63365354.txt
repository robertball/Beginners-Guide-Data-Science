Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 Cup brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 Cup white sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
6 Tablespoons cream sherry
1 Tablespoon grated orange zest (colored part of skin)
1 teaspoon orange extract -- optional
2 Tablespoons butter
5 Cups walnut halves

Directions:
Combine sugars, salt, sherry, zest and extract (if using) in a large saucepan. Stir. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add butter, and stir to blend well, and boil for 2 to 3 minutes, again stirring frequently. Remove from heat and add nuts. Toss well until coating sets a bit and covers all the nuts.
Pour the mixture onto a large piece of aluminum foil. Spread out and cool (the nuts will be clumpy, not flat like peanut brittle). When cooled, break into pieces and store in an airtight container.

Description: 
I submitted an earlier version of Sherried Orange Walnuts to Allrecipes.com, which I have loved for years, but like some of the reviewers said, I wanted a more glazed type of walnut. With the holidays approaching, I played with the recipe, and now can submit a revised version, where the walnuts come out glazed and brittle. They are wonderful, and still freeze well. The sherry flavor is a bit more subdued, but they're still divine!
