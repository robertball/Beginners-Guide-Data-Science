Ingredients:
1 quart chicken broth
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 onion, minced
1 1/4 cups Arborio rice
1/2 cup white wine
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons white truffle oil
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon milk, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Heat chicken broth in a stockpot over medium-low heat until warmed.
Heat 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan; cook and stir onion in the melted butter-oil mixture until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add rice to onion mixture and stir to coat; cook and stir rice mixture until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour wine into rice mixture; cook and stir until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Add 1 ladle of hot chicken broth to rice mixture, stirring constantly, until broth is absorbed. Continue adding 1 ladle of broth at a time until rice is tender but firm to the bite, 20 to 30 minutes.
Mix 2 tablespoons butter, truffle oil, Parmesan cheese, and milk into risotto until fully incorporated; season with salt, pepper, and parsley.

Description: 
I created this recipe because there is nothing quite like creamy, savory rice. It is so delicious and filling, it can be a meal in itself! You do need to tend to the stove for 30 minutes for stirring, but it is definitely worth the effort. I used regular milk (not cream) and it was absolutely heavenly and creamy! Serve as soon as possible (as it turns like glue if held too long!)
