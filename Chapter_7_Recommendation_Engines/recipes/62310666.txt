Ingredients:
1  pound wagon wheel-shaped pasta
1  can (15-ounces) great northern beans, drained and rinsed
1  can (14-1/2-ounces) no-salt-added stewed tomatoes
1  can (10 ounces) mild enchilada sauce (such as Old El Paso)
1  teaspoon hot chili powder
1/2  teaspoon ground cumin
1/4  teaspoon salt
1  package (12-ounces) soy crumbles (such as Morningstar Farms)
1  cup shredded reduced-fat sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
Cook pasta following package directions. Drain and return to pot.
While pasta is cooking, prepare sauce. In a large skillet, stir together beans, tomatoes, enchilada sauce, chili powder, cumin and salt. Break up tomatoes with a wooden spoon. Simmer over medium heat for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the soy crumbles and simmer for an additional 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir the sauce into pot with pasta. Add half of the cheese, and stir to blend.
Spoon pasta into a large serving bowl and sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese over the top. Serve immediately.
