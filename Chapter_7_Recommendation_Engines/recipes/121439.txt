Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1 cup chopped raisins
1 cup water
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts
GLAZE:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the first six ingredients. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat; cool to room temperature. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Add raisin mixture; mix well. Stir in walnuts. Fill greased or paper-line miniature muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-16 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. For glaze, combine the confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough milk to achieve desired consistency. Drizzle over cooled muffins.
