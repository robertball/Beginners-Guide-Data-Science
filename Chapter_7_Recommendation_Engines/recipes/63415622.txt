Ingredients:
Pan Drippings
Turkey Stock (usually from cooking the gibblets for the stuffing)
1/4 cup Butter (melted)
1/4 - 1/2 cup milk
1-2 cups Flour
Salt and pepper to tasts

Directions:
Siphon the turkey drippings from the cooked turkey into a large pot.
Bring it up to a nice simmer and add the turkey stock (1-2 cups)
Melt the butter
Make a roux by mixing the butter and flour together to form a paste. (this will eliminate lumps)
Drop spoonfuls of the paste into the simmering liquid. Use whisk to break up the paste which will melt into the hot liquid. This will soon begin to thicken the gravy.
If it becomes too thick, thin by adding a bit of milk or broth until you reach the right consistency.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.

This is the way Grandma Lois used to make her gravy. Much of this is by eyeball since you never know how much liquid you'll have
