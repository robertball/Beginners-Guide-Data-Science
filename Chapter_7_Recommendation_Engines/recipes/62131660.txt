While let the potato and bacon brown and stirring frequently, oil another skillet or grill pan with margarine. Place tortilla on pan, smear with a little maragine, flip. Repeat with remaining tortillas, cook until soft.

Description: 
I often make an extra baked potato when we have baked potatos for dinner to make these the next morning. Season to taste, I like the simplicity of salt and black pepper. Not the healthiest breakfast for you, but so good!
