Ingredients:
handful of Parmesan, grated
2 (8 oz) tubs of mascarpone
4 oz taleggio cheese, grated
zest and juice of 2 lemons
2 cloves garlic, minced
handful of chopped walnuts
7 oz bag of baby spinach, chopped
1 large carrot, grated
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
8 oz fresh sage
2 tbsp butter
handful of cherry tomatoes (left whole)
1 packet of fresh lasagne (12 sheets)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375ÂºF.
Mix half the Parmesan, the mascarpone, the taleggio, the lemon zest and juice, garlic, and the walnuts. Put 1/4 of the mixture to one side, then combine the remaining cheese mixture with the spinach and carrot and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Fry the sage leaves in hot butter and crumble 1/2 into the cheese and spinach mixture, saving the rest for the top.
Put a good spoonful of the cheese and spinach mixture along one of the longer edges of each lasagne sheet and roll up. Place them in a flat oven dish seam side down, and dot with the leftover cheese mixture, drizzle with 2 ounces of water, then sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan, crispy sage leaves, and cherry tomatoes.
Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.  Change oven setting to broil and remove foil from the baking dish.  Broil cannelloni for about 3-5 minutes until top is lightly browned and tomatoes are slightly wilted.
Serve.
