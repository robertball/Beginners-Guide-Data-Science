Ingredients:
8 ounces strawberries, cleaned and stemmed
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Place strawberries in a high-performance blender (such as a Vitamix(R)) and process on low variable 1, quickly increasing to 10 and blend for about 20 seconds. Press mixture through a fine-mesh sieve over a bowl, and discard the seeds.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Pour in strained strawberry puree. Add sugar and vanilla extract and whisk together thoroughly. Allow mixture to come to a boil and bubble until slightly thickened, about 6 minutes.

Description: 
Curd is so simple but it seems like it takes forever to make. I love using this as an addition into homemade yogurt. I found by eliminating the egg (oh the horror!), the curd still thickens as the moisture evaporated. If you want to include the egg to be traditional, by all means add in an egg yolk when the strawberries are pureed.
