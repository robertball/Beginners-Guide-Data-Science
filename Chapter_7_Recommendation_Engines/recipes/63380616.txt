Ingredients:
2 lb. pork tenderloin (plain not seasoned)
1 cup apricot preserves
2 T. minced garlic (I use the kind in jar)
1 T. water
2 T. soy sauce
1 T. fresh ginger (if you have it, if not omit)
1/2 t. pepper
1/2 t. salt
1 package McCormick's Pork Gravy (opitional)

Directions:
Place in a slightly greased roasting pan or foil lined pan.  Sprinkle with pepper & salt (not much salt, remember soy sauce is salty).
Combine preserves & rest of ingredients, spread evenly over pork.
Bake in a pre-heated oven at 425 for 35 minutes or until thermometer inserted in thickest part of meat reads 155 degrees.
Baste every 10 minutes until done.
Take out of oven, cover with foil
Let stand 10 minutes or until thermometer reads 160 degrees.
Slice thin and serve with sauce left in pan or I use the McCormick's Pork Gravy Mix.
