Beat butter and sugar together in a separate large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat one egg at a time into the butter mixture; add molasses and vanilla extract with last egg. Add sweet potatoes, cranberries, and walnuts; mix until batter is thoroughly combined. Gradually beat flour mixture into batter until thoroughly combined. Pour batter into prepared baking pans.
