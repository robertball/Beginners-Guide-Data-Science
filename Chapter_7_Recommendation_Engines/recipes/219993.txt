Ingredients:
10 ounces chocolate fettuccine
1/4 teaspoon canola oil
1/2 cup whipped cream
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups vanilla ice cream, divided
1/2 cup chocolate ice cream topping

Directions:
Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil; cook the chocolate fettuccine until tender but not mushy, about 2 1/2 minutes. Drain the pasta and immediately place into a large bowl filled with ice water. Allow to stand until chilled, about 5 minutes.
Drain the pasta again and toss with canola oil in a bowl to lightly coat. Refrigerate until fully chilled, at least 15 minutes.
Lightly whisk the whipped cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and cocoa powder together in a small bowl until thoroughly combined.
To make the desserts, divide the chocolate fettuccine between 4 dessert plates.
Spoon a dollop of chocolate whipped cream on the fettuccine on each plate.
Place 1/2 cup of vanilla ice cream onto the whipped cream.
Spoon 2 tablespoons chocolate topping onto each dessert to serve.
