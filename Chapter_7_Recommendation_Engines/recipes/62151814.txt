Ingredients:
1 small onion, diced
1 red pepper, diced
2 TBSP Olive Oil
1/4 cup unsalted chicken stock
3 TBSP Flour
1 cup Skim Milk
Garlic Powder (to taste)
Salt and Pepper (to taste)
1 16oz bag frozen brocolli
1 lb. Ground beef, browned, drained and rinsed
2 cups cooked brown rice
1/2 cup shredded chedder cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
In a med saucepan saute onion and pepper on medium heat until onions are translucent.
Add Flour to pan and mix to coat, stir often and cook until flour has turned golden brown.
Deglaze pan with chicken stock, trying to disolve any flour on sides or bottom of pan.
Turn heat to low, Add milk, stiring contantly.
Add desired seasoning amounts, I would normally use more garlic powder than some and very litte pepper.
Once mixutre has come to a slow boil, watch for desired consistancy.  Because the rice in this recipe is already cooked I like to have a thicker gravy.
Add in frozen Brocoli and cook just long enough that the brocoli is defrotsted.
Mix in browned hamburger and rice, spread into 2 qt casserole dish. Top with cheese
Bake at 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes

Description: 
This was born on Leftover night; so I'm sure you can customize the ingrediants to your family's likes (and what's in the freezer!) I usually buy ground beef in bulk, brown, drain and rinse, then freeze. Rinsing the beef after it's cooked really reduces the fat in the dish. It's a great hearty meal that doesn't contain a lot of added salt or fat - not to mention a load of veggies!
