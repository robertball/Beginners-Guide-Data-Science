Ingredients:
5 ounces jumbo pasta shells
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound ground boneless, skinless chicken breast
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ cup chicken broth
¼ cup tomato sauce
2 tablespoons light cream cheese
2 tablespoons reduced-fat grated Parmesan cheese
¼  white onion, diced
1 tablespoon crumbled goat cheese
1  spreadable cheese wedge (such as The Laughing Cow(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Creamy Swiss Garlic & Herb)
2 cloves garlic
¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite about 9 minutes. Drain.
Heat olive oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken with oregano, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes,  salt, and pepper until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth, tomato sauce, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, onion, goat cheese, cheese wedge, and garlic. Bring to a simmer and cook until well combined, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Pour 3 to 4 spoonfuls of the chicken mixture into the bottom of a baking dish to prevent the shells from sliding. Stuff remaining chicken mixture into shells and set in the baking dish with the stuffed side up. Sprinkle top of shells with mozzarella cheese.
Bake shells in the preheated oven until mozzarella cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.
