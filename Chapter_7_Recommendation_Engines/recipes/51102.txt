Ingredients:
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 (3 pound) cut-up broiler-fryer chicken
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1/3 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup chili sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper (cayenne)
1 cup water
1/4 cup chopped salted peanuts
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
Angel hair pasta or rice, if desired

Directions:
Sprinkle salt and pepper over chicken.
Heat oil in 12-inch skillet or 4-quart Dutch oven over medium heat.
Cook chicken in oil about 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until brown on all sides. Cover and cook over low heat about 20 minutes or until juice is no longer pink when centers of thickest pieces are cut. Remove chicken from skillet using tongs.
Drain all but 1 tablespoon drippings from skillet. Heat 1 tablespoon drippings over medium heat.
Cook onion in drippings, stirring occasionally, until tender; reduce heat. Stir in peanut butter, chili sauce and ground red pepper. Gradually stir in water, stirring constantly, until peanut butter is melted. Add chicken. Spoon peanut butter sauce over chicken.
Simmer uncovered about 5 minutes, spooning sauce frequently over chicken, until sauce is slightly thickened. Serve sauce over chicken. Sprinkle with peanuts and bell pepper. Serve with pasta.
