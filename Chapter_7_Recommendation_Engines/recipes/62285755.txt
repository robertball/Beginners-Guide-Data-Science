Description: 
My Mom got this recipe from a friend of hers.  I tried it for the first time not long ago and within a month, I think I made it 4 times.  I made it in the called-for jelly roll pan and also made into cupcakes.  Both were equally fabulous!  This is super duper moist and really flavorful!  If you don't have almond extract, you can substitute with vanilla.
