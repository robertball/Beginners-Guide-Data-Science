Description: 
Don't tell anyone and they won't know it's avocado! This amazingly easy, super-refreshing pie is a hit every time! No baking; mix the filling in a blender for super-speedy results! For picnics or potlucks, this recipe works well in mini pie crusts too. Just make sure that the pie crusts are baked and cooled before pouring in the filling.
