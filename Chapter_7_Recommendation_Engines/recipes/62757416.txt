Ingredients:
Potatoes:
3 medium potatoes, peeled and chopped
½ Tbsp olive oil
3 Tbsp milk
¾ tsp salt
Chicken Mixture:
Cooking spray
2 large carrots, finely chopped
1 onion, chopped
½ tsp dried thyme (or 1 ½ tsp fresh)
1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch pieces
3 cups fresh spinach, coarsely chopped
½ cup part-skim ricotta cheese
½ tsp salt

Directions:
Place potatoes in a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook, uncovered, until tender.
While potatoes are boiling, set oven to 375F. Lightly coat a heavy-bottomed skillet with cooking spray; place over medium heat.
Add carrots, onion and thyme. Cook until slightly browned, stirring often.
Add chicken and cook until golden brown. Turn off heat; stir in spinach, ricotta and salt.
Drain potatoes well, then return to pot. Add olive oil, milk and salt, and mash til smooth (some lumps are okay).
Place chicken mixture in a 9-inch pan and top with mashed potatoes. Bake for 15 minutes. To brown the potatoes, broil for 5 more minutes.
