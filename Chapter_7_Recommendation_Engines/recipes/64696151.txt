Ingredients:
2	eggs
3	tablespoons unsalted butter
2	cloves garlic, minced
2	carrots, finely chopped
2	cups cooked medium-grain rice
3	tablespoons soy sauce
3	green onions, finely chopped
2	tablespoons gomasio (sesame and salt seasoning)
Black pepper, to taste

Directions:
1. In a large frying pan, scramble the eggs in 1 tablespoon of the butter over low to medium heat. Remove from the wok and set aside on a plate.
2. Melt the additional 2 tablespoons of butter in the pan over high heat.
3. Add the garlic and carrots, stirring constantly. After 1 to 2 minutes, stir in the cooked rice and soy sauce.
4. Toss to thoroughly incorporate the ingredients. Add the cooked eggs and onion and mix in the gomasio and black pepper to taste.
5. Cook for another 6 to 8 minutes, or until the rice is warmed through and the flavors incorporated.
Serve immediately.
Tip: Cook the rice the day before and refrigerate it overnight. Refrigerated rice is less likely to stick together when fried, so you'll get separated grains, rather than a mushy mass. To give the rice even more flavor, cook it in chicken broth.
