Ingredients:
1 cup crumbled fully cooked bacon
1 sheet frozen Puff Pastry, thawed
3 large eggs
3/4 cup Heavy Whipping Cream
8oz shredded hardwood smoked cheddar
1 Roma tomato, seeded and finely chopped
1/8 tsp ground Cayene pepper
salt and pepper to taste
Paprika

Directions:
Lightly grease the cups of a 24 Nut Tasse pan, set aside.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out puff pastry to about the thickness of a pie crust. Cut 24-2 1/2 circles (I find that my son's small plastic cups, like the ones that come in Character Dish sets, work perfectly). Gently fit the cirles into the Nut Tasse cups, set aside.
Preheat oven to 400F degrees
In a large bowl beat eggs,cream, cayene, salt and pepper until smooth. Add smoked cheddar and 3/4 cup of crumbled bacon. Fill each pastry cup about 3/4 full with egg mixture. Sprinkle each quiche with a little extra bacon and a light sprinkling of paprika.
Bake at 400F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown around the edges and puffed in the center. Cool 5 minutes before serving.
