Description: 
I flour and brown the pork first. I also add molasses, increase the soy sauce and take out the sugar. I use the juice from the canned vegetables and simmer it a bit longer to develop the flavor and soften the meat. We serve it over crispy chow mein noodles and chinese rice.Modified from: Chop Suey
