Fishy Potato Salad Recipe

Ingredients:
- 4 medium or 2 large potatoes
- 375 gms (12 ounces) white fish fillets or steaks, about 1 inch thick. I find that cod is the best to use, but other fish works
- 6 Tablespoons EVOO
- 2 Tablespoons lemon juice
- Freshly milled black pepper
- 4 bushy stems of fresh parsley, medium chopped
- 1 medium (Spanish) onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
Cut the potatoes into quarters (or halves if using medium ones) and then cook for 10 minutes in a pan of boiling salted water - we want an ordinary knife tip to be able to get into the potato without too much effort. Remove from the heat and drain well.
Meanwhile, in a small shallow pan, place the fish pieces and cover with water. Poach them for 5 minutes or so (maybe as long as 8!) until the flesh is opaque but still firm. Leave in the pan and turn off the heat.
Now slice the still warm potatoes into widths about half the thickness of a pencil.
In your serving bowl, mix the EVOO, lemon juice and a good few twists of the pepper mill. Add the potato slices and stir to get them to soak up the oily mixture evenly.
Now drain the fish, remove the skin and break into bite sized pieces.
Toss the dressed potato slices with the parsley and onion and finally gently mix in the fish pieces.
Serve while still warm. I do this as a main for 2, but it also works as a starter for 4 or 6!

Description: 
Simple and sublime marriage of fish, herbs and potatoes. Just don't overcook the potatoes and when mixing in the fish, be gentle so the juicy lumps don't disintegrate.
