Ingredients:
4 russet potatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch slices
1 onion, chopped
2 Tablespoons Worchestire Sauce
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1 quart casserole dish.
Mix pototates, onions, Worchestire sauce, salt and pepper together and set aside.
In a medium-size saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Mix in the flour and salt, and stir constantly with a whisk for one minute. Stir in milk. Cook until mixture has thickened. Stir in cheese all at once, and continue stirring until melted, about 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese over the potatoes, and mix well.  Pour into prepared casserole dish and cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven.  Remove foil and bake 30 minutes more.

Description: 
Layers of potatoes and onion baked with a simple cheese sauce make a hearty and comforting casserole. To avoid lumps in your sauce, add the milk just a little at a time as you stir the flour and butter. Experiment with different cheeses for variety.Modified from: Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes
