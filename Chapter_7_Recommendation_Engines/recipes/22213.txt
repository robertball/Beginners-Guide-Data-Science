Description: 
A deceptively easy, very tasty candy.  Make them into bars or you can use petit fours cups, placed in a miniature muffin tin. Pour the mixture into the cups, then drizzle a little melted milk or dark chocolate on top for decoration. This method will give you about 50 cups -- plenty to share!!
