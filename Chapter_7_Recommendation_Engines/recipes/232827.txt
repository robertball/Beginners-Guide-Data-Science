Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds red potatoes, quartered
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup petite green peas
5 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
4 slices cooked bacon, chopped
1/4 cup minced onion
2 tablespoons mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.
Mix potatoes, mayonnaise, peas, hard-boiled eggs, bacon, onion, mustard, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Refrigerate to allow flavors to blend and bacon to soften, about 1 hour.
