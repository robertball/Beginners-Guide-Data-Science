Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked
2 cups white sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (optional)
4 cups milk
4 egg yolks
4 egg whites
1 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup shredded coconut
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to broiler setting.
To Make Coconut Custard: In a large saucepan combine 2 cups sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Add cocoa powder if desired. Mix well. Pour in 3 cups of the milk. Stir well and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently until mixture comes to a boil.
Meanwhile, mix remaining 1 cup of milk with beaten egg yolks in a medium bowl. When mixture on stove thickens, add 1/2 cup of it to egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly, until thoroughly combined.
Pour egg yolk mixture back into sugar mixture, whisking constantly. Bring mixture back to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, stirring frequently.
Remove mixture from heat. Stir in butter, vanilla, and coconut. Set aside.
To Make Meringue: Place reserved egg whites in a large metal or glass mixing bowl. Beat until foamy. Add 1/2 cup sugar, a little at a time, beating constantly until stiff peaks form.
Pour custard into baked pie shell. Spread meringue over custard, covering completely.
Place pie under preheated broiler. Bake 5 minutes, or until meringue is golden. Chill before serving.

Description: 
This is very rich. If needed, the richness can be cut down by decreasing the sugar. You can also turn this into a chocolate coconut cream pie by using the optional cocoa powder in the ingredients.
