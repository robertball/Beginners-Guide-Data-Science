Description: 
This is a chili powder that I created myself. Regular chili powder was just not cutting it, and the chili powder packets tasted, well.... packety... As they say, necessity is the mother of invention. The recipe will make a small canister of powder. This will be good for 1-3 batches of chili depending on batch size and intensity of the flavoring.
