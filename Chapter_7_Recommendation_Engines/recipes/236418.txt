Ingredients:
2 cups oil, or as needed
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon pepper seasoning (such as McCormick(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
12  chicken wings

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Stir olive oil and lemon pepper together in a bowl.
Fry the chicken wings in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Toss hot wings with olive oil mixture to coat.

Description: 
My family and I love chicken wings, especially during football season. I just got tired of spending so much money on wings for our party that I decided to whip up my own version of Wing Stop's(<sup>&reg;</sup>) lemon pepper chicken wings. The ending result was an empty platter and pleased bellies.
