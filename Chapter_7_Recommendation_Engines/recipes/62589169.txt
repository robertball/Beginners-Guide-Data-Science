Description: 
I was given this recipe over 20 years ago to prepare for a baby shower at work.  As a newly married non-cook I was nervous (and unhappy) about having to make it. (My mom actually had to come over to help me!)  When I made it and then tried it, I thought it was one of the best bean salads I had ever had!!  

4 types of beans and a sweet sauce make this the perfect summer salad.
