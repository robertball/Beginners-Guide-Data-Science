Title:
April’s Friend Mike’s Mom’s Super-Secret Cheesecake Recipe Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
Crust:
1 sleeve cinnamon graham crackers
¼ c. sugar
½ c. melted butter
Filling:
3 8-oz. packages cream cheese
1 c. sugar
½ t. vanilla
5 eggs
Topping (secret crack-hiding cheesecake spackle):
1 16-oz. container of sour cream
½ c. sugar
½ t. vanilla

Directions:
pre heat oven 350*
Crust:
Combine and press into bottom of small spring-form pan. It will be greasy. You can do more graham crackers if you would like. (The addition of the sugar makes the crust really decadent, but also harder to cut, so it is recommended to slice it before refrigerating. I’ve never done that, though, because I’m a glutton for punishment.)
Leave the cream cheese out until it gets to room temperature, or soften it a little in the microwave first. Make sure you take it out of the wrapper first, so you don’t blow up your microwave!
Filling
Beat the heck out of that cream cheese. Make it nice and smooth. Beat in sugar and vanilla. Add eggs and mix only until adequately combined. Don’t over-mix on the egg stage.
Pour onto graham cracker crust and bake for 1 hour.
Remove from oven and let the air get to it for a few minutes.
Topping (secret crack-hiding cheesecake spackle):
Mix or whisk together and spread on top of baked cheesecake. Bake for 5-10 more minutes.
