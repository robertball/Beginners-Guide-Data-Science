Ingredients:
2.5 cups pan drippings
2 cups chicken broth + 2 cups water (or "Easy Turkey Stock" from Rachael Ray)
3/4 cup flour
salt & pepper

Directions:
Pour the drippings and solids from the turkey roasting pan (make sure to remove any vegetable or fruit pieces from the drippings) into a 1-qt. measuring cup.  Let the liquid settle (through in a few ice cubes to speed up the separation process, if desired).
Skim off and discard the fat from the surface.  You should have 2 to 2 1/2 cups of defatted drippings (add stock or broth, if necessary, to equal 2 1/2 cups).  Return the pan drippings and solids to the roasting pan.
Place the flour in a medium bowl.  Using a fork, gradually stir in 1 cup turkey stock. (If the stock is hot, add it very slowly to prevent lumps from forming.)  Gradually mix in 1/2 cup more stock.
Set the roasting pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat.  Scrape up any browned bits at the bottom of the pan and bring the drippings to a simmer.  Whisk in the flour paste and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly.  Gradually whisk in the remaining 2 1/2 cups turkey stock and boil, whisking, until thickened, about 12 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
