Chicken Squares Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 or 4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup water
1 egg
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp paprika
Cooking oil

Directions:
Mix flour water egg, and seasonings and allow to sit for 1/2 hour so batter will stick to chicken. Cut chicken into bite-size pieces and dip in batter. Heat 1/2 inch deep cooking oil in electric skillet to 375 degrees. Put about half of chicken in hot oil (don't overcrowd pan) and fry until golden, about 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. I like these plain, but my sweetie likes to dip them in honey mustard, bbq sauce, etc, and my 7-year-old boy likes them (and everything else on the planet) with ketchup.
