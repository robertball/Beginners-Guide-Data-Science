Ingredients:
3/4 cup roasted peanuts, finely ground
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup corn flour
1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 egg yolk, beaten (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Stir together the peanuts, flour, corn flour, and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl until well-combined. Make a well in the center of the peanut mixture. Slowly pour in the vegetable oil and mix with the peanut mixture to make a wet, slightly sticky dough. Pinch off about 2 teaspoons of dough per cookie, and roll into balls about 1/2-inch in diameter. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheets, and brush each with egg yolk, if desired.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool on racks.
