Ingredients:
1 tbsp. olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 bell peppers, chopped (I like red and yellow)
1 can black beans
1 16-oz jar medium to hot low-sodium salsa
1 tbsp. red wine vinegar
1 tsp. creole seasoning

Directions:
Heat olive oil over medium heat.
Saute garlic and bell peppers in the olive oil until peppers are tender and garlic is fragrant.
Add black beans, 1/2-1 jar of salsa, red wine vinegar, and creole seasoning.  Mix well and allow to come to a boil.
Lower heat and allow to simmer for 10-15 minutes until liquid is reduced to a thick sauce and the black beans start to break up.
Serve over cooked brown rice.

Description: 
This recipe is great when you're short on time and are not able to make traditional Cuban black beans that have simmered for hours.  Serve with brown rice for a completely balanced meal.
