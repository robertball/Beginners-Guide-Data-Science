Ingredients:
Dough
1 cup white/raw sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter
3 eggs
1/2 pint sour cream
2 Tbls. active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm milk
1 teaspoon sugar
7 cups flour
Filling
1 cup + 4 Tbls. butter
1 Tbls. plus 2 tsps. honey
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup white/raw sugar
2 1/2 lbs. nuts ground/chop fine your choice of nut
1 Tbls. cinnamon
2 teaspoons vanilla
Wash
2 egg whites mixed with
2 tsps. milk

Directions:
1. In a large bowl, mix together 1 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1 cup melted butter and 3 eggs. In a small bowl mix yeast with warm milk & 1 tsp. sugar.
Add to contents in large bowl and mix well. Add flour, mix and knead for a few minutes. Divide dough into 4-6 equal parts, depending on the length you want each one to be. Shape each into a ball.
2. Let rise 1 hour in a warm place or until almost double in size. Cover with saran wrap and place in refrigerator for 16-24 hours.
3. To make filling: Melt 1 cup plus 4 Tbls. butter in small bowl in microwave. Add honey, mix well.
In large bowl mix white/raw sugar and brown sugar. Add melted butter mix & stir to dissolve. Stir in ground nuts and mix until coated. Add cinnamon and vanilla and mix well. Divide the filling into 4-6 equal amounts, (number of rolls you are making). Cover with saran wrap and store in refrigerator with dough until dough is ready, if made the same day. It is best to make it the day the dough is ready, otherwise take it out about an hour before you need it.
4.Roll each dough ball into a rectangle approximately 16" x 12" for 6 rolls. ( For different number of rolls just make your short side 4" less than long side.) Slightly beat 2 egg whites with 2 tsps. milk and brush on top of dough. Spread equal amounts of filling on top of each rectangle. Roll in edges and spread edges with egg wash to seal, then roll length wise tightly. Pinch dough together at seam to seal. Place on non-stick cookie sheet, seam side down and brush tops with egg wash.
5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake for 30 minutes or until roll is lightly brown or browned to liking.
Cool on rack. Slice in 1 inch thick pieces. These are good warm or cold and they don't last long with my family around. They also freeze well.
