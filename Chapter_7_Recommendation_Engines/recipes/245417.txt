Ingredients:
2 cups dried chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
water to cover
1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and stems
2 medium eggs
5 cloves garlic, peeled
3 tablespoons chickpea flour
2 tablespoons tahini
2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Place the chickpeas into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight.
Drain water from beans and transfer beans to a pot; cover with water. Bring water to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until beans are tender, about 1 hour. Cool beans until easily handled.
Combine chickpeas, cilantro, eggs, garlic, chickpea flour, tahini, coriander, salt, cumin, and chili powder in a blender; blend until well mixed but still chunky. Form mixture into patties.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry patties until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes per side.
