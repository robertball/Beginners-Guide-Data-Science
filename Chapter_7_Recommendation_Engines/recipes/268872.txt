Description: 
My most-requested dessert, even over my normal chocolate chip recipe. Delicious and chewy cookies for those with certain dietary restrictions. Something to consider is that banana is the egg substitute and the taste is noticeable. Blue Bonnet速 light margarine does not contain trace amounts of whey or lactose. Trader Joe's速 semi-sweet chocolate chips are on PETA's list of recommended vegan chocolate.
