Ingredients:
2 cups cracker crumbs
3 tablespoons minced walnut pieces
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1/4 cup chopped watercress leaves
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
1 tablespoon dried parsley
2 teaspoons soy sauce
4 whole trout

Directions:
At home: Mix cracker crumbs, walnuts, and dill in a resealable plastic bag. Store oil, watercress, water onion, parsley, and soy sauce in individual bags and containers and combine them in a larger, self-sealing plastic bag labeled with recipe instructions.
On the trail: Place onion in a skillet with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Cook and stir over low to medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add parsley and water. Cover and steam for a minute or so; stir in the watercress.
Combine the cracker-walnut mixture with the onion-parsley mixture in a medium bowl to make the stuffing. Stir in soy sauce.
Stuff each trout with 1/4 of the walnut-herb stuffing. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and add remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add trout to skillet, cover, and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes per side.
