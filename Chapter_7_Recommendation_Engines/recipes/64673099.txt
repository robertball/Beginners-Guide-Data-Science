Ingredients:
3 tablespoons Unsalted butter
1 tablespoon garlic; finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon Salt
1/4 teaspoon Fresh ground black pepper
3/4 - 1 pound small white mushrooms; wiped clean and stems removed (or not, preference choice)
1/2 - 3/4 cup shredded Swiss cheese (or preferred like Gouda, Havarti or Parmesan)
2 tablespoons fresh flat-leaf parsley; chopped and separated into half.

Directions:
Melt butter in a saute pan or skillet over low heat. Add garlic, 1 tablespoon parsley, salt and pepper and cook until fragrant, approximately 1 minute. Add mushrooms to garlic butter to coat.
Cover skillet and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, making sure garlic doesn't burn (may need to reduce heat to very low) then add shredded cheese to mushroom gills to melt (approximately another 1-2 minutes). Just before serving garnish with remaining parsley.
