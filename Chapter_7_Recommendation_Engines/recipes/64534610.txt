https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 cups zucchini, coarsely grated
1 large egg
1/2 cup  grated parmesan cheese
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated black pepper
1/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees F.
Remove as much moisture as you can from the zucchini.
Add zucchini to large bowl and mix in remainder of the taco shell ingredients (egg, parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, black pepper, salt, garlic powder, and cumin).
Cover baking sheets with parchment paper or oven proof baking mat.
Scoop about ¼ cup of mixture and press down on baking pan into a thin circle, about 5” wide.
Repeat for remainder of mixture.
Bake shells for about 25 minutes, or until the shells look “crisp’ and brown around the edges. We like to bake the shells a little longer for a more charred texture and flavor. Just be careful to not bake too long or else the shells dry out and are hard to peel off.
After zucchini soft taco shells are cool, gently peel them off the parchment paper.
