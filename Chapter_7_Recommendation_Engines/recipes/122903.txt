Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter (no substitutes)
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (10.5 ounce) package miniature marshmallows, divided
GLAZE:
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
In a microwave or double boiler, melt butter and chocolate; cook for 10 minutes. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set aside.
In a mixing bowl, beat eggs, sugar, applesauce and vanilla. Stir in chocolate mixture. Add dry ingredients; mix well. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-30 minutes or until cake tests done. Set aside 1/2 cup marshmallows for glaze. Sprinkle remaining marshmallows over cake. Return to the oven for 2 minutes or until marshmallows are softened.
In a saucepan, combine sugar, milk and butter. Bring to a boil; boil for 1-1/2 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in chocolate chips and reserved marshmallows until melted. Quickly drizzle over the cake (glaze will harden as it cools).

Description: 
When Mom wanted to treat us to something special, she made this awesome dessert. We could never resist the tender chocolate cake, the fluffy marshmallow layer or the fudge topping. It's very difficult to stop at one piece.
