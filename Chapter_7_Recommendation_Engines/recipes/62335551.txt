Ingredients:
Food:
•	1 quart heavy cream
•	1 vanilla bean, split and scraped (or 4 squirts of imitation- about 3 tbsp?)
•	1/2 cup sugar
•	2 tbsp sugar
•	6 large egg yolks
•	2 quarts hot water
Hardware:
•	Food blow torch
•	6 ramekins (8 oz)

Directions:
•	Place the cream and 1/2 cup sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. (watch out because the cream mixture will rise exponentially so plan ahead.) Remove from the heat, and allow it to sit for 15 minutes (or until the pan is cool to the touch).
•	In another pan- bring the 2 quarts of water to a boil
•	In a medium bowl, whisk together vanilla and the egg yolks until well blended.
•	Add the 2 tbsp sugar to the egg mixture and mix thoroughly
•	SLOWLY  Pour the cream into the egg mixture.  Make sure you do this very slowly and mix the egg/cream mixture throughout the entire procedure.  (It is a good idea to pour a little bit of the cream into the eggs, mix, add a little more cream, mix, and repeat until all the cream is in the mixture.)  If you rush this step- then you will cook the eggs.  This makes for really truly gross Crème Brulee
•	Arrange the ramekins on a 9 x 13 cake pan (I like to put five ramekins on the pan, add the boiling water and then add the sixth.  It makes pouring water onto the cake pan easier.)
•	Pour the mixture into the ramekins
•	Pour enough hot water into the pan to come up about 2/3 to 3/4 up the ramekin
•	Bake just until the Crème Brulee is set, but still trembling in the center, approximately 45 minutes. Remove the ramekins from the roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 7 days.
•	 Sprinkle sugar equally among the 6 dishes evenly on top. Using a torch, melt the sugar and form a crispy top.

Through much trial and error- I have developed a method which produces a great tasting custard every time I make it.  Now my wife begs me to make this every chance she gets.
