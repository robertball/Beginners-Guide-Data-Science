Ingredients:
5 poblano peppers
cooking spray
12 pitted Medjool dates
20 ounces 90%-lean ground beef
5 ounces goat cheese
1/4 cup barbeque sauce (such as Jack Daniel's®)
1/4 cup plain bread crumbs
1 egg
2 tablespoons barbeque sauce (such as Jack Daniel's®)

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange peppers on a baking sheet.
Broil peppers in the preheated oven until bubbling and skin becomes blackened, 5 to 10 minutes per side. Remove from oven and transfer peppers to a bowl of ice water; set aside for skin to loosen from peppers, about 10 minutes. Remove peppers from water and peel blackened skin from peppers and remove seeds.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
Place peppers and dates in a food processor; pulse until evenly combined.
Mix pepper-date mixture, ground beef, goat cheese, 1/4 cup barbeque sauce, bread crumbs and egg together in a bowl or in a stand-mixer until evenly combined. Pour beef mixture into the prepared loaf pan. Spread 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce evenly over meat mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
This meatloaf steps above in flavor and juiciness. With the spice of the peppers, sweetness in the dates, and the tang from the goat cheese it is the perfect combination. I am sure you will love it!
