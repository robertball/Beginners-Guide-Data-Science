Ingredients:
1 head cabbage, cored
water to cover
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 1/2 pounds ground pork
1 1/2 cups cooked white rice
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 cup white vinegar
2 2/3 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Place the cabbage in a stockpot with enough water to cover.
Add 1/4 teaspoon salt to the water and cabbage.
Bring water to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn cabbage every 2-3 minutes and remove leaves that separate from cabbage and place in a strainer to cool. Boil until all the leaves have cooked, about 15 minutes.
Reserve 12 oz. of cabbage water.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Trim thick center vein off of bottom of each cabbage leaf.
In a large bowl thoroughly mix together, ground beef, ground pork, rice, chopped onion, fresh parsley, egg, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
Lightly pack a small amount of meat mixture and place in the center of the cabbage leaf.
Fold sides over the filling and start at the stem and roll the cabbage up until the meat is encased. Repeat with remaining leaves and filling.
Cut the leftover leaves into pieces and place into the bottom of a roasting pan.
Layer the stuffed cabbage rolls over the cut leaves.
In a bowl, mix the tomato sauce, reserved cabbage water, white vinegar, and white sugar.
Pour the tomato sauce mixture over the cabbage rolls.
Cover roasting pan with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven until the ground beef mixture is no longer pink in the center, about 2 1/2 hours. Baste stuffed cabbage rolls every hour.

Description: 
Halupki, also known as stuffed cabbage on the Russian/Ukranian side of my family, is a dish made of rice, beef, and pork encased in cabbage drizzled with a thin, sweet tomato sauce. My grandma Eugenia is 98 and she taught me how to make this comfort food classic. Every family has their own twist on this traditional dish. I hope you enjoy these with mashed potatoes just as we always do in my family!
