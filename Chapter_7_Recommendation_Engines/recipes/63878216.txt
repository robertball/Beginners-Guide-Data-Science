Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
Red & green food coloring (optional)
12 oz. dark chocolate candy coating, melted
3/4 cup crushed peppermint candies

Directions:
In a bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in extracts.  Gradually beat in flour. Divide dough in half; tint each half, if desired.  Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate 2 hours or until easy to handle.
Preheat oven to 350.  On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion of dough to 1/4 in. thickness.  Cut with a floured 11/2-inch round cookie cutter.  Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets.  Bake 8-10 minutes or until firm.  Remove from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
Dip half of each cookie into melted candy coating; allow excess to drip off.  Sprinkle with crushed candies.  Place on waxed paper; let stand until set.
