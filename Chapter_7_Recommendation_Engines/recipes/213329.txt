Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Golden Mushroom Soup
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 cups water
3 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup milk
2 cups instant mashed potato flakes or buds

Directions:
Cook the beef and garlic in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat.
Stir the beef mixture, tomatoes, 1/2 can soup and Worcestershire in a 3-quart shallow baking dish.
Heat the remaining soup, water and butter in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat to a boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Stir in the milk. Stir in the potatoes. Spoon the potatoes over the beef mixture.
Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are lightly browned.
