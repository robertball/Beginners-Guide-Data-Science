Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup buttery spread (such as Smart Balance®), softened
1/4 cup slivered almonds, crushed
3 tablespoons reduced-fat olive oil mayonnaise
2 tablespoons bread crumbs
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon celery salt
1 pound tilapia fillets

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a broiling pan with aluminum foil or spray with olive oil cooking spray.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.
Mix Parmesan cheese, garlic, buttery spread, almonds, mayonnaise, bread crumbs, lemon juice, seafood seasoning, basil, black pepper, onion powder, and celery salt together in a bowl.
Arrange tilapia fillets in a single layer on the prepared pan; cover pan with aluminum foil.
Broil in the preheated oven for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip fillets, cover pan with aluminum foil, and broil for 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove aluminum foil and cover fillets with Parmesan cheese mixture. Broil in the oven until fish flakes easily with a fork and topping is browned, about 2 more minutes.
