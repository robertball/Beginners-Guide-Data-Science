Ingredients:
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 t. vanilla
1/4 t. salt
3 cups powdered sugar
4 drops yellow food coloring
2 drops red food coloring
1 (12 oz.) bag milk chocolate chips
2 T. shortening

Directions:
Combine corn syrup, butter, vanilla and salt in large bowl. Beat well with electric mixer.
Add sugar, one cup at a time, mixing by hand.
Remove 1/3 of the mix and place in small bowl, stir in yellow & red food coloring.
Cover both mixes and refrigerate at least 2 hours.
When mixes are firm, roll a small ball from the orange filling and wrap about twice that of the white filling around it.
Form into the shape of an egg and place on a greased cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining ingredients and refrigerate 3-4 hrs.
Combine chocolate chips with shortening in glass bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute, stir, and microwave another minute.
Use a fork to dip each center into the chocolate. Place candy onto wax paper and chill for 1-2 hours.
Dip each candy again and chill until dry.
