Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef
1/2 cup cooked brown rice (white rice works, too)
1 egg
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 Tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
lots of freshly cracked pepper
1 large onion thinly slice
2 teaspoons olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a medium bowl, mix together beef, rice, egg, parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, worcestershire sauce and salt.
Form meat mixture into four oblong mini-loaves.
Season the outside of each loaf liberally with cracked pepper.
Bake at 350 degrees in a lightly greased baking dish for 35-45 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees.
While meat loaves are in the oven, add olive oil to a skillet. Cook onions with a pinch of salt over low heat, stirring frequently, until soft and caramelized.  Serve mini-meatloaves topped with onion garnish.

Description: 
These single-serve meatloaves are made with rice rather than bread or breadcrumbs so they are gluten free.  A great way to use leftover rice.
