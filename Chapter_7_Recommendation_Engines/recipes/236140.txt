Description: 
Perfect for people who love using their slow cookers. I've tried many chili recipes but this one is the best ever! You can substitute beans for the cornmeal, but I think it takes away from the taste and the smooth texture. I recommend opening a second bottle of porter beer and drink it while cooking this tasty dish! Yum!
