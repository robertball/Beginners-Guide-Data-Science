Ingredients:
1 egg
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup powdered milk
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 dash salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Stir together the egg, white sugar, butter, flour, cornstarch, powdered milk, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Knead for a few minutes to make a soft dough. Divide the dough into 12 portions. Roll each portion into a ball and flatten slightly. Place on the prepared baking sheet 1 inch apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, about 10 minutes. Cool completely and store in an airtight container.
