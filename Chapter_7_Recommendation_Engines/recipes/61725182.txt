Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup chopped green onions
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
1 (14.5 ounce) can natural cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup low-fat sour cream
1 1/2 cups cubed cooked chicken breast meat
1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, divided
6 (12 inch) flour-and-corn OR whole wheat tortillas
1 cup pinto beans
1/4 pound sliced cremini mushrooms

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish.
In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Saute the green onion and garlic until fragrant (about 2 minutes). Add the mushrooms and cook until lightly browned and tender, about 6 minutes. Stir in the green chiles, cream of mushroom soup and sour cream. Mix well. Reserve 3/4 of this sauce and set aside. To the remaining 1/4 of the sauce in the saucepan, add the chicken, beans, and 1/2 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese. Stir together.
Fill each flour tortilla with the chicken mixture and roll up. Place seam side down in the prepared baking dish.
In a small bowl combine the reserved 3/4 of the sauce with the milk. Spoon this mixture over the rolled tortillas and top with the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly.
