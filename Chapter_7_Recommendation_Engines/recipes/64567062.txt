Directions:
METHOD
Preheat oven to 160°C/fan 140°C/gas 3. Rub the flour, zest, butter and a pinch of salt together until it resembles breadcrumbs. Mix in the sugar
and beaten eggs slowly to form into a ball. Wrap in clingfilm and chill for 2 hours. Thinly roll the pastry and line an 18cm (7in) flan tin. Bake blind for 10 mins until golden, then remove paper and beans. Turn oven to 140°C/fan 120°C/gas 1. Bring the cream to the boil. In a bowl, whisk the 9 yolks and sugar together, add the hot cream and mix well. Sieve into a jug and pour into the pastry case. Grate nutmeg over and bake for 30 mins until just set.

Stunning dishes from celebrity chefs in honour of Her Majesty (and a celebratory cocktail too!)
II cooked this for the Queen at her 80th birthday celebration in 2006. I am not easily intimidated but on this occasion I was a little, as the guest list at her party was quite something! Custard tart was one of my favourites as a
child, but this is a modern version of the classic.
