Title:
Christmas Cheeseball Recipe

Ingredients:
1 8 oz. pkg. Philadelphia Cream Cheese, softened (this is what the actual recipe yields, but I use 1 1/2 pkgs)
1 pkg. Carl Budding thinly sliced beef, chopped
1/2 jar Mario pimiento-stuffed green olives, chopped
1 small Vidalia Sweet (yellow) onion, minced
2-3 good dashes of Lea&Perrin's worchestershire sauce (to taste)
1-2 handfulls chopped English Walnuts (enough to cover ball)

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients except nuts and mix well.  Shape into a ball, roll in chopped nuts (if desired) and place on a platter with crackers. (Ritz crackers are the best. The buttery-sweet notes of a Ritz cannot be replicated in any other cracker. The Ritz cracker's flavor bring out the best of the somewhat salty, savory flavor of the cheese ball.)
Shaping advice:  after ingredients are mixed, scrape the sides of the bowl and form a semi-fashioned ball and let set in the refrigerator until well chilled.  Then it is much easier to manipulate the mixture into a ball as it wont be so 'smeary' and difficult to shape.  Then the mixture will easily 'drop' onto a piece of waxed paper covered in the nuts to roll the ball in and to then transfer it onto a serving plate.

Description: 
A very simple, traditional cheese ball that has been served during family Christmas Eve parties since before my time.  I look forward to it every year; the ingredients are few and inexpensive, but I reserve this one special appetizer for the Holidays only-to maintain the special'ness' of it.
