Ingredients:
4 pork chops
4 teaspoons honey
2 cups Worcestershire sauce
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Slice each chop down the center horizontally, cutting not quite through.  Open flat to resemble a butterfly. You can also ask your butcher to prepare the meat in this way.
In a large, shallow dish, mix together honey and Worcestershire sauce. Marinate pork chops in the mixture for no more than 4 hours.
Prepare barbecue for indirect cooking.
Pepper the chops to taste, and place on well oiled grate. Cook over medium low heat for 35 to 40 minutes.
