Ingredients:
1 tablespoon red chile flakes
1 tablespoon hot water
1/4 cup soybean oil
1 1/2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns
1 large clove garlic, sliced thin
1/4 pound ground pork
2 1/2 tablespoons doubanjiang (spicy broad bean paste)
1 (15 ounce) container soft tofu, drained and cubed
1/4 cup water
3 green onions, sliced

Directions:
Place red pepper flakes in a small bowl of hot water. Let soak until softened.
Heat a wok over medium-high heat until very hot; pour in oil. Add peppercorns; toss briefly until aromatic. Add garlic; stir until aromatic, 10 to 15 seconds. Add ground pork; saute until until browned and crumbly, about 2 minutes.
Mix doubanjiang and red chile flakes into the pork mixture. Let simmer for about 1 minute. Add tofu and water; gently stir to coat. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; let simmer until flavors meld, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and toss in green onions.

Description: 
This is one of those extremely simple recipes that is a staple of its culture, yet it is so difficult to find an authentic recipe. I received this from someone who was born and raised in Sichuan province. Serve with fresh steamed white rice.
