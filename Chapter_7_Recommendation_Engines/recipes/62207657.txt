Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 cup all-purpose flour
1.5 cup white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup water
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 eggs
1 c homemade cranberry sauce (or whole berry sauce)
1 handful CranRaisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a bundt pan.
Stir together the white cake mix, flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl until well mixed. Pour in the water, sour cream, vegetable oil, vanilla, cranberry sauce, CranRaisins, and beat with an electric mix on low until all the ingredients are mixed and moistened but some lumps still remain.
Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan, and bake in the preheated oven until the top is a light golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 70 minutes. No frosting needed, if glazed, use VERY light vanilla or almond glaze.
