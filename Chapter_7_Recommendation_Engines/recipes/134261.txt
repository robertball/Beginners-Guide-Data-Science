Ingredients:
2 tomatoes, chopped
10 fresh chile de arbol peppers, chopped
1 clove garlic
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 1/4-inch slices
salt and pepper to taste
1 cube tomato-flavored bouillon

Directions:
Cook the tomatoes and peppers together in a small saucepan, or in the microwave until softened. Place into the bowl of a blender with the garlic clove, and puree until smooth.
Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the beef with salt and pepper to taste, then fry in the skillet until no longer pink.
Once cooked, pour in the tomato puree, and add the bouillon cube. Stir until the bouillon cube dissolves, then cook for 3 minutes.
