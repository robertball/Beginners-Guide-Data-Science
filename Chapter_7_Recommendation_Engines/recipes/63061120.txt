Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, divided
4 tsp water
1/2 lemon
6 apples
3 eggs
1 cup flour
8 oz (2 sticks) butter, softened
4 oz cream cheese, softened
OPTIONAL:
8 oz Honey Nut Flavor Cream Cheese spread
1 cup whipping cream
1/4 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  To prepare the caramel, heat 3/4 cup granulated sugar with 4 tsp water.  When the sugar becomes light brown, add the juice of 1/2 lemon and remove from heat.
Coat the bottom and sides of a springform pan with the caramel.
Peel, core and thinly slice the apples and arrange in a circular overlapping pattern on the caramel.
In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with remaining 3/4 cup granulated sugar.  Add the flour, butter, cream cheese and continue beating until you have a creamy batter.
Pour over apples and caramel and bake for 35 minutes. Let cool slightly prior to turning over onto a decorative cake plate.
OPTIONAL: While cake is baking, beat honey nut flavored cream cheese until fluffy.  Separatel, beat whipping cream until fluffy and then add 1/4 cup powdered sugar.  Gently fold the whipped cream cheese into the whipped cream and chill well using the freezer, if necessary.  Spoon onto warm cake slices.
