Description: 
I can only attempt to spell the real name of this dish; Cabushka or something like that!  My mother's father was from Czechoslovakia, and he has three sisters who are excellent cooks.  I have learned to cook this dish quite happily.  At our last reunion, there were three separate bowls with different versions of this same dish; they were all scraped clean!
