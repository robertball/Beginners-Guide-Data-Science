Ingredients:
1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch cubes
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons sake (Japanese rice wine)
5 tablespoons mayonnaise, divided
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 1/2 teaspoons honey
3/4 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 egg
1 cup vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Put chicken pieces in a bowl; season with salt and pepper.
Stir sake and 2 tablespoons mayonnaise together in a separate bowl until smooth; add chicken and mix to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 15 minutes.
Whisk remaining 3 tablespoons mayonnaise, ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and lemon juice together in a bowl. Stir cornstarch and flour together in a separate shallow bowl. Beat egg in a third bowl.
Pour enough oil into a large skillet to be about 1/4 inch deep; heat over medium-high heat.
Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.
Coat chicken in the cornstarch mixture; dip chicken pieces into the beaten egg and gently drop into the hot oil.
Fry chicken, turning regularly, until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes; transfer to a large bowl.
Drizzle mayonnaise sauce over fried chicken and quickly mix to coat.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite dishes. The sake and mayo marinade makes chicken tender and juicy. It is great with steamed white rice and some simple salt and pepper saut√©ed asparagus with garlic. I sometimes use chicken tender strips to save time. You can also use shrimp instead of chicken. I understand that many of you don't have sake, but if you use white wine instead, the chicken will not the taste the same.
