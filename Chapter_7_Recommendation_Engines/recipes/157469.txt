Description: 
To be totally honest, I didn't think this recipe was going to turn out. I had never added fruit to the ingredients before adding them to my yogurt maker. When I tasted the yogurt, it was really thick, creamy and delicious! And what kid doesn't love bananas? This is a great way to get more fruit into your kid!!
