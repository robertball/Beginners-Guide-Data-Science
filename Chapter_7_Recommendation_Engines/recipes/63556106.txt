Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 white fish filets (I used pangasius/swai but any white fish would work)
2 t ground black pepper (or to taste)
1 t curry powder
2 T soy sauce
1-2 inch piece fresh ginger root
2-3 cloves garlic
1 T sambal oelek (can substitute fresh chilies or 1t red chili flakes)
1 c orange juice
1 T olive oil (or oil of your choice)

Directions:
Lay the fish in a glass dish and sprinkle both sides with the curry powder and black pepper.  Pour the soy sauce on top making sure to coat both sides.  Marinate for at least 20 minutes.
Peel the ginger root and grate.  Crush the garlic in a garlic press or finely chop.
Heat the oil in a sauce pan on medium-high.  When the oil is hot place the fish in the pan and cook until browned on one side (about 3 minutes).  Flip.
After flipping the fish, add the garlic and ginger to the oil in the open spaces, stir the garlic and ginger frequently to prevent burning.
After the fish has browned on both sides and the garlic and ginger is fragrant, pour the remaining marinade into the pan, along with the orange juice.
Cook until fish flakes easily (will vary depending on the thickness of the filets).  Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.
Add the sambal oelek to the pan and stir.  Cook the sauce for about 5 minutes to reduce.
Pour the thickened sauce over the fish and serve with white rice.

Description: 
I came up with this tasty recipe when I was craving something vaguely Indian but also wanted to keep it simple and light and use the ingredients I had on hand.  I serve it with white rice and a side of stir-fried asian veggies such as bok choy with garlic, oyster sauce and cashews.
