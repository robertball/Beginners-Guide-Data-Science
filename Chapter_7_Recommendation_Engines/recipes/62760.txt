Description: 
This is a delicious summer salad with a tropical flair that has been a family favorite my whole life, and probably longer. Pineapple, marshmallows, and whipped cream make this salad good as a side dish, or as a cool and refreshing dessert. Overnight refrigeration is the most important step to allow the marshmallows to fluff.
