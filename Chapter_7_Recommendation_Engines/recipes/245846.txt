Ingredients:
8 ounces ground bison
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon dried sage
1 pinch celery salt, or to taste
2 teaspoons olive oil

Directions:
Mix bison, mustard, oregano, cumin, onion powder, paprika, sage, and celery salt together in a bowl. Form meatballs approximately 1 1/2-inch diameter in size.
Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat, swirling to cover bottom of the skillet. Add meatballs and cook undisturbed, about 4 minutes. Continue to cook, turning meatballs until browned evenly on all sides, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
