Description: 
I made this dessert when I wanted to make something small and sweet for dessert. All I had in the house was cream cheese and chocolate chips, and thus the Shot Glass Cream Cheese Dessert was born. It is so simple and can be whipped up in an instant. You can substitute crushed graham crackers instead of mini chocolate chips if you'd like more of a crust.
