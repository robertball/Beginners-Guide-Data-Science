Ingredients:
1 1/2 Cups flour, sifted
1/2 Cup white sugar
1/4 Cup brown sugar
1/2 tsp Salt
2 tsp baking powder
3 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1/3 Cup Vegetable Oil
1/3 Cup Milk of choice
1 Egg
1 tsp Vanilla extract
1/4 tsp Lemon extract
3/4 Cup white chocolate chips
1 TBSP flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Sift flour and add it to a bowl along with the sugars, salt, baking powder and pumpkin pie spice.
Measure oil in a liquid measuring cup, measure milk into same cup, add egg, vanilla extract, lemon extract and pumpkin and mix together.
Add the pumpkin mixture to the dry ingredients while stirring. Stir until just combined making sure to scrape the side off the bowl. Do Not Overmix or muffins will be tough.
Measure out the white chocolate chips and toss them in the additional 1 TBSP of flour to ensure that they won't sink to the bottom of the muffins. Fold in the white chocolate chips and add batter to a lined muffin tin.
Bake at 375 for 15-20 minutes making sure to check them after 15.
