Ingredients:
1 baguette (about 2 1/2 in. wide and 24 in. long)
5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 pounds firm-ripe tomatoes (see note)
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/4 cup chopped pitted calamata olives
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, or 1/3 as much dried basil
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
Salt and pepper
6 ounces fresh chevre (goat cheese)

Directions:
Slice baguette on a slight diagonal about 1/3 inch thick; reserve ends for another use. Arrange slices on racks on two baking sheets (each 12 by 15 in.). Brush tops lightly with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Bake in a 425 degree regular or convection oven until lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, rinse, stem, and core tomatoes. Cut in half crosswise and squeeze out and discard seeds; chop tomatoes. (If not serving immediately, put tomatoes in a strainer or colander to drain.)
In a bowl, mix remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, the lemon juice, and mustard. Stir in tomatoes, olives, basil, and garlic. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Spread cheese over one side of each slice of toast. Mound tomato mixture equally on top. Serve at once.

Description: 
The day starts with a light lunch in the form of these bruschetta, contributed by Sheila Schmitz. In Ojai, vine-ripened tomatoes are available even in November. If you have trouble finding them, look for Roma or cherry tomatoes; they tend to be better quality than other types during cool-weather months.
