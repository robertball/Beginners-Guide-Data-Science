Ingredients:
1 onion, divided
1 teaspoon butter
4 teaspoons taco seasoning, divided
1 1/4 pounds ground beef
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 cup salsa
4 hamburger buns

Directions:
Mince enough onion to get 1/4 cup. Set remaining onion aside.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add 1/4 cup minced onion and 1 teaspoon taco seasoning. Cook until onion is translucent and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Transfer onion to a medium bowl; add ground beef, 2 teaspoons taco seasoning, and garlic powder. Mix well and shape into 4 hamburger patties.
Pour tomato sauce into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add salsa and remaining 1 teaspoon taco seasoning. Mix to combine.
Shave remaining onion into thin slices using a mandolin. Add to tomato mixture. Add hamburger patties and cook in the sauce until internal temperature reaches 170 degrees F (76 degrees C), about 5 minutes per side.
Toast the hamburger buns if desired. Top buns with hamburger patties and sauce, and other desired toppings.

Description: 
After I moved to Oklahoma, I quickly discovered most every burger joint has their version of an onion burger. My version takes the Oklahoma onion burger south of the border. Top with lettuce, cheese, avocado slices, black olives, and Mexican crema.
