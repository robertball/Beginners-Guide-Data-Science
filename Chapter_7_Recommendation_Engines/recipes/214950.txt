Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 red bell pepper, chopped
3/4 cup white onion, diced
1 1/2 cups zucchini, sliced
1 1/2 cups yellow squash, sliced
1/2 cup chicken broth, or as needed
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1 (6 ounce) package cornbread stuffing mix

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a 7-inch casserole dish.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the bell pepper, onion, zucchini, squash, and chicken broth. Bring to a simmer, and cook until the vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes. Use more broth if needed to keep the mixture moist. Remove the vegetables from the heat, and stir in the condensed mushroom soup, sour cream, and 3/4 of the stuffing mix; pour into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle the remaining stuffing mix over top.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned on top, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
I've tried many squash casseroles, but this is by far the best I've ever had.  This recipe was given to me by a friend and has gotten rave reviews from squash lovers and squash haters alike. Fresh squash, bell pepper and onion are given an extra boost of flavor and texture from cornbread stuffing mix.  This is a lightened-up version of the original recipe, but you won't miss a thing!
