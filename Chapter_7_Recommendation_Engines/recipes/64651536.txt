Ingredients:
3 cups of your favorite tomato sauce or marinara sauce
1/2 pound of Italian sausage (sweet or hot)
1 pound of ground beef
1/2 pound ground veal
1 medium onion, chopped
1 red or green pepper, finely chopped
3 cloves of Garlic, chopped
1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
8 large beef tomatoes
Olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F
In a large sauté pan, add olive oil to a large heated sauté pan over medium temperature.
Add the onion and all of the meat, until browned. Drain excess liquid. Add garlic and cook for another minute. Add the basil, parsley, salt and pepper.
Add in sauce and let simmer for 15 minutes. Taste for any additional spices or salt/pepper.
Meanwhile, slice the tomatoes in half and scoop out the flesh. Keep the top of the tomato.
Pour the bolognese mixture into the halved tomatoes, cover with top and bake for 25 minutes, or until tender and golden brown.
Garnish with fresh herbs
If you are using any cheese I sometimes top with fresh parmesan cheese.
NOTE: You can omit the 1/2 pound of veal and substitute with 1 pound of ground beef.

Description: 
As you probably know by now I love having a big pot of something going on my stove top! Most of the time it is a sauce and my favorite is a bolognese. How about stuffing bolognese in a tomato! YUM…. This can be served as a buffet food, appetizer or the main course with a side salad. Go ahead – give it a try!

My bolognese stuffed tomatoes are a great paleo recipe, gluten free recipe or just a great meal.
