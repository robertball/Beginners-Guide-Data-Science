6 large crimini mushrooms, chopped
1 onion, chopped
2 large cloves of garlic, minced
2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar
salt
pepper
4 tablespoons of herbed goat cheese
4 teaspoons of whipped cream cheese
1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Heat a medium skillet on medium heat.  Saute mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper with the extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar until cooked (3-5 minutes).  In the meantime, mix goat cheese and cream cheese in a small bowl.  Set aside.  Heat large skillet.  Place one tortilla in the skillet, heat for one minute, and turn.  Spread 1/4 of the goat cheese mixture on the tortilla.  Spoon 1/4 of the mushroom mixture on one half of the tortilla.  Add 1/4 of the mozzarella cheese on top of the mushrooms.  Allow mozzarella cheese to begin to melt, fold the tortilla in half, and press to seal.  Repeat with the remaining three quesadillas.
