Ingredients:
3/4 cup uncooked short or medium rice.  Not long grain
2 cups milk, divided
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
2/3 cup golden raisins
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
cinnamon

Directions:
Bring 1 1/2  cups salted water to a boil in a saucepan; stir rice into boiling water. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Don't add sugar until rice is completely cooked.
In a clean saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cup cooked rice, 1 cup milk, sugar and salt.
Cook over medium heat until thick and creamy, 15 to 20 minutes.
Put some of the warm mixture into the remaining milk and sugar for about 3 minutes.
Stir in remaining 1 cup milk, beaten egg, and raisins; cook 2 minutes more, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in butter and vanilla.
