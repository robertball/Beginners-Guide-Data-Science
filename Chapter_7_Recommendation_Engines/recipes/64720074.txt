Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 (3 to 4 pound) pie pumpkin

Directions:
Place water into the bottom of the pressure cooker. Set trivet inside.
Cut around pumpkin stem, cutting a hole large enough to fit hand into pumpkin. Remove stem, then remove seeds and stringy pieces from inside pumpkin.
Place pumpkin on trivet, cut side down. If pumpkin is too large to fit, cut in half and arrange both halves to fit.
Lock lid and set valve to SEALING. Set timer for 12 minutes on manual mode. When timer is up, quick release the pressure. Remove pumpkin from pressure cooker and set on rack until cool enough to handle.
Scrape pumpkin flesh from skin and place into a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth. Store in the refrigerator for up to a week, or freeze for future use.
Cook's notes: Pie pumpkins, also called sugar pumpkins, are what you need for this recipe. They have more flesh and a much creamier, less stringy texture than carving pumpkins.

Description: 
While store-bought canned pumpkin purée is handy, nothing beats the flavor and smooth texture of homemade purée. It can't get any easier in the Instant Pot! Reserve seeds to make roasted pumpkin seeds, if desired.
