Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
garlic to taste
worcestershire sauce
1 cup chopped onion
1 (29 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 smaller can tomato sauce too
3 1/2 pounds chopped cabbage
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 teaspoon salt
2 (14 ounce) cans beef broth
(I only use about 1-1/2 cans)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large skillet, brown beef in oil over medium high heat, add garlic & worcestershire sauce (a bunch of shakes). I also add a few shakes of Italian Seasoning.  Cook until redness is gone. Drain off fat.
In a large mixing bowl combine the onion, tomato sauce, cabbage, rice and salt. Add meat and mix all together. Pour mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour broth over meat mixture and bake in the preheated oven, covered, for 1 hour. Stir, sprinkle grated cheddar on top, replace cover and bake for another 30 minutes.
