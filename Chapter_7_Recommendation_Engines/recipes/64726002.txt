Ingredients:
1 quince
1 tbsp lemon juice
3 medium eggs
1/2 cup cane sugar
1 organic orange, juiced and zested
1 cup almond meal
1/2 cup polenta

1.5 tsp baking powder
1 tbsp sliced almonds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 180°C. Butter and flour an 8” - round cake pan
Wash, peel, core, and slice the quince. Let rest in a bowl of water with one tablespoon lemon juice.
In a stand mixer or hand mixer on medium, cream together the eggs and cane sugar until pale. Add orange juice, orange zest, almond meal, polenta, baking powder, and yogurt mixing until just combined.
Pour the batter into the prepared cake. Drain the quince. Top the cake with the quince slices pushing them down slightly in order to make them fit.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Cover with foil and cook for another 20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
Allow to cool before topping with sliced almonds then serve.
