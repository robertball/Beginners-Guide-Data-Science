Ingredients:
1 Turkey Breast - boneless, about 5 pounds
Juice of 2 limes
2 dried ancho peppers
2 dried pasilla peppers
2 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp brown sugar
2 tsp dried minced onion
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper

Directions:
Using a spice grinder or coffee grinder waz together the cumin, ancho, pasilla, black pepper, dried onion, and salt until it is a fine powder. Stir in the brown sugar.
Squeeze juice of 2 limes on the breast then rub the turkey with the spice blend rub. Let it marinate for about an hour.
Turn all burners on the BBQ to full whack until it is piping hot - about 600 degrees. Turn burners to medium and sear all sides of the breast. Reserve the marinade as a baste.
Turn half of the BBQ's burners to off and the other to low, and roast the breast for about 15 to 20 minutes on one side, maintaining a BBQ temperature of 350-400 F.
Turn the turkey over and baste, and cook for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the internal temperature is 165F. Juicy turkey and crispy skin! Let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
