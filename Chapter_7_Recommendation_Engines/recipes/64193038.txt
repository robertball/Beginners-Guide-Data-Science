Ingredients:
1 large box (approx.  30-40) frozen Taquitos, no need to defrost!
15 oz. can of cream of chicken soup  (I only used approx. 1/2 of that large can in the pic.  Too much soup, and it wonâ€™t get creamy enough!)
2 cups shredded cheddar, divided
1 cup chopped green chile
1 large egg
Sour cream and cilantro for garnish

Directions:
In a large bowl mix together the soup, 1 cup of the cheese, the egg, green chile and any spices you prefer.
Using a deep 8x13 glass baking dish, lay a single layer of the taquitos on the bottom of the pan.  Evenly pour some of the soup mix onto the taquitos.
Continue to layer the rest of the taquitos and soup mix all the way to the top of your baking dish.
Top the entire dish with the remaining shredded cheese and bake in the oven on 350 degrees for 40 to 50 minutes or until golden.
