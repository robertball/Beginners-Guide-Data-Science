Set an air fryer for 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Place flour on a plate. Place panko on a separate plate.
Coat shrimp first with flour, followed by mayonnaise mixture, then panko. Place coated shrimp on a baking sheet.
Place shrimp in the air fryer basket without overcrowding.
Cook for 12 minutes. Repeat with remaining shrimp.

Description: 
This is my take on a popular dish from a restaurant chain. My version is made in an air fryer instead of being deep-fried. The end result was perfectly crispy sweet and spicy shrimp.
