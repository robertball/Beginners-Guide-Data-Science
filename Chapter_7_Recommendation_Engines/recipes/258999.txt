Ingredients:
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 (8 ounce) round brie, sliced in half horizontally
1/4 cup slivered almonds
2 tablespoons butter, or more as needed
2 tablespoons honey, or more to taste
1 egg white, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Dust a pastry mat with flour. Roll out the puff pastry into a 1/4-inch sheet with a rolling pin.
Place 1/2 of the brie on the puff pastry, rind side-down. Trim off the corners of the pastry with a knife.
Dab the top of the brie with 2 tablespoons almonds and 1 tablespoon butter. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon honey. Cover with the other half of brie, rind side-up. Top with the remaining almonds, butter, and honey.
Wrap the puff pastry around the wheel of brie, sealing the seams by pinching them together. Brush with egg white. Place brie en croute in a baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes.
