Ingredients:
8 slices multigrain bread
1 cup hummus
2 Granny Smith apples, thinly sliced
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven broiler. Lay out the bread on a baking sheet.
Broil the bread until lightly toasted, 2 to 4 minutes. Carefully turn the bread over on the baking sheet and place back under the broiler to lightly toast the other side, 2 to 4 minutes.
Take the bread from the oven and spread 2 tablespoons of hummus on each piece. Lay the apple slices on top of the hummus and sprinkle the cheese over the apples.
Broil the sandwiches open-faced until the cheese is melted and bubbly, 3 to 4 minutes. Sandwich two slices of bread together, to make four sandwiches.
