Ingredients:
1 cup raspberry balsamic salad dressing
2 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
1/4 cup raspberries (fresh or frozen)

Directions:
Marinate the chicken breast in 1/2 cup of the salad dressing for at least hours, or overnight.
Heat skillet over medium/high heat.  When hot, add chicken breasts, and cook about 5 minutes per side, or until juices run clear when poked with a fork.
Combine remaining 1/2 cup salad dressing with raspberries in a small saucepan.  Heat over medium heat about 10 minutes until reduced.  Serve sauce over chicken.
