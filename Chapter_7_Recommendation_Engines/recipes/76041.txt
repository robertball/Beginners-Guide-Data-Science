Description: 
Going on an adventure? These unique sandwiches pack a lot of nutrients and travel extremely well. They do require an adventurous spirit because they are quite different than they average fare. For a sweeter taste use a trail mix that includes dried fruit. I would not recommend one with chocolate pieces, though! Plain, unchopped sunflower seeds work great, too.
