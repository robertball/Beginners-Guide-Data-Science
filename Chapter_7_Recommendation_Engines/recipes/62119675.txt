Description: 
The secret to make this recipe turn out perfect is to prepare your custard and bread the night before. I use Artisan French bread cut into 1/2 slices and set out individually so to give it a day old appearance. This keeps the bread together when cooking. Such an easy recipe, but will definately add appeal to your holiday or Christmas breakfast.
