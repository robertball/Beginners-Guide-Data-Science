Ingredients:
2 cups biscuit mix
2/3 cup half-and-half
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
6 eggs
1/2 cup diced ham
1/4 cup chopped steamed broccoli
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste (optional)
2 teaspoons onion powder, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Combine biscuit mix and half-and-half in a medium bowl; knead approximately 10 times. Add 1/3 cup Cheddar cheese and mix until evenly combined. Use a teaspoon to scoop uniform amounts of dough and drop onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Use fingers to create cup shapes by pinching sides and pressing outward.
Whisk eggs in a bowl until no whites remain. Add ham, broccoli, parsley, garlic powder, and onion powder and mix well. Spoon mixture into dough cups without overfilling.
Bake in the preheated oven until dough is golden brown and eggs are set, about 15 minutes.
