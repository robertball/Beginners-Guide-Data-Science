Ingredients:
1/2 pound sliced bacon, diced
1 cup thinly sliced celery
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup sugar
2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
1 tsp salt
3/4 tsp ground mustard
1 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup water
5 pounds unpeeled small red potatoes, cooked and sliced
2 medium carrots, shredded
2 Tbsp minced fresh parsley
Additional salt, optional

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Using a slotted spoon, remove to paper towels; drain, reserving 1/4 cup drippings. Saute celery and onion in drippings until tender.
In a large bowl, combine the sugar, flour, salt, mustard, vinegar and water until smooth. Add to the skillet. Bring to a boil. Cook and stir for 1-2 minutes until thickened.
In a large serving bowl, combine the potatoes, carrots and parsley; drizzle with sauce; stir gently to coat. Season with additional salt if desired; garnish with bacon. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
I make this salad for all occasionsÂ—it goes well with any kind of meat. I often take this salad to potlucks, and there's never any leftover. The celery, carrots and dry mustard are a special touch not usually found in traditional German potato salad.
