Ingredients:
1  beaten egg
½ cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as Crystal (<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 pound cooked and peeled whole crawfish tails
1 sleeve buttery round crackers, crushed
¼ cup canola oil

Directions:
Mix together the egg, mayonnaise, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl.
Place the crawfish tail meat and crushed crackers in a large bowl, and mix in the mayonnaise mixture until thoroughly combined. Refrigerate the crawfish mixture until it can hold a shape, about 1 hour. Form the chilled mixture into 8 patties.
Heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium heat, and fry the patties until golden brown on each side, about 6 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
