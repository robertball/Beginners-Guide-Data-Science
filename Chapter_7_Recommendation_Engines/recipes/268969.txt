Description: 
This is one of my favorite rice recipes handed down to me from my mother-in-law. It is the tastiest rice I have ever had and my family is always wanting me to make it as a side dish with dinner. We will even eat the leftovers for breakfast. I usually serve this with a meat dish or tacos.
