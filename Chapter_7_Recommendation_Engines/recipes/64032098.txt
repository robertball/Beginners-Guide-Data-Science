Ingredients:
1 piece of Salmon
1 Red Bell Pepper
1 Green Bell Pepper
1 can Black Beans
1 Avocado
2 Taco sized flour tortillas

Directions:
Reheat your salmon and warm your black beans. (I heat my salmon on the stove top.) Slice your bell peppers long ways and thinly. Slice your avocado down the middle and remove the seed; take a knife and make little slices longways, then use the back of your thumb to scoop them out.
Now it's just about placement. Slice or cut up your salmon so it will easily fit into a wrap and can be dispersed into two wraps. Lay the wraps out; add salmon and black beans and as many pepper and avocado slices that you can fit! Wrap it and enjoy!

Description: 
I am currently eating clean so I needed a quick and healthy lunch recipe. I already had pepper slices and leftover salmon in the refrigerator so I just decided to throw something together! This recipe is fresh and delicious and easily doubled for multiple people.
