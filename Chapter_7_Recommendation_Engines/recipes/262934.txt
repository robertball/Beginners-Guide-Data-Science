Ingredients:
Sauce:
1 teaspoon water, or as needed
1 teaspoon cornstarch, or more as needed
1/2 cup low-sodium beef broth
1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
2 teaspoons wine vinegar
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger (optional)
Stir-fry:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
1/2 pound asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 onion, chopped, or more to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 heads baby bok choy
1 zucchini, chopped
4 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Combine water and cornstarch together in a saucepan to desired thickness. Add beef broth, soy sauce, rice vinegar, wine vinegar, red pepper flakes, sugar, garlic, and ginger. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and let sauce simmer until thickened while you cook the vegetables, about 5 minutes.
Heat oil in a wok or large frying pan. Add asparagus, onion, and garlic; cook until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Add boy choy and zucchini; cook until still slightly crispy, about 5 minutes more. Stir sauce into the vegetables and top with sesame seeds.
