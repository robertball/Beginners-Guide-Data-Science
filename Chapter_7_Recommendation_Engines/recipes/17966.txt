Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1/2 cup shortening
1/3 cup white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
6 cups self-rising flour
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Mix in the shortening and sugar; stir until melted. Let cool until lukewarm. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine the cooled milk mixture and the yeast mixture. Stir in eggs and flour; beat well. Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled; about 1 hour. Stir batter to deflate. Cover bowl and refrigerate several hours or overnight.
Pour batter onto a lightly floured surface and roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut rolls into desired shape and place on lightly greased baking sheet. Brush with melted butter and let rise until doubled; about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown.

Description: 
These rolls take a while to make but are certainly worth the effort. My maternal grandmother made a double batch of these at each major holiday, and they were almost always gone before anything else! They're very tender and lightly sweet.
