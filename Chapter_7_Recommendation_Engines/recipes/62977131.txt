Ingredients:
2-1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon coarse salt
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
1 cup packed light-brown sugar
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1-1/2 cups sweetened shredded coconut
1-1/2 cups chopped dried apricots
1-1/2 cups chopped dates
1-1/2 cups chopped macadamia nuts
1-1/2 cups chopped pistachios

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°.  Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl, set aside.
Put butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix on medium speed until smooth.  Add sugars, and mix until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Reduce mixer speed to low.  Add flour mixture, and mix until just combined.  Stir in coconut, apricots, dates, macadamias and pistachios.
Drop batter, 2 heaping tablespoons at a time, onto baking sheets lined with parchment, spacing 2 inches apart.  Flatten slightly.  Bake cookies until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.  Transfer on parchment to a wire rack to cool.  Cookies can be stored in airtight containers at room temperature up to 3 days.
