Description: 
Tartare is a word that the French give to something with (mostly) raw ingredients that are minced and/or chopped. This is a world-famous, award-winning recipe given to my father by the barman at a deluxe hotel, who would knock this up on demand in record time. And boy, was it in demand! Chop the beef by hand, as machines tend to crush the meat and you end up with a soggy mess. My father's award-winning barman friend (sadly, now no longer with us) actually used 2 knives simultaneously in each hand to do this. He prepared the whole thing, including chopping the meat, in 15 minutes. If he knew he was going to be busy, then he pre-cut and sliced and diced everything beforehand, in which case he served it in less than 5 minutes. Serve with thin, buttered toast.
