Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup lard
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons milk
8 apples - peeled, cored and cut into thin wedges
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.)
In a large bowl, combine flour, 2 teaspoons white sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in 1/4 cup butter and lard until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Blend egg yolk and milk, add to flour mixture and stir until mixture forms a ball. Pat onto the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of an 8x12 inch baking pan. Arrange apple wedges in rows lengthwise on top of dough. Cover with streusel.
To make the streusel:  In a medium bowl, combine 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, cinnamon and 1 1/2 tablespoon flour. Cut in butter and blend into coarse meal.
Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes. Cover with foil the last 25 minutes to prevent over browning.
