Ingredients:
~Crust~
1 1/2 cups biscuit mix or 1 1/2 cups Bisquick, clone
1/2-3/4 cup water (Enough to make drop dumplings or form a sticky ball)
~Sauce and Toppings~
1 (16 ounce) jar pizza sauce or 2 cups homemade pizza sauce
1 -2 cups mozzarella cheese, depending on how much cheese you like
pizza toppings, of your choice (precook and drain any raw meat)
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Drizzle olive oil on the bottom of the crock then put about one quarter of your pizza sauce on the bottom of the crock.
Mix up your crust and spread on top of the sauce to almost touch the sides then cover with the remaining sauce and coat it all over so it sort of swims in the sauce like a giant soft dumpling.
Top with cheese and your chosen meat and veggies, cover and cook on high for about 2 hours. Enjoy!
