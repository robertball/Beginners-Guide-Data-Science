Ingredients:
Muffins:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice
2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon lemon zest
2 teaspoons lemon extract
1/2 cup coconut milk beverage (such as SilkÂ®)
1 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup mashed banana (optional)
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
Glaze:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 9 muffin cups or line cups with paper liners.
Whisk sugar, lemon juice, oil, lemon zest, and lemon extract together in a bowl until evenly blended. Add coconut milk and stir until well combined. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir into sugar mixture. Fold in mashed banana and poppy seeds.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, at least 25 minutes.
Mix confectioners' sugar and 1 tablespoon lemon juice together in a bowl. Brush glaze on top of the cooled muffins.

Description: 
The optional addition of a ripe banana makes these muffins very moist and sweet. With or without the banana these muffins are delicious. Plus they're vegan!
