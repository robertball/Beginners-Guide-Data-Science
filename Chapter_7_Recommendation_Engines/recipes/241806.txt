Description: 
This healthy, protein-packed tofu dish is filled with flavor. This is a spicy dish. I don't find it overly spicy but I like heat in my faux-meat! I served this with wilted garlic spinach and a fresh salad on the side. Remember that tofu is a concentrated protein, so you don't need as much tofu as you would meat. This dish is great reheated! If you want to be really creative, try grilling your tofu for an even more delicious result!
