Directions:
Heat 1 tsp Olive Oil in pan over low heat; toast Saffron 1 min.  Cool; crush Saffron in pan.  Add Clam Juice, bring to a boil; remove from heat, set aside.
Put large Paella pan (17-19 in) on med. heat.  Add Olive Oil, brush entire surface until hot.  Add Onion & Peppers to center of pan, cook until soft & dark.  Add Tomato, Garlic, Pimenton, & 1 tsp Salt.  Cook in center of pan, until thick (30-40 min).  Stir regularly, do not allow to burn.
Place Shrimp shells in large saucepan.  Stir on low-med. heat until dry & pink.  Add 6 cups Water, bring to boil.  Add 1/2 of Mussels, return to boil, lower heat, cover & simmer 10-12 minutes (until open).  Remove/discard shrimp shells; remove/retain mussels.  Combine with Saffron/Clam broth.
Add Rice (uncooked) to Paella pan, stir to combine with mixture (2-3 min) over med. heat.  Spread over entire pan in even layer.  Increase heat, slowly add 6 cups of broth.  Reduce heat to simmer, do not disturb mixture.  Move pan around on heat for even cooking; simmer until water & mixture at even level (8-10 min).
Place remaining Mussels & Clams in mixture, cover with foil, continue to simmer on low until water nearly evaporated (5 min).  Bury Shrimp in mixture (can be cut into large pieces if desired), continue cooking for total of 18-20 min or until Rice tender.  Add reserved broth if needed.
Heat 2 TBL broth in skillet.  Add Chorizo & cook 3-5 min on medium heat.  Place onto Paella.  Add in meat from broth Mussels and peas.
Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees.  Carefully check Paella, insure nothing sticking to pan (drizzle in broth to correct).  Place foil-covered into oven for 15-20 min or until all seafood & Chorizo is cooked.
Let stand covered 10 min.  Place Lemon slices & sprinkle Cilantro as garnish.  Serve.

Description: 
I love Paella, but don't always prefer what others include in their recipes.  So this is mine.  Feel free to swap out various seafood items with:  Squid; Scallops; Monkfish; Lobster meat; etc.  Or, use less seafood and include Chicken.  You can include other vegetables as well:  carrot pieces; kernels of corn; etc.  If you like the ingredients, don't be afraid to use them.
