Ingredients:
5 eggs
1 cup potato starch
1 teaspoon salt
oil for frying

Directions:
Beat eggs, potato starch, and salt together in a bowl until batter is slightly frothy.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Ladle in 1/2 the batter, forming a large pancake. Cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and blot excess oil with a paper towel. Repeat with the remaining batter.
Slice pancakes into thin, noodle-like strips. Add strips to soup at least 20 minutes before serving to fluff up.
