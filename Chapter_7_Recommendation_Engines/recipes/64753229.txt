Ingredients:
1/2 cup brown rice flour
1/2 cup all-purpose gluten free flour
3 Tbsp whole grain gluten free flour (such as buckwheat, quinoa, or millet)
2 Tbsp sugar
1 and 1/4 tsp baking powder
Pinch baking soda
2 medium eggs, separated
2 Tbsp light oil
1 cup buttermilk, divided

Directions:
1. Whisk together the dry ingredients in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the egg yolks, oil, and 3/4 cup buttermilk.
2. Add the dry ingredients to the egg yolk mixture, stir until just combined. Set aside. Do not overmix.
3. With a hand mixer, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. Fold in the egg whites to the batter. Check the consistency. If it is too thick, add the remaining buttermilk little-by-little, waiting a bit to allow the batter to set. Gluten free flours need time to absorb the liquid, thickening after about 45 seconds to one minute. When the batter has the consistency of tomato soup, heat a griddle to medium.
4. When the griddle is hot, add 1/4 cup of pancake batter to form the pancakes. Wait until the tops have become a bit dry and full of bubbles before flipping. When browned, remove from the griddle. Serve hot or wait until completely cooled before freezing.

Description: 
Traditional buttermilk pancake taste without the gluten; dense and fluffy at the same time. Using whole grain flours not only helps flavor and texture, but increases nutrition. The instructions take into account that some gluten free flours are thirstier than others. The pancakes freeze well, too. Just pop a frozen pancake in the toaster for a quick breakfast or snack.
