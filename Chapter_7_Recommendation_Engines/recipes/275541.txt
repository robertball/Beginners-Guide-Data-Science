Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion (large chunks)
5 cloves garlic, halved
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree
1 1/2 cups red wine
1/8 cup chopped fresh basil
1/8 cup chopped fresh oregano
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add tomato puree, red wine, basil, and oregano. Increase heat a touch and bring to a simmer. Cook until sauce reaches desired consistency, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Stir in butter and sugar; simmer for 10 more minutes. Remove from heat, allow to cool, and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
For a smooth sauce, remove onion and garlic pieces before spreading sauce on pizza crust. For a chunky sauce, use as is.
