Ingredients:
6 medium white potatoes, peeled and chopped
2 onions, chopped
1 carrot, peeled and diced
3 stalks celery, diced
1 tablespoon oil-packed minced garlic
4 cubes chicken bouillon
1 quart water
1 tablespoon parsley flakes
1 tablespoon salt-free herb seasoning blend
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 1/2 cups soy milk
2 cups chopped broccoli

Directions:
In a slow cooker, place the potatoes, onions, carrot, celery, oil-packed garlic, and bouillon cubes. Pour in the water, and season with parsley, herb seasoning blend, and Italian seasoning.
Cover slow cooker, and cook soup 3 to 4 hours on High, or 10 to 12 hours on Low. Stir in soy milk during the final 30 minutes of cook time.
Place broccoli over boiling water in a pot fitted with a steamer basket, and steam 5 minutes, or until tender but firm. Spoon into the soup to serve.

Description: 
This is a old family favorite that I have updated. I have used white potatoes, red potatoes with skins on, and sweet potatoes, and substituted mushrooms for the carrots. It's a very versatile recipe.
