1 large head of cauliflower
1 package (2 cups) of white mushrooms, diced
1-2 tablespoons of olive oil
1/8 cup of nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon of black pepper
1 teaspoon of garlic powder
1 teaspoon of minced onion

Directions:
Pulverize cauliflower to a rice-like consistency using a Ninja or food processer, or shred using a cheese grater.
Combine the "rice", mushrooms, and olive oil and mix constantly on high until the mushrooms are soft. Then add in the spices and turn the heat to low. Let sit on low for another 5-10 minutes.
Enjoy!
