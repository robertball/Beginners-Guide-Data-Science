Ingredients:
CRUST
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup LAND O LAKESÂ® Butter
3 tablespoons cold water
FILLING
2 eggs
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup whipping cream
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon salt
GINGER WHIPPED CREAM
1/2 cup chilled whipping cream
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees F.  Stir together flour and salt in large bowl; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Stir in enough water, with fork, just until flour is moistened.  Shape dough into a ball; flatten ball slightly.
Roll out ball on lightly floured surface into 12-inch circle.  Fold into quarters. Place dough into 9-inch pie pan; unfold, pressing firmly against bottom and sides.  Crimp or flute edge.  Set aside.
Beat eggs at medium speed in large mixer bowl until thick and lemon-colored (2 to 3 minutes).  Add all remaining filling ingredients; beat until well mixed (1 to 2 minutes).
Pour filling ingredients into prepared crust.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F.  Continue baking for 40 to 50 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool completely.
Beat 1/2 cup chilled whipping cream at high speed in chilled small bowl, scraping bowl often, until soft peaks form.  Add 1 tablespoon sugar and ginger.  Continue beating until stiff peaks form (1 to 2 minutes).
To serve, top each serving with a dollop of whipped cream.  Sprinkle with additional ground ginger, if desired. Store pie and whipped cream refrigerated.
