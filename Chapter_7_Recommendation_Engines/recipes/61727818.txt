Ingredients:
2 pounds beef chuck roast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons butter
4 green onions, sliced (white and green parts)
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups reduced-sodium beef stock
1 teaspoon prepared mustard
1/2 pound white or cremini mushrooms, sliced
1/3 cup white wine
1/3 cup light sour cream
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Remove any fat and gristle from the roast and cut into strips 1/2 inch thick by 2 inches long. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of both salt and pepper.
In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add the mushrooms and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are browned (about 6 minutes). Remove to bowl and add 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet.  Add about a third of the beef strips and brown quickly, then remove to a bowl. Repeat with the remaining butter and beef strips. Add the wine to the hot skillet and deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits.
Combine the flour and a 1/4 cup beef broth in a jar with a tighly fitting lid and shake until combined. Stir into the skillet, wisking until smooth. Stir in the remaining broth and mustard, then return the beef to the pan. Bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer until the meat is tender, about 1 hour.
Five minutes before serving, stir in the prepared mushrooms and the sour cream. Heat briefly then salt and pepper to taste.
