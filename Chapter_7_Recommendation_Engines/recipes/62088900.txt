Ingredients:
4 fish fillets (I like walleye)
1/2 t. lemmon pepper
1/2 t. basil (crushed in the palm of your hand)
1/2 stick butter (clarified)

Directions:
preheat oven to 500F
clarify the butter by melting in the microwave and using only the clear butter.
If you have metal steak plates that is best but any baking pan will do.
cover the bottom of your pan with the butter.
Place fillet skin side down in the butter.
sprinkle with lemon pepper and crushed basil.
bake until the fish flakes and the butter is sizzeling.
