Ingredients:
3/4 cup vegan chocolate chips
1 (10.5 ounce) package silken tofu
3/4 cup peanut butter
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker pie crust
1 ripe banana, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon vegan chocolate chips, or more to taste

Directions:
Place 3/4 cup chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until just melted, about 1 minute. Stir and allow to cool slightly.
Combine tofu, peanut butter, and maple syrup in a blender. Add melted chocolate and blend until smooth.
Cover the bottom of the pie crust with banana slices and pour chocolate-tofu mixture over top. Sprinkle with remaining chocolate chips and chill until firm, about 2 hours.
