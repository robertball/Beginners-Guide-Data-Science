Ingredients:
4 cups noodles (we used shells, but you can use elbow macaroni)
1 small pkg processed cheese (like Velveeta)
2 cups shredded sharp cheddar (we used a mixture of Tillamook cheddars)
1/4 cup yellow onion
2 Tbsp butter

Directions:
Chop onion finely and saute in butter over medium heat until golden brown and crisp.
Cut Velveeta into small cubes.
Boil noodles until almost over-done (not al-dente). Drain pasta and pour into a greased bowl. Add Velveeta, shredded cheese and onion and stir. Heat in the microwave until all the cheese is melted and well-incorporated into the pasta.
Serving Suggestions: We had ours with ketchup and garlic chili sauce (you can find it at Asian markets or in the asian section of your supermarket)
