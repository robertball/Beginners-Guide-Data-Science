Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup molasses
1 egg
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1 tablespoon cold water

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar. Beat in molasses and egg. Combine the flour, baking soda, ginger, salt, cinnamon and cloves; add to the creamed mixture alternately with water. Mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or until easy to handle.
On a well-floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a rocking horse cookie cutter or cutter of your choice dipped in flour. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9-11 minutes or until edges are firm. Remove to wire racks to cool.
