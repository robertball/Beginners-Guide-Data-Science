Ingredients:
1 pound pepper-jack cheese, cubed
1 8oz pkg. cream cheese
1 small can chopped green chillies
1 1/2 tsp granulated garlic
1 (14 ounce) package won ton wrappers
1 cup vegetable oil for deep frying

Directions:
In a small bowl combine pepper-jack cheese, cream cheese, green chillies, and garlic.
Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of cheese mixture into the center of each wonton skin.  Fold the top and bottom corners in toward each other and roll it up like a little egg roll.  You will have to seal the wonton with a little water where the ends meet.
Heat oil in a deep pot to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).  Fry the wontons two or three at a time.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve immediately.
