Ingredients:
3 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed chicken broth
2 cups water
1/2 cup finely chopped green onions
1/2 cup uncooked wild rice
8 slices bacon
1/2 cup margarine
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups half-and-half cream
1 1/2 cups cooked, diced turkey meat
2 tablespoons dry sherry

Directions:
In a large pot over medium heat, combine chicken broth, water, green onions and wild rice.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until rice is tender, 35 to 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp.  Allow to cool and then crumble.  Set aside.
When rice is tender, melt the margarine in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Stir in flour, salt, poultry seasoning and pepper all at once.  Cook, stirring, until smooth and bubbly.  Stir in half-and-half and cook until thickened, 2 minutes.  Stir half-and-half mixture into rice mixture.  Stir in bacon, turkey and sherry.  Heat through and serve.
