Mix together lamb, breadcrumbs, fennel, shallot, oregano, and salt. Form into 3/4-inch-thick patties, and sprinkle black pepper over each.

Description: 
My mother never really cooked ground meat, but I have given these burgers the flavor of her Greek cooking. I like a lot of pepper on mine, coating each side liberally, but the kids prefer these burgers with just a very little finely ground pepper. Serve with a garlic mayonnaise.
