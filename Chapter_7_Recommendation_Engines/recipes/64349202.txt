Ingredients:
4 large eggs
•			30 oz container of ricotta cheese
•			2 cups shredded parmesan cheese
•			16 oz mozzarella cheese, freshly shredded and divided in half (about 4 cups total)
•			2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes
•			2 teaspoons salt
•			1 teaspoon pepper
•			45 oz jar of pasta sauce
•			2.5 oz fresh baby spinach, chopped (about 3 cups)
•			Two boxes of “oven ready” lasagna noodles with no boiling required (I used 24 noodles, about 1.5 boxes)

Directions:
•	In a large bowl, create cheese filling by combining eggs, ricotta, parmesan, half of the mozzarella cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper.
•	Spread a thin layer of pasta sauce at the bottom of each pan.
•	Layer lasagna noodles, cheese filling, fresh spinach, and pasta sauce until you have four layers of noodles in each pan.
•	Top the fourth layers with remaining pasta sauce and mozzarella cheese. (Make sure to cover the entire noodles with sauce so they don’t get crunchy when baked.)
To Cook Immediately
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cover lasagna with foil and bake for 40 minutes, or until center is hot.  Remove foil and bake for additional 5-10 minutes or until cheese on top is melted.
To Freeze
Cover each pan with layers of plastic wrap and foil, and freeze for up to three months.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Remove plastic wrap and replace foil.  Bake frozen lasagna 60 minutes or until center is hot.  Remove foil and bake for additional 5-10 minutes or until cheese on top is melted.
