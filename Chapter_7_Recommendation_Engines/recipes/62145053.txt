Description: 
I created this recipe many years ago for my hubby who does NOT like the traditional sour cream sauce on his chicken enchiladas.  It's been a hit with family and friends every since.  Now with our Instant Pot it's been improved and made better than ever!  For a different take on chicken enchiladas that will make everyone happy, give this one a try!
