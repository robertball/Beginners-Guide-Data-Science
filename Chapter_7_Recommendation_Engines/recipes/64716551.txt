Ingredients:
6 lbs prime rib, bone-in or out - it's up to you!
Coarsely ground black pepper
Sea salt
Garlic
Garlic powder
Rosemary
Paprika
Lemon pepper (a little bit for some tanginess)
Italian seasoning (optional)
Chipotle powder (optional if you'd like to add a bit of heat and smokiness)
Bacon grease (rub on the cut ends to keep them from drying out)
Whole garlic cloves, peeled

Directions:
Allow the roast to sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to an hour before seasoning and cooking.
Combine all of the seasonings together in a small bowl. (No measurements for this, just eyeball it.)
Coat the ends of the roast in bacon grease or butter to help seal them and prevent them from drying out.
Using a paring knife, pierce the roast to make fingertip size wholes. Stuff the peeled garlic cloves into the wholes.
Generously coat the roast in the seasoning mixture.
Cook in a 250째F oven for 3-4 hours, or until desired level of doneness is reached:
115째F for rare, 125째F for medium-rare, 135째F for medium.
You can do a quicker cook by putting the roast in a super hot over to brown it then turn it down to the 325 range but I prefer the longer cook method. Depends on how much time you have really. Longer cooking time at lower temp rewards with super juicy meat.
Remove from the oven, cover lightly with foil, and allow to rest for about 30 minutes before slicing and serving.
Serve with the pan juices and enjoy!
