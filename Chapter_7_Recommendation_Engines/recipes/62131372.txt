Ingredients:
4 cups minute rice
4 cups water
1/2 cup chopped onion (omit if kids)
1/2 cup green pepper (omit if kids)
1-28 oz. can of tomato sauce
1-24 oz. can of refried beans
3-4 chicken breasts
2 tsp. vegetable oil
2/3 cup water
1 package taco seasoning
1 1/2 to 2 cups grated cheddar cheese
Tortillas
lettuce, chopped
tomatoes, chopped
sour cream
taco sauce
Tortilla chips

Directions:
Heat water, onion, and gr. pepper to boiling. (Leave out onion and gr. pepper if kids are picky). Add minute rice, cover and let sit for 5 minutes.  Stir in can of tomato sauce. Spread half of this rice mixture into a 9 x 13 pan. Spread refried bean over the top of this. (I heat in the micro to make them easier to spread) Cut chicken breasts into strips. Fry on medium heat in vegetable oil, until cooked through and browning on outside. Drain any oil or fat if necessary. Add water and taco seasoning cooking according to package.  This is optional, but I pulse the chicken when it is done in my quisinart a few times to get shredded chicken. You can chop yourself or leave in strips.  Spread chicken over refried beans. Spread cheddar over chicken. Top with remaining 1/2 of rice mixture. Bake on 350 for 30 to 45 minutes, til heated through.  Serve up with remaining fixings for burritos or scoop up with chips. Make a double batch and freeze one for when you don't feel like cooking!
