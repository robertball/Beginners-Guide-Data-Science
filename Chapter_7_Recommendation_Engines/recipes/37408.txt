Easy Herbed Focaccia
You may substitute 1 tablespoon dried rosemary for 1/4 cup fresh. Divide into 3/4 and 1/4 tablespoon to follow recipe.
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
1 (32 ounce) package frozen bread dough, thawed
all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
1/4 cup fresh rosemary, divided
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (optional)
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Easy Herb Focaccia:    BRUSH a 15- x 10-inch jellyroll pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil; set aside.
TURN bread dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead 3 to 4 times or until smooth.
STIR together butter, 3 tablespoons rosemary, and Parmesan cheese; gradually knead mixture into bread dough until dough is smooth and elastic, adding additional flour, if necessary.
PRESS dough evenly into prepared pan. Using fingertips, press small indentations in top of dough; sprinkle with garlic and remaining 1 tablespoon rosemary. Drizzle with remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil; sprinkle with kosher salt, if desired, and pepper. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.
BAKE at 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cut into squares.
