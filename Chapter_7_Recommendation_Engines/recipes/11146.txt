Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate
1/3 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons pasteurized egg
1 cup rolled oats
1 1/2 cups flaked coconut
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon butter
2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate

Directions:
In a saucepan, melt 1/2 cup butter or margarine with 2 squares chocolate. Remove from the heat, and stir in white sugar, egg, rolled oats, coconut, chopped nuts, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Press mixture into a greased 9 inch square pan, and chill for 1 hour.
Combine confectioners' sugar with 3 tablespoons softened butter, 1/2 teaspoon of the vanilla, and milk. Mix until it has an icing-like consistency, and spread it over the oat mixture in the pan. Chill for 1/2 hour.
Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter or margarine with remaining 2 squares chocolate. Spread over the top of the bars. Chill for 4 to 5 hours.
Cut into squares using a hot knife; dip knife in hot water, and let it melt through the chocolate.

Description: 
A no-bake square, that freezes well. I make these during the year, but they are a must on my Christmas baking list as family and friends look for them. My parents live just outside of Nanaimo, B.C. Canada.
