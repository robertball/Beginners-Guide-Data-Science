Ingredients:
1/4 cup canola oil
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
cooking spray
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1/4 tsp ground ginger
1/8 tsp ground cloves
1/8 tsp allspice
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup granulated sugar
2 eggs
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 tsp pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Adjust a rack to the center of your oven. Preheat oven to 350. Lightly spray a mini muffin pan (or two pans, if you have them) with nonstick cooking spray. Or you can use paper mini muffin cups - whatever floats your boat.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, spices, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the oil, sugar, eggs, pumpkin, and vanilla. Whisk flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture until well combined. Using a cookie scoop or measuring cup, fill the mini muffin tin with the batter. You should end up with about 29 mini muffins, depending on your pan(s).
Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean - about 18-20 minutes. Cool muffins in the pan on a cooling rack.
