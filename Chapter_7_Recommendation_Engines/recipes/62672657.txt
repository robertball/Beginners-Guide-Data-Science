Ingredients:
2 bunches green onions
1 (14 ounce) can light coconut milk
1/4 cup soy sauce, divided
1/2 teaspoon brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
2 teaspoons chile paste
1 pound boneless, chicken breast, cut into 3/4 inch cubes
4 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced
4 ounces fresh mushrooms, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
4 cups chopped bok choy
salt to taste

Directions:
Remove white parts of green onions, and finely chop. Chop greens into 2 inch pieces.
In a large heavy skillet over medium heat, mix coconut milk, 3 tablespoons soy sauce, brown sugar, curry powder, ginger, and chile paste. Bring to a boil.
Stir chicken into the skillet and cook for 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes, yellow pepper, mushrooms, and finely chopped green onions into the skillet next. Cover, and cook 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally until chicken is cooked through and veggies have your desired consistency. Mix in basil and bok choy. Season with salt and remaining soy sauce. Continue cooking 5 minutes, or until vegetables are tender but crisp. Garnish with remaining green onion.

Description: 
I love curry dishes, but most of them lack lots of veggies -- so this recipe caught my eye. I'm not supposed to eat Tofu (too much Soy), so I swapped out chicken breast for the tofu.Modified from: Coconut Curry Tofu
