Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package classic white cake mix
3 large eggs
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup strawberry jam
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 (16 ounce) container prepared strawberry frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Mix cake mix, eggs, water, and vegetable oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer; slowly mix in strawberry jam until fully blended into the batter. Beat lemon juice into batter until smooth. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 19 minutes. Cool cupcakes on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.
Spread strawberry frosting onto each cupcake.
