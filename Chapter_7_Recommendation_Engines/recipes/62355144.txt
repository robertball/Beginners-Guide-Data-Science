Ingredients:
1 cup evaporated milk
2 tablespoons sugar
2 cups heavy cream
3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk
1/4 cup of loose Thai tea leaves in a tea sock
5 large egg yolks

Directions:
Warm the evaporated milk, sugar, heavy cream, sweetened condensed milk and tea leaves in a medium sauce pan. Cover, remove from the heat and let steep at room temperature for 1 hour.
When the mixture is cooled, squeeze excess liquid from the tea sock to maximize the flavor of the tea. Rewarm the tea-infused milk.
In a separate bowl, whisk together egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm mixture into the egg yolks whisking constantly, then scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the sauce pan.
Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens.
Chill the mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator, then freeze it in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.
