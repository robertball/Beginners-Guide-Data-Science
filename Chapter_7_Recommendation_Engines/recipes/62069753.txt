Ingredients:
8 oz. cream cheese, room temperature
4 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup water
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 tsp. lemon extract
1 box pudding variety lemon cake mix, such as Pillsbury
powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat the overn to 350 degrees. Mix the softened cream cheese with the beaten eggs in a large bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients, except for the powdered sugar, and using a hand mixer, beat over medium high speed until the cream cheese is blended with the rest of the ingredients. There will be some very small lumps of cream cheese. Spray a bundt pan with non-stick cooking spray. Pour the batter into the pan and bake until the cake is lightly browned and when a toothpick inserted into it comes back clean. Cool completely and gently remove the cake from the pan. Sift powdered sugar over it just prior to serving it.

Description: 
This lighter version of pound cake is easy to make and utilizes store bought cake mix as a base. Use any type of cake mix that can incorporate compatible food extracts, such as orange with orange cake, almond with butter cake, amaretto with chocolate cake, etc. Also, I only use Mexican vanilla, but if you don't have access to it, a good commercial brand will do fine.
