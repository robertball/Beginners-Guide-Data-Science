Ingredients:
1/2 lb ground beef
2 onions, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
1 cup frozen corn
2 tbsps minced garlic
1 28 ounce can diced tomatoes with herbs and spices
1 tbsp soya sauce
1 tbsp chili powder or taco seasoning
1 tsp Italian seasoning
pepper to taste
2 cups elbow macaroni or small shells, uncooked
2 cups shredded Italian or Mexican blend cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large saucepan brown beef and onions, drain off fat.
Drain liquid from canned tomatoes into a 4 cup measuring cup, add water if needed to make 2 1/2 cups of liquid.
Add tomato juice, tomatoes, garlic, green pepper, corn, soya sauce, chili powder, Italian seasoning, pepper and macaroni to the pot, bring to a boil.
Pour half the mixture into a well greased 8 cup baking dish, sprinkle with 1 cup of cheese, add remainder of mixture, sprinkle with the remaining cup of cheese.
Bake covered for 30 minutes, remove cover and bake for another 15 minutes, remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.
I always place it on an old cookie sheet so if it bubbles over there is no mess in the oven.
