Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked orzo pasta
1 1/2 cups cubed fresh mozzarella cheese
2 fresh plum tomatoes, seeded and cut into bite-size pieces
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
salt to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the orzo, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain well, and let cool.
Mix the mozzarella cheese cubes, tomatoes, basil, crushed red pepper flakes, and salt with olive oil in a salad bowl. Gently mix in the orzo pasta, and toss lightly to coat the ingredients with oil.

Description: 
A take on a traditional Caprese, but modified into a light summer pasta salad that goes great with anything off the grill, or just on its own. When I eat it on its own, I sometimes add about a cup of any chunked, cold sausage (I suggest pepperoni or a lighter summer sausage). Any pasta is fine, but I like the orzo's size.
