Ingredients:
3 cups self-rising flour
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup tomato-vegetable juice cocktail

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Stir the flour, baking soda, salt, and sugar together in a bowl, and cut in the shortening with a pastry cutter until the mixture looks like crumbs. Mix in the vegetable juice cocktail just until moist, and turn out onto a well-floured work surface. Gently knead several times just until dough holds together, roll out to 1/2-inch thick, and cut into rounds with a biscuit cutter. Place the biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until risen and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
My father was a man that could take an unstocked kitchen and make a gourmet meal. I watched him make these biscuits when we were out of milk. Just amazing!
