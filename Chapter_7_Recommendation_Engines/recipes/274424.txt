Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
1 cup chopped green onions
2 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 cup chopped kimchi, drained and 1/4 cup juice reserved

1 (5 ounce) package fresh baby spinach
1 1/2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
2 teaspoons sesame oil
4 eggs

Directions:
Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons sesame oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high. Add green onions and garlic; saute 1 minute. Add chopped kimchi and Jasmine Rice; saute 4 minutes. Gradually add fresh spinach, stirring until spinach wilts, about 2 minutes. Stir in kimchi juice, soy sauce, and gochujang. Remove from heat and set aside.
Heat remaining sesame oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully crack eggs into hot oil and fry until desired degree of doneness. Place 1 egg on top of 1 cup of fried rice and serve immediately.
