Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons brown sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
3 beaten eggs
2 cups vanilla soy milk with added fiber (Silk Plus, for example)

Directions:
In a medium mixing bowl stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Make a well in the center of the dry mixture and set aside.
In a second medium mixing bowl combine the egg and soy milk. Add egg mixture all at once to the dry mixture. Stir until just moistened (batter should be lumpy).
For standard-size pancakes, pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto a hot, lightly greased griddle or nonstick pan. Cook over medium heat about 2 minutes on each side or until pancakes brown, turning to second sides when pancakes have bubbly surfaces and edges are slightly dry.
