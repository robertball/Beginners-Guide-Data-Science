Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) bone-in turkey breast
1/4 cup fresh parsley sprigs
1/4 cup fresh basil leaves
3 tablespoons butter
4 cloves garlic, halved
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 medium lemon, thinly sliced
1 medium orange, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons water
1 cup orange juice
1 teaspoon grated orange peel
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Using fingers, carefully loosen the skin from both sides of turkey breast. In a food processor or blender, combine the parsley, basil, butter, garlic and salt; cover and process until smooth. Spread under turkey skin; arrange lemon and orange slices over herb mixture. Secure skin to underside of breast with toothpicks.
Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Prepare grill for indirect heat, using a drip pan. Place turkey over drip pan. Grill, covered, over indirect medium heat for 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F and juices run clear. Cover and let stand for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, pour pan drippings into a measuring cup; skim fat. In a saucepan, combine the cornstarch and water until smooth. Add the orange juice, orange peel, lemon peel, pepper and pan drippings. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Discard the skin, lemon and orange slices from turkey breast. Remove herb mixture from turkey; stir into gravy. Slice turkey and serve with gravy.
