Description: 
Smoky mezcal and an unusual liqueur are the stars of this flavorful cocktail. You'll shake the mezcal with amaro, lime juice, and simple syrup, and then top it off with a splash of ginger beer and a floater of Malort速 liqueur. There's so much going on in this cocktail. It's like nothing you've tasted before. Garnish with fresh mint and a wedge of lime. This exciting cocktail is the signature drink at Simone's in Chicago.
