Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef
one egg
1/2 - 3/4 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup ketchup + 1 tbsp. ketchup
1 slice of american cheese, torn into little pieces (or you can use shredded cheddar if you like)
2 tsp. seasoning salt

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl.  Pour mixture into loaf pan or just shape the mixture into a loaf shap with your hands and put it on a baking sheet.
Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour.  Cheese will ooze slightly around the meatloaf (yum, yum.)  15 minutes before removing from oven, spread about a tablespoon of ketchup over the top and sides of meatloaf.

Description: 
This meatloaf is so moist and delicious, you might want to double the recipe.  The smells that come from the oven are almost as good as the taste.  We never have any leftovers.
