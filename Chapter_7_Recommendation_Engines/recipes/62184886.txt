Directions:
Using reserved shrimp shells to make a stock, boil shrimp shells in 6 cups of water. Sit aside to steep. In a large stock pot, brown salt bacon in oil. Add onions and saute until clear or starting to brown.  Add shrimp stock and bring to a boil. Add rice. Cover and lower heat to simmer until rice is cooked. Add canned tomatoes. Stir to mix. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add shrimp and let simmer until shrimp are opaque.  Better the longer it sits, in fact it is even better served the next day! It can also be made with less shrimp when money is tight!
