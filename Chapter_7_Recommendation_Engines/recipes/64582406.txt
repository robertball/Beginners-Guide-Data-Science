Ingredients:
5 Tbsp of my "bouillon" substitute
2 tsp onion powder
1/8 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp pepper
4 tablespoons tapioca starch
Add later:
2 tsp vegan/gluten free yeast extract per 2 cups of liquid

Directions:
Pulse all the dry ingredients in a mini processor for 30 seconds until completely ground and well combined. Store in an airtight container.
When using, add the yeast extract.
To use:
For every 2 cups of liquid add 1 Tbsp and 2 tsp of powder plus 2 tsp yeast extract

Submitter: 
Buckwheat Queen
Description: 
Because I can't find au jus packets over here and even if I could, I can't eat them for the gluten and after reading the ingredients list am scared beyond belief at all the sodium and chemicals. So here's a better solution.
