Ingredients:
2 teaspoons chipotle chile powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple rings, drained and juice reserved
1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
1 red onion, thinly sliced
1/4 cup brown sugar
4 boneless pork chops
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese

Directions:
Combine chipotle powder, garlic powder, cinnamon, and onion powder in a small bowl.
Pat pineapple rings dry.
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large, nonstick saucepan over medium-high heat. Add pineapple rings and red onion; sprinkle with 3 tablespoons reserved pineapple juice and brown sugar. Cook until pineapple is lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer pineapple-onion mixture to a plate.
Pat pork chops dry and lightly season both sides with salt and pepper.
Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in the same saucepan over medium-high heat; swirl to coat pan. Add chops; cook until bottom is browned, about 3 minutes. Flip and sprinkle the chipotle mixture on top. Cook until other side is browned, about 3 minutes. Continue flipping and cooking until no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Transfer chops onto a plate and top with the pineapple-onion mixture. Sprinkle goat cheese on top.
