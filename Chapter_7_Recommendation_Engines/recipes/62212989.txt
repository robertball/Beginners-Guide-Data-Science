Ingredients:
1 tsp butter
1/4 Cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 Cup water
1 head broccoli, chopped very small
2 cans low-fat cream of mushroom soup
2 cans non-fat milk
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 cup cold water
1 packet McCormicks country gravy mix

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic until they are fragrent and soft.
Turn the stove up to medium high and pour in the 1/2 cup water and broccoli.  Cover the soup pot to let the broccoli steam for about 5 minutes.
Uncover the pot and add the cans of soup and milk and stir until it is all combined.
Stir in the shredded cheese.
While the soup is heating through, whisk the gravy packet into the cup of cold water until smooth.  Just before the soup boils, whisk the gravy mixture into the soup. Continue whisking until the soup has thickened. Immediately take it off the heat so it does not boil.

Description: 
I threw this together one night on a whim, it turned out very thick and delicious, without a ton of extra cheese. Great for serving in bread bowls.
