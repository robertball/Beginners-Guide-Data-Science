Ingredients:
? cup raw cashews, soaked for 3-4 hours in advance and then drained
1-2 tablespoons nutritional yeast (optional)
1 teaspoon whole chia seeds
scant ½ teaspoon sea salt
½ teaspoon kelp granules (see notes)
½ teaspoon capers
1 medium clove garlic, chopped
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
?-½ cup unsweetened, unflavored plant milk (plus extra to thin)
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1½ teaspoons pure maple syru

Directions:
Combine the cashews, 1 tablespoon of the nutritional yeast (if using), the chia, salt, kelp granules, capers, garlic, pepper, milk, lemon juice, and maple syrup in a blender, and purée until very smooth. Add more nutritional yeast for a cheesier flavor if you like, and add extra salt, pepper and/or garlic if desired.
Serve tossed into romaine lettuce, along with your choice of croutons, if desired.
Refrigerate for up to 4 days. This dressing will thicken after refrigeration. You can thin it by stirring in 2 to 3 teaspoons of plant milk or water, if desired.

Description: 
You can make this creamy, delicious (and very authentic-tasting) Caesar dressing as is, or add nutritional yeast for a cheesy twist. You can also reduce the milk and use it as a dip or sandwich spread.
