Description: 
Extremely yummy, spicy marinated salad that will keep in the fridge for up to a week! My kids in university love packing this up for their lunch. You have everything you need for a very healthy meal in one dish! Substitute barley for the brown rice if desired. Turtle beans can be substituted for kidney beans.
