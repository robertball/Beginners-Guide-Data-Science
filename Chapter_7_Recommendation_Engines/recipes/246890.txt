Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package soba noodles
1/3 cup vegetable oil, divided
1 small onion, finely chopped
4 scallions, finely chopped
4 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Add soba noodles; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and toss with 1 tablespoon oil. Allow to cool, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and scallions; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir onion mixture into the noodles in the bowl. Add eggs, salt, and black pepper; mix until well-combined.
Pour remaining oil into a 9-inch baking dish. Place dish in the oven to heat the oil, about 2 minutes. Remove from the oven and pour in noodle mixture.
Bake kugel in the preheated oven until golden, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great fusion of Jewish and Asian cuisine. The texture of the soba noodles works so well in this form. With the scallions and dipping sauce it is like a Jewish Scallion Pancake. Serve with a ponzu dipping sauce if desired.
