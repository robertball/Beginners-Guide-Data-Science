Ingredients:
1 pound bulk pork sausage
4 cups water
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup quick-cooking grits
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup butter, softened

Directions:
Crumble sausage into a large skillet. Cook over medium heat until no longer pink; drain and set aside. In a saucepan, bring water and salt to a boil. Slowly stir in grits. Reduce heat and cook 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Stir a small amount of hot grits into the eggs; return all to the saucepan, stirring constantly. Add the sausage, 1 cup cheese, milk and butter, stirring until the butter is melted.
Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until the top begins to brown.

Description: 
Grits is a main ingredient for many Southern meals. I've had this recipe for years and never grow tired of it. It's especially good to serve on a lazy weekend, since leftover portions are very tasty served cold.
