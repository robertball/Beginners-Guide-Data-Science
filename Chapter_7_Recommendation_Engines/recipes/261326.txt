Description: 
Traditional Italian meat sauce (ragu) prepared in an Instant Pot®. When cooking in an Instant Pot®, the amount of liquid is minimal, so there is no additional water or broth required for this recipe. The final consistency is thick enough to toss with pasta, not too runny. Cooks much faster than traditional stovetop version! Just toss with pasta and serve.
