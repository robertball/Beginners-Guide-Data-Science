Tomato Blue Cheese Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
2 tsp olive oil
1/2 onion, diced
1 carrot, peeled and diced
salt and pepper
1 clove of garlic, minced
8 cups tomato juice or thinned tomato sauce (I roasted some "on the old side" grape tomatoes)
2 cups chicken broth
2 tsp fresh oregano, chopped
1 Tbsp fresh basil, chopped
1 tsp Sriracha chili sauce (or your favorite chili sauce, and use more or less according to your tastes)
2 oz reduced fat cream cheese
2 oz blue cheese (use less for a less pronounced flavor or use more!)

Directions:
1. In soup pot, heat olive oil over medium heat.
2. Add onion and carrot and season with salt and pepper.
3. Saute for 5-6 minutes then add the garlic and saute for another minute or two.
4. Add the tomato juice, chicken broth, oregano, basil, and hot sauce.
5. Increase heat a bit and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until carrots are tender, 20-25 minutes.
6. Stir in cream cheese and blue cheese.
7. Remove from heat and stir to melt the cheeses. Don't worry if they don't completely melt and incorporate into the soup.
8. OPTIONAL! Working in batches, puree soup in blender and return to pot.
9. Season again with salt and pepper if needed.
Serve with crispy garlic bread or croutons. Recipe follows:
To make homemade croutons I just cube old bread, drizzle on some olive oil, then season with whatever you're in the mood for that day. Today it was salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Place on baking sheet and bake in a 300 degree oven for one hour, stirring every 15 minutes.
