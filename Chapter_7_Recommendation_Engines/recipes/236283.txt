Description: 
I am always looking for new ways to use Brussels sprouts. People always claim they had Brussels sprouts once and hated them, but I have converted several people with this recipe. I think the bacon helps. For kids or people who claim to not like Brussels sprouts, try shredding them to tone down the flavor a bit.
