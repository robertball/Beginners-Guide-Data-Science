Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
4 tablespoons cocoa powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 eggs
1 (12 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips
2 cups grated unpeeled zucchini
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two loaf pans.
Combine flour, cocoa, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and baking powder in a medium bowl and mix together. Set aside.
Cream sugar, butter, oil, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, until mixed. Mix the dry ingredients slowly into the sugar mixture on medium speed until incorporated. Gently add chocolate chips, zucchini, and walnuts with a spoon. Pour batter equally into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into each loaf comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Don't overcook.

Description: 
This super easy zucchini bread is so moist and chocolaty that it's easy to forget zucchini is in it! My husband even loves it and he's never been a fan of zucchini!
