Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) deep dish pie crust
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
1/4 cup white sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups chopped pecans
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
In a small bowl, blend together cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/3 cup sugar, and salt.  Mix by hand until mostly smooth.  Spread  mixture into the bottom of the unbaked pie shell.  Sprinkle with chopped pecans.
In another bowl, slightly beat 3 eggs.  Stir in 1/4 cup sugar, corn syrup, and 1 teaspoon vanilla; blend well.  Fold in chopped  chocolate or chocolate chips.  Very CAREFULLY pour corn syrup mixture over pecans.    Cover pie crust edge with a strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes, or until center is set.  Cool completely.  Store in refrigerator.

Description: 
This is a 3 layer pie: the bottom crust, a creamy cheesecake-like layer, and  a delicious pecan pie layer on top.  Warning: this is very rich, and definitely NOT diet food.   Especially good with a dollop of whipped cream.  It might keep up to a week in the fridge, but it's never lasted that long at our house! Dark chocolate pieces may be used in place of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Instead of chopped pecans, trying arranging pecan halves in an eye-pleasing manner on top of pie.
