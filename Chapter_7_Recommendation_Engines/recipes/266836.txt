Ingredients:
Dressing:
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon minced shallot
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Salad:
5 pint-sized jars with lids
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
20 cherry tomatoes, halved
8 cups stemmed kale, cut into ribbons
1 pinch salt
5 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Whisk lemon juice, red wine vinegar, shallot, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Slowly drizzle in olive oil, whisking constantly until dressing is combined.
Line jars up in an assembly line fashion. Divide beans evenly between the jars. Spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons dressing over the beans. Add 8 tomato halves to each jar.
Sprinkle kale with salt and lightly massage until leaves are slightly softened and starting to turn a brighter green color, 20 to 30 seconds. Divide kale between the jars, packing it down tightly to squeeze out air pockets.
Top each salad with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Place lids on jars and refrigerate. Pour salad out into a bowl and toss when ready to eat.
