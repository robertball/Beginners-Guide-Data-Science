Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
2 eggs
1 cup pumpkin seed and flax granola
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix together flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl; set aside.
Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until mixture has the consistency of a smooth paste. Add eggs and beat until smooth and creamy. Add granola, raisins, and walnuts and beat with the mixer until smooth with a slightly grainy texture. Stir in flour mixture until a dough forms. Drop teaspoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned on top, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
