Ingredients:
Main items:
1/2 lbs. ham ground
1 1/2 lbs. ground pork
1 cup. cracker crumbs
1 cup. Milk
1/4 t. pepper
2 eggs
1 t. worchestire sauce
Sauce:
1 1/2 cup. brown sugar
1 T. dried mustard
1/2 cup. vinegar
1/2 cup. water

Directions:
Keep the sauce items separate, mix all the “main items” together with the meat and form into round balls (as big or little as you want). Set aside.
For the sauce: Bring this mixture to a boil and pour over balls.
Cover with tinfoil and bake for 2 hours at 350 degrees. After 40 minutes of it baking take the tinfoil off and continue checking the hamballs every 15 minutes. Flip them so they don’t burn.
