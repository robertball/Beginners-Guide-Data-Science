Ingredients:
2 egg whites
6 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 cups unblanched almonds
1/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a medium sized bowl, mix together sugars, cinnamon, and salt. Set aside. In another medium sized bowl, whisk the egg white and vanilla until it’s a little frothy. Add almonds. Make sure the almonds are thoroughly coated in the egg white mixture. Add cinnamon mixture to the almonds and toss until coated.
Thoroughly spray with Pam, or whatever, the stoneware of your large crock pot (mine is a 4 quart). Add the divine mixture of almonds and sugars to the crock pot and turn it to low.
Cook 3-4 hours stirring every 20 minutes.  In the last hour, add the 1/4 C. of water and stir well. This ensures a crunchy yummy coating.
Line a baking sheet with parchment and spread the almonds flat to cool, if you can wait for them to cool…
