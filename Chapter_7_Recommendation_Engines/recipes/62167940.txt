Ingredients:
Ingredients
1½ lbs ground beef or turkey
2 Tbsp Olive oil or vegetable oil for browning
Jar of Salsa (mild, medium, or hot; depending on your taste)
1 onion chopped
2 clove garlic chopped
1 can seedless black olives chopped
2 cans 10oz ea of Old El Paso Enchilada Sauce
1 can 14 1/2 oz tomato sauce
3 cups shredded cheddar or Monterey jack cheese
1 large bag tortilla chips  roughly crumbled by hand (you can do while they are in the sealed bag) You can use Doritos  however I now use regular corn tortilla chips for less salt content.
2 Tbsp butter or margarine for greasing lasagna pan
Sour cream for serving
Handful of chopped scallion or green onion for serving

Directions:
In a large pan brown the ground meat
About halfway through (ten minutes or so) add the chopped onion and garlic and continue to brown meat until done and until onions and garlic are soft.
Add a pinch of salt and pepper just to meld the flavors and stir.
Drain if needed and add salsa and chopped olives - remove from heat.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Grease a 13x9” lasagna pan liberally,
add enough tomato sauce to coat the bottom.
Now make a “layer” of tortilla chips, using the palm of your hand to flatten any edges, in the bottom of the pan.
Add half of the meat mixture, spreading evenly over the layer of chips, followed by one can of the enchilada sauce and then a nice handful of cheese.
Repeat the process – crumbling enough tortilla chips on top to cover completely, then using the rest of the ground meat on this second layer, the second can of enchilada sauce, and another handful of cheese  - be sure to reserve a good portion of the cheese for the top.
Finish with a third layer of crushed chips on top - then spread the rest of the cheese on top of this, followed by the reserved tomato sauce, spreading evenly over the top of the lasagna.
Bake for appx. 35-45 minutes, or until top is bubbly and cheese is melted.  Some folks like to bake it a bit more until the cheese is brown and almost crispy – we prefer it cooked a bit less so it’s more gooey and saucy.
Remove from oven and let stand for 15 minutes to come together.
Slice and serve each piece with a dollop of sour cream and pinch of chopped scallion on top.

Description: 
This stores well (it gets better the next day) and freezes well too.  

I came up with this recipe while trying to figure out what to do with a nearly full bag of Doritos that had been left out on the table open after a football game one night  and was too stale to eat right out of the bag anymore.   

Hey, without stale milk we wouldn’t have cheese or yogurt, right?
