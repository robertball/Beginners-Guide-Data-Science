Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) box whole wheat rigatoni
1 tablespoon vegan margarine
1 small onion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 (12 ounce) package vegetarian beef crumbles (such as Boca®)
1 (12 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
6 ounces vegan sour cream
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion and mushroom soup mix (such as Lipton®)
1 cup boiling water
1 cube vegetable bouillon
1/4 cup soy milk
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt margarine in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; reduce heat to medium and saute until onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add vegetarian crumbles and mushrooms; saute until mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes.
Mix vegan sour cream and soup mix together in a small bowl.
Pour boiling water over bouillon cube and mix well until dissolved. Stir into the skillet and bring to a simmer. Mix in sour cream mixture, soy milk, and nutritional yeast. Cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Drain rigatoni and serve with sauce.
