Ingredients:
1 cup buckwheat(kasha)
1 cup basmati rice
4 cups water, separated
1 tbsp butter or margarine
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp salt
1 large green bell pepper
1 large red bell pepper
Tabasco sauce (to taste)
Chicken Bullion cube

Directions:
Mix rice, olive oil and salt in rice cooker or on stove, cooking as you normally would.
Place kasha in small pot with 2 cups water, butter and bullion cube, cooking on med/hi and stirring often just until water disappears, taking care not to burn.
Chop peppers into 1 inch strips and saute lightly with desired amount of Tabasco (the hotter the better for me!) in a large pot.
Once kasha and rice are cooked, mix them into large pot with peppers. Stir until ingredients are incorporated.
