Ingredients:
3/4lb linguine
1TBS olive oil
3 cloves of garilc, minced
1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips
1/2lb thin asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2" pieces
1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
1 cup sliced button mushrooms
1TBS all-purpose flour
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup low-fat milk
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 large carrot, peeled and ribboned
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/2 cup shredded basil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to boil.  Add the pasta, and cook until al dente, according to package directions.  Before draining, reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and stir for about 1 minute.  Add the bell peppers, and cook stirring, until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes.
Drop in the asparagus, tomatoes, and mushrooms, and cook until tender.  Stir in flour, cook for 1 minute more.
Add the chicken broth, milk, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil; reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook until the liquid has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the carrot strips.
Toss the pasta with the vegetables and sauce, add the pasta water, if necessary, to loosen the mixture.  Serve garnished with the parmesan and basil.
