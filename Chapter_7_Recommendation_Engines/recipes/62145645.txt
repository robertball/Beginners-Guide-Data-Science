Ingredients:
2 lbs boneless country pork ribs with some attached fat
1 15-oz can Sauerkraut
2 Tablespoons Cider Vinegar
1 1/2 Tablespoons Sugar
1 teaspoon Caraway Seeds (optional)
2 - 3 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
Salt and Pepper to taste
4 to 6 cups Water

Directions:
Put meat into a 3 or 4 quart Dutch Oven (I don't usually do this but, it is ok to brown the meat first if you wish). Place the potatoes on top of the meat.  Empty the can of sauerkraut over the potatoes. Sprinkle the Caraway seeds, salt, pepper and sugar over the top. Add the vinegar and the water, enough to partially cover the potatoes. Stir lightly to mix spices into the sauerkraut.
Bring to a slow boil. Lower heat to simmer and cover the pot. Allow to simmer, covered for about 2 hours or until the meat is just falling apart.
To serve, put meat and potatoes on the plate. Lightly mash potatoes with a fork, spoon over all some of the pan liquid with sauerkraut. Place a chunk of butter on the potatoes and enjoy. Great to add a salad and rolls.

Description: 
This is a very easy one pan dinner with simple rich flavors. This is definitely, intentionally comfort food.  So don't try using lean pork cuts or you will have dry meat. I like to use country pork ribs cause they have generous fat, which flavors this wonderfully, at least to my taste. The cooked fat separates easily from the meat on the plate when it is eaten.
