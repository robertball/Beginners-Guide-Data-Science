Ingredients:
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 (4 pound) beef chuck pot roast
3 tablespoons Crisco® Baking Sticks All-Vegetable Shortening
2 cups water
1 bay leaf, crushed
8 small onions
8 small potatoes
8 small carrots
2 medium turnips, quartered
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
1/2 cup cold water
1/4 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Combine 1/3 cup flour, salt, and pepper; coat meat evenly.
Melt Crisco in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Brown meat well on all sides. Add 2 cups water and bay leaf. Cover and simmer for 2 hours; do not boil. If needed, add water during cooking.
Peel onions and pare potatoes, carrots, and turnips.
When meat has simmered for 2 hours, add vegetables to Dutch oven. Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until meat and vegetables are tender.
Remove meat and vegetables and arrange on a heated platter; keep warm. Strain liquid and add water, if necessary, to make 1-1/2 cups liquid. Return to Dutch oven.
Blend 1/2 cup cold water and 1/4 cup flour until smooth. Slowly stir into pot roast liquid. Cook and stir until gravy thickens and comes to boiling. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Serve with meat.
