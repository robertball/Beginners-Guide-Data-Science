Ingredients:
6 thin slices salt pork or 3 slices bacon
1 small onion, minced
2 cups water
5 cups diced raw potatoes
5 cups milk

Directions:
Cook pork and onion in a soup pot for a few minutes; add 2 cups water and cook about 20 minute or a half hour.
Add potatoes and cook until tender. Stir frequently. Add a small amount of water to keep from scorching.  When potatoes are done add milk.  Heat to boiling but do not let it boil (it may curdle if boiled)
If you wish, cut salt pork into 1/4" strips and serve. George can't have the pork so I don't serve it.

Description: 
My friend Elaine's mom made this good old-fashioned soup for us for lunch - I liked it so much she sent me home with her handwritten recipe (and a block of salt pork!)  Very simple, but special soup.
