Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup oat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon chia seeds
1/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons coconut oil
1/3 cup soy milk
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons lemon zest
Glaze
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon lemon zest

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine whole wheat flour, oat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, chia seeds, and white sugar in a bowl. Mix in coconut oil in until the mixture is crumbly. Stir in soy milk, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons lemon zest until a dough forms.
Transfer dough to a bowl and knead in bowl until workable, about 8 times. Gently roll into a ball and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Press into a circle about 1 inch thick; cut into 10 wedges. Place scones onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until edges are lightly golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
Mix confectioners' sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon lemon zest in a small bowl. Drizzle or spread frosting on top of scones while still warm.

Description: 
These scones are lower in fat than standard recipes, vegan, and super full of lemony flavor! The chia seeds give it a texture similar to poppy seeds and add lots of omega 3s. The added perk is that it's a foolproof recipe. I've made this without even measuring everything exactly and they still came out great. Try adding blueberries or doubling the amount of lemon zest!
