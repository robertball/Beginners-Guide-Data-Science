Description: 
This is a recipe I had quite a lot of fun preparing. It is quick and easy to make, and a perfect accompaniment to any lunch or dinner. I made this recipe with mostly organic ingredients, but it is equally delicious without as well! It was a huge hit at the family dinner, I'm making it again for the upcoming fall holiday!
