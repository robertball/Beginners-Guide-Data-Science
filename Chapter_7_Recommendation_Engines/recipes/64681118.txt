Description: 
Whenever I cook spicy recipes meant to be over rice that are primarily just meat (chicken, pork, or beef) then I like to stir-fry some vegetables to go as a side dish. I try to use what's basically local with a few added Asian components. This is not only a side dish but goes well by itself on white rice.
