Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups plain cashew nuts (not roasted or salted)
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons dry white wine (substitute water if preferred)
2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast (optional)
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
freshly ground pepper

Directions:
Place the raw nuts in a bowl, cover with fresh water, and let stand for 2 hours.
Drain the nuts and place them in the bowl of a food processor or blender. Add 60 ml (1/4 cup) water and the rest of the ingredients, and mix until thoroughly pur√©ed, stopping to scrape the sides of the bowl every once in a while. Add a little more water if necessary and blend again to adjust the consistency; the cheese will get a little more solid as it sets.
Transfer to a bowl, cover, and let stand somewhere cool for 24 hours before placing in the fridge, where it will keep for another 5 days.
