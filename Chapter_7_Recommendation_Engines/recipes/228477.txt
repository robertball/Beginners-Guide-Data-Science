Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups bran flakes, crushed
1 cup skim milk
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 egg
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup diced apple
1/2 cup diced banana
1/3 cup raisins

Directions:
Spray rice cooker bowl with cooking spray.
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Combine bran flakes, milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract together in a separate large bowl; allow bran flakes to slightly absorb the milk, about 5 minutes. Add egg and oil to bran mixture; stir to combine. Stir flour into bran mixture until just combined.
Gently fold apple, banana, and raisins into batter. Pour into sprayed rice cooker.
Cook in the rice cooker for 3 cycles or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Originally I made these as muffins in the oven but I found that making them in the rice cooker they are moister and my kitchen doesn't get so hot.
