1 Tablespoon Nutritional Yeast
1 1/2 Tablespoons Soy Sauce
1/2 cup coarsely ground hazelnuts
1/4 Teaspoon Salt
1/8 Teaspoon Red Pepper Flakes (or more if desired)
1/8 Teaspoon Black Pepper
1 Teaspoons Ground Sage
1/4 Teaspoon Crushed Rosemary

Directions:
In a food processor, first pulse nuts. Set aside. Then oats and then add the brown rice and pulse about 5 times. Add the rest of ingredients (except nuts) into a bowl - spices into soy sauce, syrup. Sprinkle nuts over dough. Use hands or mixer to mix the ingredients together pouring the liquid all over the dough to help distribute it evenly.
Flour hands with corn meal and then pour out mixture onto a corn meal floured board. Flatten out mixture to about 1/2 inch and cut out patties with a biscuit cutter. Heat skillet and turn heat down to medium to low.
Coat skillet with oil (opt) and place patties. Cover and cook until lightly brown on both sides. Cook each side about 3 minutes. If necessary add 1/2 tablespoon of water to skillet to prevent sticking and burning.Let stand about 10 minutes.
Alternatively you can cook them in the oven on 400 degrees on a cookie sheet, covered in foil. Cook for 5 minutes, turn and cook 5 more minutes.
