Ingredients:
6 eggs
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
2 tablespoons onion powder
1 (12 ounce) can tuna, drained
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup sour cream
1/4 cup butter, melted
4 slices soft bread, torn into small pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover pan, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in the hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from water; peel and chop.
Combine the chopped eggs, spinach, onion powder, tuna, cream of mushroom soup, and sour cream in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Mix well. Scatter bread pieces over tuna mix; drizzle with melted butter.
Bake in preheated oven until bread is toasted and casserole is hot, about 30 to 35 minutes.

Description: 
My mom used to make this as I was growing up. I recently found it and have put it into our weekly rotation. You can also substitute a can of chicken. I put it serves 4 because our family always goes back for seconds.
