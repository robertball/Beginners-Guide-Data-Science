Ingredients:
1 can of yellow curry paste (Maesri brand)
2 cans (or 4 cups) coconut milk
1 cup cooked chicken
2 cups largely diced cooked potatoes
2 cups sliced carrots
1/2 cup sliced onions
2 Tbsp. fish sauce
2 Tbsp. sugar
1 tsp. salt

Directions:
In medium sauce pan, add two cans of coconut milk and 1 can of yellow curry paste. Cook in medium heat until curry starts to smell fragrant, is bubbling and the red has dissolved and it becomes a lighter yellow (about 20 minutes). Don't stir, let simmer.
Then add potato, carrot, onion, fish sauce, sugar and salt. For milder curry, add more coconut milk (use half a can of milk for spicier curry). Simmer for 10 minutes and serve with steamed rice.
Soak sticky rice for two hours (sweet gluten rice from Thailand). Best to use Geoff's pot and basket.
