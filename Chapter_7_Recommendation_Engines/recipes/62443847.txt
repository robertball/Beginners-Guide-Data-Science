Ingredients:
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
1 can cream-style corn

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425F
In a bowl, combine flours, baking powder and salt. Add egg and cream-style corn and mix until smooth.
Line an 8-inch square pan with non-stick foil and pour in mixture. The foil makes it easy to remove from the pan. Bake until browned and the center is done, about 20 minutes. You can check for doneness by sticking a toothpick into the middle of the bread. If it comes out dry, the bread is done.
