Ingredients:
6 pork chops
1 tablespoon dried marjoram
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
3/4 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 onion, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a small amount of oil in a large skillet, add chops and brown on both sides. When chops are almost done,  sprinkle marjoram on both sides.
Stir together half the can of soup, water, salt and pepper.  Pour into a foil-lined 9x13 inch baking pan.
Put the onions and then the browned chops on top of the soup mixture.  Spoon the remaining soup over the top of chops so they are covered. Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes.  Take off foil and bake another 20 minutes.  Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
