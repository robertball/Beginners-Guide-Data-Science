Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon butter/margarine
1 Clove of garlic
2 Slices of bread
1 Slice of cheese
*Personally I enjoy sourdough or a good italian bread and sharp cheddar cheese...the possibilities are endless!*

Directions:
1) Put butter and garlic in a frying pan over medium heat and brown garlic.  If garlic is minced, leave it in the pan, if you use a whole clove pull it out before step 2.
2) Put 1 side of each slice of bread in the butter to coat.
3) Leave 1 slice of bread, butter side down in the pan and top with cheese, then another slice of bread with butter on the outside.
4) Cook on medium/low heat until golden brown with melted cheese on the inside.
