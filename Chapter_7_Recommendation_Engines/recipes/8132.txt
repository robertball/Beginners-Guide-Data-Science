Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons buttermilk
1 cup chopped apples
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Butter a 9x5x3-inch pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cream butter, add sugar slowly, and continue to beat until light and lemon-colored. Beat in eggs.
Sift flour with salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Add to the butter mixture alternately with the   buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Stir in the apples, nuts, and vanilla. Spoon batter into prepared pan.
Bake in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 50-60 minutes, until the loaf pulls away   slightly from the sides of the pan or until a cake tester comes out clean. Cool in the pan for about 5 minutes, then loosen from pan and turn onto a rack to cool completely before slicing.

Description: 
Almost a pound cake. We like it sliced, spread with butter, then microwaved just until warm.
