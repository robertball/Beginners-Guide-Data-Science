Description: 
This is a healthier (and tastier!) version of the classic oatmeal lactation cookie.  Tastes so good I even make them when I am not nursing. Try variations such as peanut butter chips, raisins, nuts etc. Vary the amount of Fenugreek & Brewer's Yeast to taste. For those on Weight Watchers, 2 cookies = 3 points.
