Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) halibut steaks
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon lime-flavored salt-free seasoning blend (such as Mrs Dash® Fiesta Lime Seasoning), or to taste
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/8 teaspoon lime-flavored salt-free seasoning blend (such as Mrs Dash® Fiesta Lime Seasoning)
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Season halibut steaks with salt, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon lime-flavored seasoning blend.
Arrange the halibut steaks on a baking dish.
Place panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, 1/8 teaspoon lime-flavored seasoning blend, thyme, and garlic in a blender.
Blend with enough olive oil to just moisten the panko crumbs.
Spoon panko crumb mixture over the halibut.
Bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes.
