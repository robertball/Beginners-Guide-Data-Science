Ingredients:
1/2 cup (1 3/4 oz) old-fashioned rolled oats
2 1/2 cup (10 5/8 oz) All-Purpose Flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup (5 5/8 oz) packed brown sugar
3/4 cup (5 1/4 oz) granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 large eggs
3 cups (18 oz) semisweet chocolate chips
1 1/2 cups (6 oz chopped walnuts (or pecans)

Directions:
Grind the oats in a food processor or blender until finely ground or to desired texture. Combine the oats with the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a medium bowl; set aside.
Cream the butter, sugars, vanilla and lemon juice together with an electric mixer. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix until smooth and creamy.
Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix well. Stir in the chocolate chips and walnuts. Chill the dough, covered for at least two hours and preferably overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and prepare 2 or more baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop the chilled dough by the tablespoon, placing them on the baking sheets 2 inches apart.
Bake for approx. 14 minutes (room temperature dough will bake in 10-12 minutes). Remove the cookies from the oven when the edges are light brown and the cookies are still soft in the middle; the gold color will seep across the face of the cookie within a minute after removal from the hot oven. Transfer the cookies to a rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I will confess that if I am able, I stay at the Doubletree Hotel just so I can get free cookies from the front desk!  I was SO excited to see this clone recipe in the Summer 2010 Baking Sheet, from King Arthur Flour.  I tried the recipe and it is dead-on.  My family declared it perfect!
