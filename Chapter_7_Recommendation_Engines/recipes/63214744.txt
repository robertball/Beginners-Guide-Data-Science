Ingredients:
1 lb ground, mild pork
1 lb lean ground beef(I use 93/7)
1 lb ground veal
1/2 cup beef stock
1 large egg
(2) 1 inch thick slices of crusty Italian bread cut into cubes
1 cup of heavy cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons chopped, curly parsley
1 tablespoon chopped oregano
1 tablespoon chopped thyme
1 tablespoon chopped basil
1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
8 large garlic cloves, slivered
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons Cabernet Sauvignon

Directions:
Soak crusty bread in heavy cream and set aside. Combine pork, ground beef, veal, parsley, oregano, thyme, basil, onion, garlic, Parmesan cheese, kosher salt, pepper, and egg in a large bowl. Mix thoroughly with your hands. Slow add beef broth and soaked bread. Depending on how dry your bread was, there may be some cream left over. DO NOT pour this into your mixture. Thoroughly combine the mixture, set aside. Coat a 9"x13" pan with olive oil and Cabernet. Form meatballs and place in pan. Bake in a 375 degree preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove and let stand for 5 minutes, allowing juices of the meats to distribute evenly. Serve with my marinara sauce! :-)
