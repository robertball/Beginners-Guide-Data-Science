Ingredients:
10 pieces chicken wings (wingettes)
200 g Japanese pumpkin (kabocha)
1 piece eggplant
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chicken stock

Directions:
Wash the chicken pieces well then dry it with paper towels. For this recipe, I’ve used chicken wingettes which can be cooked evenly in a microwave because of its flat shape.
In a small bowl, combine the curry powder and salt. Toss it to the chicken pieces then coat evenly then marinate for about 20 minutes.
Slice the eggplant in half along its length then slice it into several pieces diagonally. Soak in water to prevent it from browning.
Use a knife to remove the seeds of the kabocha. Cut in half along its width then slice into several pieces with about half a centimeter thick.
Put the chicken in a microwave-safe bowl then evenly distribute the vegetables on top. Then, pour over the chicken stock.
Cover the bowl or wrap it with a microwave-safe cling wrap. Cook in the microwave for about 7 minutes using 600W.
Remove the bowl from the microwave then serve the steamed chicken curry with rice.
