Ingredients:
1 pound breakfast sausage
1/8 cup minced onion
salt and pepper and red pepper flakes, if desired
bacon bits, if desired
3-7.5 oz can refrigerated biscuit dough
8 eggs, beaten
1/2c milk
shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat, combine sausage and onion. Cook until sausage is evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.
Separate the dough into individual biscuits. Flatten each biscuit out, then line the bottom and sides of muffin cups. Evenly distribute sausage mixture between the cups. Top with bacon bits. Mix together the eggs and milk, and divide between the cups (using turkey baster). Sprinkle tops with shredded cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until filling is set. Place baking sheet under muffin tin in case of spillover.
