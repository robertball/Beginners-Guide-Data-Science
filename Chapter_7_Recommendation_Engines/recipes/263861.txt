Ingredients:
2 eggs
water
1 (10 ounce) package refrigerated fresh ramen noodles (such as Sun Noodle)
1 (.75 ounce) packet dashi granules (such as Hondashi® Soup Stock)
4 slices fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAM®), cut into bite-sized pieces
1 green onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a pot; add eggs and boil until yolks are barely set, about 6 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.
Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in the same pot. Add noodles and dashi. Cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, about 3 minutes.
Divide soup and noodles between 2 bowls; add eggs, luncheon meat, and green onion.
