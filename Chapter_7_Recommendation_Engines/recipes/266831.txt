Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package dried soba noodles
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
5 (3-cup) storage containers
1 cup shelled edamame
1 large carrot, shredded
4 green onions, thinly sliced
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
1 1/4 cups Thai peanut sauce
5 (2-ounce) dressing containers

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Drop in soba noodles and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 7 minutes. Drain.
Toss noodles with sesame oil in a medium bowl. Divide noodles evenly between the 5 containers.
Top noodles with edamame, carrot, green onions, and cilantro, dividing them evenly between the 5 containers. Place lids on containers. Pour 1/4 cup peanut sauce into each dressing container. Refrigerate until ready to eat. Mix 1 dressing container with 1 serving of soba salad to serve.

Description: 
This cold salad is easy to make and great for prepping healthier options for the week's lunches or snacks. I like to add some heat by mixing sriracha or chili garlic paste into the Thai peanut sauce.
