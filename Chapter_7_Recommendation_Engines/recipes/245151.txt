Ingredients:
½ cup unsweetened coconut
¼ cup sunflower seeds
¼ cup sesame seeds
¼ cup flax seeds
¼ cup sliced almonds
¼ cup hemp seed hearts
¼ cup protein powder
¼ cup honey
¼ cup almond butter
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Stir coconut, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flax seeds, almonds, hemp seed hearts, and protein powder together in a bowl; add honey, almond butter, and olive oil, stir until well combined.
Shape mixture into balls about 1 1/2-inches in diameter. Coating your hands with a little olive oil will help prevent the mixture from sticking. Cover and refrigerate until serving.

Description: 
I'm always looking for ways to increase my raw food intake. These are a super satisfying snack without the extra calories that granola bars pack. They keep well in the fridge. I use raw, organic ingredients wherever possible.
