Description: 
A fantastic chili that builds up in heat as you eat. Perfect for football. I won a chili cook off with this recipe. I make it in this size batch so I can freeze the leftovers. A friend gave me this recipe over 10 years ago and I have tweaked it over time. Serve with shredded cheese and/or oyster crackers. It is also good over pasta.
