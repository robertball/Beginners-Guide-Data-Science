Ingredients:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced
1/2 cup uncooked pasta
1 can condensed cream of celery soup
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup frozen or fresh vegetables
1 tsp. Mrs. Dash
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup shredded cheese (any kind will do)
1/4 cup cheese flavored crackers, crushed

Directions:
Put a large pot of salted water on to boil.
Once it boils, add the pasta to the water and cook until barely al dente.  Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, in a large (12-inch) skillet sprayed with non-stick spray, cook the diced chicken over medium heat until almost done (if using meat that is already cooked, just warm it back up).
Add the vegetables to the skillet and continue to cook until the vegetables are warmed through.
Reduce skillet heat to low and add soup, sour cream, Mrs. Dash and salt & pepper.  Mix to combine and cook 1 minute to warm through.
Turn off the heat, add most of the cheese, and stir to combine.
Add the noodles and mix.
Place the mixture into a greased 2-quart casserole dish.
Top with remaining cheese followed by the crushed cheese crackers.
Bake at 375Â° for 20 minutes until heat through and top is lightly browned.

Description: 
A creamy casserole invented one night when I realized I had accidentally bought a can of cream of celery soup.  You can substitute almost any meat and vegetables for what you happen to have at the fridge.  Can be made the night before!
