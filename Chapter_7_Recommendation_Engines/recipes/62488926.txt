Ingredients:
1 whole chicken (4 lbs)
6 strips thick cut bacon
3 tbls unsalted butter (softened but NOT melted)
3 cloves garlic (crushed)
1 clove garlic (minced)
RUB
2 tbls dried thyme
2 tbls dried oregano
1 tbls paprika
1 ½ tbls cumin
2 tbls brown sugar
1 ½ tbls salt
2 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 425°F mix rub ingredients together, divide them in half, put minced garlic and butter in one half and mix until incorporated.
Pat chicken dry with paper towel and place in a roasting pan on a rack. Rub the garlic/butter portion of the rub under the skin of the chicken and the other half of the rub on top of skin and inside the cavity along with 3 cloves crushed garlic.
Place the 6 strips of bacon on top of the chicken in a criss cross pattern and put in the oven. Bake for 15 minutes at 425°F then lower oven temperature to 400°F and bake another 15 minutes. Then lower temperature to 375°F and bake 30 minutes longer or until internal temperature reaches 165°F. Cover chicken with tin foil at any point when skin/bacon reaches your desired colour.
Let chicken rest for 10-15 minutes. Carve, serve and enjoy!
