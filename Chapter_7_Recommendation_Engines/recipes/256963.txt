Ingredients:
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 drops white wine vinegar
cooking spray
4 egg whites
2 eggs
1/4 cup shredded Gouda cheese
1 slice thick-cut prosciutto, cubed

Directions:
Cook and stir onion, brown sugar, and vinegar in a skillet over medium heat until onion is golden, about 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 6-muffin tin with cooking spray.
Whisk egg whites and eggs in a large measuring cup.
Fill each muffin cup halfway with egg mixture. Scatter onion, Gouda cheese, and prosciutto cubes on top. Cover with remaining egg mixture, leaving 1/4-inch space at the top for eggs to rise.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Use a standard muffin pan to make easy egg cups, like a quiche. These are easy to make and you can change the ingredients to whatever you like. Make them ahead and freeze or refrigerate and reheat in the microwave. This can easily be doubled.
