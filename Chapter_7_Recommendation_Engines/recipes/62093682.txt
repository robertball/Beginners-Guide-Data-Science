Ingredients:
2 Medium apples
2 Medium oranges
2 Large bananas
1 6 oz carton of non-fat, no-sugar added Cherry yogurt
1/2 cup fat-free whipped topping
1/2 cup walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Core and dice apples (do not peel) into bite sized pieces.
Peel bananas and oranges and slice into bite sized pieces.
In a large bowl, fold together yogurt and whipped topping. (If you prefer a fluffier sauce, add whipped topping to desired consistency.)
Fold prepared fruit and walnuts (if using) into yogurt mixture. Chill for at least one hour before serving, if possible.
Notes: One can of drained mandarin oranges may be used in place of oranges. Crisp variety apples work best, such as Honeycrisp or Braeburn. Experiment with your favorite yogurt flavors!
