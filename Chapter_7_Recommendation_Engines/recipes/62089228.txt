Ingredients:
1 salmon fillet
5-6 small red potatoes
1 garlic clove
1/2 fresh lemon
1 tbs all purpose seasoning
1 tsp ground black pepper
5 tbs olive oil

Directions:
Rinse fish and potatoes.
Cut potatoes in small bit size cubes.
In a large bowl, put olive oil and minced garlic.
Place aluminum foil in the bottom of a roasting pan, then place a metal rack in the pan.
Spray rack with Pam or brush with oil to prevent sticking.
Place the fish in the center of the rack.
Spread potatoes all around the fish.
Squeeze the fresh lemon on the fish and potatoes.
Sprinkle the pepper and seasonings on the fish and potatoes.
Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.
Don't cut the potatoes too big or they will not cook all the way through.
When you are finished, you should be able to lift the aluminum foil out of the roasting pan and have a very small clean up.
Enjoy!
