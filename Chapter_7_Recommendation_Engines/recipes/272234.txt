Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups water
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked orzo pasta
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 bunch green onions, chopped
3/4 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup dried cranberries
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pinch cayenne pepper
3/4 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Bring water, orzo, and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until orzo is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Rinse orzo under cold water and scrape into a large bowl. Let cool for 20 minutes.
Stir in green onions, celery, cranberries, lemon juice, sesame oil, vinegar, olive oil, and cayenne pepper. Let stand at room temperature until flavors blend, about 1 hour. Stir in pecans and cilantro before serving.
