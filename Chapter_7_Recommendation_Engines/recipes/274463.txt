Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup blanched almond flour
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 cup butter, cubed
1 egg
Filling:
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
Streusel Topping:
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking pan.
Mix flour, almond flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Add butter and mix until combined. Stir in egg until a dough forms. Press 1/2 the dough into the bottom and up the edges of the prepared pan, reserving remaining dough for streusel.
Beat pumpkin and cream cheese using an electric mixer in a separate bowl until well combined. Add eggs and vanilla extract; mix until combined. Pour mixture over crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until set and golden, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine reserved dough with flour and cinnamon in a bowl and mix until crumbly. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove bars from the oven and sprinkle topping over pumpkin filling.
Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the pan comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool at least 15 minutes before transferring to a refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours. Cut into bars and serve.
