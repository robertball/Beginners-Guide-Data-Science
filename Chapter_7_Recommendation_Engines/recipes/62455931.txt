Ingredients:
1 can Grands biscuits
(sure you can make your own dough if you want, but why?)
Confectioner's sugar
Vegetable oil (this depends on the pot you're cooking in, we use a fry-daddy.  Make sure there's enough to submerse your beignets)

Directions:
Heat oil to 300 deg.
Open biscuits, seperate, cut each in half, drop carefully into oil.
Remove from oil when they begin to pop up, or when they turn gold. (SOmetimes they pop up really fast, so for your first try just do one, let it cool on a paper towel then taste to be sure it's cooked all the way through. If not, go up about 50 deg at a time with the oil.)
Allow about 2-3 minutes to dry on papertowel,
Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar to taste (NOLA style has almost half inch thick layer)
Enjoy!
