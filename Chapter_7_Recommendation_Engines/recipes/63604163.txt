Ingredients:
5 lb of pastured pork leg roasts (I used two 2.5 lb roasts)
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 organic yellow onion, roughly chopped
3 garlic cloves, peeled
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons raw apple cider vinegar
3 tablespoons raw organic honey
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
2 teaspoons granulated onion
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon Kosher salt
1 cup of water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 F with the rack in the lower middle.
Dry the roasts with paper towels and iberally season with salt and pepper.
Heat the coconut oil in a large Dutch oven over medium high heat.
Sear the roasts and brown on all sides.
While the pork is browning, add the onion, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, apple cider vinegar, honey, oregano, chili powder, rosemary, granulated onion, cumin, salt, and some freshly ground black pepper into a food processor. Pulse until blended.
When the pork has finished browning, tuck both of them back into the Dutch oven and remove the pot from the heat. Cover the top of the roast with the sauce. Put the lid on and pop it in the oven for 2.5-3 hours or until the pork is fork tender.

Description: 
This recipe results with moist, tender meat. The easy-peasy sauce is a perfect blend of tangy, sweet, and savory. It would be great on any meat.
