Ingredients:
1 pound ripe cherry tomatoes, halved lengthwise
1/3 cup dry breadcrumbs
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/4 cup grated mozzerella cheese
3 cloves garlic, minced
Salt and pepper, to taste
3/4 tsp red pepper flakes
1 pound penne pasta
1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp dried basil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 9x13 baking dish and arrange tomatoes cut side up in a single layer.
In a small bowl, combine breadcrumbs, cheeses, garlic, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Mix well. Sprinkle evenly over the tomatoes, making sure each tomato half is well covered. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until tomatoes soften and are cooked through, and the topping begins to brown.
When tomatoes have been cooking for about 6 minutes, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente or to your preference. Pasta should be done when tomatoes are ready to come out of the oven.
When tomatoes are done, mash lightly with a fork, add basil, and stir vigorously to make into a sauce. Drain the pasta and transfer to the baking dish. Add olive oil and mix well.
