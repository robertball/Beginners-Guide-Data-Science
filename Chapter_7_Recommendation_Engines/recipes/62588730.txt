Salt and pepper to taste
2 Teaspoons of garlic power
2 Teaspoons of onion powder
A sprinkle of crushed red pepper
Teaspoon of Vinegar

Directions:
This is as simple as pouring a glass of water and it is very tasty. Melt the butter then pour all ingrediants in the pan. I put mine on medium to get it going then once it boils I put it on simmer for about 20 minutes to let all the flavors blend.
