Ingredients:
2 cups cauliflower florets
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups cooked couscous
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
butter to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 inch baking dish.
Place the cauliflower into a microwaveable dish, and microwave on High 3 to 4 minutes, until tender. Place the cooked cauliflower into the baking dish, sprinkle with Cheddar cheese and couscous, and dust the top with nutmeg.
Bake in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the top of the casserole is golden brown, and the cheese is melted. Stir in butter to taste.

I love this recipe because it's easy to whip up in a hurry and makes good use out of our leftover couscous and shredded cheese.
