Ingredients:
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup sweet potatoes, cooked, cooled and mashed
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
8 T aqua faba or sub for 2 eggs
1/4 cup prune puree or applesauce
1/4 cup milk, at room temperature
2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan.
In a medium-sized bowl, beat butter and brown sugar until creamy. Add sweet potatoes, maple syrup, eggs, milk, and vanilla; mix well.
Sift together flour, baking powder, soda and spices. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; add the sweet potato mixture and pecans; stir just to combine.
Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean.
Remove the pan to a wire rack. Cool for 10 minutes before removing the bread from the pan; finish cooling on the rack.
Store the completely cooled bread in an airtight container at room temperature.
