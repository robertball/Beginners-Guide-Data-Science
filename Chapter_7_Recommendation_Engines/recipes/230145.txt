Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) box vanilla wafer cookies (such as Nilla速)
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup light corn syrup
3/4 cup dark rum (such as Meyer's速)
1 cup confectioners' sugar, plus more for dusting

Directions:
Place vanilla cookies in a food processor and process into fine crumbs.
Heat chocolate chips and corn syrup together in a saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring often, until chocolate is melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in rum and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Fold in cookie crumbs; dough will be sticky.
Place saucepan in the refrigerator until dough is firm and easy to roll, about 15 minutes. Cover 2 plates with waxed paper; dust with confectioners' sugar.
Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place on the prepared plates. Dust rum balls with confectioners' sugar. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.
Remove rum balls from refrigerator and transfer to a resealable bag, including the extra confectioners' sugar. Seal the bag and shake to coat the rum balls completely with confectioners' sugar.

Description: 
I wanted a good rum ball with a lot of kick, so I sat down and came up with this recipe. I didn't realize how good these were until one year I didn't make them for work. I just about got lynched! Needless to say, I've made them every year since (about 20 years). These are best if you use Meyers Original Dark Rum速 chilled, and Nabisco速 'Nilla wafer cookies. They are at their peak if you make them 2 days in advance. Remove from fridge 30 minutes before serving.
