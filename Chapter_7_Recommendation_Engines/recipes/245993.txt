NA
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
4 ounces buckwheat soba noodles
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1  boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into thin bite-size strips
1 teaspoon chopped garlic
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 rib celery, sliced (optional)
1  carrot, sliced
½  red bell pepper, chopped
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Whisk rice vinegar, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, sesame oil, brown sugar, soy sauce, and ginger together in a large bowl until dressing is combined.
Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Add soba noodles, stir, and return water to a boil. Boil noodles until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander under cold running water until cool, about 1 minute.
Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken breast pieces until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 2 to 4 minutes. Add garlic, salt, and pepper; stir until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
Toss soba noodles, chicken, celery, carrot, red pepper, cilantro, green onion, and sesame seeds together with dressing in large bowl.
