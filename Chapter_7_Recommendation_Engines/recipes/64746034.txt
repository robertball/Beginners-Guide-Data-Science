Ingredients:
250 g white unsalted almonds
250 g fine sugar
zest of 1 lemon
little bit of water (around 50 g/50 ml, 3 to 4 tbsp)

Directions:
Put the almonds and sugar in a grinding device or a mill (for instance an old coffee grinder) and grind the almonds to a very fine powder consistency.
Add the lemon zest and some water and first stir with a spoon, then get your hands in, until you have a smooth but very firm paste, not too wet and not too dry.
