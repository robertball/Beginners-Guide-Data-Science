Ingredients:
1 large pattypan squash, halved and seeded
1 cup water
1/2 (1 pound) chorizo sausage
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1 large tomato, chopped
1 cup chicken stock
1 cup black beans
1/2 cup corn
1 ounce shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place squash, cut-side down, in a baking dish; add water.
Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender, about 30 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is softened and browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Add green bell pepper and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add tomato, chicken stock, black beans, and corn; cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir chorizo into mixture.
Flip squash over and fill each half with chorizo mixture; top with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Spicy chorizo is a perfect offset to the mellow meat of summer squash. Leftover bean and chorizo mixture is great for breakfast burritos.
