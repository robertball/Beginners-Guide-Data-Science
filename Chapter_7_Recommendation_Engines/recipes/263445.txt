Ingredients:
Batter:
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
5 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon cornmeal
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
Coating:
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon parsley flakes
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
5 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2-inch strips
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed
cooking spray

Directions:
Place water, flour, cornstarch, cornmeal, garlic powder, and salt in a wide, shallow bowl; mix into a batter the consistency of pancake batter. Adjust ingredients if needed to get the right consistency.
Stir panko, salt, pepper, parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and basil together in another wide, shallow bowl.
Lightly coat each mozzarella stick with flour. Dip each stick in the batter and toss in the panko mixture until fully coated. Place sticks in a single layer on a baking sheet. Freeze for at least 1 hour.
Heat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Place a row of mozzarella sticks in the fryer basket. Spray with a light coat of cooking spray. Cook sticks for 6 minutes. Open fryer and flip the sticks with tongs. Continue cooking until golden brown, 7 to 9 minutes.

Description: 
These ooey, gooey mozzarella sticks are sure to impress. The best part: because they are air fried, they're better for you than their fried cousin! Season with garlic salt and serve with marinara sauce for dipping.
