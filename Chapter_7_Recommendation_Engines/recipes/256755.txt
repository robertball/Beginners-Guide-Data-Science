Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cocoa powder
1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 1/4 cups light brown sugar
1 1/3 cups butter, at room temperature
3 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®), at room temperature
1 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch cake pan with 3-inch sides.
Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon together in a bowl.
Combine brown sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one a time. Mix in vanilla extract. Beat in flour mixture in thirds, alternating with stout beer, until batter is smooth. Fold in pecans.
Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 70 to 75 minutes. Transfer cake pan to a wire rack; let cool for 20 minutes. Invert cake onto a serving platter and let cool completely.

Description: 
A little trip to Ireland all baked in a delicious chocolate cake with Guinness® flavor. You can serve it with powdered sugar or ganache poured on top. I use this recipe for my groom's cakes but I frost it with a chocolate buttercream then pour ganache evenly over the top. I use raspberries or strawberries to decorate the top for color. It turns out beautiful!
