Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup white sugar
2/3 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup rolled oats
2 eggs
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 (10 inch) pie crust, baked and cooled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, pecans and oatmeal. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, mix eggs, melted butter and vanilla. Add to the dry mixture and mix well.
Fold in chocolate chips. Spoon into a pre baked 10 inch pie shell.
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)  for 25 minutes. It will still appear quite moist, but it will set up after it is removed from the oven.
