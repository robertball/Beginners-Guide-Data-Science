Ingredients:
1 lb linguine, cook as directed, reserve 1/2 cup pasta water
olive oil, about 2 tbsp
1 lb Bacon, sliced crosswise into bite-sized pieces
1/2 tsp dried rosemary, crushed
1.5 lbs crimini mushrooms, sliced
1.5 lbs fresh brussels sprouts, chopped
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, shredded
salt
pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil using high heat. Once it boils, add pasta and stir occasionally until al dente. You will need to reserve a 1/2 cup of pasta water to use later. Drain pasta and toss with enough olive oil to coat.
While your water is heating, place a large saute pan over medium high heat. Add the bacon to the pan. Stir occasionally and cook until the bacon begins to get crispy. Drain off half the bacon fat. Add rosemary to bacon and remaining grease.
Toss mushrooms and bacon together in saute pan. Add a pinch of salt and pepper. Add chopped Brussels sprouts. Cook for 1-2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of pasta water to saute pan. Add drained linguine to bacon mixture. Toss everything together adding Parmesan cheese as you toss. Season with salt and pepper if needed.
