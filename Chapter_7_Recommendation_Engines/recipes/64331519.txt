Ingredients:
1 cup dates, chopped and pitted (if you can't get really fresh ones, soak them for a couple of hours before hand)
1.5 cups almond milk
½ tsp baking soda
¼ cup applesauce
½ cup brown or coconut sugar
½ tsp ground cinnamon
¼ tsp salt
1¼ cups white or whole wheat flour
1/2 cup maple syrup
For the sauce:
1/2-3/4 cup dates
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup coconut cream
1/2 cup almond milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a medium pot, bring the almond milk to a gentle boil. Add in the dates and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring regularly. Take the pot off heat and stir in the baking soda. Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, stir together the date and almond milk mixture with the remaining ingredients. Pour into a cake pan and bake for 25-30 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven and poke holes in the top with a fork. Spread the date sauce over the top and allow to sit for 30mins - 2 hours.
For Sauce: Mix all ingredients in a high-power blender until smooth. Pour some over the top of the cake, and use the rest when serving. Best served warm with vegan vanilla ice cream of your choosing.
