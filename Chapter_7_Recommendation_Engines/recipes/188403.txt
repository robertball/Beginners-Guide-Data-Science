3 pounds red potatoes, cut into chunks
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Mash the potatoes with a potato masher; mash in butter and cream cheese. Stir in milk, bacon bits, Colby-Jack cheese, and steak seasoning. Season to taste with salt.

Description: 
Quick, delicious mashed potatoes. I was craving 'loaded mashed potatoes' like they serve at some of the chain restaurants but was tired, busy and in a hurry so in an effort to eliminate some steps I tried seasoning my mashed potatoes with Montreal steak seasoning (my favorite slow cooker seasoning!) and threw in some cream cheese and shredded cheese for a super easy treat that the whole family raved over. Next time I will double the recipe so I can have leftovers for my lunch bucket!
