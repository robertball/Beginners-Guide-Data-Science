Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) container low-fat vanilla-flavored yogurt
1/2 cup finely chopped, frozen tart cherries
1/4 cup 100% tart cherry juice
1 tablespoon honey
6 (2 ounce) frozen pop molds with handles

Directions:
Stir together yogurt, cherries, juice and honey in small bowl. For easier chopping, chop cherries while still frozen.
Spoon yogurt mixture into 2-ounce freezer pop molds and insert handles. (If using paper cups, spoon mixture into cups and cover each with foil. Cut a small hole in center of each foil top and insert a pop stick.)
Freeze about 6 hours or until firm.
