Ingredients:
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 carrots, coarsely grated
1/2 cup red lentils, rinsed and drained
3 1/2 cups water
1 cube vegetable bouillon, crumbled
1/4 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons toasted sunflower seeds

Directions:
Dry-fry crushed red pepper flakes in a large saucepan until they start to jump around the pan and release their aroma, about 1 minute. Add oil, carrots, and lentils; stir to combine. Add water and crumbled bouillon and bring to the boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until lentils have swollen and softened, about 15 minutes.
Blend soup to desired consistency (smooth or chunky) with an immersion blender or food processor. Stir in milk and cumin. Ladle soup into bowls and sprinkle with toasted sunflower seeds.
