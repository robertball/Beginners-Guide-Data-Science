Spicy Korean Chicken and Vegetable Stew (Dak Doritang) Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Korean refined rice wine
2 dashes ground black pepper, or to taste
2 dashes ground ginger, or to taste
4 ½ (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons light corn syrup
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 clove garlic, crushed
¼ teaspoon chili powder
1 dash sesame oil
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
4  potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
1  carrot, peeled and cut into large chunks
2 cups water
1  onion, cut into large chunks
12  sesame leaves, sliced

Directions:
Combine rice wine, black pepper, and ginger in a shallow dish. Toss in chicken to coat. Marinate for 15 minutes.
Mix gochujang, soy sauce, corn syrup, sugar, garlic, chili powder, and sesame oil together in a bowl for the sauce.
Heat vegetable oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add potatoes and carrots; cook and stir until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Pour in water. Add the chicken and onion; stir to combine. Add the sauce, stir, and bring stew to a boil. Boil until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Stir sesame leaves into the stew. Cook until wilted, about 1 minute more.
