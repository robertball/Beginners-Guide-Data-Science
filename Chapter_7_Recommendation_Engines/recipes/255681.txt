Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

2 tablespoons melted butter
3/4 cup barbecue sauce
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Combine ground beef, green onions, garlic powder and cayenne pepper; form into 4 patties. Sprinkle both sides with steak seasoning. Cover and chill.  (These can be made several hours ahead.)
Brush buns with melted butter, set aside.  Mix barbecue sauce with honey in a small bowl; set aside.
Preheat grill (medium-high heat). Grill burgers to an internal temperature of 160°F, about 4 to 6 minutes per side.  Two minutes before burgers are finished, grill buns, butter side down, until golden brown. Place Borden® American Cheese Singles on burgers to melt.
