1 large onion
2 cloves garlic or 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 lb lean (at least 80%) ground beef
2 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
1 Tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1/2  teaspoon cayenne ** 1/4 for kids
1 tablespoon vinegar from jalapeno jar
2 cans (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (14.5 oz) can tomato sauce
1 can chili hot beans beans, undrained
1/2 - 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed

Directions:
Peel and chop the onion to measure 1 cup. Peel and finely chop the garlic.
In a 3-quart saucepan, cook the beef, onion and garlic over medium heat 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until beef is thoroughly cooked. Place a strainer or colander in the sink; line with a double thickness of paper towels. Pour the beef mixture into the strainer to drain. Return beef mixture to saucepan; discard paper towels and any juices in the bowl.
Into the beef, stir the chili powder, oregano, cumin, salt, pepper sauce or cayenne.  Cook to combine.
Pour in tomato sauce,  tomatoes with their liquid, and beans.
Heat the mixture to boiling over high heat. Once mixture is boiling, reduce heat just enough so mixture bubbles gently. Cover with lid; cook 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  Cook uncovered about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until desired thickness.  Another can of beans can be added if desired.
