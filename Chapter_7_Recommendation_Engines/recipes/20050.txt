5 large baking potatoes
4 cups shredded Gouda cheese
3 chopped green onions

Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut baked potatoes in half. Scoop out potato, leaving a small layer on the skins. Cut halves into four strips. Place strips on a medium baking sheet.
Sprinkle 1 cup Gouda cheese thinly over potato strips. Top with pepperoni, followed by green onions and remaining Gouda cheese.
Bake topped potato strips in the 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven 30 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.
