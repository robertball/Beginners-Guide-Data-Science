Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon Morton Lite® salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour (sifted)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 large Granny Smith apple peeled, cored and diced
23 oz. jar Mott's® Natural Applesauce (no sugar added)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9x13 inch cake pan.
In a mixing bowl; beat oil and eggs with an electric mixer until creamy. Add the sugar and vanilla and beat well.
Combine the flour (sifted before measuring), salt, baking soda, and ground cinnamon and sift together into a bowl. Slowly add this mixture to the egg mixture and mix until combined. The batter will be very thick. Fold in the apple & applesauce by hand using a wooden spoon. Spread batter into the prepared pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes or until cake tests done. Let cake cool on a wire rack. Once cake is cool serve with a dusting of confectioners' sugar or with a Cream Cheese Frosting.
