Ingredients:
1 Bell Pepper, cut into thin strips
A handful of baby carrots, cut into thin strips
Half a large onion, cut into thin strips
One block of extra firm tofu, cut into small cubes (can use any other protein you like)
1 4oz jar Thai Kitchen Red Curry Paste
1 can lite coconut milk
1 cup vegetable broth
Rice noodles
soy sauce, to taste

Directions:
Step One: Soak the rice noodles in water until softened, then submerge them in boiling water. Let them soak for a bit. If you can cover them, all the better. But just be sure they aren’t on the heat any longer—nobody likes an overcooked noodle.
Step Two: Drizzle a bit of olive oil into your pan and empty about half the jar of the curry paste into the pan. Mix up and let those two really get to know each other.
Step Three: Add one cup water plus one cup broth into the skillet. Add the carrots, onions and tofu, and bring to a boil.  Cover and let it rumble until almost cooked to the point you like them.
Step Four: Add the can of coconut milk and the peppers.
Step Five: Add about 1/4 cup of soy sauce into the mix (and Thai sweet chili sauce, if you have some on hand). In a bowl, put a decent helping of noodles. Then ladle on some of that delicious sauce and veggies right over the noodles.
