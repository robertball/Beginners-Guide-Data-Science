6 Potatoes
1 medium onion
2 eggs
1/2 cup flour
1/4 tsp pepper

Directions:
Wash potatoes and cut into chunks.
Place potatoes in a food processor (or a blender) and pulse until there are no longer any big chunks.
Cut onion into chunks and add add to food processor.
Pulse until the potatoes and onions until the mixture starts to look like a batter.
Pour into a bowl and add eggs, flour, salt, and pepper and mix well.
Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
Drop batter into the oil by 1/4 cups.
Fry on one side until the potato cake is a deep golden brown, flip, and fry on the other side.
Remove from oil and drain on paper towels while the rest of the potato cakes cook.
Continue until all the batter is gone, adding more oil when needed.
Serve warm, topped with ketchup, cottage cheese, or sour cream.

Description: 
This is an easy, quick recipe using ingredients that most people have on hand. My mom made these for Lent, when we couldn't have meat on Fridays. We topped these with cottage cheese or ketchup.
