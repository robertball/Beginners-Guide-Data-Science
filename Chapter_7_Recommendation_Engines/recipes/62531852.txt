Description: 
The flavor of this basic bread stuffing is boosted by the addition of several cups of chopped celery. This recipe yields enough dressing to stuff a 10-15 pound turkey. Bake the dressing that doesn't fit in the cavity of the turkey in a buttered baking dish. Try putting the stuffing under the skin of the breast.  It makes the turkey very moist!Modified from: Celery Stuffing
