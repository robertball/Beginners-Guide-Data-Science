Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups crushed gingersnap cookies (about 32 cookies)
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/8 cup sugar
3 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, softened
1 cup sugar
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon Pure Vanilla Extract
5 ounces white baking chocolate, melted and cooled
3/4 cup canned pumpkin
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a small bowl, combine gingersnap crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and butter. Press onto the bottom of a greased 9-in. springform pan; set aside.
In a double boiler, melt white chocolate.  Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add eggs and vanilla; beat on low speed just until combined. Stir in melted white chocolate.
Combine pumpkin and spices; gently fold into cream cheese mixture. Pour over crust. Place pan in larger pan with 1-2 inches hot water.
Bake at 350Â° for 55-60 minutes or until center is just set. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around edge of springform pan to loosen; cool 1 hour longer. Refrigerate overnight.
