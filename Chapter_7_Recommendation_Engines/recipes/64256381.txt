Ingredients:
1-2 cans whole cranberry sauce
2 tablespoons orange zest
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups rolled oats
2 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan, line with foil, then grease the foil.
Stir together the cranberry sauce and the orange zest.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in the butter using your hands or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press half of this mixture firmly into the prepared pan. Spread the cranberry sauce evenly over the base, then crumble the remaining oat mixture over the top.
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is golden brown. Cool completely before cutting into bars.
