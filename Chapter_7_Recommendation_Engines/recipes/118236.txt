Ingredients:
3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups sugar
1 cup baking cocoa
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups buttermilk
1 cup butter, melted
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
30 milk chocolate candy kisses, unwrapped
1 (16 ounce) container fudge frosting

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda and salt; mix well. Combine the buttermilk, butter, eggs and vanilla. Add to the dry ingredients; mix well.
Fill paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Press a chocolate kiss into the center of each cupcake until batter completely covers candy.
Bake at 375 degrees F. for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cakes comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely. Frost cupcakes.

Description: 
I earned a merit badge by dreaming up these cupcakes for a Cub Scouts meeting. You should have seen the grins when the kids bit into the chocolate kisses in the middle. My husband and grandkids say I don't make them often enough.
