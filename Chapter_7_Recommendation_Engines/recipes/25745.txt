Ingredients:
2 pounds tomatoes
2 cubes beef bouillon, crumbled
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 quart milk

Directions:
Run the tomatoes through a food mill to remove the seeds and skins, and place in a large pot over medium heat.  Stir in the bouillon, sugar, salt, bay leaf, basil and pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes.  (If you're going to can this mixture, process it now.)
In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter.  Whisk in flour all at once to form a roux, cook 1 minute.  Whisk in milk, a little at a time, cooking and stirring constantly until thickened.  Stir into tomato mixture and heat through.

Description: 
I can this soup mixture (before adding the butter, flour and milk) about every other year.  You determine how much you do at one time.  I usually put up about 80 jars at a time, mostly in October when the weather has cooled down.
