Ingredients:
3 cups warm water
3 tablespoons active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups honey
3 tablespoons molasses
2 teaspoons cinnamon
9 cups whole wheat flour
2 cups raisins, or to taste
1 tablespoon salt

Directions:
Combine warm water and yeast in a large bowl; allow to dissolve, about 5 minutes.
Stir honey, molasses, and cinnamon into the yeast; stir gently.
Stir flour, raisins, and salt into the bowl with the yeast-honey mixture. Mix well; it will be crumbly. Knead until dough is smooth, about 10 minutes. Cover with a towel and allow dough to rest for 20 minutes.
Bring a large pot of water to a low boil.
Pinch off a 2-inch ball of dough and roll into a snake. Wrap it around with 4 fingers and gently pinch ends together to form a bagel shape. Repeat with remaining dough to make 25 to 45 bagels.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Place bagels in boiling water; cook for 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the water and place on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
