Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsps baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsps ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground cloves
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp ground allspice
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
3 eggs, room temperature
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1 1/2 tsps vanilla extract
1 tsp orange zest
3/4 cup buttermilk
2 cups ground cherries, husks removed

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Generously grease a large Bundt pan.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and allspice until combined. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, beat butter and brown sugar together until light and fluffy. Add in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in maple syrup, vanilla, and orange zest. Add in 1/3 of the flour mixture, and stir until just combined. Pour in half of the buttermilk and mix until just combined. Repeat alternating additions of flour mixture and buttermilk until ingredients are incorporated--beginning and ending with the flour mixture--and stirring just until combined. Do not over mix. Gently fold in ground cherries.
4. Pour batter into prepared Bundt cake pan and bake in preheated oven 50-55 minutes, or  until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow cake to cool in pan for 10 minutes, before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I came up with this cake as a way to use the massive amounts of ground cherries (also known as Cape gooseberries or husk cherries) that grew in my garden this year. The ground cherries have a subtle pineapple-y flavor and a beautiful orange color that makes a great addition to this spicy Bundt cake. If you don't have ground cherries, you can use 2 cups of any fresh fruit or berries you'd like--though blackberries in particular would be a great substitution.
