Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, minced
2 stalks celery, minced
2 (6 ounce) packages bread stuffing mix
1 pint shucked oysters
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning, or to taste
2 1/2 cups hot water or as needed

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion and celery until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer the vegetables into a large bowl. Mix in the stuffing mix, oysters, melted butter, and seasoning; pour in hot water to desired moistness. If used for stuffing a turkey, stuffing will need less moisture.
