Ingredients:
18 dry lasagna noodles (1 lb box)
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium zucchini, diced
1 yellow onion, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
2 large carrots, shredded
4 ounces fresh baby spinach
(1 cup sliced baby portobello mushrooms)
1 1/2 jars pasta sauce (40 ounces)
15 ounces part skim ricotta cheese
4 cups freshly shredded part skim mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese
4 ounces silken tofu
2 eggs

Directions:
Cook noodles al dente in salted water.  Drain and rinse with cold water. Toss with olive oil to prevent sticking and to add flavor.
While noodles are cooking, saute onions, zucchini, bell pepper and carrots (and mushrooms if using) in olive oil over medium-high heat until tender.
Add spinach and 1 and 1/2 jars pasta sauce to vegetables and simmer until spinach is cooked.
While simmering sauce,combine ricotta cheese, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs and tofu into a bowl.
To assemble, cover bottom of lasagna pan (2-quart rectangular baking dish) with a little vegetable pasta sauce to prevent sticking, layer 8 overlapping lasagna noodles, spread 1/2 of the cheese and tofu mixture over noodles, spread 1/2 of the remaining sauce over the cheese, then repeat with remaining noodles, cheese and sauce.
Top with a mixture of 2 cups mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
Bake, covered, in a 375 degree F oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and cook 20 minutes more. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving to assist with cutting.

Description: 
We are always looking for recipes to add to our Meatless Monday rotation.  Bumping up the protein is important for our 3 kids, so adding tofu to the cheese mixture of vegetarian lasagna works great.  Use the excess tofu to make a high protein salad dressing.
