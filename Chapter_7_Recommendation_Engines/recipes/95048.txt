Ingredients:
6 medium boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 pounds), tenderloins cut or pulled away, and breasts pounded lightly with fist to a more-or-less even thickness
4 teaspoons ground coriander
Salt
6 tablespoons Major Grey Chutney
1 lime, quartered
6 tablespoons frozen limeade concentrate
1/4 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil
1 (15 ounce) package broccoli slaw
3 medium green onions, thinly sliced
1 large carrot, coarsely grated
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to position closest to broiler element, and turn on high. Mix coriander, a generous sprinkling of salt and the chutney in a medium bowl, then add chicken breasts (and tenderloins), and toss to coat with sauce. Place chicken, skinned side up, on a wire rack set over a foiled-lined pan; broil without turning until chicken is cooked through and spotty brown, about 8 minutes.
While chicken breasts cook, whisk limeade concentrate (no need to thaw) with pepper flakes and ginger, and then whisk in oil.  Place broccoli slaw, green onions, carrot and cilantro in a clean medium-sized bowl and add dressing; toss to coat.
Remove chicken and transfer to serving platter. Squeeze lime juice over chicken to taste, and serve with slaw.
For lunch, pack chicken and slaw in separate leakproof containers. Warm chicken in microwave, or serve the chicken and slaw at room temperature.
