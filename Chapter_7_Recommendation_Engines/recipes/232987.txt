Ingredients:
½ pound chicken wings, split and tips discarded
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ cup butter
¾ cup red hot sauce
¼ cup brown sugar (optional)
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add chicken wings, put lid on steamer, and steam wings until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Spread chicken wings onto a platter to cool; pat dry with paper towel. Spread wings onto a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.
Bake wings in preheated oven for 20 minutes, flip, and continue to bake until crispy, about 20 minutes more.
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Stir hot sauce, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper into the melted butter; cook, stirring occasionally, until the seasonings dissolve into the liquid and the mixture is hot, about 5 minutes.
Put wings in a large bowl; pour sauce over wings and toss to coat.
