Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package ground beef
1/2 red onion, diced
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon hot English mustard

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix beef, red onion, garlic, salt, pepper, Worcestershire, and English mustard together in a mixing bowl.
Form patties by pressing a ball of ground beef with your hand and rounding the sides to your desired size.
Cook burgers in the preheated air fryer until firm and no longer pink in the centers, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
