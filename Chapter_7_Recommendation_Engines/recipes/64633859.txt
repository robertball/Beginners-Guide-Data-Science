Ingredients:
1 tablespoons olive oil
1 red onion minced
1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded and cut into 1/2 inch pieces
4 garlic cloves, chopped
A good piece of saffron
2 c. orzo
3-4 cups chicken broth
1/2 t. dried oregano
1/2 cup frozen peas
1 pound uncooked extra large shrimp, peeled, deveined
14-1/2 ounce can diced tomatoes, drained, with juice reserved
1 cup crumbled feta cheese
2 scallions, sliced thin
lemon wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Pat shrimp dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper, set aside.
Put olive oil in  non-stick oven-proof  12' pan until it shimmers.  Saute onion, bell pepper, in oil for 5-7 minutes, until the veggies are softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds. Stir in the orzo and and saffron and cook, stirring until the orzo is coated with the oil and starting to brown--about 4 minutes.
Stir in 3 cups of the broth and reserved tomato juice  and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the orzo becomes softer, but still has a slightly firm center, about 12 minutes. Add a little more broth if the mix looks too dry.
Stir in the tomatoes, peas, shrimp, and oregano.
Sprinkle the feta cheese over the top.  Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, when the feta will begin to brown.  Remove from oven (remember that the handles are hot!) and sprinkle with the scallions and serve with the lemon wedges..
