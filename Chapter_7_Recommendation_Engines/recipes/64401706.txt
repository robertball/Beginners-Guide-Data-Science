Ingredients:
1-1/3 cups mashed ripe banana
3 large eggs
1/3 cup Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil a little warmer than room temperature (but not hot to the touch)
1/2 cup twice sifted coconut flour
1 tbsp. vanilla extract
1 tsp. cream of tartar
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/4 tsp. sea salt

Directions:
Set oven on "convection" setting and preheat to 300 F, (the "convection" setting causes forced convection by circulating the air inside the oven using a fan).
Mix together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and sea salt.
Using a mixer, cream together the mashed banana, egg, oil and vanilla.
While mixing, slowly add the flour mixture to the egg mixture.
Drop by the spoonful on a cookie sheet greased with coconut oil.
The cookie dough will not flatten in the oven, so you will need to shape them with the back of a spoon.
Bake for 35 minutes.

Description: 
These cookies are soft and mildly sweet with a subtle coconut flavor. My son likes them with raspberry jam on top.
