Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste
3/4 cup self-rising flour
3/4 cup milk
1 (28 ounce) can sliced peaches, with juice

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the butter into a 8x8-inch baking dish, and place into the oven until melted. Stir the sugar, nutmeg, and self-rising flour together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the milk until no lumps remain. Pour the batter over the melted butter in the baking dish. Do not stir. Spoon the sliced peaches over top; gently pour in the juice.
Return to the oven, and bake until the batter has firmed and the cobbler has risen a bit, 35 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
This was the result of letting my 3 baby cousins 'help' me in the kitchen. The oldest was 4. Surprisingly this cobbler turned out pretty well. If a bit messy.
