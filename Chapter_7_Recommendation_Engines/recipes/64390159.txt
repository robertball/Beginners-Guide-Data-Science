Ingredients:
1 Japanese eggplant, sliced 1/4" thick
2 to 3 egg whites, beaten
1 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs
1 cup flour
salt & pepper
5 to 6 slices Provolone or Mozzarella cheese, quartered
Grated Parmesan or Romano cheese for topping
1/2 to 2/3 cup olive oil
Homemade sauce

Directions:
Season flour with salt and pepper and set aside on plate
Have beaten egg whites in a bowl and the breadcrumbs on a 3rd plate
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and line a rack with paper towels for draining
Dredge eggplant (no need to salt or peel) in flour, then egg whites, and lastly in breadcrumbs.  Oh.  A note.  Adding Parmesan cheese to breadcrumbs would be wonderful if you have it.  If not, don't worry.
Heat olive oil in large frying pan and saute breaded eggplant slices 1 to 2 minutes per side or until golden brown.  Remove from oil and drain on paper towels.
Once drained, move eggplant slices to prepared baking sheet.  The Original recipe called for first putting a dab of spaghetti sauce on eggplant ... we felt that made it too soggy, but that's your choice.
Top fried eggplant with cheese (we like Provolone) and a sprinkling of Parmesan or Romano.
Run under broiler for 2-3 minutes or until cheese has melted into gooey yummy stuff.  Oh yeah, baby.
Serve hot with a side of pasta, homemade sauce, and a salad.  Or eat them dipped in ranch.  That'll keep you busy.
