Ingredients:
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons butter
4 (1 ounce) squares baking chocolate
2 3/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons instant espresso powder (optional)

Directions:
Combine the heavy cream, butter, baking chocolate, chocolate chips, and espresso powder in a saucepan over medium heat; stirring constantly, cook until the chocolate has melted into a smooth and thick mixture. Remove from heat. Pour into a bowl and chill in refrigerator until the mixture hardens, about 1 hour
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Scoop small balls of the chocolate mixture onto the waxed paper. Store in refrigerator until the balls harden completely. Store in a cool, dry place.

Description: 
My Dad made this recipe up one evening to surprise my Mom. They are huge fans of dark chocolate. Add any extra little add-ins that you want! (e.g. coffee grounds, mint extract, cinnamon, white chocolate coating, etc.) Deliciously dark and fudgy! Enjoy with family on holidays, or just any time you have a major dark chocolate craving! Rolling in coating of choice before refrigerating, if desired.
