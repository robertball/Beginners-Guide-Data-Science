Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 package active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup warm water
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 can pizza sauce
4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 package sliced pepperoni

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, yeast and salt. Add water and oil; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll the dough into a circle; transfer to a greased cookie sheet. Spread with pizza sauce and sprinkle with cheese. Arrange pepperoni on top however you would like! Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until crust and cheese are lightly browned.
