Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups flour
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 T. pumpkin pie spice
1 t. baking soda
1/2 t. salt
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1 cup canned pumpkin
1/2 cup vegetable oil
Cream Cheese Filling
8 oz. cream cheese

pinch of salt
Cream all together
Struesel Topping
2 T. flour
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 t. cinnamon
4 t. cold butter cut into small bits
Cut the butter into the remaining ingredients until the mixture is crumbly.

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the first five ingredients, set aside. In a large bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients, mix well.  Add the dry ingredients to the pumpkin mixture and stir well.
Spoon batter into ungreased muffin pans. Put a dollop of cream cheese mixture on top of each muffin. (Be sure not to fill too much.) Sprinkle with the struesel mixture and bake at 350 degree oven for 20-25 minutes or untila toothpick inserted into the middle of one muffin comes out clean.

Description: 
These muffins are so delicious and quick to make.  I usually fill the muffin pan half way with the pumpkin mixture then add about 2 T of the cream cheese filling, then top each muffin off with more pumpkin and the struesel.
