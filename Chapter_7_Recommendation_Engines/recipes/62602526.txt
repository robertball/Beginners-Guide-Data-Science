In a small bowl, whisk pudding mix, cream of tartar  & the other 1/2 of the milk until smooth.  Fold pudding into whipped topping.  If this is not sweet enough for you, slowly add the powdered sugar to taste.

Description: 
Instant pudding and instant whipped topping mix make this a creamy, versatile icing that takes minutes to make.   Substitute any pudding flavor for the vanilla or add a quarter teaspoon of your family's favorite spice to vary the flavor.  We like ginger!Modified from: Fluffy Frosting II
