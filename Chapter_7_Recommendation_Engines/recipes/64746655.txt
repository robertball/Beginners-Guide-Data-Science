Ingredients:
1 lb ground turkey
1/2 onion, diced
1/2 green pepper, diced
2 small carrots, grated
Seasoning (1tsp each to your taste: garlic powder, Lowry’s seasoning, pepper, and 1 tbsp Italian seasoning)
1.5 c beef broth (I use water and beef bouillon powder)
1tbsp Worcestershire
2c elbow macaroni
1tsp paprika
8 oz tomato sauce
15 oz can petite diced tomatoes (could use Italian or stewed)

Directions:
Set Instant Pot to sauté, when hot add a little olive oil and brown the turkey until about half done. Add onions, pepper, carrots and seasoning.
Mix 1.5 c water with bullion powder and Worcestershire, add to meat and vegetables and mix well, bring to a simmer.
Add macaroni and paprika and stir.
Add tomatoes and tomatoes sauce, DO NOT STIR.
Close the lid and lock in place.
Manual pressure 4 minutes (or 3 for al dente)
Do a controlled quick release to prevent sauce from mixing with the steam  (turn the pressure release knob and allow short bursts of steam to escape).
Remove lid and mix well.
Can add corn, beans or peas and could top with cheese.
