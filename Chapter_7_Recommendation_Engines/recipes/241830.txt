Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
4 cups salad greens
1 Granny Smith apple, cored and sliced
1/2 cup candied walnuts
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
1/4 cup raspberry vinaigrette, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Season chicken with seasoned salt and grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Mix salad greens, apple slices, walnuts, and blue cheese together in a bowl. Drizzle raspberry vinaigrette over the salad and toss to coat; divide salad between 2 plates.
Cut chicken into strips and place half the strips atop each salad portion.
