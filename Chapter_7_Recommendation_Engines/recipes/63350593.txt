In a separate pot, boil or steam cleaned and stemmed beets until firm/tender.  Set aside to cool.
Once beets are cooled, strip off skins and coarsely grate beets.
When beef is tender, remove from water, cover and set aside.  Add grated beets, cabbage, crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper and lemon juice to beef broth and simmer for 30 minutes.
In a separate pot, boil or steam potatoes (with or without skins) until tender, serve immediately.
Serve soup with boiled potatoes hot on the side or in the soup.

Serve beef separately and garnish with horseradish and/or mustard.
Then as my my mother would say, "ess & fress"!
