Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 egg yolks
3 cups miniature marshmallows
2/3 cup corn syrup
1/4 cup butter
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 10 ounce package peanut butter chips
2 cups crisp rice cereal
2 cups salted peanuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.
Line a 13 x 9 pan with foil so that it extends up the sides.  This will enable you to remove the bars from the pan easily onto a cutting board for cutting into serving pieces.
In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.  Set aside.
In the bowl of your stand mixer combine 1/2 cup butter, brown sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla and egg yolks.  Mix on low speed with an electric mixer fluffy.  Slowly add in dry ingredients and mix until thoroughly combined.
Press firmly into bottom of 13 x 9 inch pan.  Bake 12- 15 minutes until golden brown.
Immediately sprinkle marshmallows over top and return to oven for 2 - 2 1/2 minutes.  Let cool while preparing topping.
To Make Topping:  In a large saucepan over low heat combine corn syrup, 1/4 cup butter or margarine, 2 teaspoons vanilla and peanut butter chips until smoothly melted, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in cereal and nuts.  Immediately spoon over marshmallows, spreading to cover.  Refrigerate overnight.
Using foil "handles" remove bars from pan onto cutting board.
Let pan sit for about 30-60 minutes before cutting them into 36 bars.
