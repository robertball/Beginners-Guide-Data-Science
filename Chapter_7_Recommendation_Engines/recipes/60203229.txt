Ingredients:
5 pounds ground beef
5 packets taco seasoning
5 (16 ounce) can refried beans
24 (10 inch) flour tortillas
10 cups shredded Mexican blend cheese
3 cups prepared salsa
Lettuce, sour cream and tomatoes as desired

Directions:
Place the ground beef in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Season with taco seasoning, and cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink. Drain off grease, then reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in the refried beans and salsa. Cook until heated through.
Warm the flour tortillas for 2 minutes in the microwave, or until pliable. Spoon 1/4 cup of the beef mixture into the center, top with shredded cheese, and roll up, folding in the ends when you get to the halfway point.  Top as desired with lettuce, sour cream and tomatoes.

Description: 
Burritos that are so easy a man could do them.  These are wonderfully different and so good. I like to serve them with Mexican rice. Customize by adding more of your favorite burrito fillings to this basic recipe, such as tomato, lettuce, sour cream or guacamole.Modified from: No Bull Burritos
