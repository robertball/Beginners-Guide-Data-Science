Ingredients:
4 cups chopped fresh rhubarb
1 pint strawberries, hulled and sliced
1 tablespoon sugar
1 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, stir together the rhubarb, strawberries and honey. Transfer to a shallow baking dish. In the same bowl, stir together the oats, brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix in the butter until crumbly, and spread over the top of the fruit.
Bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until rhubarb is tender and the topping is toasted. Serve warm.

Description: 
A lot of rhubarb recipes add a large amount of sugar.  This keeps the sweetener to a minimum so you can enjoy the tang of the rhubarb! Delicious-- enjoy! Use sugar in place of honey if you like.Modified from: Low Sugar Strawberry Rhubarb Crunch
