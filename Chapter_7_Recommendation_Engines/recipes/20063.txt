Ingredients:
2 pounds bottom round roast, cut into 1/8 inch thick slices
salt and pepper to taste
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, sliced
15 fresh hot chile peppers, seeded
2 pounds bacon, sliced

Directions:
To Grill: Preheat grill to medium low heat. To Roast: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread out beef slices and season with salt and pepper to taste. Put a slice of cream cheese and a hot pepper on the end of each slice, and roll up like an eggroll. Wrap 1 slice of bacon lengthwise around each steak deal, then wrap a second bacon slice around each so that the first slice is secured. Secure steak deals with toothpicks and place in disposable pans for grilling, or a 9x13 inch baking dish for roasting.
Cook steak deals on grill or in oven long enough for beef to be cooked through and bacon to be somewhat crispy (20 to 30 minutes).

Description: 
A friend of the family introduced this to us and we have used it quite often. Note: If grilling, do not put steak deals directly on grill as this will increase chances of a grease fire!
