Chocolate Rice Krispies Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup Karo corn syrup
1 cup sugar
1 cup peanut butter
6 or 7 cups rice krispies cereal
1/2  - 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 - 1 cup butterscotch chips
*depends how much chocolate you like on top, 1/2 cup for less, 1 cup for more of course. Just make sure there are equal amounts.

Directions:
1. Generously butter a 9x13 inch baking pan. (Instead of buttering, I wrap saran wrap around the pan for easy clean up. I don't always use a 9x13 inch pan...just whatever looks like it will hold everything, especially if I double the recipe.
2. In a bowl, mix corn syrup and sugar. Heat in microwave for 1 minute. Stir and heat for another minute or a little less (enough so that mixture starts to bubble). Stir in peanut butter. Add rice krispies.
3. Transfer mixture into pan. Pat it down into pan - I use a piece of saran wrap so mixture doesn't stick to my hand.
4. In a separate bowl, melt chocolate chips and butterscotch chips until smooth. I usually heat in the microwave for a minute and stir, then heat for another minute or so. Probably would work better to heat in a pot on a stove so you don't burn the chocolate. Spread over top of bars and let bars cool. Cut into squares.
