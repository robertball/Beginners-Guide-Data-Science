Ingredients:
1 large head cabbage
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 pound ground pork
1/2 pound ground ham
1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
1 onion, finely chopped
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
1 pound sauerkraut
1 cup tomato juice
water to cover

Directions:
Place cabbage in the freezer for a few days. The night before making the rolls, take it out to thaw.
In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, ham, rice, onion, egg, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mix well. Form meat mixture into oblong balls, using 1/2 cup of the mixture at a time. Then, wrap a cabbage leaf around each ball.
Spread the sauerkraut in the bottom of a large pot, then layer cabbage rolls on top, placing them seam-side down. Pour tomato juice over rolls, then add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for about 3 hours, adding more water as necessary.
