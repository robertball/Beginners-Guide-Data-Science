Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 medium tomato, diced
1 tablespoon chopped onion, or to taste
1 clove garlic, minced
⅔ (1 pound) package processed cheese, cubed
8 ounces sour cream
2 small cooked skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, shredded
½ (4 ounce) can green chiles, chopped - or to taste
2 tablespoons salsa
¼ teaspoon seasoned salt
¼ teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the tomato, onion, and garlic until the tomato has released its juice and the juice has become thick and syrupy, about 10 minutes.
Mix in the processed cheese cubes, and stir until melted and smooth. Stir in the sour cream, shredded chicken, green chiles, salsa, seasoned salt, and oregano until thoroughly mixed, and cook until hot but not simmering, about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Serve hot.

Description: 
I fell in love with Carlos O'Kelly's chili con queso with chicken, and experimented until I came up with something I think is a great imitation.  It's often a requested appetizer dip at family functions. Serve hot with tortilla chips.
