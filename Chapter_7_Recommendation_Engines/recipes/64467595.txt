Ingredients:
7 oz or 2 cups shredded coconut
2 cups kale (yields 1 cup finely shredded)
4 egg whites
1/2 cup sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 ts salt
chocolate for dipping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
This is the most important step. Choose the music that you will listen to while you bake. I prefer dance party for cooking but something more mellow for baking , maybe a little Mumford & Sons.
Shred your kale. A food processor is preferable.
Whisk the egg whites, sugar, vanilla and salt until it is well combined and frothy.
Gently add the coconut and kale.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper
You may just scoop the mixture into balls or shape it into dinosaur bones. Someone might say that your bones look like bowties or just blogs. Ignore them, they don't understand your art.
Bake for 20-25 minutes
Move parchment to a rack to cool
Follow directions on chocolate for melting
Dip cookies in chocolate. You can dip the bottom  like traditional macaroons or just dip one half.
Enjoy!
