Ingredients:
4 organic eggs
1 packet of good quality sausages
1 teaspoon of salt and pepper
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon oregano
Seasoned flour for coating
Breadcrumbs for coating
2 beaten eggs for coating
2 cups of oil for frying

Directions:
Boil your eggs for 5 minutes and immediately place under cold water to stop the cooking.
Meanwhile run a knife along from one end of the sausage to the other and remove the skin.
Repeat this with all the sausages and transfer the meat to a bowl.
Add the herbs and seasoning and mix well.
Add the oil to a pan and heat to a moderate temperature.
Meanwhile wet your hands and take some of the sausage meat and mold it around the egg.
Roll the egg in the seasoned flour, then into the egg, then the breadcrumbs and set aside as you continue with the rest.
Place them in the oil and fry for around 5 to 7 minutes, or until the sausage meat is cooked.
(If you find it hard to roll the egg and sausage in the flour then you can put them in the fridge for half an hour before coating, which will firm them up slightly and make them easier to coat.)
Eat hot or cold with mustard, chutney or pickle.
