Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, peeled and chopped
2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1 (7 ounce) can hearts of palm, cubed
1 tablespoon cornmeal
1 cup milk
1 pinch ground nutmeg
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup chopped fresh chives
1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and hearts of palm; saute until tender, about 5 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Dissolve cornmeal in a bowl of milk; mix well and pour into the skillet with the hearts of palm. Stir well. Add nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until flavors meld, about 5 minutes more. Add cream cheese and chives; stir well to dissolve the cheese. Remove from heat. Let filling cool.
Roll pastry out onto a floured work surface. Cut into squares. Place 1 tablespoon of the filling on each pastry square. Fold pastry over the filling and seal. Place pastries on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 40 minutes.
