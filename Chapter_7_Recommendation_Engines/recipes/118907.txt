Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package hot roll mix
1 cup warm water (120 to 130 degrees F)
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 egg white, lightly beaten
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
Refrigerated butter-flavored spray

Directions:
In a bowl, combine roll mix and contents of yeast package. Add the water, oil and egg white; beat until smooth. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
Roll into a 16-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Cut widthwise into sixteen 1-in. strips. Cut strips in half widthwise, forming 32 strips. Twist each strip 5-6 times; place on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray.
Combine sugar and cinnamon. Spray dough sticks generously with refrigerated butter-flavored spray; sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 25 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.

Description: 
I think this is the best sweet breadstick you'll find. I love to snack on these while drinking my morning coffee. Each twist has just 1 gram of fat and is quite satisfying.                   --Carol Birkemeier of Nashville, Indiana
