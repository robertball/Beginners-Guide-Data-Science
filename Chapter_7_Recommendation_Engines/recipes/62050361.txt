1 Cup cold Water

Optional Then add 1 teaspoon almond flavoring. 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Refrigerate overnight or at least one hour.
To form letters:
Divide dough into 12 equal balls.  Roll each ball into thin strips-about 18 inches long by 4 inches wide.  Divide filling into 12 equal parts. Roll into a snake like shape...to fit the dough.  Place in the middle of the dough.  Bring sides and end up-over lapping.  Lay on a cookie sheet with seam on the bottom....Shape into the letter S or a straight line.  Brush with egg whites and sprinkle with course or regular sugar.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20 mins. or until light brown. These will keep good in a plastic container in freezer until ready to eat.  Doughs can be kept in the refridge for a couple days.
