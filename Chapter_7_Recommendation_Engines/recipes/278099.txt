Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cake flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter, at room temperature
3 tablespoons applesauce
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
1 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line twenty four 2 1/2-inch muffin cups with paper liners.
Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a small bowl.
Beat brown sugar, peanut butter, applesauce, oil, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each addition until combined. Beat in flour mixture, alternating with buttermilk, on low speed until just combined. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 14 to 16 minutes. Cool in the tins for 5 minutes. Loosen edges using a knife; carefully remove cupcakes and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
