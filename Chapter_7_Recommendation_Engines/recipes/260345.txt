Use a wooden spoon to mix the chile powder and paprika into the paste. Add the vinegar and water while stirring. Mix well.

Description: 
Revised version of 'Janelle's Turkey Chorizo (Loose, Not Encased).' I have adjusted the spices and method to suit my tastes. My friends who eat chorizo often have told me the end result is very good and close to an original recipe.
