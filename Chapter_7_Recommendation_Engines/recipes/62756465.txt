5 T light sesame oil
1/3 c chopped raw cashew (optional)
1 c quick cooking cream of wheat
1 1/4 tsp black mustard seeds
1/2 T channa
2 tsp urad
1 - 2 hot green chilies, chopped
1/3 tsp asafoetida (hing)
1 T ginger paste
1/2 c onion, chopped
1/2 c tomatoes, chopped (Roma if fresh)
1 tsp salt
1/2 c plain yogurt
1 1/2 c hot water
1 - 2 tsp lemon juice
chopped cilantro for garnish

Directions:
Use 1 T dark sesame oil plus 4 T regular veg oil if you don't have light sesame oil.
Chop and measure all ingredients and set aside in bowls so they may be quickly and easily added as you go.
Whisk together the yogurt and the hot water and set aside.
Heat a frying pan over high heat.  When it is hot, reduce heat to Med, add 1 T of the oil(s), coat the pan.  Fry the cashews if you are using them.  Otherwise, fry the semolina, stirring to coat well and lightly fry. (about 5 mins).  Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
Add remaining oil to the pan.  When very hot, reduce to med-low and add the dal, first the channa, then after about a minute the urad.  When the urad is just starting to brown, drop in the mustard seeds.  Add the chilies, asafoetida, ginger, and onion and stir to cook, about 3 mins.
Add the cream of wheat, tomatoes, salt, and yogurt-water.  Stir to mix thoroughly.  Stir constantly with a folding motion to make it light and fluffy.
Fold in the nuts, lemon juice, and about half the coriander.
Serve and garnish with the rest of the coriander.
