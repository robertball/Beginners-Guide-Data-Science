Ingredients:
2 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, cubed
1/4 cup corn syrup
3 large apples, peeled and chopped
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon apple pie spice
1 loaf cinnamon raisin bread
1/2 cup peanuts or pecans
10 eggs
1 cup nonfat milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine the brown sugar, butter and corn syrup. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring consistently. Cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Set aside.
In a small bowl, combine the apples, lemon juice, sugar and pie spice. Arrange half of the bread slices in a greased 13 x 9 baking dish. Spoon apples over bread; drizzle with half of the caramel sauce. Sprinkle with nuts; top with the remaining bread.
In a large bowl, combine the eggs, milk, salt and vanilla. Pour over the top. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Cover and refrigerate the remaining caramel sauce.
Remove strata from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 350 for 50-55 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.
In a small microwave covered dish, microwave reserved sauce, uncovered for 1-2 minutes or until heated through. Drizzle over strata.
