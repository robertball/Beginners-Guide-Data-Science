Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup melted butter
1/4 cup ground almonds
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Filling:
1/2 cup water
1 envelope unflavored gelatin
1 pound cream cheese, softened
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup whipping cream
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
Topping:
2 large peaches, peeled and sliced
1 cup fresh raspberries

Directions:
Combine graham cracker crumbs, butter, almonds, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix until evenly moistened; press into the bottom and partway up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Refrigerate while preparing the filling.
Pour water into a saucepan. Sprinkle gelatin powder on top. Let stand until softened, about 1 minute. Place over low heat; stir constantly until the granules are completely dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in sour cream, whipping cream, and lemon zest. Add gelatin; mix well. Pour into the prepared crust. Refrigerate until set, 3 to 4 hours.
Remove from the springform pan and place on a serving plate. Decorate with sliced peaches and raspberries.
