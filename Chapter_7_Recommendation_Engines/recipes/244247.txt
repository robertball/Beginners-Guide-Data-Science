Ingredients:
1 (16.9 ounce) package blueberry muffin mix (such as Betty Crocker®)
3/4 cup water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
3/4 cup cream cheese frosting, or as needed
2 strawberry-flavored fruit roll (such as Fruit Roll-Ups®), cut into thin strips, or as needed
20 blueberries, halved crosswise

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 10 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Drain blueberries from muffin mix. Mix muffin mix, water, oil, and eggs together in a bowl until batter is just mixed; fold in blueberries. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each to the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 16 to 21 minutes. Cool until able to be handled and cut tops off each cupcake, reserving tops for a separate use.
Spread cream cheese frosting, starting from the middle and working outwards, onto each cupcake bottom. Arrange fruit roll strips onto each, forming "stripes" and place 2 blueberry halves in the left corner of each for the "stars".
