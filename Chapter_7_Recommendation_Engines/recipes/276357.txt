Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar, divided
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup lime juice
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 eggs
1/4 cup coconut-flavored rum
2/3 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line each cup with paper liners.
Combine flour, white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.
Combine lime juice, melted butter, eggs, and rum in a small bowl. Slowly stir into the flour mixture until moistened. Fold in white chocolate chips.
Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle remaining brown sugar over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
Yummy cake-like muffins, with lime and white chocolate. These are closer to tart than sweet--not sour, but a nice change from very sweet desserts.
