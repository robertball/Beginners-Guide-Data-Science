Pour cooled mixture over fruit and refrigerate until firm, at least 8 hours.
7. To unmold, dip outside of glass container into a larger container with hot water, 3 to 5 seconds to loosen. Do not let hot water spill over into terrine.

Note:  some people line the terrine with plastic wrap, put the fruit in and pour the mixture over, chill and then they don't have to worry about the hot water to loosen.
