Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) bag broccoli florets
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 cup packed finely grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg
2 tablespoons Italian bread crumbs
2 cloves garlic, grated
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil, or as needed
sea salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place 1/2 of the broccoli in a food processor and pulse until texture resembles rice, about 20 times. Repeat with the remaining 1/2 of the broccoli.
Fill a large shallow saucepan with salt and 1/2 inch water over high heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and add the broccoli rice. Cover and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool for 10 minutes. Transfer broccoli rice to the center of a dish towel. Wrap up the towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.
Place Parmesan cheese, egg, bread crumbs, garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Add the broccoli rice and mix until dough is well incorporated and sticks together when rolled into a ball.
Place dough in the center of the prepared baking sheet; press into a 12-inch circle about 1/3-inch thick. Drizzle crust with olive oil and season with sea salt.
Bake on the top rack of the preheated oven until edges are crisp and lightly browned, 18 to 20 minutes.
