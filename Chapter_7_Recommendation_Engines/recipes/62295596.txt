Description: 
Sichuan (Szechuan) Cold Noodle is one of the most famous Sichuan street foods. What I mean by street food is that you can get it almost anywhere in Sichuan--even a small food stand on the side of the street. It is actually simple to make, and the ingredients are easy to find. It is definitely a quick, easy meal, though you might want to watch out for the garlic :)
