Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups butter, softened
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 (24 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
In a large mixing bowl, mash the butter with white sugar and brown sugar until the mixture is well combined. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and stir in vanilla extract. Stir in the flour mixture, about 1 cup at a time, then mix in the chocolate chips. Drop the dough by rounded tablespoon onto baking sheets, about 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Allow to cool for about 5 minutes on the baking sheets before removing cookies to finish cooling.

Description: 
These delicious chocolate chip cookies are almost no-fail. No matter what you do with it, they always seem to turn out. Even my ten year old daughter can make them and they still turn out. They are very rich and yummy.
