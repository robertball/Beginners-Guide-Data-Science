Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces
1  onion, chopped
3 large stalks celery, chopped
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1  bay leaf
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon ground oregano
⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
½ (4 ounce) can chopped jalapeno peppers
1 (6 ounce) can chopped green chilies
2 ½ cups chicken stock
1 cup water
3 (14.5 ounce) cans great Northern beans
12 ounces sour cream
½ cup heavy cream

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken in the hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
Add the onion and celery to the skillet; cook and stir until the vegetables are slightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
Transfer the chicken mixture to a slow cooker.
Mix in the garlic powder, cumin, bay leaf, salt, black pepper, oregano, cayenne pepper, jalapeno peppers, green chilies, chicken stock, water, and great Northern beans.
Cook on Low 8 to 10 hours, or on High 4 to 5 hours. Remove the bay leaf from the mixture. Stir the sour cream and heavy cream through the chili to serve.

Description: 
I altered a combination of two different recipes to come up with this chili. It's kind of like a mild green chili that's white with beans.
