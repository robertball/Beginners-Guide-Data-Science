Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 cup butter flavored shortening
2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
6 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Cream together eggs, butter, sugar and baking powder.  Stir in the flour.  Dough will be stiff.
Shape in walnut sized balls and flatten with the bottom of a glass.
Place on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 minutes.  If you brown them, you've overbaked them.  These may also be rolled out and cut with cookie cutters.
