Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) loaf French bread, cut into small cubes
1/4 cup butter
3 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and cut into small dice
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Raisens & nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 7x11-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Beat eggs, half-and-half, milk, white sugar, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl; add bread cubes and stir to coat. Let soak until bread is moist, at least 10 minutes.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir apples and brown sugar into the melted butter to moisten the sugar completely; add cinnamon and cook, stirring regularly, until the apples are warmed yet still firm, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir apple mixture into the bread mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until golden on top and still somewhat soft in the center, 35 to 45 minutes.
