Description: 
It was 1AM and all the stores were closed when my husband says you know, I would just love some home made white chocolate chip cookies. That would be awesome...  With no flour, eggs, or fresh milk, I must have been insane to try.  5 minutes of internet research and 20 minutes of mad cooking science later...imagine my surprise when my husband told me they were the best cookies he had ever eaten! - I'm sure this would be great with the standard flour, egg, and sweetened condensed milk, but wheres the fun in that?
