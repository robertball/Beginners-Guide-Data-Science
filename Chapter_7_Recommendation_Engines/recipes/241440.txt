Ingredients:
½ cup orzo pasta
½ cup light mayonnaise (such as Light Miracle Whip(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons light sour cream
½ cup orange juice
½ teaspoon curry powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained
2 cups cubed cooked chicken
2 stalks celery, diced
1  Fuji apple, cored and diced
1 cup seedless green grapes, halved
6 small green onions, minced
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
2 tablespoons shelled salted pumpkin seeds, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl; refrigerate until chilled.
Whisk mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, sour cream, orange juice, curry powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until dressing is smooth; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
Mix pineapple, chicken, celery, apple, grapes, and green onions together in a bowl. Stir orzo and dressing into pineapple mixture. Gently fold oranges into salad and top with pumpkin seeds.
