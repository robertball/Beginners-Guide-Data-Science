Ingredients:
2 1/4 tsp. (or 1 package) Active Dry Yeast
3  to 3 1/4 all-purpose flour
1 C. water
1/2 C. quick rolled oats
1/4 C. molasses
2 Tbl. butter
1 tsp. salt
1 egg

Directions:
In a large bowl combine 1 1/2 C. flour and yeast – set aside.
In saucepan, heat water, oats, molasses, butter & salt until warm (110º) and butter is almost melted. Add to flour mixture. Add egg.  Beat with mixer at low speed ½ minute scraping sides. Beat 3 minutes at high speed.  Stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can mix with a spoon.
Knead enough of remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball. Place in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease surface.
Cover and let rise in warm place until dough has doubled.
Punch down, turn onto light floured surface. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.
Grease  a 9x5x3 loaf pan.  Shape into loaf. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled. If desired brush with an egg wash and sprinkle additional rolled oats on top.
Bake at 375º for 40 to 45 minutes. Cover loosely with foil last 15 minutes to prevent over browning.
