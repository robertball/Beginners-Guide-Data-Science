Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/3 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 (19.8 ounce) package brownie mix
1 ripe banana, mashed
1/2 cup chopped walnuts, or to taste
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat eggs, water, and vegetable oil together in a large bowl until smooth; add brownie mix and stir until the mixture is a smooth batter. Beat mashed banana into batter; fold in walnuts. Pour batter into a 13x9-inch baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until set in the middle, about 23 minutes.
Cool brownies at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes before cutting into bars. Sprinkle confectioners' sugar over the brownies.

Description: 
I was wondering how to zest-up the traditional brownie recipe and, coincidentally, had a banana as well. If you're a banana-lover, you'll dig this recipe! The banana also moistens the brownie bars, so it's a win-win!
