Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) whole chicken
salt and pepper to taste
1 large lemon, sliced
6 cloves garlic, sliced
1/2 cup margarine, divided
1 stalk celery, leaves removed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place a large sheet of parchment paper into the middle of a roasting tray.  The parchment must be large enough to completely envelop the chicken.
Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.
Season the chicken with salt and pepper, stuff with half of the lemon slices, and place breast side up in the middle of the parchment paper.  Sprinkle garlic slices, and thyme sprigs evenly over the chicken.  Lay the remaining lemon slices over the breast.  Fold the parchment over the chicken forming a loose parcel.
Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken has cooked, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  A meat thermometer inserted into thickest part of the thigh should reach 180 degrees F.
Remove from heat, and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.
