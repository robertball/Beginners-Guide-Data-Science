Ingredients:
2 lbs. Ground beef
1 29 oz. can Tomato Sauce
1 29 oz. can Red Kidney Beans , with liquid
1 29 oz. can Pinto Beans , with liquid
1 c. Onion , diced
1/2 c. Diced Green Chili Pepper , 2 chilies
1/4 c. Diced Celery , 1 stalk
3 Medium Tomatoes , chopped
2 tsp. Cumin Powder
3 tbsp. Chili Powder
1 1/2 tsp. Black Pepper
2 tsp. Salt
2 c. Water

Directions:
Brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat; drain off the fat. Using a fork, crumble the cooked beef into pea-size pieces.
In a large pot, combine the beef plus all the remaining ingredients, and bring to a simmer over low heat.
Cook, stirring every 15 minutes, for 2 to 3 hours.
Tidbits For spicier chili, add 1/2 teaspoon more black pepper. For much spicier chili, add 1 teaspoon black pepper and a tablespoon cayenne pepper.
And for a real stomach stinger, add 5 or 6 sliced jalapeno peppers to the pot.
Leftovers can be frozen for several months.
