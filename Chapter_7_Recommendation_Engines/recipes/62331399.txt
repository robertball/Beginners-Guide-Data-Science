Ingredients:
3 cups diced turnips (about 3/8" squares)
1/4 C water
1 cube chicken bouillon
1 to 2 T butter
2 T sugar

Directions:
Simmer the diced turnips in a flat pan with the water and bouillon cube for about 15 minutes.
Once the water has evaporated and the turnips are tender, add the butter until melted. Once melted, on medium heat, add the sugar, stirring while cooking to carmelize the turnips. Carmelizing will take about 10 minutes.

Description: 
A great side dish with grilled duck. An astonishing way to add some zip to a vegetable I'm used to putting a soup pot.
