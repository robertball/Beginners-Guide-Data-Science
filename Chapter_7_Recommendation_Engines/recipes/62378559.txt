Ingredients:
3 cups sifted flour
1 1/2 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoon cold butter
1 1/2 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Mix dry ingredients in a bowl.  Cut in butter until crumbly.  Add buttermilk; mix until just moistened.  Knead lightly on floured surface.  Roll and cut as desired. (I like mine a little thicker at almost an inch!)  Place on ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.  Yield: 12 servings.

Description: 
I love this recipe because it reminds me of the biscuits my Dad from West Virginia used to make me when I was a little girl!  They're amazing with a pat of butter and jam!!
