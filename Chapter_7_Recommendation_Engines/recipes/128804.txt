Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons red curry paste
1 1/4 cups creamy peanut butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 tablespoon fish sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
3 (13.5 ounce) cans coconut milk

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until the aroma of the garlic has mellowed, about 1 minute. Add the red curry paste, and stir for 1 minute more. Whisk in the peanut butter, brown sugar, chili powder, cayenne pepper, fish sauce, sesame oil, and coconut milk. Bring to a simmer, whisking occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and is smooth.

Description: 
I received a basic thai peanut sauce recipe from a very kind friend back in Oregon who worked at a popular Thai restaurant there and modified it with my own taste. Made this a lot of times and always got rave reviews, try it and you won't regret it!
