3 tubes refrigerator crescent rolls - Lite Crescent Rolls may be used

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place ground turkey, onion, and Montreal Steak Seasoning in skillet, over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until meat is cooked through. Drain, if needed.
Stir in dill pickle relish, ketchup**, mustard**, grated cheese, and bacon bits.
Unroll crescent rolls, and cut each triangle in half.***
Place a heaping tsp of the meat filling on each triangle, folding the corners of the triangle to the middle, like a diaper. Place on parchment covered baking sheet.
