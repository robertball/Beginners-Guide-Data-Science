Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix (such as Pillsbury®)
1 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (10 ounce) jar raspberry preserves
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed
1 (3.5 ounce) package sweetened flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix cake mix, water, oil, and eggs together in a bowl until batter is smooth; beat with an electric mixer for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 34 to 38 minutes. Poke holes into the cake using the handle of a clean wooden spoon.
Drizzle sweetened condensed milk over the top of the warm cake, ensuring the holes get filled. Refrigerate cake until cool, about 1 hour.
Spread raspberry preserves over cooled cake; refrigerate until cool, about 10 minutes.
Spread whipped topping over raspberry preserves layer and sprinkle coconut over the top.
