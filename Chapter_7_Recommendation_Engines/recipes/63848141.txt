Ingredients:
1 pound veal
1 pound beef
1 pound pork
2 large eggs
Black pepper and kosher salt, to taste
1 tbsp. garlic powder
2 cups finely chopped fresh Italian parsley
2 cups Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
1 cup Italian-style Progresso breadcrumbs
1 loaf of day-old Italian bread
2 cups of warm water
Vegetable oil

Directions:
1. Mix the ground meat together in a bowl.
2. Crack two large eggs into another bowl and whisk them together. Pour the eggs into the meat mixture.
3. Add the pepper, salt, garlic powder, parsley, cheese and bread crumbs.
4. Get a loaf of day-old Italian bread and break it into small pieces. Soak the bread in warm water until it's soft, and then squeeze all the water out. Add the bread to the meat mixture and mix everything together.
5. Roll the meat into 4 ounce balls, or whatever size you like. One of my grandmothers made hers big, the other one made hers small.
6. Fill a deep pan half-way with vegetable oil and make sure the oil is hot before adding the meatballs. To test the oil, take a small piece of meat from the meatball and throw it in the oil. If the meat begins to fry, it's ready to go.
7. Working in batches, brown the meatballs for three minutes on one side and then three minutes on the other side. Remove and serve with a salad of Romaine, cucumber, red onion, cherry tomatoes, imported Italian wine vinegar, EVOO and ricotta.
