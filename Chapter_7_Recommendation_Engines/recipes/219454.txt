Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) pork tenderloin
2 cups onion, sliced
1/2 cup water
3/4 cup red wine
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons minced garlic
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place pork tenderloin in a slow cooker with sliced onions.  Pour water, wine, and soy sauce over top, turning pork to coat.  Spread garlic over the pork, leaving as much on top of roast as possible.  Sprinkle with pepper.  Cover and cook on Low setting, until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Serve with cooking liquid on the side as au jus.

Description: 
This pork tenderloin soaks up the yummy juices as it cooks.  And the juices are healthier in this version of the recipe because we replaced the dry onion soup mix with fresh ingredients.
