Ingredients:
6-8 Medium potatoes, peeled & sliced thin*
6 tablespoons flour
6 tablespoons butter
3 cups milk
2 cups shredded Colby/Jack cheese
1 package "Real" bacon crumbles
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground mustard
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Place sliced potatoes in pot with salted water on high heat; as soon as they reach a boil turn off heat and let sit in water for 5 minutes; carefully pour into a colander, rinse with cold water, let Drain drain while you make the sauce.
Make a roux by whisking the butter and flour in a saucepan on med/low heat for about 5 minutes.  Don't let it burn.  Add the milk a little at a time, whisking until the milk and the roux are completely blended.  Add the seasonings and continue to whisk until sauce has thickened, turn off heat.
In a buttered baking dish layer half of the potatoes, then half of the sauce, half of the bacon and half of the cheese.  Repeat for the 2nd layer.
Cover with foil and bake at 375 degrees for 45-50 minutes or until potatoes are tender then remove foil and bake another 10-15 minutes for a lightly brown and crispy top.
