Ingredients:
1 pound extra-lean ground round
1 (14.5 ounce) can zesty diced tomatoes, undrained
1 1/2 teaspoons jarred minced garlic
1 teaspoon Caribbean jerk seasoning
2 large unpeeled baking potatoes, such as russets (8 to 10 ounces each)
Salt and pepper
Caribbean jerk seasoning
Topping:
1/2 cup plain yogurt
3/4 teaspoon jarred minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon Caribbean jerk seasoning

Directions:
Brown ground beef in large nonstick skillet over medium heat 8 to 10 minutes or until beef is not pink, breaking up into small crumbles.  Pour off drippings.  Reserve 1 tablespoon diced tomatoes.  Add remaining tomatoes with liquid, 1-1/2 teaspoons garlic and 1 teaspoon jerk seasoning to beef; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat; cover and simmer 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Uncover skillet; continue simmering 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Season with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile cut potatoes lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices; pierce in several places with a fork.  Dip in cold water; sprinkle lightly with salt, pepper and jerk seasoning.  Place in single layer on nonstick baking pan.  Broil 3 to 6 inches from heat 10 to 12 minutes or until tender and lightly browned, turning once.
Combine topping ingredients and reserved 1 tablespoon tomatoes in small bowl; season with salt and pepper.  Spoon beef mixture over potatoes.  Serve with topping.
