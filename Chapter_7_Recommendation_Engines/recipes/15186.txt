Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup melted butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
3 tablespoons cold water
2 cups ricotta cheese
1 cup white sugar

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the eggs, sugar, melted butter and oil. Stir in the flour, baking soda and cinnamon. Then add the cold water and vinegar. Mix well until smooth.
Preheat the pizzelle iron. Drop the cannoli batter 1 tablespoon at a time onto the iron, close the lid and bake for 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully remove cookies and roll on the cooking cylinders while they are hot. Allow them to cool and remove from the cylinder. Fill when all of the shells have been baked and cooled.
In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, sugar and vanilla  until smooth. Fold in the chocolate chips and cherries (if desired). Use a pastry bag to pipe the filling into the shells.
