Description: 
This paleo omelet tastes great. It's easy to make and you can freeze the leftover muffins to reheat on the go for a quick breakfast. This recipe can also be infinitely modified by substituting different meats or veggies. Just make sure the meats are pre-cooked and the veggies are cut small enough to cook thoroughly within the 25 minute time frame.
