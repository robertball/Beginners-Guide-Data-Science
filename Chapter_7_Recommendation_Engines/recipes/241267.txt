Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix (such as Betty Crocker®)
1/2 cup butter, melted
3 eggs
1/2 cup lime margarita mix (such as Jose Cuervo®)
1 egg yolk
3/4 cup lemon-lime soda
1 1/2 (1.5 fluid ounce) jiggers tequila (such as Jose Cuervo®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line muffin cups with paper liners.
Mix cake mix and butter together in a large bowl; add eggs, margarita mix, and egg yolks and stir just until combined. Pour lemon-lime soda into batter and stir until foam is dissolved. Stir tequila into the batter. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
