Ingredients:
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 (16 ounce) can jellied cranberry sauce
2 teaspoons red curry powder
1 jalapeno pepper, minced
1 (14 ounce) package wonton wrappers
3 cups canola oil for frying
1/4 cup green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
Mix the cream cheese, cranberry sauce, curry powder, and jalapeno peppers in a bowl until slightly lumpy. Lay a few wonton wrappers at a time out on a clean surface. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture onto the center of each one. Pinch the corners together to make a triangle shape. If they don't stick, wet them with a little water using your finger. Set aside on a piece of waxed paper while you assemble the remaining puffs.
Heat oil in a large skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cook the wontons a few at a time in the hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with green onions to serve.

Description: 
A more simple version of an already wonderful recipe. Sweet and spicy blended together for a fast and tasty snack! I recommend serving this with a red chili Asian dipping sauce. Yum! Also note that if you want a less spicy version, feel free to seed your jalapeno, choose to omit the jalapeno or curry powder, or both.
