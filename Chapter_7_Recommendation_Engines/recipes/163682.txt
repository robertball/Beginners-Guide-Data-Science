Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1/4 teaspoon cayenne hot pepper sauce, or to taste (optional)
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (8 ounce) package imitation crabmeat, flaked
1/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1 (8 ounce) package crimini mushrooms, stems removed

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch baking dish.
Stir the cream cheese, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, seafood seasoning, Cajun seasoning, hot pepper sauce, and garlic powder in a mixing bowl until smooth. Stir in the crabmeat and bread crumbs until evenly blended. Spoon the cheese mixture into the mushroom caps; set them filling-side-up into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes; set the oven to broil and broil until the tops are crisp and brown, about 3 minutes.
