Ingredients:
1 stick butter (1/4lb.)
1 small bunch finely chopped green onions (4-5 with whites, discard roots)
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley (I use curly parsley)
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 pint (16oz.) half and half
4-5 slices  of Swiss cheese, chopped
1 Pound Fresh Crabmeat (claw meat is best)
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
salt to taste
black or white pepper to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons cooking sherry

Directions:
In a heavy pot or sauce pan, melt butter over medium heat.  Add green onions and parsley and cook 1-2 minutes.
Add flour, stirring constantly with wooden spoon or wire whisk so lumps donâ€™t form.
Cook for 1 minute.
Lower fire to medium-low and add half and half.  Stirring frequently, cook until simmering and flour has reached its full thickening potential(about 3-5 minutes).
Add cheese, sherry and spices, mix until cheese is melted and everything is well blended.
Remove from heat and fold in crabmeat and serve warm.
Tastes best if made 4 to 24 hours in advance and gently reheated.  Can be served in chafing dish or serve warm in desired vessel with buttery crackers, like Ritz or Townhouse.  (DO NOT USE IMITATION CRAB)Enjoy!!

Description: 
Everyone seems to use my submitted Cajun Crabmeat Au Gratin as a dip, so here is the crab dip we eat down in Louisiana. I have made it for years and it is sure to be a hit at every party.
