Description: 
Homemade meatloaf with a yummy sweet twist. I didn't have any breadcrumbs for the traditional meatloaf, so I searched my cabinets and came up with this meatloaf. It was a huge hit with the kids. It's sweet but still a meatloaf. The cornmeal and brown sugar just made it out of this world! Also, once cooked, they are very easy to store and pack up for leftovers. Serve with some smashed potatoes and green beans.
