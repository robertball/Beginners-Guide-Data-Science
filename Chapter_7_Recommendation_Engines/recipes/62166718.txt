Ingredients:
1 1/4 ice cold club soda
1 1/4 c tempura mix
2 c Japanese Panko breadcrumbs
1 lb codfish, haddock, or other mild, white fleshed fish
1 tsp kosher salt or to taste
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
Oil for deep frying

Directions:
Pour the club soda into a bowl.
Sprinkle the tempura mix over the top and whisk to combine.
Batter should be lumpy, and slightly thin.
Rinse the fish, pat dry, and cut into manageable pieces.
Put the panko into a pieplate and season with the salt and pepper.
Preheat the oil to 350 degrees.
Dip the fish into the tempura batter, then coat with the panko crumbs. Drop into the oil and fry until golden brown. Allow to drain on a rack placed over a sheet pan.

Description: 
The thin tempura batter and panko coating make a nice crispy crust for deep fried fish that doesn't get greasy or too browned before the fish is done.
