Ingredients:
1 pkg frozen puff pastry, thawed, but chilled in the fridge
1 pkg shredded Italian or Pizza cheese
1 jar pasta sauce, or 6 plum tomatoes, sliced into rounds
1.5 tbsp butter
1 heaping tsp garlic powder
1 tbsp Parmesan cheese
Any other pizza toppings you enjoy

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Gather all of your ingredients and your cookie sheet. You'll have to work fast once the puff pastry is out of the fridge.
Melt the butter and add the garlic powder and Parmesan cheese to it.
Remove the puff pastry from the fridge, and very gently unfold one sheet onto your counter or cutting board. It's ok if it cracks, you can just press it together again. Place the second sheet back in the fridge, wrapped in plastic wrap.
Slice the sheet into six squares. Place them on your cookie sheet, about 1 1/2 - 2 inches apart.
Brush some of the garlic-butter on the edges of all the squares, making a border. In the middle add a spoonful of sauce, or several fresh tomato slices. Top with the cheese and any other toppings you have.
Place in the oven for 15 minutes. Repeat with the next sheet.

My daughter loves these puff pastry pizzas. You can use them as a meal, or as an appetizer. The best part is, you can add whatever you want to make it special.
