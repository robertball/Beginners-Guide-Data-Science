Description: 
My sister was kind enough to share this wonderful marinade. It tastes better than just teriyaki sauce. This marinade sauce is awesome. The perfect marinade. To use the marinade, pierce up to 4 pounds of chicken pieces all over with a fork and marinade 2 hours before cooking as desired.
