Directions:
Cook bacon nice and crispy.  Cool on paper towel, crumble and set aside.
Cut potatoes in half inch chunks.  Place in large pot and cover with cool water.  Add garlic to potatoes and water.  Bring slowly to a boil.  When potatoes are fork tender remove from heat.  Strain potatoes in a colander and rinse with cold water.  You may even add ice to cool the potatoes faster.
In a large bowl mix together vinegar, mayonnaise, sour cream, salt, pepper, 1/2 the green onions, bleu cheese, bacon, and dill weed.  Add potatoes and stir together gently until potatoes are covered.
Top with the rest of the green onions.
