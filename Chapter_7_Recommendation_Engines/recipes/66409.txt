Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups fresh pearl onions
2 cups fresh or frozen peas
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon margarine or butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Fill a saucepan with water, and bring to a boil. Cook pearl onions in boiling water for 3 minutes, drain, and rinse in cold water. Peel onions, and remove the ends.
Place onions with peas in the saucepan, and fill with enough water to just cover the vegetables.  Simmer until tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, and place vegetables in a bowl.
Melt margarine in the saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour in cream, and season with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Bring to a boil; cook until thick, stirring constantly.  Stir peas and onions into the sauce to coat. Serve immediately.
