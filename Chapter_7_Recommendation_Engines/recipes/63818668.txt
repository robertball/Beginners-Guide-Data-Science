Ingredients:
4 Lbs. pork roast (any kind will do)
Seasoning for pork (see note below)
1  28 oz. can of diced tomatoes
½ Can of uncooked long grain rice
¼ tsp. dry mustard
1 tsp. low salt soya sauce
2 good dashes of Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Season Pork roast as you would normally.  I enjoy using pepper and dry mustard.
Place roast in a large roasting pan with about 1 to 2 inches of water.   Cover and cook for about 1 hour at 350 degrees.
In a large mixing bowl add diced tomatoes (including juice), rice (I use the now empty can of stew tomatoes to meaure the rice), mustard, soya sauce and Worcestershire sauce and mix together.
Remove roast from the roasting pan.   Also remove trivet if you are using.
Add rice mixture to the pan and mix with juice already in the bottom.
Place Pork Roast on top of the rice and continue cooking for about 1 more hour or until pork reaches an internal temp of 165 to 170 degrees and rice is cooked.
Part way through cooking remove roast from pan and give the rice a quick stir.  If there is not enough liquid add some water and return roast to the pan and continue cooking
