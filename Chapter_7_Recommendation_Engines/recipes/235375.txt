Description: 
This recipe is an adaptation to southern pulled pork sandwiches, but it's made with chicken instead. It is made with only a few ingredients in the slow cooker so you will be surprised just how good it tastes. I've been making this for years and EVERYONE loves it, I am always asked for the recipe. You will be amazed at how good this is so you have to try it.
