Ingredients:
3 tablespoons chia seeds
1 1/2 cups warm water
1/2 cup sucanat
1/4 cup agave nectar
1 1/2 cups cornmeal
1 cup spelt flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups frozen corn kernels

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.
Soak chia seeds in warm water in a bowl for 5 minutes; drain.
Blend chia seeds in a blender until smooth; add sucanat and agave nectar. Blend the mixture again until smooth.
Sift cornmeal, spelt flour, baking powder, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Add frozen corn kernels and chia seed mixture to the cornmeal mixture; stir and pour into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
