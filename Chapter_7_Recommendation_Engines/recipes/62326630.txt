Ingredients:
2 T. Fennel Seeds
2 t. Dried Rosemary
1 t. Dried Thyme leaves
1 t. Whole Black Peppercorns
3 t. Coarse Sea Salt
5 T. Minced Garlic
2 T. Ouzo
1 Boston Pork Butt (about 8 lbs.)
2 Large Onions, peeled and sliced thickly
1 Fennel Bulb, sliced thickly (optional)

Directions:
Preheat a saucepan to medium-high heat, and the oven to 325.  Add the Fennel See, Rosemary, Thyme, and Peppercorns.  Roast until a strong smell comes of them and lightly browned.  DO NOT LET THE SPICES BURN!
Place the toasted spices, Salt, Garlic, and Ouzo in either a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, and grind to a paste.
Score the fat on the pork butt, and rub the paste evenly over the entire roast.
In the bottom of a roasting pan, place the onions and fennel (if using), with just enough water to cover.  Place the butt on top.
Roast in oven, uncovered, fat cap up, for 40 minutes per pound, or until meat thermometer reads 185.

Description: 
I have often served a fennel salad with a pork chop, and decided: let's kick it up a notch.  Thus the birth of this dish.
