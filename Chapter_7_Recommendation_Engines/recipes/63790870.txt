Ingredients:
1 cup Self-rising Corn Meal
1 cup Buttermilk
little water
Bacon Grease (about a 1/2 tablespoon)
1 seasoned cast iron skillet

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  On the stove top, turn burner on medium high.  Place iron skillet on burner, add bacon grease, enough to coat bottom of skillet.
In a bowl, add corn meal and buttermilk, stir together.  add water to thin out mixture just so the meal runs off the spoon smoothly, not clumpy. Add to hot skillet.
Once bubbles start to form in the middle of skillet, place in oven in bottom, close to  heat source.  Keep watch.  When edges of bread start to separate from the skillet and turn brown and the mixture no longer jiggles in the center, move skillet to top and turn oven to BROIL.
Keep watch until bread browns to your satisfaction.  Remove from oven, turn skillet over, corn bread should pop out without a problem if skillet is properly seasoned.  Cut and serve immediately.
