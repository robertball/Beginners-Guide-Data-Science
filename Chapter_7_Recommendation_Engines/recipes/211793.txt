Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 tablespoon ground allspice
1 tablespoon paprika
salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1 potato, finely chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough
1/4 cup melted butter

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Brown ground beef in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain fat; stir in allspice, paprika, salt, and pepper. Transfer beef to a large bowl and stir in potato and onion.
Unroll phyllo pastry and transfer 2 sheets to a work surface; stack sheets. Spoon 1/8th of the ground beef mixture down one long edge of the phyllo pastry. Roll phyllo into a tube, encasing beef. Shape the tube into a coil (snail shape). Place the roll on an ungreased baking sheet; brush with melted butter. Repeat, placing finished rolls up against one another to keep them from unrolling.
Bake burek in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
