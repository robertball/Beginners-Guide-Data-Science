Ingredients:
3 medium ripe avacados
6 strips thick-sliced smoked bacon
1/4 cup diced white/sweet onion
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 tbsp lemon juice (Bottled is fine.)
1/2 cup chilled cucumber ranch salad dressing
1/3 cup shredded mild cheddar cheese
4 leaves of romaine lettuce
3/4 cup finely crumbled corn chips (optional)

Directions:
Cook bacon over medium-high heat in pan without throughly crisping it and turning once during cooking.  Cool on wire rack, cut or tear into pieces, and set aside.
While bacon is cooling, carefully remove avocados from skins and cut into chunks after removing pits. Gently toss with bacon, onions, salt, pepper, lemon juice, salad dressing, and shredded cheese in medium size bowl until evenly coated.
Place equal portions of mixture onto leaves of lettuce on four individual serving plates.  Garnish with crumbled corn chips if desired.

Description: 
I was tinkering with a few things I got on sale at your average garden variety grocery store one night and have refined it a bit.  This sweet, but savory, light yet hearty dish was the result.  It makes a great appetizer and its looks will impress your family and guests who enjoy complex, unexpected flavors.
