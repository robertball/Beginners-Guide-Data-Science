Description: 
This recipes brings back wonderful childhood memories. My grandma would make this all the time for my dad and I. It was and is still our favorite meal. This is a very simple inexpensive soup to make, but it is heaven to eat. My great grandma used to make this for my grandma during the depression and she passed it down. Now I'm passing it down to you. Enjoy!
