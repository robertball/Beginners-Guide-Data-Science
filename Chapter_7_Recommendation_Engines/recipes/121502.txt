Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1/3 cup sugar
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup finely ground almonds
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Combine flour, almonds and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or until easy to handle. Divide dough into fourths. Roll out each portion into a long rope, about 1/4 in. diameter. Cut into 2-in. lengths. Place 2 in. apart on lightly greased baking sheets; form each into a crescent. Bake at 325 degrees F for 14-16 minutes or until set. Cool for 2 minutes. Combine confectioners' sugar and cinnamon; dip warm cookies in sugar mixture. Place on wire racks to cool.
