Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste
2 pounds beef stew meat, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
1 onion, diced
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup red wine
1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (16 ounce) can red chili beans in sauce
1 (15.5 ounce) can small white beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 pinch ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Heat enough olive oil in a large pot to cover the bottom of the pot over high heat; sear beef in hot oil in batches until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes per batch. Remove browned beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl between batches.
Pour some olive oil into the pot with the browned bits of beef on the bottom; heat until shimmering. Saute onion and garlic in the hot oil until beginning to brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour red wine into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until the wine reduces slightly in volume, about 5 minutes.
Pour tomato sauce, chili beans with sauce, white beans, black beans, and kidney beans into the pot; stir. Bring the mixture to a simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. Stir sea salt, cumin, black pepper, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, sugar, garlic powder, coriander, paprika, cinnamon, and nutmeg into the beef mixture. Cook until the beef is very tender, 2 to 3 hours.
