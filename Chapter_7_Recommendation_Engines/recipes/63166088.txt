Ingredients:
4 medium size russet potatoes, peeled
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 cup water, or as needed
1 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Slice potatoes into French fries, and place into cold water so they won't turn brown while you prepare the oil.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. While the oil is heating, sift the flour, garlic salt, onion salt, (regular) salt, and paprika into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water so that the mixture can be drizzled from a spoon.
Dip potato slices into the batter one at a time, and place in the hot oil so they are not touching at first. The fries must be placed into the skillet one at a time, or they will clump together.  Fry until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper  towels.

Description: 
My family loves French fries and with 4 children the bag fries from the store just weren't enough and became too expensive.  So I tried batter - after all it makes chicken, shrimp, and onion rings crispy so why not potatoes.  Now even my husband can't get enough of these French fries.  They even stay crispy when you reheat in the microwave.Modified from: Homemade Crispy Seasoned French Fries
