Ingredients:
2 cups ginger ale
1 teaspoon butter
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Place the ginger ale in a 2-cup microwave-safe measuring cup, and microwave on high until the soda is hot but not boiling, 1 to 2 minutes. Gently stir in the butter to melt, then stir in the brown sugar and cinnamon. Don't stir too vigorously to avoid the soda fizzing up. Pour the drink into mugs, and serve.

Description: 
This is a slightly different take on the Harry Potter-style Butterbeer recipes you find out there. It is not as cloyingly sweet as most, has no milk or alcohol, and can be very addictive, according to my son.
