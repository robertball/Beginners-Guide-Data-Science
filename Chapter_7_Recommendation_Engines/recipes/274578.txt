Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup brown rice flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
1 cup mashed ripe bananas
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup sweetened flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray and set aside.
Whisk all-purpose flour, brown rice flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl.
Combine sugar, butter, and eggs in a stand mixer bowl. Beat on medium speed until smooth. Add bananas, sour cream, and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth. Add in flour mixture gradually, in 3 additions. Fold in chocolate chips and coconut; batter will be quite thick.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean and edges are golden, 15 to 17 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before transferring muffins to a wire rack to cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes more.
