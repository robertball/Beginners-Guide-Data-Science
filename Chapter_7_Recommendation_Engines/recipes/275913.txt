Description: 
Family favorite grilled chicken. Sweet apple cider taste with a little spice. One of the best things about our time in Texas was learning to grill great food like this. After the first time you make this recipe, everyone will know when you are making it just by the delicious smoke smell from cooking. This goes great with long grain and wild rice and corn on the cob.
