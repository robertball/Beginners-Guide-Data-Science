Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
1 small can tomato paste
1/2 cup catsup
1/3 cup white vinegar
1/4 cup molasses
2 tbs sugar
3 tsp onion powder
3 tsp chili powder
2 tsp worcestershire sauce
1 tsp liquid smoke (I use hickory)
1 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp dry rub (I use my own mix), optional
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1/2 tsp Louisiana Green hot sauce (or hot sauce), optional
1/2 tsp instant coffee granules
1/4 tsp ground cumin
1/8 tsp garlic powder

Directions:
Combine all ingredients "EXCEPT THE WATER" in a medium sauce pan and stir until blended.
Gradually stir in the water until well combined.
Cook over high heat stirring constantly until the sauce starts to boil.
Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency, stirring occasionally; about 25 minutes.
When the sauce is thickened, pour it into jars and cool it in your refrigerator until you're ready to use it.
This is a good recipe for canning.

Description: 
This is a homemade BBQ sauce that is slightly sweet and spicy. I've developed this recipe over the years and I think it's finally perfect. You can make it with what you have in the pantry.
