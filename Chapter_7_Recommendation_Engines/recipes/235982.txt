Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch wedges
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon Mexican-style seasoning blend
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
1/4 cup rinsed and drained canned black beans
1/4 cup diced tomatoes
1/4 cup sliced black olives
1/4 cup sliced green onions
3 tablespoons canned chopped green chiles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Combine potatoes, oil, Mexican seasoning, and garlic salt together in a bowl; stir to coat potatoes completely. Spread potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are crisp and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
Transfer potatoes to a plate and top with Mexican cheese blend, black beans, diced tomatoes, black olives, green onions, and green chiles.
