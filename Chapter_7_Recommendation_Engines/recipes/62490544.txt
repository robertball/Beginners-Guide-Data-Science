Ingredients:
1 teaspoon unsalted butter
1 pound green beans, trimmed
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1-1/2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
salt and fresh ground pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat butter in a large skillet over medium high heat and add green beans, saute until seared in spots, about 3 minutes.
Add water, reduce heat to medium and cover. Cook until just tender, 3 to 6 minutes.
Drain any remaining water, return to heat and push beans to the outside of the skillet. Add the oil and garlic and let cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Add tomatoes and combine, cooking until the tomatoes begin to break down, about 3 minutes.
Add vinegar, salt and pepper and serve.
