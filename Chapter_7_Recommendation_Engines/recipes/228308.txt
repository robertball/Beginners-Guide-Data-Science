Ingredients:
1 quart strawberries, sliced
1 cup white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup vegetable shortening
1 1/2 cups milk
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 cup whipped cream

Directions:
Mix strawberries and 1 cup sugar in a bowl and allow to stand while you complete remaining steps. Stir occasionally to help juice form.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch round baking pan.
Combine flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; cut in shortening with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir milk into crumb mixture until just blended; pour into prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes; cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing shortcake.
Split shortcake into two layers; spread bottom layer with 2 tablespoons softened butter and top with strawberries and juice. Place top layer over strawberries. Serve with whipped cream.
