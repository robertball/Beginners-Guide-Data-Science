Ingredients:
1 cup old-fashioned oats
1 cup water
1/2 cup milk (1% works well)
2 tablespoons brown sugar, packed
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine oats, water, milk, brown sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Stir. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, 5-10 minutes, until the oatmeal reaches desired consistency. Stir the peanut butter in during the last minute or so, until completely dissolved. Serve right away.
