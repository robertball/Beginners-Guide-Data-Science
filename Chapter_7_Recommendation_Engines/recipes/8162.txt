Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup white sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling
6 ounces semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter and flour a bundt pan or 10-inch tube pan.
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, oil, eggs, vanilla, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Mix well. Stir in the cherries and their liquid and the chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake for about 1 hour, until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on rack and remove from the pan to cool completely.
