Ingredients:
1/2 cup chick pea flour
1/2 cup dry non-fat powdered milk
1/2 cup cooked chicken, cut into small pieces
1 tablespoon cod liver oil
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees F. Grease cookie sheet with cooking spray.
Cut the chicken into small pieces in a large bowl.
Mix the powdered milk and the chickpea flour into the chicken.
In another bowl, combine the wet ingredients with the egg. Mix them together with a fork.
Pour the wet ingredients into the chicken mixture and combine well with your hands.
Shape the mixture into small balls with your hands and flatten them on the greased cookie sheet.
Cook for about 8 minutes, then turn the treats over and cook for approximately 10 more minutes, until they are nicely browned. Remember not to feed them to your cat until they have completely cooled. You can freeze these treats and bring them out for your kitty as needed.
