3/4 cup water
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 (21 ounce) can LUCKY LEAFÂ® Premium Peach Fruit Filling

Directions:
For the sauce: In a medium saucepan combine granulated sugar, brown sugar, water, and butter. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in almond extract.
Meanwhile, spoon pie filling over half of each tortilla. Roll up and place seam sides down in a 2-quart rectangular baking dish. Pour sauce over assembled enchiladas and let stand at room temperature for 45 to 60 minutes.
Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 25 minutes. Serve each enchilada with sauce in a shallow dessert bowl topped with a scoop of ice cream and a fresh mint sprig.
