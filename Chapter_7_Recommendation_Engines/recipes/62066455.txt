Ingredients:
3 pkg. Crescent Rolls
3 pkg. cream cheese
3 cups sugar (separated)
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla
2 tsp. cinnamon
1 1/2 stick butter or margarine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Roll out 1 1/2 pkg. crescent rolls into a 11x13 pan.  Press together to form a "crust".  Mix together until creamy:  3 pkg. cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Spread mixture over crescent rolls.  Roll the other 1/2 of the crescent rolls over the mixture (this does not have to cover the mixture perfectly).  Mix together 1 1/2 cups sugar, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 1/2 stick butter or margarine.  Spread over the second crescent roll layer.  Bake for 30-35 minutes.

My Mom makes this for work parties.  I used it recently when I brought breakfast to everyone at work one day and it went FAST!  Everyone asks me when I'm bringing it again and several people wanted to recipe!
