Ingredients:
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 pounds rib tips
1 tablespoon BBQ rub
1/4 cup apple juice
1 cup barbeque sauce

Directions:
Preheat an electric smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Sprinkle salt over rib tips. Add BBQ rub and massage into rib tips to evenly coat.
Place rib tips on the preheated smoker and smoke for 1 1/2 hours, spritzing with apple juice throughout the cook time.
Transfer rib tips to a baking sheet and add barbecue sauce. Stir to coat.
Return rib tips to the smoker and smoke for 30 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate and let rest 5 minutes.

Description: 
These tender and juicy rib tips almost steal the show from the ribs themselves. They are that good. They are super tender and done in a fraction of the time it takes to smoke the ribs. I like to use a combination of hickory and apple chips but feel free to use your wood of choice.
