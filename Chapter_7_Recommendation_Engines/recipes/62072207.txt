Ingredients:
1 can of frozen pink lemonade
8-10 large strawberries
1 can of water, add more to taste
1 tray of ice cubes

Directions:
Fill blender with berries and lemonade.  Add 1 can of water, and ice cubes.  Pulse in blender until ice cubes have broken up somewhat.  Grind until strawberries are are pureed.
This is a good foundation recipe for smoothies if your using different fruit juices.  Any juice and any fruit can be used.  I like to use one can of peaches with one can of o.j., one can of water, and one tray of ice.  We often add yogurt or banana to other smoothie recipes, especially bananas that need to be used. Frozen fruit also works very well.

Description: 
This is the best frozen lemonade I've ever had.  We've experimented with a number of recipes, but this deffinately beats even restaraunt strawberry lemonade.  Different berries can be used as well as other juices, such as orange, or pineapple for something more like a smoothie.
