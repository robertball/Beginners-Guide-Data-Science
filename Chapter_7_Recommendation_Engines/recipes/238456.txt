Ingredients:
1 cup dried mung beans
1/4 cup vegetable oil, or more as needed
1 green onion, sliced
1 Thai chile pepper, or more to taste, sliced (optional)
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Put mung beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water. Soak beans for 1 hour.
Drain mung beans and spread them out onto a flat surface. Pat gently with paper towel to blot some of the water; air-dry beans for 15 minutes.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beans in hot oil until evenly browned and crunchy, about 5 minutes. Drain beans and transfer to a mixing bowl; add chile pepper, green onion, and salt and stir to coat.

Description: 
This is Thai street food. A great way to use mung beans. I don't add chile peppers when I am making it for my children. This is a great snack. Easy, fast, and nutritious.
