Ingredients:
4-6 dried red chilies
2 small brown onions chopped
1 tsp 5 ml peppercorns (about 68)
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tbs ground coriander
2 tbs fresh cilantro, chopped (including stems and roots)
1 tsp salt
2 tsp finely chopped lemon or lime peel
1 tsp lemon grass powder
1 tsp ginger powder
1 tbs (2-3 cloves) garlic, chopped
2 tsp shrimp paste
1 tbs vegetable oil
1 tsp tumeric
2 tsp paprika

Directions:
In a small bowl pour some hot water and add the dried chilies to soak and soften them for about 8 minutes.  Next chop the onion, cilantro and lemon peel.  Drain the chilies and remove the stems.  (If you want the paste to be milder, remove the seeds from chilies).
In a blender add all of the ingredients.  Blend to a thick paste.  If it is too dry add a little water or more oil.
The paste will keep in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks and up to 2 months in the freezer.  Put into freezer bags by the amounts needed for recipes and freeze.  (1 to 2 scoops).
