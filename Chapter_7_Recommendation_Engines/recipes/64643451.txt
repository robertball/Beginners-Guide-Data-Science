Ingredients:
-- 2 tbsp onion powder-- 2 tbsp garlic powder-- Two 6 ounce cans tomato paste-- 2 tbsp paprika-- 2/3 cup cider vinegar-- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce--  cup packed dark brown sugar-- 2 tbsp honey-- 2 tbsp maple syrup-- 2 tbsp kosher salt-- 2 tbsp freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Combine all of the ingredients in a blender and pulse a couple of times to thoroughly combine. Pour the mixture into a medium saucepan and place over medium heat. Stir continuously until the sauce is heated through, but do no allow it to come to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat. -- Use the sauce immediately as you like, or, if reserving for a later use, allow the mixture to cool, then pour it into a large bottle or container and store, tightly covered and refrigerated for up to 1 year.
