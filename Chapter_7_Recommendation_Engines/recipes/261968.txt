Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
2 onions, chopped
1/2 tablespoon minced garlic
5 cups chicken broth
3 large red potatoes, chopped
8 carrots, sliced
1 (15.5 ounce) can corn, drained
6 stalks celery, sliced
1 cup frozen peas
1 cup frozen green beans
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
2 bay leaves
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine turkey and onions in a large stockpot over medium-high heat; cook until turkey is no longer pink and onions are translucent, about 6 minutes. Drain and discard fat. Add garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Pour chicken broth into the stockpot with the turkey and bring to a boil. Add potatoes, carrots, corn, celery, peas, green beans, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, basil, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Return to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until vegetables are soft, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
I was in the mood for a hearty, vegetable-heavy soup last night, and made this with ground turkey and red potatoes I had on hand. It came together quickly and the whole family loved it, so I thought I'd share the recipe. You could also make this in a slow cooker.
