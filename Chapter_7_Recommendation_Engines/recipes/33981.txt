Ingredients:
2 family size black tea bags
4 cups boiling water
2 lemons, thinly sliced
1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon almond extract
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (2 liter) bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage, chilled

Directions:
In a saucepan, brew tea bags in hot water for 15 minutes. While waiting for tea to brew, squeeze the lemon slices as you put them into a large pitcher. Pour in sugar.
Pour brewed tea into the pitcher with the sugar and lemons. You can let this sit in refrigerator for up to 1 day, or use it right away.  When ready to serve, stir in almond extract, vanilla extract and lemon lime soda.
