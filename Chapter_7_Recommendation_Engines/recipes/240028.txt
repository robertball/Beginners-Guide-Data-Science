Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened
1 cup finely chopped pistachio nuts
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 teaspoons meatless bacon and onion seasoning (such as Tastefully Simple® Bacon Bacon®)
8 jalapeno chile peppers, halved and seeded
16 slices packaged precooked bacon
16 toothpicks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Combine Neufchatel cheese, pistachio nuts, Cheddar cheese, and bacon seasoning in a bowl. Spoon cheese mixture into each jalapeno pepper half. Wrap each stuffed pepper with a bacon slice, securing with a toothpick. Arrange peppers on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp, about 30 minutes. Cool peppers for a few minutes before serving.

Description: 
Certain flavors have always meant to be together, like jalapenos and cream cheese. Or bacon and...well, almost anything. Pistachios, however, get forgotten too often! They are a contradiction in your mouth: creamy, smooth nutty flavor with a crunchy texture. At some point it occurred to me to try adding pistachios to stuffed jalapenos, and these delicious beauties were the result. I made two different versions since I'm lactose intolerant and my husband hates goat cheese. Both are delish!
