Ingredients:
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup sesame seeds
1 cup brown rice flour
1 1/4 cups rolled oats
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/8 cups unsweetened apple juice
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring 3/4 cup of water to boil and add the raisins.  When the water returns to a boil turn off the heat.  Let the raisins plump for at least 10 minutes. Drain the raisins well, then chop them coarsely.
Toast the sesame seeds by stirring them with a wooden spoon in a heavy saute pan over medium heat. Saute until the seeds begin to crackle, pop and smell toasted; about 10 minutes.
Combine rice flour, oats, salt and toasted sesame seeds. Stir apple juice, oil and vanilla into the flour mixture.
Form the dough into 8 large balls. Place each ball on greased cookie sheets or parchment paper. Moisten your fingers and flatten each ball until it is 1/2 inch thick.
Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool on pans before removing.
