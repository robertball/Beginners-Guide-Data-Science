Ingredients:
2 Tbsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1 tsp pepper
1 tsp paprika
2 lb chicken wings, split and tips discarded

Directions:
Whisk baking powder, salt, black pepper, and paprika together in a small bowl.  Place chicken wings in a large bowl, and sprinkle 1/2 of the baking powder mixture over the wings, tossing to coat.  Sprinkle remaining mixture over wings, and toss again.
Place the chicken wings in the air fryer basket which has been coated with cooking spray.  Turn on the air fryer and cook at 380º for 25 minutes, shaking the basket/stirring half way through the cooking cycle.  Turn the temperature up to 400º and cook for another 5 minutes.
Serve as is or coat the wings with your favorite sauce (like buffalo-style or Asian).

Description: 
This technique of coating the wings with a baking powder rub before cooking is from Chef John’s recipe for Crispy Honey Sriracha Chicken Wings on Allrecipes.  Coating the wings this way yields perfectly crisp, golden brown, and tender wings just waiting to be sauced to your preference.
