Ingredients:
2 eggs
2/3 cup sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1 pinch salt
1 cup all purpose flour
10 tablespoons melted butter (slightly cooled)
powdered sugar (to sprinkle on after baked)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a medium sized bowl mix eggs, sugar, salt, vanilla and butter together. Add flour slowly. Do not over mix! Fill greased madeleine pan molds with batter. Bake 12-16 minutes, until the cookies are just turning golden. Let cool 5 minutes, then remove from pan and sprinkle tops with powdered sugar. Enjoy!

Description: 
This is the best (and easiest!) madeleine recipe I've found yet, passed on by a family member who also loves to bake. These moist, cake-like cookies are good with coffee and fruit for breakfast or just as a sweet treat.
