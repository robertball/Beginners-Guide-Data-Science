Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup melted butter
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup diced apple
1 cup shredded carrot
2 tablespoons chia seeds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 16 muffin cups with liners.
Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
Beat buttermilk, melted butter, honey, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract in another bowl. Stir in flour mixture. Fold in apple, carrot, and chia seeds. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
Cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

Description: 
These moist muffins are a sneaky way to add veggies and fiber into my kid's diet. You can easily substitute other vegetables and fruit too. I've tried zucchini, pear, and banana!
