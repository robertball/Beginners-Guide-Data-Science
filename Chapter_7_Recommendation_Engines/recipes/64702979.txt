.25 cup Cocoa Powder
1.5 Cups Flour, All Purpose
.5 tsp Salt

2 tsp Cayenne Pepper
1 Tbsp Chili Powder

Directions:
Cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add melted chocolate, eggs, and vanilla and mix together until completely combined. Mix in chipotle pepper puree, cayenne pepper, and chili powder.
In a separate bowl, sift together the cocoa powder and flour. Add to the butter mixture just until incorporated.
