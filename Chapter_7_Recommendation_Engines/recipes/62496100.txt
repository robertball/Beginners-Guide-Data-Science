While the quinoa is cooking, mix together the minced garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, freshly ground pepper, tarragon, and mustard.

Add salt and pepper to taste (this recipe usually requires a lot of salt).
Serve and enjoy.

Description: 
This dish is a meal in itself-- it contains a healthy fat (olive oil), green vegetables (broccoli), a whole grain (quinoa), and a protein source (garbanzo beans)! It's also vegan and has a low glycemic index. I usually have this for breakfast or lunch.
