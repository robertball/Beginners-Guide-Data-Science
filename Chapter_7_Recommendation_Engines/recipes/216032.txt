Ingredients:
1 pound beef stew meat, cut into bite-size pieces
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme (optional)
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 1/2 cups apple cider
4 carrots, sliced
3 potatoes, chopped
2 small Fuji apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup water
1 stalk celery, chopped (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme

Directions:
Combine the beef stew meat with the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the black pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon thyme in a bowl; toss to coat evenly.
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a pot; cook the stew meat in the hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour the apple cider over the beef, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer the mixture until the beef is tender, about 1 hour.
Add the carrots, potatoes, apples, onion, water, celery, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon thyme to the pot; continue cooking at a simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.

Description: 
Inspired by my mother-in-law, this is a warm, sweet, fall favorite! I make this for my husband and I, so half saved for another meal. We've found that it tastes even better the second day!
