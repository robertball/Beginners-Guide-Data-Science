Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) package pork spareribs, rinsed and patted dry
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup water
1 cup sweet chili sauce

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season the spareribs with the salt and pepper. Pour the water into the bottom of a large baking dish and lay the spareribs in the dish; cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; pour about half the chili sauce over the meat, cover, and return to oven. Brush the ribs with more chili sauce every 5 minutes, and continue cooking until the meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 30 minutes more. Serve hot or cold.
