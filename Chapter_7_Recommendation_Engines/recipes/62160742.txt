Ingredients:
1 whole chicken
2 lbs breakfast sausage (tube kind)(sage is good)
1 cup celery
1 cup green/yellow/red/orange pepper
1 cup onion chopped
1 box brown and wild rice (or white)
salt & pepper to taste.
1 Tblsp Sage
1 cup chicken stock/bullion

Directions:
Cook the chicken (I boil it, it seems to stay juicier).  Cool, remove bones and cut into bite size pieces.
Brown sausage and set aside.
Saute vegetables until onion are just turning translucent.  Cook the rice according to the directions on the box.
Mix everything in a casserole dish or large non-sick pan.
If using the casserole dish add some of the chicken stock to keep moist and place in 350 degree oven until hot.
If using non-stick pan add some chicken stock and simmer until hot.
You may need to add additional chicken stock to keep it moist.
Serve.
