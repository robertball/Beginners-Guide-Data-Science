3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups solid shortening
1 large egg, beaten
5 tablespoons cold water

Combine pastry ingredients, mix and form into a ball and refrigerate overnight or at least 2 hours. Remove from refrigerator, roll on a flour covered pastry cloth and cut six 5" circles for each tart pan. Line each pan with pastry and set aside.
Preheat oven 400 degrees.
Prepare apple filling using:
2 cups apples (peeled & diced)
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons cornstarch

1/4 cup white granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

In a bowl combine diced apples and lemon juice, stir and set aside.  Combine cornstarch, brown sugar, white sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon and add to diced apple mixture. Stir and add vanilla extract.  Fill each pastry shell with 2 Tablespoons of apple mixture, top with a small slice of butter and cover with pastry cutouts. I used leaf cutouts.  Place on thin cookie sheet and bake at 400 degrees for 18-24 minutes or until light golden brown.
