Ingredients:
3 ribs celery, sliced
2 carrots, sliced
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, smashed
5 lbs. beef short ribs
salt and pepper to taste
1 (10.5) can Campbell's beef consomme
1/2 can water

Directions:
Coat a 6 quart slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. Place the celery, carrots, onion and garlic in the bottom of the cooker.
Season the short ribs with salt and pepper. In a skillet, brown the ribs on all sides. Place the ribs on top of the vegetables in the slow cooker. Add the beef broth and water.
Cover and cook on HIGH until the ribs are fork tender, about 5-7 hours. Using a slotted spoon, remove the ribs from the slow cooker. Strain the broth in the slow cooker and discard the vegetables.
To make shredded beef, remove and discard the bones. Using 2 forks, shred the meat. Put the meat in a hoagie roll and serve with the reserved broth for dipping. Or, moisten with your favorite barbecue sauce and serve on a toasted bun.
