Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 (6 inch) celery rib, finely chopped
1 small clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1/4 cup half-and-half cream
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1 pinch dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup fresh shucked oysters, undrained
1 pinch ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed skillet or wok over medium-high heat; cook and stir the celery and garlic in the butter until the celery is soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the flour and stir, scraping the bottom of pan until flour is lightly toasted. Slowly add the milk and half-and-half to the roux, stirring constantly. Stir the onion powder, parsley, and salt into the mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking and stirring until the mixture bubbles and thickens, 5 to 7 minutes.
Add the oysters with the liquid from the container to the mixture; cook until the edges of the oysters curl, about 5 minutes more. Season with pepper just before serving.

Description: 
Wonderful main meal stew using 8-ounce container of oysters. Good served with toasted and buttered thick sliced bread and simple fruit, such as canned peaches.  If stew is too thick, thin with a little more milk. If your oysters are large, they may be cut after cooking into smaller pieces.
