Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh spinach
1 pinch salt
1/2 onion, finely chopped
3 eggs, or more to taste
1/2 cup natto
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil; add salt. Add spinach and cook until tender, about 1 minute. Drain and cut into 1-inch strips.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Combine eggs and natto in a bowl until natto is evenly distributed.
Heat oil in a nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Add egg mixture and cook until nearly set, 3 to 5 minutes. Add cooked spinach and onion. Flip the omelette and finish cooking until fully set, about 2 minutes more.

Description: 
Natto is a Japanese delicacy made from fermenting soybeans and has a savory and unique flavor. Once you try natto, you will be hooked. 

It is like eating baked beans, but with a much stickier source. Cooked in eggs, its a great way to enjoy what I consider to be the best way to serve beans. You can always make this into scrambled eggs and get more colors in your dish.
