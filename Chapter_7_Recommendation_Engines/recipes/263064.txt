Ingredients:
Dressing:
2 teaspoons seeded and minced jalapeno pepper
1 clove garlic
3/4 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1/3 cup lime juice
1/4 cup packed cilantro leaves
2 tablespoons honey
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Salad:
1 pound flat iron steak
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup corn kernels
1 cup chopped yellow bell pepper
1/2 cup thinly sliced red onion
1 plum tomato, diced
1/2 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced (optional)
8 cups torn romaine lettuce
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1 cup tortilla chips, or to taste

Directions:
To make the dressing, blend jalapeno, garlic, and ginger in a blender until finely chopped. Add lime juice, cilantro, honey, balsamic, and salt; pulse to blend. With blender running, drizzle in oil until well incorporated.
Preheat oven broiler. Season steak with salt and black pepper, then transfer to a foil-lined baking sheet.
Broil 4 inches from heat until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 135 degrees F (57 degrees C) for medium-rare, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Let rest about 10 minutes, then thinly slice against the grain.
Stir together corn, bell pepper, red onion, tomato, and jalapeno (if using) in a bowl.
Divide lettuce among 4 plates; drizzle each with about 2 tablespoons dressing. Top with steak slices, then with corn mixture. Sprinkle with feta and garnish with chips.
