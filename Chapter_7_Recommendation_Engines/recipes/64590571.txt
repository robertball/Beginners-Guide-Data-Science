Ingredients:
Olive oil
1 large onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes (san marzano)
1/4 cup dry red wine
2 salmon fillet (6 ounces each)
1 teaspoon sea salt plus more
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper plus more
1 tablespoon capers
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
In your baking dish add in olive oil and onion.  Put in the oven for 7 minutes.  Carefully remove the pan then add in oregano, basil, diced tomatoes and wine.  Stir then add back in the oven for 10 minutes.
Season both sides of the salmon with salt and pepper and add about 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper into the sauce.
Top with capers and place in the oven to bake for 15-20 minutes.  The steak will easily flake apart with a fork.  Top with fresh parsley and serve with your favorite side.  Enjoy
