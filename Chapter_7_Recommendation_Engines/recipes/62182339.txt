Cabbage and Noodles Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 head of cabbage
1 bag of wide egg noodles
1 package of bacon
3 cups of water
2 tablespoons of butter
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
You can use a large frying pan, or a stock pot. (I prefer a frying pan) Add the water and butter. When it comes to a boil, add the bacon. (you can fry the bacon, and just use the grease if you prefer, but the bacon leaves bits in it, it makes it better) After you clean and peel the cabbage, add it.
While the cabbage is cooking put on the noodles in a seperate pan. Cook them until done.
Let it cook until cabbage is tender enough for a fork to go through the thickest parts. (at this time, if you don't want the bigger bacon peices left in, take them out) When it's finished, drain, and add the noodles (drain them too). Mix them together, and there you go!

Description: 
I don't like cabbage, really. But my grandmother passed this recipe down. If you like bacon, and noodles, then you'll love this. You can't even taste the cabbage.
