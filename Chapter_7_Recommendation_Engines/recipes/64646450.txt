Ingredients:
1 bunch of kale leaves, rinsed and pat dry
1 tablespoon pine nuts
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon freshly grated parmesan cheese
3 large zucchini
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
7 ounces frozen petite peas

Directions:
To make the kale pesto start by removing the stems the the middle of each leaf.
Next, make an ice bath in a large bowl. (cold water and ice cubes)
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add in about 2 tablespoons of salt.  Add in kale to blanch for about 3 minutes.  Remove from pan using tongs and add to your ice bath.  This will stop the cooking process and keep the kale nice and green.
Once the leaves cool down, lay on paper towels to dry.
Add the kale, garlic, pine nuts, parmesan in your food processor.  Pulse about 5 times then start to drizzle in the oil and continue to pulse until you have a  nice consistency for pesto.
Add the extra virgin olive oil and continue to pulse until the kale pesto reaches the desired consistency. Taste and add more salt or extra virgin olive oil if necessary.  Set aside.
Heat the oil in a large saut√© pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes and cook until the garlic is fragrant; about 30 seconds.
Add the zucchini noodles to the pan and toss around.  Cook for about 2 minutes then remove from heat.  Add in peas and pesto then toss around.
Serve and Enjoy.
