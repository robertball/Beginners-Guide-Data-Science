Ingredients:
4 cups flour
3 Tbsp sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup butter, room temp
1 cup milk
3 egg yolks
2 envelopes yeast (4 1/2 tsp)
1/4 cup warm water
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon (or more if desired)

Directions:
Mix together flour, sugar, salt in a large bowl. With 2 knives or a pastry cutter, mix in 1 cup butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Scald milk and then cool to room temperature. Whisk the 3 egg yolks into lukewarm milk.
Mix yeast into the warm water and let sit for a minute. Add yeast mixture to the milk and eggs. Whisk gently.
Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients. Stir until soft dough forms. You may want to add a bit more flour to cut stickiness. Place dough into large tupperware container and seal. Place in refrigerator overnight.
Roll out dough on floured surface, as you would for cinnamon buns. Spread second amount of butter evenly on dough, sprinkle with 1/2 cup brown sugar and cinnamon.
Roll up, cut and place on parchment paper lined cookie sheets. Lightly flatten with the palm of your hand. Let rise in warm place for 1 hour.Bake at 350 for 10 - 15 minutes, until evenly browned.
