Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds pumpkin, peeled and cubed
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons honey
1 ripe banana
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 carrot, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 teaspoon medium curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup coconut milk
1 cup chicken stock
salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper
1 lime, juiced, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine pumpkin, 2 tablespoons olive oil, sugar, and honey in a bowl. Pour into a baking dish. Place unpeeled banana in a second smaller baking dish.
Bake both pumpkin and banana in the preheated oven until pumpkin has softened and is lightly brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat remaining olive oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook onion, carrot, and celery until soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, curry powder, coriander, nutmeg, and cinnamon; mix to combine. Cook for another 3 to 5 minutes.
Peel banana. Add banana flesh, pumpkin, coconut milk, and chicken stock to the pot and simmer 5 to 10 minutes. Puree soup using a stick blender until smooth. If desired, thin soup with more stock or hot water. Season with salt, pepper, and lime juice.
