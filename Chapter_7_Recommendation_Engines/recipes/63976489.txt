Ingredients:
1/2 pound lean ground beef
1/2 can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 c. frozen corn
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 (14 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes with juice
1 can diced green chilis
10 (6 inch) corn tortillas
1 cup prepared salsa
1/2 cup shredded Colby cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef, and stir in the taco seasoning, black beans, chilis, corn, and tomatoes. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with babking spray and line with half the tortillas. Spoon the beef mixture into the dish, then top with the remaining tortillas. Spread salsa over the tortillas and sprinkle with the cheese.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
