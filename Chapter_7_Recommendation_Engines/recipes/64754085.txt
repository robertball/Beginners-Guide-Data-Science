Ingredients:
4 oz cream cheese, cut into 1/4 inch pieces and frozen
2 cups all purpose flour
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
10 tbsps unsalted butter, softened
1 cup sugar
1 egg
2 tsps vanilla extract
1/4 tsp almond extract
1/3 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Mix in egg, vanilla, and almond extract, beat until combined. Add in 1/3 of the flour mixture and stir until just combined. Mix in half of sour cream. Continue alternating additions of the flour mixture and sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour mixture, stirring until just combined. Do not over mix. Gently fold in blueberries and frozen pieces of cream cheese.
4. Drop 1 1/2 tbsp sized balls of dough onto prepared cookie sheets about 2 inches apart. Bake in preheated oven until the bottom of the cookies begin to just brown, about 15-18 minutes. Cool 5 minutes on cookie sheet before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
Note: Make sure to cut the cream cheese into small pieces. It's easiest to do this when the cream cheese is very cold, but not frozen. I recommend placing the 4 oz block of cream cheese in the freezer for about 30-60 minutes, or until very cold. Then slice into 1/4 inch pieces, and place the pieces back into the freezer until completely frozen, about 1-2 hours.

Description: 
Folding frozen chunks of cream cheese into a sour cream sugar cookie base makes for a wonderfully cheesecake-y flavored cookie! Add in blueberries, and you've got a nice balance of creamy, sweet, salty, and tart berry flavor--all in one deliciously soft cookie!
