Ingredients:
1/4 cup wheat berries
2 cups water
2 cups cashews
1/4 cup pecans
2 tablespoons garlic salt
2 tablespoons chili-lime seasoning (such as TajinÂ®)

Directions:
Place wheat berries in a bowl. Pour in enough water to cover by a few inches; let soak until berries expand, 8 hours to overnight. Drain. Rinse berries twice a day, for 3 to 4 days, until berries sprout and grow short tails.
Place sprouted berries in a bowl and cover with 2 cups water. Let sit at room temperature, 12 to 24 hours, until soaking liquid turns cloudy, fizzy, and smells a little tart.
Cover cashews with water and soak, 8 hours to overnight. Drain.
Combine drained cashews and 1 cup of the soaking liquid in a high-powdered blender. Blend until smooth.
Pour blended mixture into a sieve lined with a coffee filter and set over a bowl; drain in the refrigerator until thickened, about 24 hours.
Combine pecans, garlic salt, and chili-lime seasoning in a food processor; pulse until a coarse mixture is formed.
Form the strained cashew mixture into a ball. Coat with pecan mixture.

Description: 
If a vegan cheese ball scares you, you are probably not alone. Don't let that stop you from trying this vegan treat. It won't taste exactly like dairy cheese, but it is delicious in a way all it's own. Also, it is good just as a cheese spread, if the seasonings are mixed in. Use within 7 days.
