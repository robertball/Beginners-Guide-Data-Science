Ingredients:
10 cups water
8 cubes chicken bouillon
1 medium onion, chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
1 tablespoon ground black pepper, divided
1 tablespoon paprika, divided
1 teaspoon seasoned salt, divided
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 cups cooked brown rice
1 (12 ounce) bag mixed fresh vegetables
1 (12 ounce) bag broccoli florets
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
2 cups frozen country-style shredded hash brown potatoes

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a large stockpot. Add chicken bouillon cubes and let dissolve. Add onion and reduce heat.
Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Season salmon with some of the pepper, paprika, and salt. Add salmon and garlic to the pan and cook until fish can be flaked with a fork but is still tender, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Break salmon apart into small chunks; transfer to the broth along with the garlic.
Stir rice, mixed vegetables, and broccoli into the broth. Add onion powder, garlic powder, and remaining pepper, paprika, and salt. Stir well and cook until vegetables are slightly tender, about 15 minutes. Add potatoes and simmer until heated through, about 15 minutes more.
