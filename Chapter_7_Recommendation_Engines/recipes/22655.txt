Description: 
Shell macaroni are stuffed with a creamy tuna mixture in this easy to prepare, fun to eat appetizer. Serve on a bed of lettuce leaves with toothpicks, and make sure plenty of cocktail sauce is available! Be prepared with additional 'shrimp' ready  to fill the serving dish as your guests make this great appetizer disappear quickly. I keep extras in the fridge.  Enjoy!
