Ingredients:
1/2 red onion, sliced
1 green bell pepper, sliced
[or 1/2 green and 1/2 red bell peppers sliced]
~15 slices canadian bacon
1/2 c crumbled feta, or to taste
1/2 c grated parmesan cheese
2 c shredded mozzarella
1 package refrigerated pizza dough

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Sautee onion and bell pepper slices in small amount of butter or olive oil, until softened.
Spread pizza dough in rectangle on parchment paper covered cutting board, or baking sheet. Lay canadian bacon slices on dough, in alternating rows of 2 and 3 slices, leaving empty borders for sealing. Spread sauteed onion and bell pepper over canadian bacon, then spread cheeses over veggies. Roll the short edge, similar to rolling cinnamon rolls. Crimp the open ends closed, place seam side down on parchment covered baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven, until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Make sure bottom of roll is browned.
Allow to cool slightly before slicing in 1 - 1 1/2 inch sections.
