Ingredients:
3 batches of homemade popcorn, popped (each batch is 1/2 cup of unpopped kernels)
1 pound of white chocolate chips, divided in half and melted
8 heaping teaspoons of yellow cake mix (I might even have added a smidge more, but haven’t experimented with it yet), divided in half
M&Ms;: I lucked out and used the Easter pastels for our batch
Assorted sprinkle

Directions:
Pop popcorn and remove any kernels or burnt pieces. Working in two batches, place half the popcorn in a very large bowl.
Melt half the white chocolate in a double boiler/mixing bowl over a pot of simmering water until smooth. Stir in half of the cake mix until smooth. Pour the chocolate over half of the popped popcorn. Using a wooden spoon to start and your hands once it has cooled just enough to touch, mix the popcorn and chocolate until completely coated.
Pour out onto wax paper or into a wax-paper lined jelly roll pan and spread into a single layer. Sprinkle half the M&M candies and sprinkles until festive, then let cool and harden.
Repeat the process with the other half of the popcorn and remaining chocolate, candies, and sprinkles.Once it has all cooled and hardened, break into servings. I left several pieces nice and chunky and stuck together.
Note: Don’t add the M&Ms or sprinkles until the chocoate has cooled enough so that they won’t melt. But also don’t wait until the chocoalte is totally cool and hardened or they won’t stick. I gently pressed the candies in a bit to help them along and it worked great.
