Ingredients:
•	2 cups vegetable broth
•	1/2 cup unsweetened oat milk
•	1 cup water, divided
•	1 tsp salt
•	1.5 cups Italian polenta (or course-ground cornmeal)
•	1/2 cup vegan shredded white cheese
•	1/4 cup vegan butter substitute

Directions:
In a large sauce pan, stir together the vegetable broth, unsweetened oat milk, and 1/2 cup water over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to medium-low. Stirring constantly, sprinkle in the polenta. Continue stirring until the polenta thickens. Reduce the temperature to low and stir often for about 10 minutes. Add the half cup shredded cheese substitute and the vegan butter. Stir until smooth. Add the remaining water, if necessary, to keep the consistency velvety and smooth.
Pour the polenta onto an oiled plate. Let stand a few minutes before serving. Refrigerate cooled leftovers.
Note:
The longer you cook/stir polenta, the better it is. This is an Italian rule of thumb. If you like, cook and stir an extra ten minutes before adding the cheese and butter.
Slice cooled leftovers, allow to dry at room temperature for about an hour before frying or baking.

Description: 
Creamy polenta without any animal products. Serve this for a savory accompaniment to your meals. Polenta goes very well with tomato-based dishes, beans, and sautéed mushrooms. Fry or bake slices of refrigerated leftovers to use as an alternative to toast for breakfast or appetizers.
