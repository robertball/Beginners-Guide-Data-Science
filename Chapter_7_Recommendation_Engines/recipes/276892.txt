Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste
1/2 cup chopped toasted walnuts
1/2 cup dried cranberries
2 large eggs
3/4 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 ripe Fuyu persimmons, chopped into small pieces

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and dust the bottom with flour.
Mix flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, ginger, and nutmeg together in a small bowl. Add walnuts and cranberries; toss or mix using your fingers to ensure cranberries don't stick together.
Whisk eggs, brown sugar, and oil together in a medium bowl until eggs are well beaten. Stir in persimmon pieces followed by flour mixture. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 1/2 hours.
Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Slide a knife around the sides and slide loaf out onto the rack to finish cooling, 15 to 30 minutes more, before cutting.
