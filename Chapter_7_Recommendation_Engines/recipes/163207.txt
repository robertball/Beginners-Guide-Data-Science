Ingredients:
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup brown ale (such as Newcastle™ brown ale)
1 pound cod fillets, cut into pieces

Directions:
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, garlic salt, garlic powder, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Mix in beer until no dry lumps remain. Dip the cod into the batter, allow some of the excess to run off, then carefully place into the deep-fryer. Cook until golden brown and crispy on the outside, and the fish is easily flaked, about 8 minutes. Cook the fish in several batches to avoid over loading the deep fryer.
