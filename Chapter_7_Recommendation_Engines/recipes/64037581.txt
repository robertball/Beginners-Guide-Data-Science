1/2 cup torn fresh breadcrumbs
2 tbsp. olive oil
1 tsp. lemon zest
2 large bunches of Swiss chard
2 tbsp. butter
2 medium shallots - sliced
Salt and pepper
3/4 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.

Season with salt.
Place on baking sheet and toast in oven, tossing once, until golden brown - 8 to 10 minutes.
Remove ribs and stems from chard and cut into 2" pieces and cut leaves into 2" pieces as well.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook chard leaves for about 1 minutes or until tender.
Drain and transfer to a bowl of ice water to cool.
When cool, drain and squeeze excess moisture out using a clean kitchen towel.
Heat butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.
Add shallots and chard ribs and stems, season with salt and pepper.
Cook, stirring often, until tender - about 5-8 minutes.
Add cream, bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often, until thickened - about 4 minutes.
Add chard leaves and cook until warmed through and coated with cream sauce.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Top with breadcrumbs before serving.
