Ingredients:
1 lb uncooked mostaccoli
1 pound lean ground turkey (or beef)
2 large onion, chopped
2 can (14-1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes, un-drained
2 can (6 ounces) tomato paste
1 cup water
2 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
4 cups (16 ounces) fat-free cottage cheese
2 tsp dried marjoram
3 cups (6 ounces) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook mosticolli according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, cook turkey and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain if necessary.
Stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, water, oregano, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
In a small bowl, combine cottage cheese and marjoram; set aside. Drain mosticolli.
Spread 1/2 cup meat sauce into an 15x11 baking dish coated with cooking spray. Layer with half of the mostaccoli, meat sauce and mozzarella cheese. Top with cottage cheese mixture. Layer with remaining mostaccoli, meat sauce and mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese (dish will be full).
Bake, uncovered, at 350Â° for 30-40 minutes or until bubbly and heated through.

Every year we host a Labor day party and this dish gets emptied first, every time! I often have two pans, one with meat the other without.
