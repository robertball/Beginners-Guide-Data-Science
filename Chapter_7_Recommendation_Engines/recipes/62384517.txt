Ingredients:
Three to four large sized zuchini's
Olive Oil
Jarred sundried tomatos
Basil Pesto
Crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Slice zuchini length wise about 1/4 inch thick.  Like a small plank. Rub zuchini planks with olive oil on each side,  approximately 1 tsp. per side.  Place on hot grill and turn it down to medium low.  Once the first side is done,  about three or four minutes turn the planks over.  Very carefully so as not to burn yourself spread each plank with about 1 tsp of basil pesto,  top with a few pieces of sundried tomato (depending on your tast you can use more or less)  top that with crumbled feta pieces and close the grill for about 3-4 minutes.
