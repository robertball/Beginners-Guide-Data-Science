Ingredients:
5 lbs (10 cups) bread flour, or as needed
5 cups warm 115 degree water
4 ounces Rapid Rise Yeast
21/2 ounces salt
2 ounces sugar
4 ounces vegetable oil or shortening
Cornmeal

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine 10 cups flour and salt.
Stir yeast in very warm water. Let stand.
Combine liquid into 7 cups flour mixture.
Add oil or shortening.
Stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 4 to 6 minutes.
Cover, let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.
Shape dough into 13 oz smooth ball for a 12" pie shell. Let rise to double in size.
Stretch to a 12" pan or heated stone. Treat pan with spray and cornmeal.
Top pizza as desired.
Make ahead and refrigerate until ready to cook. Remove from fridge and let warm to room temperature.
Bake at 450 degrees F for 12 to 15 minutes or until done. Baking time depends on size and thickness of crust and selected toppings.
