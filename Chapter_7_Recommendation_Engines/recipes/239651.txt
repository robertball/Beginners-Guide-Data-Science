Ingredients:
1 pound ground round beef (85% lean)
1/2 cup Kraft® Grated Parmesan Cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian (flat-leaf) parsley
1 egg, slightly beaten
3 teaspoons finely chopped garlic, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion
1 (14.5 ounce) can Hunt's® Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes, undrained
1 cup Hunt's® Tomato Sauce
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon salt
12 mini sandwich buns
6 (1 ounce) slices part-skim mozzarella cheese, cut in half

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Combine beef, Parmesan cheese, parsley, egg and 1 teaspoon garlic in medium bowl. Divide mixture into 12 portions; shape into meatballs and place on aluminum foil-lined shallow baking pan.
Bake 15 minutes or until done (160 degrees F).
Meanwhile, heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook 3 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add remaining 2 teaspoons garlic, cook 1 minute more or until fragrant. Stir in undrained tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes or until sauce has thickened, stirring occasionally.
Place open buns on baking sheet. Spoon sauce on bottom of each bun; place 1 meatball on each bun and more sauce, if desired. Top each with mozzarella cheese. Bake 5 minutes or until cheese melts and bun tops are lightly crisped. Close with tops of buns.
