Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 large overripe bananas
3/4 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup pumpkin puree
1/3 cup egg whites
1/4 teaspoon allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon grated orange zest
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/8 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup mini chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
Mash bananas in a large bowl. Mix in brown sugar, pumpkin, and egg whites.
Mix allspice, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and orange zest together in a small bowl. Set aside 1/2 teaspoon of mixture.
Combine whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, and remaining spice mixture in another large bowl. Slowly add banana-pumpkin mixture and mix until completely moistened. Fold in chocolate chips.
Spoon batter evenly into the prepared muffin tin. Place a pinch of reserved 1/2 teaspoon spice mixture on top of each muffin.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Leave muffins in their tin for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack for further cooling.

Description: 
This is a recipe I made up to make muffins that were fat-free, so just a little more wholesome. Basically, it's a mix of pumpkin bread and banana bread, but without butter or oil. 

This recipe is good for adapting to those that do not care about it being fat-free. Adding mini chocolate chips makes the muffins sweeter, but still not too unhealthy.
