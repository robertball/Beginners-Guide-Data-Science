Description: 
This makes the best steak marinade ever.  Have the grocer slice a 4-5 lb steak about 1 3/4 inches thick.  Marindae overnight or up to 2 days, its delicious.  You can also use it for kabobs, including the veggies and chicken.  Just cut of meat and veggies into size wanted for kabobs and throw into a tuperware container or zip lock baggies.
