Ingredients:
1 cup jasmine rice
2 cups chicken broth
Zest and juice from 1 1/2 lemons
1 clove garlic, chopped
2 tbsp basil, chopped
6 chicken breasts
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325. In a skillet, brown the tops of the chicken breasts, set aside. In a 13x9 baking dish, combine rice, chicken broth, lemon zest and juice, garlic, and most of the basil. Arrange chicken breasts on top of the rice. Sprinkle chicken with salt, pepper, and the rest of the basil. Bake until rice is cooked, liquid is absorbed, and chicken is cooked through (about 30 minutes.)
