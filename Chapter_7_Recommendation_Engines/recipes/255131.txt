Ingredients:
2 teaspoons butter
1 cup cooked macaroni
2 slices American cheese, diced
2 tablespoons milk
16 thin pretzel crackers (such as Snack Factory® Pretzel Crisps®)
1 (4 ounce) precooked smoked sausage, cut into sixteen 1/4-inch slices
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add macaroni and American cheese; stir until cheese is mostly melted, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low; mix in milk.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven on the low broil setting. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Spread pretzels crackers on the prepared baking sheet; top each with a slice of sausage. Spoon 1 tablespoon macaroni and cheese mixture over sausage. Sprinkle black pepper on top.
Bake under the preheated broiler until American cheese and pretzels start to brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
