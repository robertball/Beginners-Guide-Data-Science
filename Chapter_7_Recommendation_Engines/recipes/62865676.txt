Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (i cut them in half to get more coverage plus it's a better portion size)
1/4 cup butter
6 cloves crushed garlic
2 cups seasoned dry bread crumbs (you can use italian breadcrumbs)
1 cup shredded parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix breadcrumbs with parmesan cheese.
In a small saucepan melt butter/margarine with garlic. Dip chicken pieces in butter/garlic sauce, then coat completely with bread crumbs and cheese.
Place coated chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Combine any leftover butter/garlic sauce with bread crumb mixture and spoon over chicken pieces. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.  (note:  i only cooked mine about 30 minutes because i had cut them in half...you'll need to experiment, you don't want to cremate that chicken!)
