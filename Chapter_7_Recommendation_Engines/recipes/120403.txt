Ingredients:
8 cups milk
2 cups sugar
6 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons vanilla extract

Directions:
In a heavy saucepan over low heat, cook and stir milk and sugar until sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat. Stir in a small amount of hot milk mixture into eggs; return all to the pan, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until mixture reaches 160 degrees F or is thick enough to coat a metal spoon.
Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla. Cool to room temperature, stirring several times. Transfer to a bowl; press a piece of waxed paper or plastic wrap on top of custard. Refrigerate. Serve over gingerbread or pound cake.

Description: 
This recipe has been in the family for generations. I'm not surprised at its popularity, because it can be used in a variety of ways. We especially like it served over pound cake and gingerbread or simply topped with fresh strawberries.
