Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup rye flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in rye flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt.  Mix well and add enough water to moisten dough.
Roll out onto floured board. The thinner the dough, the crispier the cookies will be.  Cut into 2 1/2-inch rounds using cutter or floured glass.  Cut a small hole off center in each cookie using a thimble.
Bake on ungreased cookie sheets until slightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Hang on a Christmas tree with ribbon or yarn.
