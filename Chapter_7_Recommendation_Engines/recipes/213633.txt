Ingredients:
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
2 large onions, grated
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/2 teaspoon saffron
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 3/4 pounds boneless lamb, cut into 1/2-inch x 1 1/2-inch pieces
4 tomatoes
1 tablespoon sumac powder (optional)

Directions:
Combine olive oil, lime juice, onions, garlic, saffron, salt, and pepper in a large, zip top food storage bag.  Place lamb pieces in bag; seal and shake to combine.  Marinate lamb, refrigerated, overnight or up to 24 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Thread marinated lamb on long, thin metal skewers.  Thread whole tomatoes on another skewer.  Brush lamb and tomatoes with marinade; discard remaining marinade.
Grill kebabs, until lamb is cooked to your liking and tomatoes are hot and grill marked, about 5 minutes on each side. Sprinkle with sumac, if desired, before serving.
