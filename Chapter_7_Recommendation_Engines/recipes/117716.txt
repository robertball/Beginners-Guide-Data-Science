Ingredients:
1 tablespoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (3 ounce) package ramen noodle pasta with flavor packet
4 cups shredded cabbage
2 cups broccoli coleslaw mix
3 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted
2 tablespoons sliced almonds, toasted
DRESSING:
3 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
4 1/2 teaspoons cider vinegar
2 1/4 teaspoons water
2 1/4 teaspoons canola oil
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the first eight ingredients; rub over both sides of chicken. Broil 3-4 in. from the heat for 5-6 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. When chicken is cool enough to handle, shred with two forks; cool completely.
Set aside seasoning packet from ramen noodles. Break noodles into small pieces; place in a large bowl. Add the cabbage, broccoli coleslaw, onions, sesame seeds, almonds and chicken. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the dressing ingredients. Add the contents of seasoning packet; shake well. Pour over coleslaw and toss to coat.

Description: 
'The ramen noodles give this hearty salad a little crunch, but it's still just as good the next day when they've softened up,' says Kathy Egan of Oceanside, California.
