Ingredients:
3/4 C butter, softened
1 1/4 C granulated sugar, divided
1 egg
1 C light molasses
4 C all-purpose flour
2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tsp baking powder
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground cloves
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
In a large bowl beat butter and 1 C sugar until fluffy.  Beat in egg and molasses.  Mix flour, cocoa, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a separate bowl.
With mixer on low speed, gradually add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients.  Beat until just blended.
Divide dough in half.  Pat each half into a flattened 1" thick square on waxed paper.  Wrap dough and chip 1 hour or until dough is firm enough to shape.  Cut into tablespoon-sized squares.  Roll each square into a ball and roll in remaining 1/4 C sugar.
Place cookies 1" apart on a lightly greased cookie sheet.  Bake 10 minutes in a 375-degree oven or until evenly browned.  Cool on cookie sheet for 1 minute before removing to rack to cool completely.  Store tightly covered.
