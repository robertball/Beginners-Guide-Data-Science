Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound bulk Italian sausage
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 ½ cups chicken broth
⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 bunch broccoli rabe, trimmed
¼ cup butter
1 ½ cups grated Parmesan cheese
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the farfalle pasta, and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the Italian sausage until crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, and continue cooking until the sausage begins to brown, about 5 minutes more. Pour off the excess grease, then pour in the chicken broth and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil over high heat, then add the broccoli rabe, and cover. Cook until the broccoli rabe is tender, about 4 minutes.
When the broccoli rabe is done, stir in the butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper until the meat sauce has thickened. Toss with the farfalle and serve.
