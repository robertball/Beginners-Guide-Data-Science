Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups cranberries
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon orange juice
Zest of 1/2 orange
DRIZZLE:
Conf. sugar
Vanilla extract
Orange juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9 inch pie pan.
Combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Stir in the cranberries and the walnuts, and toss to coat. Stir in the butter, beaten eggs, and almond extract. If you are using frozen cranberries, the mixture will be very thick. Spread the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 minutes (start checking at 30 min.), or until a wooden pick inserted near the center comes clean. Easily double this recipe and use 10x13 pan.
