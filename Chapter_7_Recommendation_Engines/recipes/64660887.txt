Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups elbow macaroni
8 oz prepared Alfredo sauce {just over half a jar}
1/2 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup mozzarella cheese
1/4-1/2 cup half and half or whole milk
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water.
Stir alfredo sauce into the cooked pasta with the three cheeses and enough milk to keep things loosey goosey. {This is so your mac and cheese doesn't dry out while it's staying cool.}
Stir in salt and pepper to taste.
Divide between four mini aluminum pie tins {or one big one}, sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.
Spray one side of aluminum foil with more nonstick cooking spray and cover each individual mac and cheese portion, sprayed side down, facing the food. Seal well. Store in a large plastic food storage bag in a cooler until ready to cook.
Prepare a fire and let it burn down to the coals. Place a cooking rack over top that would be 2-3 inches above. Place each pie tin over the hot coals and cook 8-10 minutes or until hot. Remove from fire and serve immediately.
