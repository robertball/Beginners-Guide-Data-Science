1 teaspoon mayonnaise
2 slices bread
1 slice jalapeno Jack cheese

Heat a cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Spread 1/2 teaspoon mayonnaise on each slice of bread. Place bread slices mayo-side down in the hot skillet. Place jalapeno Jack cheese on 1 slice of bread, and top with tomato slices.
