Ingredients:
3/4 lb. Sukiyaki meat, cut into 2-inch pieces
4 potatoes, peeled, cut into 1-inch chunks
2 medium onions, cut in half, sliced
1 tbsp oil
1 tbsp sake
1 tbsp mirin
3 tbsp sugar
5 tbsp soy sauce

Directions:
Cut beef, potatoes, and onion. Heat oil in pan, add beef and separate slices, then add onions and potatoes. Saute approximately 2 minutes.
Add water to cover, then add rest of ingredients. Bring to a boil and remove the scum that forms.
Reduce heat, drop in a cover that is smaller than the pan and continue to cook, stirring 10-15 minutes (until potatoes are tender). Serve with hot rice.
