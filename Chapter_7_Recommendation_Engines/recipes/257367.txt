Ingredients:
12 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces
3 cups orange juice
1/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup olive oil
2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
2 cups dried pitted prunes, quartered
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Stir together carrots, orange juice, sugar, oil, zest, and ginger in a large skillet or 5-quart pot; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until carrots are tender and glazed, about 15 minutes. Stir in prunes and simmer until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in salt and pepper.
