Ingredients:
2 cups self-rising flour
6 Tbsp cold, salted butter
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 F.
Cut butter into flour until mixture is the consistency of coarse peas.
Stir in milk.  Handle as little as possible and use the minimal amount of flour on your hands to scoop out the dough and pat about 7 rounds on a baking sheet.  You may also place them side by side on a cast iron skillet.  this will cause them to rise up more and stick together.
Bake about 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
