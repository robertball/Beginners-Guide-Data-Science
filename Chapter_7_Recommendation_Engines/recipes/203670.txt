Ingredients:
4 eggs, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 zucchini, sliced 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick
garlic powder, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir the eggs and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl; set aside.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook the zucchini in the hot oil until softened and lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Season the zucchini with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium; pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Cook, stirring gently, for about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and cover. Keep covered off the heat until the eggs set, about 2 minutes more.

Description: 
My Dad (who's Italian) used to rustle this anytime dish up for himself. When I was in my 20s in 1996, I flipped when I saw it being served in a trendy Greek restaurant as an appetizer. It's a perfect, tasty meal.
