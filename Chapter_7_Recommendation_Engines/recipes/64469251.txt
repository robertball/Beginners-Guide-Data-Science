Ingredients:
10 oz candy coating or cheap white baking morsels
16 oz bag mini marshmallows
optional: green sixlets or M&Ms;, green sprinkles, candy eyeballs and mustaches, chopped kale, cat fur for extra fluffiness

Directions:
Combine marshmallows and other stuff in a large bowl (optional sixlets, sprinkles, kale, and/or cat fur).
Melt candy coating according to package directions, making sure to stir frequently and not overheat.
Pour melted coating in with the other stuff. Mix together. It's extra fun if you use your hands.
Spread evenly in 9x13 pan.
Add optional eyeballs and mustaches to give Dinomite more friends.
Chill in fridge until hardened, about 10-15 minutes.
Cut or break into hunks of fluffiness.
Eat it.
Run in circles with a cape on due to your sugar high.

Description: 
Dinomite loves sweet things, especially when they are fluffy. He shared his favorite recipe with me, so I thought I would pay it forward and share with you! This is probably the quickest green thing with eyeballs I've ever made - it only takes about 20 minutes, and then you can stuff your face with it. Give it to anyone who enjoys eating pure sugar; they'll love it as much as I do.
