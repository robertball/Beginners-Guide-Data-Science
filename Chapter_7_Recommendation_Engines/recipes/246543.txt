Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 (15 ounce) can creamed corn
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1/2 cup evaporated milk
2 eggs, beaten
1 (10 ounce) can asparagus tips, drained
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Coat a baking dish with butter; spread creamed corn on top. Sift flour, sugar, salt, and pepper evenly over corn. Pour evaporated milk and eggs on top. Fold asparagus into egg mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until beginning to set, about 30 minutes.
Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over asparagus mixture; bake until Cheddar cheese is melted, casserole is fully set, and edges are lightly browned, about 5 minutes more.
