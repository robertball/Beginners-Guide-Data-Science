Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (17.5 ounce) package dry oatmeal cookie mix
1/2 stick butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Pour cookie mix into a large bowl. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly and coarse. Reserve 1 1/2 cups crumb mixture; press remaining crumbs into the bottom of the prepared baking pan.
Bake crust in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Remove partially baked crust and leave oven on.
Beat cream cheese, sugar, egg, flour, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using electric mixer on medium speed until smooth.
Spread cream cheese mixture evenly over the partially baked crust. Spread cherry pie filling over cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle reserved crumbs on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown on top, about 35 minutes. Cool about 30 minutes. Refrigerate to chill, about 2 hours. Cut into 16 to 20 bars.
