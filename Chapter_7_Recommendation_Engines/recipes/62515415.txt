Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter
1 3/4 cups white sugar
4 eggs
1 cup milk
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp lemon extract
2 1/2 cups cake flour
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp salt
Frosting:
5 cups confectioners' sugar
1/3 cup + 1 Tbsp whole milk
2 1/2 Tbsp light corn syrup
1/2 tsp vanilla
5/8 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder.
(pinch of baking soda if cocoa powder is not Dutch processed.)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Line 2-3 cookie sheets with parchment paper.  I use 3 sheets, with 8 cookies on each.
In your mixer, cream together butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in the milk, vanilla, and lemon extract. Combine cake flour and all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt; gradually blend into the creamed mixture. Drop 1/4 cup of batter 3 inches apart on prepared baking sheets.  Spread each mound and flatten to about 2.5 inches in diameter.
Bake until edges begin to brown, about 15 minutes.  Cool completely on a wire rack.
Frosting:
Place confectioners sugar in large bowl. Mix in all other ingredients other than cocoa.  Transfer half of the frosting to a separate bowl.  Stir in the cocoa. Thin consistency with warm water.  With offset spatula, coat a little more than half the BOTTOM of the cookie with white frosting. (Yes, the bottom becomes the top) Let this set at room temperature or in fridge.  Frost second half with chocolate frosting.  Cool again until frosting sets.
