Ingredients:
1 cup fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped
1 cup fresh wax beans, trimmed and snapped
1 cup diced carrot
1 cup diced turnip
2 cups cubed new potatoes
6 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup heavy cream (optional)
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Place the green beans, wax beans, carrots and turnips into a saucepan and add enough water to cover the vegetables. Lightly salt the water, and bring to a boil. Cook for about 1/2 hour, then add the potatoes and cook for another 1/2 hour. Stir in butter and if desired, cream.
Mix together the flour and 1/2 cup water, and pour into the soup. Cook for a few more minutes to thicken. Remove from heat and serve hot.

Description: 
This is an old favourite vegetable stew from Nova Scotia. Is typically made in the fall as gardens are just harvested. It is important that the freshest veggies are used. This recipe very much lends itself to tinkering by adding different vegetables and quantities.
