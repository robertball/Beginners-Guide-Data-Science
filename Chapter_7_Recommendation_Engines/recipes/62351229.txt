Ingredients:
1 jar green salsa (approx. 11 oz.)
3 lb. pork loin roast (boneless)
1 TBS canola oil

Directions:
If using the oven, heat to 400 degrees. If using slow cooker, have it ready to cook.
Heat oil in large dutch oven on medium-high. When oil is warm, add roast. Brown on all sides. You may transfer the roast to a slow cooker at this point, and pour all of the salsa over the roast. Cook for 6-8 hours, shredding the pork after 5 hours.
Alternately, you may pour the salsa over the roast in the dutch oven and cover it. Transfer the pot to your hot oven and allow to roast, covered, for 3 hours. Shred the pork with two forks, then return the pot to the oven for another hour.
If it looks dry when you're shredding, add 1/2 cup of water and stir it in.
Allow pork to cool before refrigerating for later use.
