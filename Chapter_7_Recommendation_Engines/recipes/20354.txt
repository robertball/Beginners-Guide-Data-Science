Ingredients:
1 pound ricotta cheese
2 eggs
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
In large bowl, combine ricotta, eggs, sugar and vanilla.  Mix together baking powder and 1/2 cup flour.  Fold into ricotta mixture.  Add enough of remaining flour to make a thick batter.  Let rest 1 hour.
Heat oil in large heavy saucepan over high heat until a small amount of batter dropped in oil sizzles and starts to color.  Drop batter by teaspoons into hot oil and deep fry until golden.  Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
Stack sfingi on serving platter in a pyramid.  Drizzle stack with honey and dust with confectioner's sugar.
