Ingredients:
½ cup chopped walnuts
1 tablespoon butter
1  onion, chopped
½ teaspoon minced garlic
1 cup uncooked instant brown rice
1 cup vegetable broth
1 pound fresh broccoli florets
½ teaspoon salt
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place walnuts on small baking sheet, and bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until toasted.
Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic in melted butter for 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the rice, add the broth, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 7 to 8 minutes.
Place broccoli in a microwave-safe casserole dish, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover, and microwave until tender.
Spoon rice onto a serving platter, and top with broccoli. Sprinkle walnuts and cheese on top.

This recipe was born one night when I didn't have too much to do. I guess the only surprise about it is that it tastes so good!
