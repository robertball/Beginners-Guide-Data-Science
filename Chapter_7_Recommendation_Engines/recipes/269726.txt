Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
2  cloves garlic,  minced
3 (1-inch thick) pork chops
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
¼ cup all-purpose flour
1 ½ cups milk

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic and cook until butter foams, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Continue to cook until brown bits of butter form at the bottom of the skillet, 3 to 5 minutes
Season pork chops with salt and pepper and add to skillet. Cook until no longer pink in the center, flipping once, about 8 minutes . Transfer to a plate and cover loosely.
Lower heat and add mushrooms to the same skillet. Cook until mushrooms are soft and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Whisk in flour until no lumps remain. Slowly stir in milk and cook gravy until thickened as desired, 5 to 7 minutes. Return pork chops to the gravy and heat for 5 to 10 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
