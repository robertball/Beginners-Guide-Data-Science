Ingredients:
2 c. cooked rice, cold
1 Tbsp. canola oil
2 Tbsp. sesame oil, divided
2 c. cooked chicken, cubed or shredded
1 large carrot, diced really small
2 c. broccoli florets, frozen or fresh
1/2 c. soy sauce
1 c. frozen baby peas or snow peas
1 egg, wisked, pan fried and cut into 1/2 in. strips. Set aside

Directions:
Firstly, I add 1 Tbsp. sesame oil to the COLD rice. Mix well and put back in the refrigerator.
In large skillet, add canola oil and saute the carrots and broccoli til soft. About 8 minutes.
Add in the cooked chicken, peas and soy sauce.
Continue to saute til your peas are heated through.
Add in the strips of egg, 1 Tbsp. sesame oil and the cold rice. Heat through, stirring often.

Description: 
After much trial and error, I think I have a winner here. Don't skip the sesame oil...it gives the dish a more authentic flavor like you'd find in the fried rice at your favorite Chinese restaurant.
