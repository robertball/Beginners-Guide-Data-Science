Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 teaspoons chopped garlic
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast, chopped
2 (14.5 ounce) cans great Northern beans
20 ounces chicken broth
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles (such as Old El PasoÂ®)
12 sprigs cilantro, chopped
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove onion and garlic to a small bowl.
Stir chicken into any remaining oil in the pot; cook and stir until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Return onion mixture to the pot; add beans, broth, chiles, cilantro, salt, and cayenne pepper.
Bring the soup to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the beans are very tender and the chicken cooked through, about 20 minutes.
