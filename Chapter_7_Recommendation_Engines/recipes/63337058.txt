Ingredients:
2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 cup olive oil
2 pounds pork tenderloin

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Mix bread crumbs and olive oil in bowl to reach consistency that would be moist enough to stick to the meat when pressed.  Place pork on a shallow cooking sheet.  Press the crumb mixture onto all sides of the meat until there is no pink showing, usually 1/4 inch thick.
Bake for at least 35 minutes until a meat thermometer reads 165 degrees F (75 degrees C) or until there is no pink when the pork is cut.  Let the pork rest for 10 minutes, then cut into 1/2 inch slices.

Description: 
This main dish is beautiful in its presentation and always comes out tender and juicy even if you overcook it a little.  The crust of bread crumbs holds in all the juices and adds a great look and taste to the finished product.Modified from: Easy and Elegant Pork Tenderloin
