Description: 
A smooth sauce of avocado mashed with lemon replaces Hollandaise sauce in this delicious variation on the traditional Eggs Benedict. The creamy richness is still there but mashing avocado is much easier than making Hollandaise sauce. Easy enough, in fact, that this could be a regular weekend breakfast or brunch item at your house. You can also try the avocado blend over toast, scrambled eggs or sliced turkey or chicken.
