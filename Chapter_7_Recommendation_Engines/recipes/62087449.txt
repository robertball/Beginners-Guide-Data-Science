Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp. butter
1/2 cup dry white wine
3 leeks, white and light green parts only, sliced into thin strips
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1 14.5 oz. can chicken broth
1 tsp. fresh thyme
salt and pepper
1 tbsp. butter

Directions:
Wash and pat dry chicken breasts. Season with garlic powder, salt and pepper and dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Preheat a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil and butter. When butter is melted, add chicken breasts. Brown for about 5 minutes per side. Remove and keep warm and covered.
Deglaze the skillet with wine, stirring up any brown bits. Add leeks, mushrooms, chicken broth and thyme. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and cover.
Simmer for 10 minutes, or until leeks are tender.
Return chicken breasts to the pan and cover and continue simmering for about 20 minutes or until chicken breasts are no longer pink.
Remove chicken breasts to a warm platter and increase heat under skillet to medium. Whisk in butter and allow sauce to reduce by about a third, about 3 - 5 minutes. Check seasoning, add salt and pepper as needed.
Pour sauce over chicken breasts and serve on a bed of rice.
