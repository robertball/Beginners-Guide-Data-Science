Description: 
A Thai-inspired recipe with eggplants and tofu. 
I am not Asian, and I don't want to claim this is an authentic Thai recipe! I had baby eggplants at hand, and I looked for ways to cook them. I couldn't find a single recipe that would satisfy me, so I got inspiration by 3-4 different ones, based on the ingredients I had available. The ready-made curry paste made it easy to prepare, and tasty for us. :) Serve with rice.
