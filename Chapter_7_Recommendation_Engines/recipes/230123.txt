Ingredients:
1 habanero pepper
1/2 mango - peeled, seeded, and cubed
1/3 large sweet onion, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed
1 clove garlic
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, or to taste
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch ground cumin, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place habanero pepper, mango, and onion on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil; toss to coat evenly.
Roast on the middle rack of the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Turn on the oven's broiler and roast for 5 more minutes. Move baking pan to the oven's top shelf; broil until onion and mango begin to brown and habanero pepper blisters, about 3 more minutes. Remove and slightly cool.
Wearing gloves, remove stem from habanero pepper and place pepper in a small food processor or blender; add mango, onion, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, and salt. Season with black pepper and cumin. Pulse until salsa is combined and slightly chunky. Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving for flavors to blend.
