1 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot and add onion, celery, carrot, potato, apple, squash, garlic and chilies. Cover veggies with chicken broth (may have some left over, that's fine). Bring to a boil.
Add salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low.  Cover pot and simmer until veggies are tender, about 40 minutes.
Remove chilies. Transfer the soup to a blender, and blend until smooth.
Return to pot. Stir in brown sugar. Mix in any remaining stock to desired consistency.
