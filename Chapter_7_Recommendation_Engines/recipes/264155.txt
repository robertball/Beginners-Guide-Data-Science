Ingredients:
⅔ cup basmati rice
1 cup water
1  mango, peeled and chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons lime juice
3 teaspoons honey
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, halved lengthwise
1 (14 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 ½ cups corn
½ cup diced red bell pepper
1 small red onion, diced
¼ cup chopped cilantro
1 tablespoon lime juice
¾ teaspoon salt
¼ cup sweetened flaked coconut
1  avocado, sliced

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Mix mango, olive oil, lime juice, honey, sriracha sauce, garlic, and salt together in a blender until smooth. Place chicken in a shallow bowl and pour 1/2 the sauce on top; marinate chicken for 10 minutes.
Mix black beans, corn, red bell pepper, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, and salt together in a bowl for the corn salsa.
Grill chicken until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from heat.
Divide rice among 4 glass meal prep bowls. Add 2 pieces of chicken to each bowl; top with the reserved mango sauce, corn salsa, and coconut. Top with avocado slices, cover, and refrigerate for up to 5 days.
