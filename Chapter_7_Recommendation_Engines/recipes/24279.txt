Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
2/3 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup butter
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme
1 (11 ounce) package white chocolate chips
red food coloring, as desired
green food coloring, as desired

Directions:
Grease a 9x13 inch pan.
In a medium saucepan combine sugar, cream and butter.  Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.
Stir in marshmallow creme and white chocolate chips; mix well.  Reserve 2 separate 1/2 cups of mixture and set aside.
To one of the reserved 1/2 cups mixture add red food coloring until desired shade of red is achieved.  To the other 1/2 cup of mixture add green food coloring until desired shade of green is achieved.
Pour white mixture into prepared pan.  Pour dots of both the red and green mixtures across the top.  Using a toothpick or knife, swirl colors throughout the white.
Chill for 2 hours and cut into 2 inch squares.
