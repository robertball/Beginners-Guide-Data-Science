Description: 
Try this tart and spicy twist on cranberries for the holidays. It's beautiful, too! The adults in my family demand to have this on the table, but we keep the traditional cranberry recipe for the kids. If you are using fresh cranberries, freeze first and allow to thaw. They'll be much juicier!
