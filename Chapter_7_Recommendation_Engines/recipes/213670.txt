Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves minced garlic
1 pound venison, cut into strips
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the venison to the skillet; cook and stir until evenly browned. Stir the tomatoes, mushrooms, thyme, sage, tarragon, and salt into the mixture; cover the skillet and allow the mixture to simmer until the venison is tender, 30 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
This is a simple and tasty way I make venison. Like anything else it's better with fresh ingredients rather than canned, but this is what I had on hand. This is wonderful served over brown or wild rice.
