Description: 
When I was younger, my family would always make Aguadito de pollo (made with beer and large Peruvian potatoes) during the holidays, which they allowed to cook for 3 days to concentrate the flavors. Due to the nature of the stew and its ability to upset your stomach, they served it with this tea. It's an amazing soup and an even better tea. I hope everyone enjoys it!
