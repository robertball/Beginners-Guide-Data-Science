Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup boiling water
1 cup sifted flour
1/4 tsp salt
4 eggs

Directions:
Boil water with shortening in small pan.  Sift flour and salt, and add all at once - beat quickly until smooth and thick and comes away from sides of pan easily.  Remove from heat.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well.  Drop spoonfuls two inches apart on ungreased sheets (should hold their shape).  Bake at 400 degrees for about 45 mins.  Cool, slit, and fill with whipped cream, pudding, or desired filling.  Dust with powdered sugar or frost.

Description: 
I think what you want is a cream puff recipe.  I use this recipe for eclairs also.  This recipe has been in my Italian family for years.  It is very good.  You can fill these light airy puffs with whipped cream, pudding, or any other filling.  Dust with powdered sugar or frost.  I like them filled with chocolate pudding and dusted with powdered sugar.  Yum!  They melt in your mouth.
