Description: 
A delicious variation on the holiday classic - this recipe makes a mostly raw eggnog that will leave your mouth watering. It's incredibly filling so have it as a snack or small meal all by itself. Traditional eggnog recipes use lots of cream to give it the right taste and consistency, but I find that the mixture of whole raw eggs and coconut oil make for a totally satisfying creamy experience. Eggnog isn't just for holiday indulgences anymore!
