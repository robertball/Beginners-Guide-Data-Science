Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons port wine
1 cup chopped walnuts
3/8 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons port wine
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 tablespoon port wine
2 drops red food coloring

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch square pan.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, then stir in the vanilla, milk and 2 tablespoons Port wine. Combine the flour, chopped walnuts and baking powder; stir into the creamed  mixture. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Brush the top with 2 tablespoons of the Port wine as soon as it comes out of the oven. Let cool to room temperature before glazing.
To make the glaze, beat together the confectioners' sugar, 1 tablespoon of butter, and 1 tablespoon of port wine until smooth and spreadable. Spread over the cooled bars.

Description: 
These are chewy walnut bars made by my Titia  Albertin in Sao Miguel, Azores. They have a wonderful flavor that comes from Port wine.
