Title:
Peruvian Cola Chicken Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
4  chicken thighs
4  chicken leg quarters
1 ½ cups soy sauce, or as needed
1 large onion, finely chopped
½ (2 liter) bottle cola-flavored carbonated beverage, or to taste
2 tablespoons cornstarch, or more as needed

Directions:
Place chicken pieces in a container; pour enough soy sauce on top to cover. Refrigerate and marinate for about 24 hours, the longer the better.
Heat a large pan over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from soy sauce and cook until crisp, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken and let rest. Cook and stir onion in the pan until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Return chicken to the pan. Mix 1 cup cola with cornstarch in a small bowl and pour into the pan. Pour in enough of the remaining cola to cover the chicken. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer, covered, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Pour some of the soy sauce marinade into the pan. Heat thoroughly, taste, and adjust seasoning if needed.

Description: 
I got this recipe from a Peruvian grandmother when I told her how much I loved Peru when I traveled there. A very authentic, simple, and delicious Peruvian meal. Use up to 8 pieces, or 4 to 5 pounds, of any chicken parts you prefer--breasts, thighs, and/or legs. Serve with rice.
