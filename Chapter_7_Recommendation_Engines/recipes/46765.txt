Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour the tomatoes into a 1 1/2 quart baking dish. Place the torn pieces of bread in a layer over the tomatoes, and dot with pieces of butter. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown.

Description: 
Tomatoes are baked with torn bread to make a savory tomato pudding. So simple, we love it with meatloaf and baked potatoes. I serve it at dinner parties, and I am always asked for the recipe. Add it to any oven cooked meal.
