Description: 
I have this on my menu at the moment. I serve it straight from the oven under a juicy ribeye steak. It's glorious when the oozing cheese mixes with the juices from the ribeye. It's very popular with my customers and my girlfriend loves it. Why not try it with a big lump of mature Cashel blue cheese melted on the top and a wild mushroom sauce poured over it all? Very heavy and full of fat but great as a treat every now and then.
