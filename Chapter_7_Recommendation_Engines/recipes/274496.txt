Description: 
Fresh, sweet taste, so much better than store-bought, and so easy! Use these marinated peppers as an antipasto, or a very healthy sandwich filling. Experiment with different herbs such as rosemary or Italian seasoning. My favorite is basil. Marinade also makes a wonderful salad dressing when the peppers have been eaten!
