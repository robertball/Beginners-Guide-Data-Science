Ingredients:
1 ½ lb. Cooked Chicken breasts
¼ cup white wine
1 cup mayo
1 6 oz can tuna
1 tin anchovies, minced
1 tsp pepper
Dash garlic powder
3/4 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Bake the chicken at 350F in the wine until cooked, about 30 minutes.  Strain the cooking juices and reserve.  Cool slightly, then chop or shred finely.
Meanwhile, mix together the mayo, tuna, anchovies, pepper and garlic powder.  Stir until very well mixed, breaking up the tuna with your spoon.  Gently stir in the reserved juices and chicken broth.  Mix chopped chicken into dressing.  Serve at room temperature or cold.

Description: 
This chicken salad dish sounds strange, but it’s a terrific combination.  Don’t be put off by the anchovies… The dressing is rich without being overwhelmed by the seafood.  Serve as a sandwich on a toasted roll or cold over mixed greens.
