Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 (8 ounce) whole trout, butterflied and deboned
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat until butter smells toasted and is golden brown, about 1 minute. Turn off heat.
Line a baking sheet with a piece of aluminum foil. Place trout onto foil; open trout so skin sides are down. Drizzle each trout with about 1/2 teaspoon melted butter. Generously season with salt and black pepper.
Move an oven rack to 5 or 6 inches below heat source and preheat oven's broiler on high heat.
Broil trout until opaque and barely firm to the touch, 2 or 3 minutes. Remove from oven.
Return pan of melted butter over high heat; stir in lemon juice and parsley. Bring butter sauce to a boil; whisk to combine. Serve trout on plates and drizzle with butter sauce.

Description: 
This recipe is so simple, it doesn't even have a name. I just call it Trout. This is such an easy weeknight seafood dinner. It's a really nice way to cook fish, especially if you're new at cooking fish.
