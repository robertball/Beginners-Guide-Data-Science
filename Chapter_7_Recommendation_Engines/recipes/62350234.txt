Ingredients:
2 cups bagged coleslaw mix (store brand is fine)
1/4 cup shredded carrots (or finely julienned)
1/2 of a large granny smith apple, finely julienned into pieces comparable in size to the coleslaw shreds
1/2 of a medium jalapeno, de seeded and diced finely
2 green onions, chopped into 1/4 inch diced pieces
3 TBS good olive oil
3 TBS rice wine vinegar
1 lime, sliced (for juice)
1 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp fresh cracked pepper
1/4 cup of chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 cup finely chopped jicama sticks (if in season)

Directions:
In a large bowl squeeze the juice of one or two lime slices over the apple pieces so they do not brown and toss to coat.
Add the the coleslaw mix, carrots, green onions, jalapeno, and cilantro to the apples.
Add the olive oil, rice wine vinegar, and the juice of the remaining lime slices.
Add salt, pepper, and sugar.
Toss until thouroughly mixed.  Let sit in the fridge for at least 1 hour before serving, preferably 2-3 hours for maximum flavor.  Taste the slaw before serving and add additional salt, pepper, or a pinch of sugar if needed, given your personal taste.

Description: 
I love coleslaw but I don't love the fat and calories from mayonnaise.  This slaw is light, fresh, and the perfect topping for fish or shrimp tacos or it can hold its own as a side dish.  Every time I make it I'm asked for the recipe!  The Granny Smith Apple is the key ingredient that sets this apart from other slaws of this type.
