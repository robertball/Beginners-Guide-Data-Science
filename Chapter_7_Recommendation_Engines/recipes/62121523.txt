Ingredients:
8 medium tomatoes
5 small jalapenos  (green or red is fine)
1 medium Spanish onion
3 cloves garlic
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons mesquite-flavored liquid smoke

Directions:
Preheat your barbecue grill then set to medium/high temperature.
Remove any stems from the tomatoes,then rub some oil over each tomato.
You can leave the stems on the jalapenos.
Place the tomatoes on the grill when itâ€™s hot.
After about 10 minutes,place all of the jalapenos onto the grill and turn tomatoes.
In about another 10 minutes you can turn the tomatoes and the peppers.
When almost the entire surface of the peppers has charred black you can remove them from the grill.
The tomatoes will turn partially black, but when the skin begins to come off they are done.
Put the peppers and tomatoes on a plate and let them cool.
When the tomatoes and peppers have cooled,remove most of the skin from the tomatoes only and place them into a food processor.
Cut the stem end from each of the peppers and place them into the food processor as well.
Add the remaining ingredients to the food processor or blender and puree on high speed for 5-10 seconds or until the mixture has a smooth consistency.
Place the salsa into a covered container and chill for several hours or overnight while the flavors develop.
