Ingredients:
1 pound salmon, cut into 4 portions
1 lemon, juiced
1 lime, juiced
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 cup honey
2 2/3 fluid ounces cognac (such as Hennessy)
olive oil
freshly ground black pepper
Himalayan pink salt

Directions:
Coat salmon in lemon and lime juice and place on a baking sheet.
Combine garlic, onion powder, Cajun seasoning, and paprika in a small bowl.
Heat honey in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until bubbling. Add the garlic mixture and cognac. Simmer until flavors combine and sauce starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Let cool until thick, 10 to 15 minutes.
Coat salmon in olive oil; season with pink salt and pepper.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Broil salmon for 6 to 8 minutes. Spoon the cognac-honey sauce over the salmon. Continue broiling until light brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
