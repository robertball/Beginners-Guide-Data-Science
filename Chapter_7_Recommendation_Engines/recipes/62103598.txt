Ingredients:
1 cup Breakstone's Sour Cream
2 T Kikoman soy sauce

Directions:
Stir together the sour cream and soy sauce.  You can add more or less soy sauce to taste -- it's hard to mess up.

Submitter: 
FXTROTLIMA
Description: 
This creamy dip is great for all things potato (fries and chips especially) and also makes a great steak dip.  It's even good spread on a roast beef sandwich!  Everyone loves it, and no one can guess what's in it.  The combination of the two ingredients is surprisingly different than either alone.  I strongly encourage using Kikoman soysauce, as other brands I have tried tasted very different and not nearly as good.
