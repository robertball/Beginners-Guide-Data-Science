Spread 1 cup meat sauce in each of two greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dishes.  Layer four noodles, 1-2/3 cups meat sauce, 1-1/3 cups cheese in each dish.  Repeat layers twice.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes.  Uncover; bake 5-10 minutes longer or until bubbly.  Let stand for 15 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
With both bacon and ground beef, this hearty dish is a real crowd-pleaser. The recipe came from my grandmother, now in her 80s. I've learned so much from helping her in the kitchen.                                  -Cathy McCartney                                   Davenport, Iowa
