Ingredients:
1/2 cup cashews
aluminum foil
1 cup chunky salsa
1 small red bell pepper - cored, seeded, and chopped
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (13 ounce) package tortilla chips
1 (15.25 ounce) can black bean chili (such as Amy'sÂ®)
2 ripe avocados, peeled and cubed
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
1/2 lime, juiced
1 pinch salt, or to taste
1 cup pico de gallo
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Place cashews in a bowl and cover with cold water. Soak for 4 hours. Drain.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Combine drained cashews, salsa, bell pepper, nutritional yeast, turmeric, and 1 teaspoon salt in a high-speed blender; blend until smooth and slightly warm.
Spread tortilla chips on the prepared baking sheet. Spoon chili all over chips and spoon cashew "nacho" cheese over chili.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot, 10 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, place avocados, 1/4 cup cilantro, and lime juice in a bowl. Season with salt and mash with a fork until guacamole is mostly smooth but a little chunky.
Top nachos with guacamole and pico de gallo, and sprinkle with cilantro. Serve hot.
