Ingredients:
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons water
2 tablespoons butter
5 tablespoons vegetable oil
5 cups cold cooked rice
2 1/2 cups small cooked, tail-off shrimp
5 tablespoons soy sauce, or more to taste
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup finely chopped green onion
salt to taste

Directions:
Whisk eggs and water together in a small bowl.
Melt butter in a large nonstick frying pan or wok over medium heat. Add egg mixture and cook, without stirring, until almost firm, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook for 1 minute more. Carefully transfer egg to a plate and slice into thin strips, about 2 1/2-inches long.
Heat oil in the same pan over medium-high heat. Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, until rice is nicely separated and firm, but not browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shrimp, soy sauce, sesame oil, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Add green onion and egg strips; cook for 1 minute.
Season with salt and additional soy sauce if needed.

Description: 
I'm not a shrimp fan, but I made this shrimp fried rice for my husband one night and he's begged for it ever since. It works equally well with pork, chicken, beef, or veggies. We now have Chinese night at home!
