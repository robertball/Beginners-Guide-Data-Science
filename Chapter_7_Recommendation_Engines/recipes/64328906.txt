Ingredients:
1 cup flour (145 grams)
2 tablespoons flour (145 grams)
1 teaspoon baking soda (5 ml)
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (2.5 ml)
1/2 teaspoon ginger (2.5 ml)
1/4 teaspoon clove (1.25 ml)
1/8 teaspoon salt (.6 ml)
1/2 cup packed brown sugar (99 grams)
8 tablespoons pumpkin, applesauce or prune puree
2 tablespoons molasses (30 ml)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (2.5 ml)
3 tablespoons sugar, for rolling
1 tablespoon course sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F or 165 degrees Celsius.
Drain applesauce so it isn't too watery (paper towel)
In a mixing bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt.
In a second bowl, mix brown sugar, puree, molasses and vanilla.
Add flour mixture to brown sugar mixture and stir until mixed. Using a tablespoon measure, scoop up dough and form nice mounds. Place the mounds about 2 Â½ inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet (Silpat is okay) and sprinkle tops with sparkly sugar (I actually rolled the dough into balls and rolled them in sugar. When I put my cookies on the baking sheet I pressed them down with my fingers). Bake for 13-16 minutes. Let cool for 2 minute on sheet, then transfer to wire rack to cool.
