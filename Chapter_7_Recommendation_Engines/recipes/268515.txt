Ingredients:
1/2 pound Italian turkey sausage links, casings removed
2 cups water
2 teaspoons chicken soup base (such as Better than Bouillon®)
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 zucchini, sliced into half moons
1 medium yellow onion, diced
2 carrots, peeled and coarsely diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch fresh spinach, chopped
1/2 teaspoon dried Italian herbs
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add sausage and sauté, breaking it into pieces with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add water, chicken soup base, beans, zucchini, onion, carrots, and garlic. Stir once.
Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 3 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Add spinach, Italian herbs, and rosemary; stir until spinach has wilted. Ladle minestrone into bowls and top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This isn't what I would call an authentic or traditional minestrone. It's simply my way of making a hearty minestrone that's amazingly healthy and quick! I prefer not to use salt or pepper in much of my cooking, to allow the flavors of the food to shine through.
