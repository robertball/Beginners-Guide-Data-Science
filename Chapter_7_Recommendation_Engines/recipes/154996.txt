Ingredients:
1/4 pound shiitake mushrooms
1 cup Birds Eye® Chopped Spinach, defrosted
1/3 cup ground pork or turkey
2 tablespoons chopped scallions
1 teaspoon chopped garlic
1 tablespoon grated ginger root
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon Asian sesame oil
1 large egg
Pot sticker wrappers
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Combine the first nine ingredients together in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until ingredients are finely chopped. Place a teaspoon of filling in the center of each wrapper; moisten the edges with water, pressing the edges together to form a semi circle. Make 3 or 4 pleats along the edge to seal. Press dumplings on bottom to flatten. Heat the oil in nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the pot stickers flattened bottoms down. Fry In rows until brown. Add cup water, cover skillet and steam until puffy yet firm and water has evaporated, 6 to 8 minutes. Continue to cook until bottoms are crispy again. Serve while warm, with plum sauce for dipping.
