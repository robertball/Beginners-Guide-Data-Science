Ingredients:
1 package frozen chopped poblano chile peppers
1/2 tablespoon corn oil
1 pound raw chorizo sausage
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup water
1/2 pound macaroni
3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste
1/2 tablespoon dried Mexican oregano
4 tablespoons sour cream (optional)
1/4 cup Queso a√±ejo (aged Mexican cheese) (optional)

Directions:
Meanwhile, heat corn oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Squeeze chorizo out of casings into the hot oil. With a wooden spoon, break up the sausage, and cook about 4 minutes. Remove sausage, and set aside. Stir onion into oil, and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir garlic into pan and cook for 1 minute. Stir in poblano peppers, and heat through 1 minute.
Increase the heat to high, and stir in tomatoes with liquid, black beans, cooked chorizo, water, macaroni, salt, pepper, and oregano. Bring to a low boil. Reduce heat to low; cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is al dente, about 15 minutes. Serve in bowls garnished with sour cream or queso anejo.
