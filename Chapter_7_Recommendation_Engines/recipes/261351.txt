Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
5 slices pancetta, chopped
1 leek, sliced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 (16 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (16 ounce) can kidney beans, with liquid
2 potatoes, cubed
1 (16 ounce) can beef broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, with liquid
1/2 cup chopped carrots
1/2 cup chopped green beans
1/2 cup corn
1/2 cup celery, sliced
2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 cup radiatore pasta
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta, leek, and garlic; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes.
Transfer pancetta and leek to a slow cooker; add chicken broth, kidney beans, potatoes, beef broth, tomatoes, carrots, green beans, corn, celery, parsley, black pepper, basil, and salt. Cook on Low until vegetables are tender, about 4 hours.
Transfer about half the vegetables from the slow cooker to a blender using a slotted spoon. Cover blender and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour vegetable puree back into the slow cooker. Stir in garbanzo beans, cream, pasta, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Cook soup on High until flavors blend and pasta is cooked, about 1 hour.
Serve with remaining Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.
