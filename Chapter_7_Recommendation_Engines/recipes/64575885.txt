Ingredients:
9 ounces fresh peaches, each peach cut into eighths
3 Tbsp brown rice flour
2 Tbsp sorghum flour
2 Tbsp potato starch
1 Tbsp tapioca starch
1 tsp powdered milk, ground fine
Scant 1/4 cup cane sugar
1/2 tsp baking powder
pinch fresh ground nutmeg
1/2 cup milk, divided
2 Tbsp butter, softened
1.5 tsp vanilla sugar
butter for greasing a baking dish

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 175Â°C. Butter a small baking dish (7" x 5" x 2").
In a bowl, whisk together the flours and starches, powdered milk, cane sugar, baking powder, and nutmeg.
Add 1/3 cup of milk stirring the whole time. The batter should be thin like pancake batter. If it is not, add more milk one teaspoon at a time until a thin batter is achieved. You may not need all the milk, it will depend on your flours, some absorb liquids more.
Add softened butter and stir until just combined.
Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish. Add the peaches on top in one single layer. Do not push them into the batter. Just lightly place them on top of the batter.
Sprinkle the vanilla sugar evenly over the peaches.
Bake in a preheated oven until browned on the top and the edges, about 45 minutes.
Allow to cool about 4-5 minutes before serving. Top with fresh grated nutmeg and fresh whipped cream if desired. Serves two.
