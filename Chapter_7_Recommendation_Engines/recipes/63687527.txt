Ingredients:
1lb ground beef (lean 90/10 preferable)
1lb ground pork or Chorizo ground pork
1 small onion (yellow)
1 egg
1 (10.75 oz)can of tomato soup (Tomato paste or tomato sauce).
Two cups Italian style bread crumbs
Chopped green bell pepper.
Parmesan Cheese
Olive Oil
Garlic

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.                      Finely chop onion and green bell pepper.
Mix ground beef, ground pork (Chorizo), egg, tomato soup, bread crumbs, onion and bell pepper in a large bowl. Mix until well blended. Transfer mix into baking pan (I use an old roasting pan with a lid). Smooth out the mixture. You should grease pan with olive oil before adding ingredients.
Use your finger or a round tool to make three wholes length wise in the mixture.
You can pour ketchup or tomato paste on top of the ingredients, once in the pan.
Cook in oven for approximately 1 hour, check periodically until cooked through.
Serve and enjoy

When I made Meatloaf for the first time, I used the exact recipe, but after making it a few times, I adjusted the recipe to meet our flavor profile.
