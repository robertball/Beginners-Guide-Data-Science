Ingredients:
4 cups sliced yellow squash
3/4 cup chopped onion
35 saltine crackers, crushed
1 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Place squash and onion in a large pot over medium heat. Pour in enough water to cover veggies. Cover, and cook until squash is tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well, and place in a large bowl.
In a medium bowl, mix together cracker crumbs and cheese. Stir half of the cracker mixture into the cooked squash and onions. In a small bowl, mix together eggs and milk, then add to squash mixture. Stir in 1/4 cup melted butter, and season with salt and pepper. Spread into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining cracker mixture. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until lightly browned.
