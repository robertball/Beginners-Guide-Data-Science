4 cups frozen cherries, thawed
1 cup dried cherries
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Combine frozen cherries, dried cherries, white sugar, tapioca, and almond extract in a large mixing bowl; mix well.  ( It is not necessary to thaw cherries before using. )  Let cherry mixture stand 15 minutes.
Line a 9 inch pie pan with pastry.  Fill with cherry mixture.  Sprinkle with nutmeg.  Dot with butter or margarine.  Adjust top crust, cutting slits for steam to escape.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) about 1 hour, or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly.  If necessary, cover edge of crust with aluminum foil to prevent overbrowning.
