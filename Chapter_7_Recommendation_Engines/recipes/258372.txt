Ingredients:
Sauce:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 teaspoons ground dried chipotle pepper
1 lime, juiced
Fritters:
1 large egg white
1/4 cup ice water
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 cup self-rising flour
2 ears fresh sweet white corn, kernels removed from cob
1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
1 1/2 cups flaked fresh Dungeness crab meat
1 fresh lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Whisk mayonnaise, chipotle powder, and lime juice together in a mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed for serving.
Whisk egg white, ice water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl until mixture is light and foamy, 1 or 2 minutes. Add cornstarch and flour; whisk together until thoroughly mixed. Batter should resemble a thin pancake batter. Stir in corn.
Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a seasoned cast iron skillet. Spoon about 2 large spoonfuls of batter into oil for each fritter. Do not crowd, cook in batches, if necessary. Fry until browned and crispy, about 2 minutes per side. Turn fritters carefully to avoid spattering the oil. Drain on paper-towel-lined plate.
Serve topped with fresh Dungeness crab and drizzle with the chipotle dressing. Serve with a wedge of lime.

Description: 
Freshly shucked corn stars here, as does the thin, light, crispy batter. You can substitute shrimp or even ceviche for the crab.
