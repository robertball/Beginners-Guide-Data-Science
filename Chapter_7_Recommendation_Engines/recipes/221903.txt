Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) can fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAM®), cubed
1 (16 ounce) jar processed cheese sauce (such as Cheez Whiz®)
1 (4 ounce) jar chopped pimiento peppers with liquid
3/4 cup mayonnaise-style sandwich spread with chopped sweet pickle
15 slices white bread
15 slices whole wheat bread
1 teaspoon dried parsley, or to taste
1 small cucumber, thinly sliced

Directions:
Place luncheon meat cubes, processed cheese sauce, pimientos, and sandwich spread in a blender; pulse to blend into a smooth mixture, stopping often to scrape down blender sides. Transfer spread to a bowl.
Spread the mixture onto 15 slices of white bread; top each with a slice of whole wheat bread. Press sandwiches together lightly and cut off crusts. Slice sandwiches in half diagonally to make triangles; sprinkle sandwiches with parsley flakes and top each sandwich half with a piece of sliced cucumber.
