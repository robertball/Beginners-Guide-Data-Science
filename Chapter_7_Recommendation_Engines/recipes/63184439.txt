Ingredients:
3 nine inch pizzas worth of pizza dough
16 to 18 ounces chicken meat, boneless & skinless
Â¾ cup barbecue sauce
olive oil, for drizzling
salt for sprinkling
24 ounces Gouda cheese, sliced thin
1 red onion, cut in half and sliced very thin
Chopped cilantro, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Salt the chicken meat on all sides, then place in an ovenproof dish. Pour BBQ sauce over the meat and turn over to coat. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until chicken is done. Remove from oven and cut into a fine dice. Set aside.
Increase oven temperature to 500 degrees.
Roll/stretch out one pizza crust. Lay it on a sheet pan drizzled with olive oil. Drizzle a little olive oil on the crust, then sprinkle on a little salt.
Spoon a couple of tablespoons of extra BBQ sauce on the crust and spread it evenly. Top the sauce with one third of the sliced Gouda. Sprinkle on one third of the diced chicken and thinly sliced red onion.
Sprinkle again with a little salt, then bake for 15 to 17 minutes, or until crust is golden brown and toppings are bubbly.
Remove from the oven and sprinkle on chopped cilantro to taste. Cut and serve immediately.
Repeat with the other two crusts or save for another time.
