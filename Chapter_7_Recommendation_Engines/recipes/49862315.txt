Description: 
I usually make this bacon, lettuce, onion, pea, cheese and cauliflower layered salad in a large flat bowl. There's never too much because everybody loves it!  You can vary the salad by substituting green onions for red, jack cheese for the Cheddar, etc.Modified from: Seven Layer Salad
