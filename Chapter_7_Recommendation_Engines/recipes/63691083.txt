Description: 
These are deliciously moist muffins that that'll disappear quickly! Use carrot or zucchini, or both if you prefer. I make a batch of each, then put some in the freezer (in Ziploc bags) for later, which usually isn't very long! My entire family just loves them!Modified from: Pineapple Zucchini Muffins
