Ingredients:
1/2 Lb Bacon, cooked, cooled and crumbled
2 Cups Sweet Yellow, Spanish or Vidalia Onions, Chopped (about 1 1/2 large onions)
2 Cups Shredded Swiss Cheese
1 Cup Shredded Parmesan (fresh, not canned)
1 Cup Mayo (light, if desired)
1 Cup Sour Cream (light, if desired)
1/4 tsp Black Pepper
Ciabatta bread or french baguette, sliced for slathering

Directions:
Prehead oven eo 350 degrees.
Mix all ingredients in medium bowl and transfer to greased 2 qt casserole or 9x9x2 Square Baking dish.
Bake for 35 Minutes, until browned and bubbly.
Remove from oven and allow to cool for 10 - 12 minutes.  This allows the sugars in the onion to develop and sweeten.
Serve with sliced Ciabatta or French Baguette.

Description: 
A twist on the traditional baked onion dips out there.  The salty smokey bacon really adds something to the sweet onions.  If you like french onion soup, you'll LOVE this dip
