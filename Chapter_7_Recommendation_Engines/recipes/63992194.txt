Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Stir in flour, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring, until smooth. Remove from heat, and gradually stir in chicken broth and cream.
Return to heat, and bring to a low boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add sherry and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese then stir in cooked spaghetti, mushrooms, and chicken. Pour mixture into the prepared baking dish, and top with remaining parmesan cheese.
