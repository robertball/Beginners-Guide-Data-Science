Ingredients:
1 ½ cups curds/yoghurt
2 tablespoons besan (gram flour)
1 large onion, sliced thin
2 green chillies, chopped
½ teaspoon turmeric powder (haldi)
½ teaspoon red chilli powder
½ teaspoon garam masala
Salt to taste
1 sprig curry leaves (kadipatta)
1 tablespoon oil
½ teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)
For pakoda:
1 cup besan
1 ½ pinches soda bicarbonate
Salt and chilli powder to taste
Oil for deep frying

Directions:
For Kadhi: Mix curds, salt, turmeric powder, chilli powder, garam masala, and besan well. Add about 1 cup water so that the mixture is the consistency of lassi (buttermilk).
Heat oil in a saucepan. Add cumin seeds and fry till they splutter. Add the onions and curry leaves. Fry for 2 minutes. Add the curds mix and bring to a boil gradually, stirring continuously. Reduce the flame to simmer. Add green chilles and simmer till kadhi is thickened, about 10 minutes.
For pakoda: Mix besan, salt, chilli powder,and soda bicarb with water into a thick batter. Set aside for 5 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadhai. Take one heaped teaspoon of besan mixture at at time and deep fry until golden brown. Lay pakodas out on paper to drain. Add to hot kadhi 10 -15 minutes before serving.
