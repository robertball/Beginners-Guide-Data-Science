Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 cup whole milk
1 pinch dried oregano
1 pinch dried basil
1 pinch dried parsley

Directions:
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Whisk in flour and stir until combined and the flour loses its raw smell, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, oregano, basil, and parsley, and bring to a simmer, 3 to 5 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until thick, about 5 minutes.
