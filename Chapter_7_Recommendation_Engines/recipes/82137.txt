Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups oatmeal
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup shortening
2 eggs, beaten
5 tablespoons light molasses
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/2 cup raisins (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, oatmeal, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
In another large bowl, beat the sugar with the shortening until smooth and creamy; mix in beaten eggs, molasses, and vanilla. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients. Stir in walnuts and raisins. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until slightly browned. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This was my Grandmother's recipe from the 1940's. These cookies use molasses in place of brown sugar, which was one of the items rationed during the war (and harder to get than white sugar, they tell me). To me they're better than regular oatmeal cookies!
