Ingredients:
5-6 Chicken Breasts OR 5-6 steaks (top sirloin, rib-eye, whatever you like)
1 bottle Italine Dressing, one without cheese
1/4 to 1/2 c. soy sauce, depending on the amount of meat
1-2 Gallon Ziploc bags

Directions:
Rinse meat and put into ziploc bags.  If you marinate more than 5 pieces of meat, you may need to use an additional ziploc bag.  Pour into ziploc over meat 1/2 to 1 bottle of Italian dressing, enough to fill the bad half full with the meat in it.  Pour in soy sauce.  I usually just pour without measuring enough to make it a light golden color.  DO NOT make mixture darker than a light, golden color or the soy will make the meat too salty.  Secure the ziploc, make sure it won't leak!  Shake around so liquids mix well and meat is covered. Make you carefully squeeze the air for better covered over the meat.  Place in refrigerator and turn every 20-60 minutes, make sure the meat is covered with liquid.  For steak marinate a least 8 hours, overnight makes the meat more tender.  For chicken, marinade 3-4 hours.  Do not marinade chicken more than 6 hours and definately not overnight or it will be really salty.  Steak is tougher so it takes longer for it to absorb, therefore it doesn't get salty like the chicken does.
