Ingredients:
2 cups pecan halves
2 (12 ounce) bags chocolate chips
25 individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped
2 tablespoons water
1/2 cup butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange pecans on a baking sheet.
Bake pecans in the preheated oven until fragrant and lightly browned, 7 minutes.
Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; grease with butter.
Combine caramels, water, and butter in a saucepan over low heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until caramels are melted and smooth. Fold in pecans.
Drop caramel mixture by the spoonful onto the prepared baking sheet. Allow to cool and harden.
Drizzle chocolate over caramel nut clusters. Refrigerate to set, about 1 hour.
