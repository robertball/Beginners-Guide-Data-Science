Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon peel
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3/4 pound beef flank steak, cut into thin strips
3 green onions, thinly sliced
4 (8 inch) flour tortillas
Salsa

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the oil, lemon juice, garlic, lemon peel, chili powder and pepper. Place half in a resealable plastic bag; cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Add meat to bag. Seal and turn to coat; refrigerate for 4-8 hours.
Drain and discard marinade. In a skillet, heat reserved marinade. Add meat and green onions. Cook and stir until meat reaches desired doneness. Using a slotted spoon, place about 1/2 cup meat mixture down the center of each tortilla. Top with salsa if desired. Fold sides over meat mixture.
