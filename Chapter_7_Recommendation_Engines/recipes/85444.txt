Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 pound pork sausage
3 eggs
1/2 cup ketchup
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, sausage, eggs, 1/2 cup of ketchup and bread crumbs until well blended. Pat into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Drain off some of the fat once in a while to keep spattering to a minimum. Enjoy!
