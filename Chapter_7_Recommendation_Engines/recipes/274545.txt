Ingredients:
1 tablespoon avocado oil, or as needed
11 small poblano peppers, halved lengthwise, stems and seeds removed
3/4 pound cooked chicken, skinned and shredded
2 ounces shredded Parmesan cheese
2 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup Greek yogurt
1 egg
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 pinch smoked Spanish paprika, or to taste
1/2 small onion, sliced into half-rings

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with avocado oil.
Arrange poblano peppers in the prepared baking dish.
Combine chicken, Parmesan cheese, Cheddar cheese, yogurt, egg, oregano, cumin, black pepper, and salt in a mixing bowl. Spoon liberally into pepper halves. Sprinkle with paprika and add 1 or 2 onion slices on top of each pepper.
Bake, uncovered, until bubbly and softened, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This variation on chiles rellenos (stuffed chile peppers) uses leftover chicken as stuffing. We originally developed it with the carcass of a beer-can chicken (chicken given a barbecue rub and then roasted on a can of beer on a grill); another option would be a rotisserie chicken. We made this with poblano and Cajun bell peppers from our backyard garden; feel free to experiment with hotter peppers.

 Serve with a green vegetable and your salsa of choice.
