Ingredients:
1 tomato, chopped
1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 large onion, minced
2 scallions, chopped
2 (1 pound) fillets salmon
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter, cut up (optional)
1 lemon, sliced

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking dish with enough aluminum foil to be able to fold over ingredients.
Stir together the tomato, mushrooms, onion, and scallions in a bowl; spread into the bottom of the prepared dish. Lay the salmon fillets over the mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Dot the salmon with the butter. Arrange the lemon slices atop the butter pieces. Fold the foil over the salmon, and press edges together to seal.
Bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 1 hour.
