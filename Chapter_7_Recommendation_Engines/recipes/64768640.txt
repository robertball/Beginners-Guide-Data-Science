Ingredients:
3 Tablespoons - 100% Pure Avocado Oil by Chosen Foods
1 cup - Organic Unsweetened Coconut Flakes
1 1/2 Tablespoons - Cajun Seasoning
1 1/2 pounds - Organic, boneless, skinless chicken thighs
4 cups - Baby Spinach
1/2 cup - Celery, chopped
1/2 cup - Green Onions, chopped
1 cup - Classic Ranch Dressing by Marzetti

Directions:
Preheat over to 375 degrees and heavily grease a rimmed baking sheet with the avocado oil.
Place the coconut in a blender or food processor and pulse until coarsely ground, but not to powder.
Combine the coconut and Cajun seasoning in a medium-sized bowl.  Toss to combine.
Place the chicken between 2 pieces of plastic wrap.  Pound the chicken until it's 1/4 inch thick.  Transfer to the bowl of seasoned coconut and roll it around until well coated.  Place the breaded chicken on the prepared baking sheet.  Bake for 25 minutes. For extra crispy, broil for 1 minute after it is done baking.
Meanwhile, divide the spinach among 4 large dinner plates.  Top with celery and green onions.  Divide the dressing among 4 small ramekins and set to the side of the salads.
Slice the chicken and divide among the salads.
