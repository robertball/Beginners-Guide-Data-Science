Ingredients:
1/4 C flour
1/4 tsp salt
1/8 tsp pepper
1TBS oil & pat of butter for browning steaks
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup chicken stock
1 sweet onion chopped
3 cloves of garlic minced
1 lb sliced mushrooms
4 pork steaks

Directions:
Mix flour, salt and pepper and dredge steaks.  Shake off excess flour and lightly spank each side of steaks to get the coating in the meat.  Reserve a TBS of flour mixture.
Place the pork steaks in the  hot skillet (butter pat and oil) over med heat & brown well on each side.  Remove to plate and cover with foil. Add mushrooms and onions to pan, and cook about 5 minutes, then add minced garlic and warm through.   Sprinkle the reserved TBS of flour mixture onto mushrooms and onions.  Add 1/4 C chicken stock and stir to deglaze pan.
Add the soy sauce And 1/4 C butter.  Return steaks and their juices to the pan and cover.  Can cook on stove top, Cook at 350 in oven for 30 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).  Or in your slow cooker until you are good and ready. :)
Delicious with mashed potatoes, pasta or rice.  I often double the sauce.
Serve with vegetable of your choice, ( mine is asparagus) a crisp salad and some dinner rolls or crusty bread.  Y u m!
