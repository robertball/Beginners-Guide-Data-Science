Ingredients:
1 Package of Crescent Roll Dough (butter flake, makes 8)
1/4-1/2 Cup Mango Preserves
Red Pepper Flakes
2 Slices Deli Ham
4-5 Slices Deli Chesse
5-7 Stalks of Asparagus
Grated Parmesan

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Roll the dough out on a floured surface making sure to keep the crescent dough in 1 single piece. Using a rolling pin flaten out the dough and seal the seams together. Do not seperate into triangles.
Mix the Mango preserves in a bowl with a couple shakes of the Red Pepper Flakes; make this as hot or as mild as you like. Using a spatula spread the preserves on the sheet of dough. Keep about a 1/2 an inch plain on both of the small sides.
Evenly layer starting with the Ham, then add the Cheese of your liking. Place the asparagus on the dough running horizontally along the longer side of the dough, leaving a gap in between each stalk. Sprinkle with grated cheese and roll up; this should end up as a long tube. Cut the tube into 1 inch pieces.
Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray. Place the rolls cut side up on the sheet.
Bake for 11-13 min. Best served warm!
