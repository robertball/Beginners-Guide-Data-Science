Heat bacon grease in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot bacon grease until onions are softened, 5 to 7 minutes.

Description: 
I love refried beans but don't always have the time to work with dried beans. This recipe uses canned beans and still tastes like I spent all day on it. Sometimes I crumble bacon on top of the finished product.
