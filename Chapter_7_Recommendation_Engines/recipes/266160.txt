Description: 
If you prefer savory pork chops instead of sweet ones, give this recipe a try. It has a good garlic flavor with just a hint of kick from the chile powder. The marinade is designed to brine and marinate the meat at the same time, producing a more tender result. Don't let the cooking time scare you: these are very easy to make, and require very little attention on your part.
