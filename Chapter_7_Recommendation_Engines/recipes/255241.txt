Ingredients:
3 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon beef bouillon granules
1/4 pound pork sausage
1/2 pound beef top sirloin, thinly sliced
3 green onions, chopped
1/4 white onion, thinly sliced, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3/4 cup sour cream, or more to taste
5 cups egg noodles, or more to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken broth and beef bouillon in a bowl.
Cook sausage in a skillet over medium heat until brown and crumbled, about 5 minutes. Add beef, green onions, white onion, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper. Stir in 1 tablespoon of soy sauce; cook and stir until flavors combine, 2 to 4 minutes.
Sprinkle flour onto the beef mixture; stir until absorbed, about 1 minute. Stir in broth mixture; bring to a boil. Add remaining 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. Reduce heat; simmer until beef is cooked through and onions are tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
Remove beef mixture from heat; stir in sour cream.
Fill a pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. Transfer to a serving plate; top with beef mixture.
