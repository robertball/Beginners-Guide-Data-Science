Ingredients:
6 bone in chicken breasts
1/4 full stalk celery chopped
1 small red onion chopped
2 tblsp chopped garlic
2 cans mandarin oranges
2 cups sliced red grapes
2 cups walnut pieces
Real Mayonaise

Directions:
Boil drain and cool chicken breasts.  You can use canned chicken but fresh is so much better tasting.
Debone chicken and shred by hand or chop. Leave chunky.
Add onion, mandarin oranges, sliced grapes, chopped garlic and walnuts.
Add 2 big scoops of mayo and start tossing gently.  I use my hands.
Orange slices will fall apart and that is fine.  Add mayo just until salad begins to bind.  Don't go overboard!
Salt and pepper to taste.
Secret ingredient:  Add a touch of cayenne pepper for a slight kick of heat.
