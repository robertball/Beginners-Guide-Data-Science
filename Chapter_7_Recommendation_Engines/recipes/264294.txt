Ingredients:
2 1/2 (8 ounce) containers plain yogurt
3/4 cup mango puree
5 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
2 tablespoons crushed almonds

Directions:
Line a colander with a clean piece of cheesecloth. Place colander over a tall vessel to collect the dripping water.
Pour yogurt onto the cheesecloth and gently twist the ends. Tie the ends into a knot above the yogurt. Let drain and thicken in the refrigerator, 5 hours to overnight.
Whisk yogurt, mango puree, confectioners' sugar, and cardamom in a bowl until well blended. Refrigerate shrikhand for 1 to 2 hours. Garnish with crushed almonds and serve chilled.
