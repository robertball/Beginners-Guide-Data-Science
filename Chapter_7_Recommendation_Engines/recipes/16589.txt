Ingredients:
½ pound smoked sausage, sliced thinly
½ pound fresh button mushrooms
3 tablespoons chopped green onion
1 teaspoon minced garlic
4 tablespoons blue cheese salad dressing, divided
3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 tablespoon Cajun-style seasoning

Directions:
To Make Stuffing: Brown sausage in a large skillet over medium high heat; once sausage starts to brown, add mushrooms and saute for 5 minutes, then add green onion and garlic and saute for another 2 minutes. Remove stuffing mixture from heat, put in a food processor and add 1 tablespoon salad dressing. Process slowly in processor, roughly chopping.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cut 2 inch slits in sides of chicken breasts and stuff with as much stuffing as breast will hold. Season both sides of breasts liberally with Cajun-style seasoning and sear in a hot skillet for 1 to 2 minutes per side, then place in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with leftover stuffing and remaining 3 tablespoons salad dressing.
Bake at 375 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
