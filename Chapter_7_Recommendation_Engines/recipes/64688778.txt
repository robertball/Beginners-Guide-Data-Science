Ingredients:
1 c white rice flour
a sprinkle of xantham gum (no more than 1/2 t)
1/2 c powdered sugar (10x)
18 large egg whites (do not use extra large)
2 t cream of tartar
pinch of salt
1 1/2 c granular sugar
1 t real vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to  350 degrees.
1. Sift the first 3 ingredients 5 times with a sieve.
2. Start to beat the egg whites on high speed in a very large and high sided mixing bowl. When the whites start to get fluffy, add the cream of tartar and salt.
3. When stiff peaks form, add the vanilla and sugar.
4. Use a very large and flat bowl (think punch bowl) and dollop some egg whites on the bottom and then sprinkle the flour mixture on top. Continue to layer the egg whites and flour mixture. Gently fold the mixture together.
5. Spoon the batter into your round, 2-part, angel food pan (do not use a bundt pan).
6. Bake for 50-60 minutes or until the top (bottom) is brown and a knife comes out clean.
7. When done, shut off the oven, open the door and let the cake rest no more than 5 minutes before you flip it upside down and rest it on a wine bottle to cool completely (wine bottle top and neck in the hole).
8. When cool, flip back and run a knife around the edge if needed to loosen and then flip over onto cake stand. Cut with a clean serrated knife (clean the blade every few cuts).
Pitfalls:
-Letting it cool too long before flipping it onto the bottle ==> starts to fall.
-Not baking it long enough ==> wet inside, falls
-Any grease anywhere ==> You cannot make an angel food with any grease! Egg whites will fall!
-Stirring instead of folding==>flat, fallen cake
-Not sifting ==> flatter cake
