Ingredients:
Dough:
•	1 package (1/4 oz) rapid rise yeast
•	¼ cup warm water (110-115 degrees)
•	¾ cup warm milk (110-115 degrees)
•	1 egg
•	2 tbs. butter, melted
•	¼ cup orange marmalade
•	1 tsp. salt
•	½ cup old-fashioned oatmeal
•	3 cups bread flour
•	1 egg white
•	1 tsp. water
Filling:
•	1 ½ cups fresh or frozen chopped cranberries
•	6 tbs. brown sugar
•	6 tbs. water
•	1 ½ tbs. butter
•	6 tbs. chopped walnuts
•	1 ½ tbs. lemon juice
Glaze:
•	½ cup powdered sugar
•	1 tsp. orange juice concentrate

Directions:
For dough, in a large mixer bowl, combine yeast and warm water. Stir to dissolve. Add warm milk, egg, butter, and orange marmalade. Stir to combine. Mix together salt, oats, and flour, add to wet ingredients and stir to moisten. Knead dough for 6-8 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat both sides of dough. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine cranberries, sugar, and water. Cook over medium heat 10-15 minutes, or until cranberries begin to soften. Remove from heat, stir in butter, walnuts, and lemon juice. Cool.
Punch dough down. On a floured surface, roll dough into a 10”x20” rectangle. Beat together egg white and water, brush some lightly over dough. Spread cooled filling on top within 1” of the edge. Roll dough up, jelly-roll style, starting with a long end. Seal edges, cut off any tapered sides that the filling didn’t reach. Transfer roll to a large square baking sheet, form a circle shape, sealing edges together. With a sharp kitchen shears, make cuts 2/3 of the way to the center at 1” intervals. Twist each slice gently to expose the swirled side. Gently shape the bread into a perfect ring. Cover and allow to rise until doubled, about 20-25 minutes. Preheat oven to 350; bake ring for 25 minutes or until golden brown and done. Cool on pan for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack. Cool completely. To make glaze, stir together sugar and concentrate. Add enough water to make a glaze-like consistency. Drizzle over tea ring. Allow glaze to set before cutting.
