Description: 
Not your regular meatloaf! This sweet and savory loaf is enhanced with the textures of raisins and almonds and the spiciness of curry. Pleasantly different. If using high quality curry, use 1 1/2 tablespoons; most store bought curries are not as flavorful so use more. If looking for more sweetness, try adding apricot preserves or a fruit chutney.
