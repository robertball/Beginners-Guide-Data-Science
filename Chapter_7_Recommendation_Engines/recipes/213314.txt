Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
6 bone-in pork chops
1 (10.5 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed French Onion Soup
1/2 cup water
ground black pepper
1 stalk celery, chopped
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 cup uncooked regular long-grain white rice

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook until well browned on both sides. Pour off any fat.
Stir the soup, water, black pepper, celery, thyme and rice in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 30 minutes or until the pork is cooked through and the rice is tender, stirring the rice occasionally.

Description: 
Only one skillet is needed to make this scrumptious pork dish....the rice actually cooks right in the skillet with the rest of the ingredients.  It couldn't be easier.
