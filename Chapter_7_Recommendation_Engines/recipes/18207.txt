Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1/4 medium head cabbage, shredded
6 cups chicken broth
2 (14.5 ounce) cans peeled and diced tomatoes
3 1/2 cups water
1 cup elbow macaroni
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute the carrots, celery and cabbage in the oil for about 8 minutes, stirring well.
Raise heat to high and pour in the broth, tomatoes and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 1 hour.
Remove lid, stir in macaroni and heat for 5 minutes, or until macaroni is tender. Remove from heat and stir in the garlic and ground black pepper.

Description: 
This is a great tasting soup recipe shown to me by my Auntie Ethel Sabourin. It's a vegetable soup, but you add the garlic at the end to give it a strong garlicky flavor.
