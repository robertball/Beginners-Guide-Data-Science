Ingredients:
1 Lb Lean Hamburger
1 Lb Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage
1/2 cup Fresh Cilantro, coarsely chopped
1 8oz can Chipotle Peppers in Adobo sauce, coarsely chopped
2 Tbl Ground Cumin
1 Tbl Kosher Salt (optional)
1 Tsp Fresh Ground Pepper (optional)

Directions:
Prepare Charcoal grill for medium high heat.
Place all ingredients in a large bowl. Ensure you add the sauce from the Chipotle Peppers. Gently mix the meat till just mixed.  Avoid over mixing the ingredients.
Divide the meat into equal portions of your choosing.  This recipe will yield 8 each 1/2 lb patties (precooked).   Avoid "compacting" the patties.  Shape them into a ball and gently flatten them to 3/4 - 1" in thickness.
Optional - Season the patties with salt and pepper.
Grill the patties approximately 5 minutes per side to achieve "medium".  Adjust to your taste.

Description: 
I tried this recently from ingredients I had on hand.  These burgers, while not exactly the healthiest, were amazing!  Juicy and flavorful, with a little kick to them.
