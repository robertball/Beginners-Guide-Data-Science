Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium onions, chopped
2 leeks, white parts only, thinly sliced
2 cups coarsely shredded red cabbage
2 stalks celery, diced
1 large carrot, peeled and diced
1 medium parsnip, peeled and diced
1 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 (32 fluid ounce) containers vegetable broth, or more as needed
2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 medium turnip, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1 cup winter squash, 3/4-inch cubes
1/4 cup barley
1 cup frozen lima beans
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large stockpot over medium heat. Saute onions and leeks until softened, about 5 minutes.
Add cabbage, celery, carrot, and parsnip. Increase heat to medium-high and mix thoroughly. Cover and cook, stirring once or twice, until vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes. Uncover and add ginger, cumin, and nutmeg. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
Add broth, potatoes, turnip, squash, and barley to the pot. Bring to a boil, then add lima beans. Add additional broth or water if soup is too thick. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until barley is tender, about 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
