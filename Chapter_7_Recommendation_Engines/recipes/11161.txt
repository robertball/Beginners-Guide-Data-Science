Ingredients:
1 cup peanut butter
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
3 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, chopped
1 tablespoon shortening

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the peanut butter and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Stir in graham cracker crumbs until well blended. Form the dough into 1 inch balls by rolling in your hands, or by using a cookie scoop.
Melt the semisweet chocolate chips, semisweet chocolate squares, and the shortening in the top half of a double boiler. Use a fork to dip the balls into the melted chocolate, and place on wax paper to cool until set.
