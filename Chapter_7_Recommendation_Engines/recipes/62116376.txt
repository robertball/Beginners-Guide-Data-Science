Ingredients:
3-4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1/2 teaspoon of seasoning salt
1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon of cracked black pepper
1 cup of ranch dressing or to cover chicken

Directions:
First take the boneless and skinless chicken and pound out to approximately 1/2 inch. I find by doing this step the chicken has more surface area to acquire the flavors during the marinading process.
Next sprinkle your seasoning salt, pepper and garlic powder on the chicken and rub in on both sides.
Pour some ranch dressing in the bottom of a 9x13 pan just enough to cover bottom then place the chicken on top of the dressing then add more dressing on top of the chicken so the chicken is totally saturated with the dressing. LET MARINADE FOR AT LEAST 4 HOURS. 6 hours is even better.
Heat grill medium heat and then cook the chicken thoroughly till juices run clear, discard marinade.
