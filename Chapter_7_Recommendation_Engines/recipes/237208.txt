Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 cups rolled oats
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup boiling water
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 tablespoons chia seeds
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup canola oil
2 2/3 tablespoons agave nectar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1 lemon, zested

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray miniature loaf pans with cooking spray.
Mix oats and salt together in a bowl. Pour 1 cup boiling water over oats and stir until oats are evenly moistened.
Stir 1/4 cup water and chia seeds together in a bowl until seeds start to gelatinize, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir honey, canola oil, agave nectar, vanilla extract, lemon extract, and lemon zest into oat mixture. Stir chia seed mixture into oat mixture. Beat oat-chia seed mixture using an electric mixer on low until batter is well combined. Spread batter into the prepared loaf pans, pressing with a spatula to evenly distribute.
Bake in the preheated oven until sides are slightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, 3 to 5 minutes; cut into slices.

Description: 
I came up with this when I wanted a quick, healthy breakfast that I could grab while I was taking care of a newborn. I had to omit dairy, eggs, and wheat from my diet due to her allergies. This recipe is the result of a desire to have my baked goods and make baby happy too.
