Ingredients:
1 lb ground turkey
2 tbs. vegetable oil
2 tsp. chili powder (depending on how spicy you want it)
1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. pepper
3-4 celery stalks, diced
2 medium onions, diced
1 red pepper, diced
2-3 garlic cloves (or equivelent of garlic powder)
3 (14? oz.) cans of black beans, undrained
2 (14.5 oz.) cans of diced tomatos, undrained
2 (14.5 oz.)cans of chicken broth
More chili powder to taste

Directions:
1. Put oil in large pot along with the ground turkey. Break the turkey up into small pieces, and brown while adding the chili powder, salt and pepper. Brown the turkey over medium heat, but do not cook completely just yet.
2. Once turkey is about 2/3 of the way done, add the celery, onion, red pepper and garlic. Saute for about 2 minutes.
3. Mix in well the black beans and tomatoes and cook medium-high to finish cooking the turkey. Stir so that nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot.
4. When the turkey is done, add the chicken broth and enough chili powder to lightly cover to the top.
5. Bring to a boil. Then reduce to simmer. Usually best after simmering for 2-3 hours.
