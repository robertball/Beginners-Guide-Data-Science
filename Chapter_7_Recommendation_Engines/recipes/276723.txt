Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Toss Brussels sprouts with olive oil, garlic powder, black pepper, and salt. Spread onto a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Roast in the preheated oven, shaking every 5 minutes, until crispy and fork-tender, about 20 minutes. Toss with balsamic vinegar and sprinkle with Parmesan. Continue roasting until melted, about 1 minute more. Sprinkle with red pepper.
