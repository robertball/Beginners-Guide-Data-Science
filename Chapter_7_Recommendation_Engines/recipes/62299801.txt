Ingredients:
1/3 cup water
4 teaspoons nutritional yeast (available at most health food stores)
1 tablespoon oat flour
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon tahini
2 teaspoons tomato paste or ketchup
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon onion granules
1/8 teaspoon each garlic granules, turmeric, dry mustard, and salt
4 slices bread

Directions:
To make the Melty American Cheeze, place all the ingredients except the bread in a 1-quart saucepan, and whisk them together until the mixture is smooth. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly with the whisk. Reduce heat to low, and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the cheese is very thick and smooth. Remove the saucepan from the heat.
Place two of the bread slices on a flat surface. Cover one side of each of the slices even with the cheese. Top with the remaing two slices.
Mist a 9-inch or 10-inch skillet with nonstick cooking spray or, or coat it with a thin layer of canola oil. Place the skillet over medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, add the sandwiches and brown them well on each side, carefully turning them over once with a spatula.
Serve!
