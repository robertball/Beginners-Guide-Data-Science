Ingredients:
•	2 cups cooked, mashed sweet potatoes
•	1 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
•	1/3 cup butter, softened
•	2 eggs (large or jumbo), separated, at room temperature
•	1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
•	1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
•	1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
•	1/4 teaspoon salt
•	1/2 cup half-and-half or evaporated milk
Mix all ingredients well and set aside  for the 2nd part. This is the most time consuming part of the recipe but it’s worth it.
STEP 2: Philadelphia® Cheesecake  (you can use generic; but I like theirs better; even their lite is still excellent)
Ingredients
2  packages (8 ounces each) PHILADELPHIA® Cream Cheese or PHILADELPHIA® Neufchâtel Cheese, 1/3 Less Fat than Cream Cheese, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 eggs
2 Graham Cracker Pie Crust

Directions:
BEAT cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until well blended. Add eggs. Make sure this is very smooth.
POUR into crust. 1st the Sweet Potato Pie filling on the bottom ½ of the pie pan – remember you have enough for 2 pies. Then pour on top of the Sweet Potato Pie the Cheesecake mix.
Extras: If you really want to richen your cake further – line the bottom of the cake pan with peacans or line the top of the sweet potato pie with pecans or the top of the cheesecake.
BAKE at 325°F, 50 minutes – 1 hr or until center is almost set. Let set before serving at least 1.5 hrs.
***Please watch this because the Cheesecake cooks faster. The oven is set lower so the cheesecake doesn’t burn – the sweet potato needs to cook a little longer (remember this)***

Description: 
Sweet Potatoe Pie  & a Cheesecake Recipe. You will be the envy of all. My neighbor was asking for the recipe upon 1st bite and so was everyone that tasted it. It is an envious pie/cake. This makes any pumpkin combo taste anorexic.
