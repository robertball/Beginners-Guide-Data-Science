Ingredients:
2 and 1/4lbs. of asparagus
salt
1/4 cup butter
1 and 1/4 cups  Arborio (risotto)rice
1 onion chopped fine
1 chicken cube  or chicken broth
freshly ground pepper
grated Parmesan cheese.
1 tbsp. butter ( or lactose free butter, Earth balance or Becel Vegan)
3-4 cups water.

Directions:
Soak asparagus for 10 minutes,rinse.
Cut off the tips and put aside.
Boil the stalks in 3cups of lightly salted water.
When tender,about 12 minutes,press the stalks through a fine meshed colonder,and put the pulp back in the cooking water,keep the water hot.
Melt the butter in a deep saucepan, over medium heat and saute the onion,and the asparagus tips for 5-7 minutes.
Add the rice mixing and turning with a wooden spoon until the rice is coated in the fat,so it is glossy.
Dilute the chicken cube in the hot asparagus water.
Add a little of the liquid to the rice,lower the heat,stir add more liquid as it reduces,until the rice is al dente,about 15-20 minutes.Add the ground pepper,taste and if needed, salt, if you wish.
Add the 1 tbsp. of butter and the cheese to the rice,stir well and serve immediately.*see notes*
Notes:
I use lactose free butter  and  put the cheese on the table
for those that choose to use it.
