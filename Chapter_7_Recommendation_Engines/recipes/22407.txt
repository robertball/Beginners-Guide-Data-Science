Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 tablespoons canola oil
3 tablespoons honey
1 1/2 cups oat bran
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/3 cups bread flour
1/2 cup flax seed meal
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Add water, yeast, canola oil and honey to the pan of the bread machine; stir to dissolve yeast. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, stir together oat bran, whole wheat flour, bread flour, flax seed meal and salt. Pour this mixture into the pan of the bread machine.  Select Whole Wheat cycle; press Start.
After the dough has risen, remove it from the bread machine and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Form into a loaf shape and place in a lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pan. Let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 30 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
