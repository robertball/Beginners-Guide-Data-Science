Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 onion, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1 green bell pepper, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1 red bell pepper, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1 (4 ounce) package mushrooms, sliced
1 (10 ounce) package seitan, thinly sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise
4 slices provolone cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer vegetable mixture to a bowl.
Pour remaining olive oil into the skillet over medium heat; add seitan and cook, turning frequently, until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Return vegetable mixture to skillet and mix with seitan; season with salt and pepper.
Arrange hoagie rolls on a baking sheet and fill with seitan-veggie mixture. Place 1 provolone cheese slice over the filling of each sandwich.
Heat sandwiches in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Quick, easy vegetarian dinner that is a guaranteed success! This recipe hinges on the quality of the seitan that is used. We make our own. For people in the Northeast, Susie'sÂ® sliced seitan is very good and comes in a variety of flavors. We add and subtract veggies based on what finicky kids will eat that day.
