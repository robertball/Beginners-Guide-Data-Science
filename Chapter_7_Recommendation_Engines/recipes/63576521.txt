Ingredients:
1 cup ketchup
4 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 tablespoon cider vinegar
1 tsp black pepper
2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 tsp hot pepper sauce
1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 tsp liquid smoke

Directions:
Combine and whisk together all ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat and allow to cool slightly before brushing on your favorite meat.
Keeps well for several weeks in the fridge, but it seldom lasts that long!

I cobbled this together from many recipes, until it had just the right amount of sweet, smoke and heat. I hope you like it!
