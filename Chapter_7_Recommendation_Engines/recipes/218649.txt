Ingredients:
4 pounds chicken leg quarters
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
1/4 cup tomato paste
1/2 cup dry white wine
3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup brandy
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 bay leaf
1 (10 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms

Directions:
Place the chicken legs into a large, heavy plastic bag, and add the flour. Close the bag and shake to coat all the chicken pieces with flour. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven, and brown the chicken leg quarters, working in batches if necessary, about 5 minutes per side.
Whisk together the tomato paste with white wine in a bowl, adding the wine gradually until the tomato paste and wine are well combined. Whisk in the chicken broth, brandy, salt, white pepper, thyme, and marjoram, and pour the mixture over the browned chicken legs. Mix in the sliced mushrooms. Bring the cacciatore to a boil over medium heat.
Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the chicken is tender and no longer pink at the bone and the sauce has thickened, about 1 hour.

Description: 
I love my mom's version of chicken cacciatore with mushrooms instead of onions and peppers. This was my favorite meal she cooked when I was growing up, and now that I am cooking for my own family, it is one of their favorites as well. Do not omit the wine or brandy from this recipe, they are key ingredients. The chicken and sauce are excellent when served over long pasta, such as spaghetti or linguine.
