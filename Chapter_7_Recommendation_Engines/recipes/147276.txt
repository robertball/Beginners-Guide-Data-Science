Ingredients:
4 pounds pork baby back ribs
3 tablespoons GREY POUPON Dijon Mustard
1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 cup A.1. STEAKHOUSE Marinade New York Steakhouse

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium heat. Place half of the ribs in single layer in center of each of two 30x12-inch sheets of heavy-duty foil. Spread mustard evenly onto both sides of ribs. Mix sugar and dry seasonings; rub evenly onto both sides of ribs. Bring up sides of each sheet of foil; double fold top and sides to seal, leaving room for heat circulation inside. (You will have two packets.)
Place ribs on grill; cover grill with lid. Grill 45 minutes to 1 hour or until ribs are cooked through. Remove ribs from foil; discard foil.
Return ribs to grill; brush with half of the marinade. Grill an additional 15 minutes, turning and brushing occasionally with the remaining marinade.
