Ingredients:
1 16 ounce bag of penne noodles, (rigatoni works well too, even spaghetti noodles - angel hair are too thin)
1 pound of ground turkey (or ground beef)
1 packet (envelope) of taco seasoning
1 cup of water
4 ounces of light cream cheese
1 8 ounce bag of shredded cheese (we used a Mexican Blend, but you can use whatever) - You will use 3/4 of the bag IN the pasta and the other 1/4 of the bag will be sprinkled over the dishes when you serve

Directions:
1. In a large pot, boil the noodles until they are cooked to your liking. We don't like our noodles al dente, so we don't do that, but if you'd like that, go right ahead.
2. Drain the pasta and set aside for a few minutes.
In a pan, brown the ground turkey or the ground beef, depending on your choice.
3. Once the meat is browned, drain grease, then sprinkle the taco seasoning over the top of the meat, and then pour the cup of water in.
4. Mix it all together in the pan and allow it to simmer for about 5 minutes.
5. Add the four ounces of cream cheese into the meat mixture and stir until it is melted.
6. Put the pasta back in the large pot and then pour the meat mixture on top. Mix together and heat over low to medium heat.
7. Sprinkle 3/4 of the shredded cheese into the Taco Bake and stir until melted.
8. Serve in bowls and divide & sprinkle the remaining shredded cheese over each bowl.
