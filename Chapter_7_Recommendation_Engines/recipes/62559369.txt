Ingredients:
1 (14.5oz) box whole grain Rotini pasta
15 ounces Part-Skim milk ricotta cheese
13 ounces reduced fat mozzarella cheese- shredded
1 ounce parmesan cheese (plus more to top servings)
4 Cups fresh chopped spinach
1 egg
Salt/pepper
Sauce- You can use a pre-made jar sauce or make your own marinara sauce

Directions:
Cook pasta according to directions- I like to cook it al dente. Put aside. In a large bowl add ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, egg- mix well. Add in chopped fresh spinach- mix. Add in cooked pasta, again mix well.
In a 9X13 pyrex pan add a couple ladles of sauce, top with pasta/cheese mix then more sauce. I like to reserve some sauce to top my serving with after it bakes.
Bake on 400 degrees F, for 15 minutes or until cheese has melted and top begins to lightly brown and bubble.
Top with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and serve
