Ingredients:
3 Tablespoons crushed almonds (Optional)
1 pound summer squash
2 1/2 Tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 minced large garlic cloves
Kosher salt
Fresh ground black pepper
Shaved parmesan cheese

Directions:
Roast crushed almonds until warmly browned.
Trim the ends off the summer squash.  Then using a vegetable peeler, thinly slice the quash lengthwise into strips and place in a large bowl.
In a small bowl, whisk together extra-virgin olive oil, fresh lemon juice, minced garlic and kosher salt to taste.
Pour dressing over squash.  Let it set for about 30 minutes and chill.  (More time is ok too if you would like to prepare ahead of time)
Season with the salt and freshly ground pepper.
Sprinkle the shaved parmesan cheese on top.
Garnish with crushed almonds if desired.
Serve!
