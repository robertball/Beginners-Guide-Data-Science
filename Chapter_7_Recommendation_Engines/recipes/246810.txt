Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded to an even thickness
4 slices prosciutto
4 fresh sage leaves
1 tablespoon butter
3 fluid ounces dry white wine, or more as needed
1 pinch salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place chicken breasts on a sheet of parchment paper. Lay 1 slice prosciutto and 1 sage leaf on each chicken breast. Roll chicken from the short end and secure with wooden skewers.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; add rolled chicken and cook until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add wine, salt, and pepper; cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
