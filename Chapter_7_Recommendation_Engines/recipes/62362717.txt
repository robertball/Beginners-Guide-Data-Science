Ingredients:
1 10 inch savoury pastry/pie crust, blind baked
1/4 cup caramelised onion jam
3/4 cup walnut peices
1 tsp salt
2 ripe pears, thinly sliced
1 cup blue cheese, crumbled
10 eggs
1/4 cup cream

Directions:
In a dry fry pan on medium heat, stir the walnuts with the salt until the walnuts are lightly toasted.
In a large measuring cup or bowl with a pouring spout, gently mix the eggs and cream until just blended (Do not beat) and set aside.
Spread the caramelised onions evenly on the base of the pastry.  Layer half of the pear slices evenly in the dish. Pour in about half the egg mixture, until the pears are just covered.  Sprinkle half of the walnuts and half of the blue cheese evenly onto the egg mix.  Layer the remaining pears evenly.  Add the remainder of the egg mix and top evenly with the remaing walnuts and blue cheese.  If desired, set-aside 6 pear slices and a bit of blue cheese to decorate the top.
Bake at 350 F (180 C) for about 45 minutes or until the center appears set.  Cool thoroughly before cutting.  Rewarm individual peices to serve.

Description: 
We often have pear, walnut and blue cheese salad in the summer, so when winter rolled around I decided to try the brilliant flavor combination in a quiche, and it is fantastic.  Great flavor and great texture/mouth feel.
