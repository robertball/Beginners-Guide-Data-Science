Ingredients:
48 large fresh mushrooms
19 ounces ground Italian sausage
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
8 ounce cream cheese, softened
2 TBSP fresh parsley, finely chopped
1 TBSP lemon juice
3 gloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
2 TBSP EVOO

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Remove mushroom stems and discard, set caps aside. Place mushroom caps on foil-lined baking sheets; set aside. Remove sausage casings (if needed). In a skillet, heat EVOO over medium heat and cook and crumble sausage until no longer pink; drain.
Remove from heat. Stir in bread crumbs and set aside. In a bowl, combine the cream cheese, parsley, lemon juice, and garlic until smooth. Combine cream cheese mixture and sausage. Fill each cap with sausage and cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until mushrooms are tender and lightly browned. For the finishing touch, drizzle with EVOO
