Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
juice of 1 lemon
2-4 tbsp hot sauce (I used Frank's)
3 cloves garlic, minced (I used frozen garlic cubes)
1 tbsp tomato paste
2 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp salt (or a little less)
1 tsp ground black pepper
1.5 lbs large shrimp, peeled and deveined
skewers (optional)

Directions:
Mix together all ingredients except shrimp.  Reserve a small bowl of marinade to baste the shrimp.  Place shrimp in a gallon plastic bag and pour the rest of the marinade over the shrimp.  Marinate in refrigerator for 2 hours, occasionally moving around the shrimp in the marinade.
If using skewers, soak skewers in water for 30 minutes.  Then thread shrimp onto skewers and place onto grill with a little olive oil.  If not using skewers, place shrimp in a grill pan with a little olive oil.
Grill until opaque and firm, basting frequently with reserved marinade.
