Ingredients:
2 small boxes of instant cheesecake pudding (white chocolate pudding also works)
1 (32 oz) container of low fat strawberry yogurt
1 (16 oz) container of light Cool-Whip
16 oz. frozen mixed berries, partially thawed
3 large fresh bananas, sliced
1 lb. fresh strawberries, sliced

Directions:
Pour yogurt into a large bowl and mix in pudding (it will be kind of lumpy). Fold in the Cool-Whip (the lumps will go away as you stir it). Add all of the fruit and stir to combine. Keep refrigerated.
