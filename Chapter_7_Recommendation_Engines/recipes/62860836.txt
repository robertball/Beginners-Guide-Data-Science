Ingredients:
6 Cups chopped, cauliflower (fresh or frozen)
Water for boiling
2 Tablespoon sour cream
1 Tablespoon butter
Salt and pepper to taste
8 Ounces shredded cheddar cheese
2 Tablespoons real bacon bits
1 Tablespoon chives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Add the cauliflower and boil 5-10 minutes or until fork tender.
Drain the cauliflower and stir in sour cream, butter, salt, and pepper. Mash to desired texture, from coarse to creamy, adding more sour cream for a creamier consistency.
Transfer cauliflower mixture to a baking dish and top with cheese and bacon bits. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
Sprinkle with chives and serve. Top with a dollop of sour cream if desired.
