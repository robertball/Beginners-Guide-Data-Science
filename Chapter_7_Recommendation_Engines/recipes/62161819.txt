Ingredients:
8 cups water
4 tea bags
1 1/2 cups sugar (or Splenda, if you desire to cut calories at bit)
1 750 ml bottle Sweet Tea Vodka (there are a few different brands, any will do)
1 fresh lemon, cut into wedges
ice

Directions:
Brew sweet tea as follows: (You will want to plan ahead and brew tea the day before serving to allow it to fully chill) Bring water to boil in large pot, add tea bags, cover pot and steep for 1 hour. Remove tea bags and stir in the sugar until fully dissolved. Pour into pitcher or covered container and place in refrigerator to chill. When ready to serve fill glass 1/2 full of ice. Pour Sweet Tea vodka over ice to fill glass 1/2 way. Squeeze juice from a lemon wedge into glass and then drop the wedge into glass. Fill the rest of the glass up with the brewed sweet tea. Stir to mix. AHHHHH, perfection!!!!
(You may like to mix up a large batch in a pitcher, just use equal amounts of the Sweet Tea vodka and brewed sweet tea but don't put the ice in it. Fill your individual glasses with ice, squeeze and add a lemon wedge to each before pouring the Twisted Southern Sweet Tea in them.)

This grown-up sweet tea goes down easy and carries a wallop! May convert Long Island Iced Tea fans! Wonderful to sip on those long hot dog-day afternoons under the shade of the porch or big willow tree, as well as warm summer nights spent under the stars.
