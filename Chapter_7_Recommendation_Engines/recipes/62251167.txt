Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package quick rise active dry yeast
4 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 cup canned sweet potato puree
1/2 cup warm water (120-130 degrees )F
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
4 1/2-5 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Dissolve yeast, warm water, and 1  sugar in a mixing bowl.  Let stand 5 minutes.
Add remaining  sweet potato, butter, salt, and slightly beaten eggs.  Stir to mix well.  Stir in 4-1/2 cups of flour.  Turn out on a lightly floured surface.  Knead  5 to 10 minutes, adding just enough of remaining flour to  prevent sticking.   Do not knead too heavily.
Allow dough to rest for 10 minutes.  Divide into 16 to 20 balls, and place on a greased cookie sheet or in a 9x13 inch pan.  Allow to rise until doubled.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 to 20 minutes.  Serve warm.
