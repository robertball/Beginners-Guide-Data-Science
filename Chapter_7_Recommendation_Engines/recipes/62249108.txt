Ingredients:
Sticky Buns
Make sweet bread dough in breadmaker, using manufacturerâ€™s recipe.
Melt 1/2 cup butter. Add 3/4 cup brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of corn syrup; mix well. Pour into 9X13 baking pan (metal works best), sprinkle with nuts and/or raisins.
When dough is ready to shape, pat it out into about a 10- by 14-inch rectangle,  and spread with 1/4 cup melted butter. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
Starting from long end, roll up, jelly roll fashion, pinching ends of dough when finished rolling.
Slice into 12 slices, using a very sharp knife. Lift each slice and place flat in pan. Let rise until doubled again.

Directions:
Bake at 400 degrees until brown and dough is baked through. It won't stick to a toothpick if it is ready.
Cover with a cookie tray or pan, carefully flip over holding onto pan and tray, tap on bottom, then left baking pan off. Scrape any loose raisins, etc. onto finished buns.
Let cool slightly.
