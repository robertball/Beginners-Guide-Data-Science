Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla
2 1/2 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
4 squares BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate, melted
1 (6 ounce) package BAKER'S Premium White Baking Chocolate
12 hard peppermint candies, crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat cream cheese, butter, sugar and vanilla in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add flour and baking soda; mix well. Blend in semi-sweet chocolate.
Shape tablespoonfuls of dough into 52 balls. Roll each ball into 3-inch-long rope. Place, 2 inches apart, on baking sheet, bending top of each slightly to resemble a candy cane.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned; cool 5 minutes on baking sheet. Transfer to wire racks; cool completely. Microwave white chocolate as directed on package; drizzle over cookies. Sprinkle with crushed candies. Let stand until chocolate is firm.
