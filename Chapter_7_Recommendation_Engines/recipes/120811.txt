Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) loaves frozen bread dough, thawed
3/4 cup chopped sweet red pepper
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
8 ounces thinly sliced deli roast beef, julienned
2 cups finely shredded Cheddar cheese
1 egg white
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Combine loaves of dough and shape into one ball. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 90 minutes.
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the red pepper, onion, garlic salt and Italian seasoning. Cover and microwave on high for 1 minute or until vegetables are tender.
Punch dough down. On a lightly floured surface, roll into a 15-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Combine the beef, cheese and red pepper mixture; spread over the dough to within 1/2 in of edges. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long edge; pinch seams and ends to seal. Place seam side down on a lightly greased baking sheet.
In a small bowl, beat egg white and water; brush over dough. Cut a slit with a sharp knife in top of dough. Bake at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
