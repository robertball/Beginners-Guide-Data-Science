Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) box Barilla® Gluten Free Elbows
2 cups heavy cream
2 cups organic milk
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 pound shredded pepperjack cheese
Salt and black pepper to taste
1 small fresh jalapeno pepper, minced
4 egg yolks, lightly beaten

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F.
Cook pasta 2 minutes shorter than recommended cook time.
In a small pot, heat milk and cream until begins to simmer. Mix corn starch with 2 tablespoons water to create a slurry. Add slurry to the cream mixture to thicken, then season with salt, pepper and jalapeno.
Slowly add 3/4 of the cheese into the sauce, whisking constantly.
Add pasta to the mixture and let it sit for 5 minutes.
Stir in yolks and place in a 9 x 9 greased baking dish.
Bake in the oven for approximately 15 minutes or until bubbling and slightly caramelized on the top.
