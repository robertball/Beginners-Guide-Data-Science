Ingredients:
3 potatoes, peeled
6 ounces bacon, chopped
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 teaspoon chopped garlic
1 cup chopped fresh tomatoes
salt and pepper to taste
6 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded
8 eggs

Directions:
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and chop.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Add the onions, peppers, garlic, tomatoes, and potatoes. Season with salt and pepper and cook until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.
Sprinkle vegetable mixture with cheese. Crack eggs into the pan a couple of inches apart. Cover pan and allow eggs to cook to desired firmness. Remove pan from heat and serve.

Description: 
Great for when you have a crowd for breakfast. Very hardy and filling, big boys and little boys just love it! I usually do all the prep work the night before so very little effort is needed in the morning. We like to serve it with hot French bread.
