Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups light brown sugar, packed
2/3 cup heavy cream, milk or evaporated milk
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter
1 cups pecan halves
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large, microwave safe bowl, combine sugar, cream (or milk), salt, butter and pecans.  Microwave 45 seconds to 1 minute on high. Stir.
Microwave 2 minutes. Stir and check temperature with a digital thermometer.
Continue to microwave for 2 minutes at a time, stirring and checking temperature until it reaches about 215 degrees.
At that point microwave for only 1 minute at a time, stirring and checking the temperature after each minute.  It is done when it reaches 235 degrees.
Let rest 1 minute.  Stir in vanilla and continue to stir 3 minutes more until it looses its glossy shine.
Drop by tablespoonfuls onto butcher paper or buttered waxed or parchment paper. The pralines should spread only a little. If mixture is runny, stir for 30 more seconds and try again.
Let it rest at room temperature until it is cool and solid.
Optional: add 2 T cocoa powder in the beginning to make them chocolate pralines.

Description: 
A traditional New Orleans treat becomes incredibly easy to make!  
Picture shows the chocolate version all poured into one large one without nuts (it's for our 92 year old MawMaw, who has no teeth).
