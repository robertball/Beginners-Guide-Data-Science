Description: 
Living on the coast we are sometimes forced to evacuate during hurricane season. Put this pasta salad in a covered container, and throw it in the cooler. It's a full meal in one bowl. It's easy to serve. Spoon it up into a cup and eat it in the car, camper, or in our case, a motel room! That's why we call it Evacuation Tuna & Pasta Salad.
