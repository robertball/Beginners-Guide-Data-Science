Ingredients:
good-quality vanilla beans
vodka, rum or bourbon

Directions:
1. Cut the vanilla beans in half crosswise and then slice them in half again lengthwise.
2. Place several pieces (I use 6 pieces – or 1 1/2 whole beans worth – in my 4oz bottles) in a glass bottle or jar.
3. Fill completely to cover the beans with vodka.
4. Cover tightly and place in a cool, dark place for 2-3 months or longer for best flavor!
