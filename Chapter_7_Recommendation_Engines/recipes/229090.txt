Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, diced
2 teaspoons minced garlic
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup beef broth
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
3/4 teaspoon prepared mustard
1/4 cup light sour cream
1/4 cup light cream cheese, softened

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble ground beef into the hot skillet; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir beef until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Transfer beef to a bowl.
Melt butter in the skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot butter until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir flour into onion mixture; cook and stir until flour is browned, about 1 minute. Return beef to the skillet; stir. Pour beef broth over the mixture in the skillet; bring to a boil. Stir Worcestershire sauce and mustard through the mixture.
Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook mixture at a simmer until the consistency is gravy-like, about 1 hour.
Stir sour cream and cream cheese through the beef mixture to serve.

Description: 
I couldn't find a beef stroganoff recipe using ground beef that I liked anywhere, so I asked on Facebook, and one of my friends messaged me her personal recipe, which I tried and loved! Serve over egg noodles.
