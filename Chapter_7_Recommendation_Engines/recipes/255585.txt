Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork sausage
1/4 cup diced carrots
1/4 cup diced celery
1/4 cup minced onion
2 cups reduced sodium chicken broth
1 1/2 cups fresh baby spinach leaves
1 (5.4 ounce) package Knorr® Rice Sides™ - Herb & Butter
Shredded Parmesan cheese, for topping

Directions:
Shape ground sausage into 1/2-inch mini meatballs. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Cook sausage balls until no longer pink in the center, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer meatballs to a paper-towel-lined plate. Drain all but a tablespoon of the grease from the skillet.
Place carrots, celery, and onion in skillet and cook over medium heat until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Add chicken broth, baby spinach, and Knorr(R) Rice Sides(TM) - Herb & Butter. Cook according to package instructions.
Transfer meatballs back to skillet; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve topped with Parmesan cheese.
