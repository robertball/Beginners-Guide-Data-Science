Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups peeled and diced potatoes
1/3 cup diced celery
1/2 cup carrots, chopped
1/2 cup green beans, chopped
1/3 cup finely chopped onion
3/4 cup diced cooked ham
3 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
1 teaspoon ground white or black pepper, or to taste
5 tablespoons butter
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups non-fat milk

Directions:
Combine the potatoes, celery, carrots, green beans, onion, ham and water in a stockpot. Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the chicken bouillon, salt and pepper.
In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with a fork, and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all of the milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir the milk mixture into the stockpot, and cook soup until heated through. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This soup was great, so creamy. I add some carrots and green beans to it and it has a little more fiber and a little more heartiness to it.Modified from: Delicious Ham and Potato Soup
