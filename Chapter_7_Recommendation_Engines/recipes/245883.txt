Ingredients:
3 (5 ounce) cans premium white chicken breast
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large yellow onion, chopped
4  garlic cloves, minced
¼ teaspoon dried oregano
3 teaspoons ground coriander
1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped green chiles
½ (14.5 ounce) can chopped tomatoes
1 (7 ounce) can salsa verde
2 (15 ounce) cans white hominy, drained
2 (14 ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth
Kosher salt and cracked black pepper
1  red onion, finely chopped
1  lime, cut into wedges
½ cup Mexican crema or sour cream
Crushed tortilla chips
½ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
Thinly sliced radishes
1  avocado, diced

Directions:
In a large Dutch oven or saucepot set over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the onion and cook until translucent and fragrant, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 3 to 4 more minutes. Add the oregano, coriander and cumin, and cook until slightly darkened and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the green chiles, chopped tomatoes, salsa verde and cook until it just comes to a boil, about 2 minutes. Add the hominy and chicken broth and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for at least 10 minutes to allow flavors to develop. Season with salt and pepper. Add chicken and cook until heated through, 3 minutes.
To serve, divide among 4 bowls and garnish as desired.
