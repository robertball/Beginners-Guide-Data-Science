Ingredients:
1 cup cold water
1/4 cup masa harina
1 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (2 ounce) bar dark chocolate, chopped
1/2 cup evaporated milk
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Whisk water and masa together in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until boiling, about 5 minutes. Add milk and cinnamon; continue stirring until thick and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes more. Add dark chocolate, evaporated milk, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Cook and stir until chocolate has just melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove from heat, pour into mugs, and serve hot.

Description: 
A wonderful, rich, thick drink. Like a cross between hot cocoa and pudding. Can never remember my tweaks to this recipe, so decided to post it. This Mexican chocolate atole is officially called champurrado.
