1 peeled, ripe banana
2 Tbsp. plain yogurt
1 cup rice milk (or any kind of milk)
1/2 cup dry oats
1 Tbsp. peanut butter
a handful of almonds
a generous dash cinnamon

Directions:
Throw oats and almonds into blender and grind up, dry, into a coarse or fine powder.  Add remaining ingredients except for milk, which can be added, a splash at a time, as needed, to help blending.  Blend thoroughly and enjoy!

Description: 
I saw a Vitamix demo the other day.  Then I realized my Waring Pro blender at home was already fully capable of the same smoothie greatness, so I got inspired to cram more nutrients into my life by blending them up.
