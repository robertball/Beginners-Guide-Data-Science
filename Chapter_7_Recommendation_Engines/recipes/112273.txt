Ingredients:
5 pounds ground venison
2 1/2 tablespoons sugar-based curing mixture (such as Morton® Quick Cure®)
2 tablespoons white sugar
3 tablespoons cracked peppercorns
4 teaspoons mustard seed
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons hickory-flavored liquid smoke
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Place ground venison in a large plastic bowl or bucket.  Add the curing mixture, sugar, peppercorns, mustard seed, ground pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, liquid smoke, and salt.  Mix well, then cover tightly and refrigerate for 24 hours.
On the second day, mix thoroughly, kneading as you would bread for 2 to 3 minutes.  Re-cover and refrigerate for another 24 hours.
On the third day, mix and knead the mixture again for another 2 to 3 minutes.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Shape mixture into 2 or 3 round logs, about 4-inches in diameter.  Place on a lightly oiled baking tray and bake in preheated oven for five hours, turning halfway through, until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Cool and then refrigerate overnight before slicing and serving.

Description: 
This is my grandmother's recipe for homemade salami, you can use ground beef also if you don't have any venison around. It's worth the effort to make it.
