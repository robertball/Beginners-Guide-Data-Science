5 Lbs Lemons
1.75 Liter of 100 Proof Vodka
6 Cups of Sugar

Steep the peel(Yellow part only) of 5Lbs of lemons in 1.75 Liter of 100 proof vodka in large glass container for 3 weeks at room temp.  Keep covered.
After 3 weeks-   Stir 6 cups of sugar and 6 cups of water in a large sauce pan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves.  Cool
Strain the liquid into bottles, seal and chill the limincello for one month.
Pour into small glass and enjoy.
I use the 5 lb bag of lemons from costco and smirnoff 100% vodka.  Be sure to save the empty bottle for the one month refrigerator chilling time.  I juice the lemons and pour the liquid into ice cube trays and freeze.  Then pop the frozen cubes into a zip lock bag.  You can use one cube for a glass of lemonade.  1 Tbsp per cube.
