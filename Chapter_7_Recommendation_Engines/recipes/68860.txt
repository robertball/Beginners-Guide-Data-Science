Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, divided
4 boneless pork chops, pounded to 1/4 inch thick
salt and pepper to taste
4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 large tomato, diced
1/3 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup dry white wine
3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper, and quickly sear on both sides. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Heat the remaining olive oil in the skillet over medium-high heat, and saute the garlic about 30 seconds. Mix in the tomato, chicken broth, wine, parsley, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes.
Return the pork chops to the skillet, and continue cooking 5 to 10 minutes, to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve pork with the tomato and broth mixture from the skillet.

Description: 
A delicious garlic and fresh tomato sauce covers tender pork cutlets. Serve with crusty bread, a leafy salad, and maybe a side of buttered pasta with a little of the sauce on top. Terrific and fast.
