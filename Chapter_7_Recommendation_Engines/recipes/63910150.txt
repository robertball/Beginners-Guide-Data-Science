Ingredients:
•	Ham bone  1
•	Ham  1 cup medium dice
•	Green split peas  600g
•	Chicken stock  5 cups
•	White onion  1/3 large white onion small dice
•	Carrot  1/2 large carrot shredded
•	Celery  4 stalks local celery small dice
•	Garlic  3 cloves sliced thinly
•	Olive oil  1 tsp
•	Butter  1 tsp
•	Salt  to taste
•	Ground pepper  to taste

Directions:
Place butter and oil into Dutch oven on medium-low heat and then add onions, celery and carrot. Add small pinch of salt and sweat vegetables until tender, stirring regularly. Rinse peas quickly in water and scan for small stones. Add peas and garlic to pot, stir. Nestle bone into pot and then add stock and ham pieces. Add water until pot is filled to about 1 and ½ inches from top. Mix to integrate and allow to come to boil. Reduce heat to low, and cover, allowing soup to simmer.  Allow soup to simmer for 2 and ½ hours on low heat. Using a spatula scrape bottom of pot, and mix every 30 minutes to avoid sticking and/or burning. Every hour, turn ham bone and skim the surface for fat and froth. When soup is done, take bone out and remove any meat, add meat back to pot. Check for seasoning and mix well. Peas should have mostly disintegrated into soup.
