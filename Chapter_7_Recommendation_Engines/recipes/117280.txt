To the remaining crumb mixture, add the sour cream, baking powder, baking soda, egg and extract; beat until blended.  Press onto the bottom and 2 in. up the sides of a greased 9-in. springform pan.
In a small mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese, sugar and egg.  Spoon into prepared crust.  Top with preserves.  Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture; top with almonds.
