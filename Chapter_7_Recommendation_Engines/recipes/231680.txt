Ingredients:
1 pound fresh Chinese egg noodles
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/3 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, chopped
3/4 cup broccoli florets
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
2 cups cooked shrimp
1/2 cup sliced water chestnuts, drained
1/2 cup baby corn, drained
1/2 cup canned sliced bamboo shoots, drained
3 tablespoons oyster sauce
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes, or to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in noodles and return to a boil. Cook until the pasta floats to the top, 1 to 2 minutes; drain.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and garlic for about 1 minute. Add broccoli and bell pepper; cook and stir until just tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in shrimp, water chestnuts, baby corn,  bamboo shoots, oyster sauce, and red pepper flakes. Continue cooking until shrimp and vegetables are heated through, about 3 minutes more.
Serve shrimp and vegetables over noodles.
