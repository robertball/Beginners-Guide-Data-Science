Ingredients:
2 zucchini cut in half lengthwise, then cut into 1/2-inch half moons
2 cups quartered ripe tomatoes
1/2 onion, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 cup olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Combine the zucchini, tomatoes, onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes in the prepared baking dish. Drizzle with the olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and mix well.
Place in preheated oven. Roast until vegetables are tender and slightly golden, about 18 minutes. Remove from oven; sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese and basil.

Description: 
This is my husband's favorite way to eat up summer's 'never-ending' supply of zucchini and tomatoes.  Goes great with grilled chicken or fish, or toss it with some cooked pasta.  Grape or cherry tomatoes work well too.
