Ingredients:
1 (1 1/2-pound) boned salmon or halibut fillet, cut into 4 equal pieces (each 1 to 1 1/4 in. thick in center)
3 tablespoons lemon juice, plus additional lemon wedges
2 tablespoons Safeway SELECT Verdi Olive Oil
Kosher salt
Fresh ground pepper

Directions:
Rinse fish and pat dry. In a bowl, whisk together lemon juice and 2 tablespoons oil; pour into a heavy plastic zip top bag. Add fish to bag. Seal bag and turn to coat pieces evenly. Chill 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut 4 pieces of heavy foil, each slightly larger than the pieces of fish. Rub one side of each piece of foil with oil; arrange foil, oiled side up, on a large baking sheet.
Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for indirect heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is balanced on the sides, not directly under the food).
Drain marinade from bag and discard. Place each piece of fish on a piece of foil (for salmon, place skin side down). Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Transfer fish, on foil, to center of grill (not over direct heat). Cover charcoal grill and open vents; close lid on gas grill. Cook fish until opaque but still moist looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), about 20 minutes.
With a wide spatula, transfer fish to plates (for salmon, carefully slide spatula between meat and skin to lift off fish). Serve with lemon wedges to squeeze juice over the top.
