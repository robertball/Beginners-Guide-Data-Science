Ingredients:
2 oz cream cheese
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella
1 egg beaten
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/3 cup almond flour
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425Â°
In a small bowl, add cream cheese and mozzarella. Microwave on high for 20 seconds at a time until melted.
In a separate bowl, whisk egg until beaten. Add dry ingredients and mix well.
Work mozzarella/cc mixture into dough. Dough may be sticky. If so, refrigerate for about 10 minutes.
Lay plastic wrap out on a flat surface. Dust with almond flour.
Spoon dough onto plastic wrap. Dust the top of it with almond flour.
Fold the plastic wrap over the dough and gently start working into a ball.  The plastic wrap will keep your hands clean and peel right back from the dough.
Cover and refrigerate at least 15 minutes.
Cut dough ball into 4.  Roll each section into a ball.
Bake 10-12 minutes or until golden and set up.
