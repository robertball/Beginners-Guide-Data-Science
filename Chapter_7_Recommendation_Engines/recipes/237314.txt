Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
5 potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
1 cup light cream
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 egg
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup chopped scallions

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with butter.
Place potatoes into a large pot; add enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes; drain.
Whip potatoes, cream, cream cheese, and egg together in a large bowl; season with hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Fold scallions into the potato mixture and transfer to the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and fluffy, about 45 minutes.
