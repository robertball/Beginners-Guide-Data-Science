Ingredients:
1 pkg tortilla shells
I Large can Enchilada sauce (Rosarita is my personal favorite)
1 small can sliced black olives
1-1/2 lbs hamburger
1 tsp. cumin
1/4 chopped onion
Shredded cheddar cheese
Sour cream
salt and pepper to taste
vegetable oil

Directions:
Fry hamburger. Drain grease. Add salt, pepper, onion, cumin and olives. Add 1/2 can enchilada sauce. Heat 1 tsp vegetable oil in separate non-stick frypan on medium high heat. Fry tortilla shell on both sides till soft (I often skip this step but it is good this way). Fill tortilla with a spoonful of meat mixture. Add some cheese and a dollup of sour cream. Roll up and place in a baking pan. Keep frying and filling until the pan is full. Pour enchilada sauce over all and top with shredded cheese and sour cream to taste. Heat 350 degrees until warmed through and cheese is melted. 20-25 minutes.  This recipe freezes well so I often double it and stick one in the freezer.

This is one of our family favorites. So easy to make and hard to mess up....even if you don't exactly measure things out. Easy to eyeball!
