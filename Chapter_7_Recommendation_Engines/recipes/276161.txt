Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
1 small Spanish onion, diced
3 tablespoons pine nuts
1 head cauliflower, stemmed and cut into small florets
3 tablespoons dried currants
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon toasted bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 380 degrees F (195 degrees C).
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
While onion is cooking, spread pine nuts on a baking sheet.
Bake pine nuts in the preheated oven until toasted and light brown, 2 to 3 minutes, being careful they do not burn.
Stir cauliflower into the skillet with the onion. Add toasted pine nuts, currants, salt, and pepper. Stir continuously until cauliflower starts to brown, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and cook until cauliflower is nice and crispy, 3 to 5 more minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl and top with toasted bread crumbs.
