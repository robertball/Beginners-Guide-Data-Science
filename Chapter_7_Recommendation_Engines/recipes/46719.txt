1/4 cup dried mixed fruit
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine bread and milk, and set aside to soak for 5 minutes. Then stir in egg, butter, raisins, mixed fruit, brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mix well. Press the mixture into a  9-inch square baking pan.
Bake in preheated oven until golden and firm to touch, about 35 minutes. Leave in baking pan to cool, then cut into squares.
