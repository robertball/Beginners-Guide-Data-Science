Ingredients:
3 pounds sweet potatoes
1 tablespoon Becel速 Buttery Taste margarine
3 tablespoons maple syrup*
1 pinch nutmeg, ground

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pierce sweet potatoes in several places to allow steam to escape. Place on a baking sheet. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes or until softened.
Let sweet potatoes cool slightly. Slice lengthwise and scoop out flesh into a medium bowl. Using a fork, mash together sweet potatoes and Becel(R) Buttery Taste margarine until desired consistency.
Stir in maple syrup, margarine and nutmeg. Spoon into casserole dish lightly greased with Becel(R) Buttery Taste margarine. Smooth top and cover with lid or foil. Reheat in 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes.
(May be made ahead up to this point and refrigerated. Reheat in oven 10 minutes longer.  To reheat in microwave, microwave on High (100%) for about 5 minutes, stirring once, until heated through. Turn once if you do not have a turntable.)
