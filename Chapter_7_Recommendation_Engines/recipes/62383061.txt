1 lb bag Frozen Berry Mix, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries
1/2 cup seedless raspberry preserves or jam
1 tsp water

8 Biscuits, either from scratch or refrigerator rolls, I used biscuits from Trader Joes
1/4 cup sugar
1 gallon of ice cream or enough for 8 scoops of ice cream

Directions:
Sprinkle 1/4 cup of sugar over the tops of the 8 biscuits. Bake biscuits according to the directions.
In a small bown combine cornstarch with water and lemon juice, stir well to dissolves cornstarch.
In a sauce pan add frozen berries, raspberry preserves and cornstarch mixture.
Cook over low-medium heat until berries melt and liquids comes to a boil. Once it comes to a boil the mixture will thicken. Stir frequently to keep mixture from burning. Cook until liquid from the berries has thicken and berries have cooked down.
The strawberries will remain solid but the otehrs should breakdown a bit.
Split biscuits in half and top with a scoop of ice cream. Spoon berry sauce over ice cream. Top with other half of the biscuit and serve immediately.

Description: 
I worked in a restaurant years ago where we served warm raspberries over vanilla ice cream. It was called Hot Love and people loved it. I've added blueberries, strawberries and blackberries to the mix along with the comfort of freshly baked biscuits. Nothing says love in a bowl like a sweet biscuit smoothered in warm berry sauce and cool, creamy ice cream.
