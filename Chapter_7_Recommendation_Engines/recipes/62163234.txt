Ingredients:
1/2 bushel quahogs
1/2 loaf bread blended into crumbs (I use white)
1 med. onion
1/2 red pepper
1/2 pkg choricio chopped into smallish pieces (use linguicia if you don't like it too spicy)
1 stick butter
shot of hot sauce
old bay seasoning to taste

Directions:
shuck quahogs save shells and reserve some liquid
rinse quahogs real well (nothing ruins stuffies like a little sand)
Mince qhahogs (not too small) and set aside
saute onion, pepper and choricio in 1/2 butter
add quahogs
saute until cooked through
add hot sauce and old bay seasoning to taste
stir in bread (moisten with quahog liquid if too dry)
Stuff mixture into shells and top with a good pat of butter
Place in shallow baking dish and cook at 425 until hot through about 15 minutes
I like to run them under the broiler for a minute to crisp up the tops
Serve with butter and lemon and enjoy!!
*the stuffing can be made ahead and refrigerated for a day or so.
