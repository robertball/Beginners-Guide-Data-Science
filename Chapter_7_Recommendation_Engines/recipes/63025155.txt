Ingredients:
Bread:
2 large ripe bananas
2/3 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1/4 cup milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tsp. ground ginger
1 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp. ground allspice
1/2 tsp. ground cloves
1 1/4 tsp. baking soda
1/4 tsp. salt
Glaze:
1 Tbsp. butter, melted
1 Tbsp. light corn syrup
2 Tbsp. milk
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325º F. Prepare a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
Mash bananas in a large bowl with a fork. Add brown sugar, molasses, vegetable oil, eggs and milk and stir until combined.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, baking soda and salt.
Add flour mixture to banana mixture and stir just until flour is incorporated. Pour in prepared pan and bake for 60 to 70 minutes, or until it tests done with a toothpick.
Cool completely, and then turn out of pan.
To make the glaze, combine the melted butter, corn syrup and 1 Tbsp. milk. Add the confectioners’ sugar and stir. Add the vanilla and additional 1 Tbsp. milk or enough to achieve a drizzling consistency. Pour over cooled loaf.
