Ingredients:
2 cups butter flavored shortening
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1 1/2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
4 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup flaked coconut
1 cup chopped macadamia nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter flavored shortening, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips, coconut and macadamia nuts. Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place them 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy! - they will be chewy.  If you like them crispy, increase the cooking time to about 12 minutes. (My mom loves them burnt!)
