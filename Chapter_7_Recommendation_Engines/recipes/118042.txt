Ingredients:
8 cups water
1 1/2 cups uncooked medium pearl barley
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 medium sweet red pepper
2 cups fresh or frozen corn, thawed
2/3 cup thinly sliced green onions, divided
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
SALAD DRESSING:
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the water, barley and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15-18 minutes or until barley is just tender. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, halve pepper; remove stem and seeds. Broil pepper skin side up 4 in. from the heat until skin blisters and blackens, about 8-10 minutes. Immediately place pepper in a bowl; cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 15-20 minutes. Peel off and discard charred skin. Chop pepper.
In a bowl, combine corn, 1/2 cup onions, Parmesan, roasted pepper and barley. In another bowl, combine vinegar, water, lemon juice, sugar, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and pepper. Slowly whisk in oil. Pour over barley mixture; toss gently to coat. Sprinkle with remaining onions.
