Ingredients:
12 ounces high quality semi sweet or dark chocolate
1 cup heavy whipping cream
3 tablespoons HandCraft Artisan Collection Cabernet Sauvignon

Directions:
Melt chocolate and cream over low heat.  Add wine to melted chocolate.  Serve warm in a bowl or in a small fondue pot.
For dipping use anything that goes well with chocolate including fresh fruit, pound cake, meringue cookies, artisan marshmallows, crystallized ginger,  salted pretzels or dried fruit.  Leftovers won't go to waste.  To make delicious Cabernet truffles out of the hardened fondue (ganache), use a melon scooper to carve out balls, dust in cocoa powder. Enjoy right away or put in a pretty box or tin.
