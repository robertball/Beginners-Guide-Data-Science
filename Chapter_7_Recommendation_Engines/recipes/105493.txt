Ingredients:
2 1/2 inch piece fresh ginger root
1 cup fresh orange juice
1/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
2 tablespoons fat-free half and half
1/4 teaspoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
2 cups frozen stir fry vegetable blend
2 (4 ounce) salmon fillets

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
Make sauce.  Peel ginger root and slice into 10 slices.  Pour orange juice into a small saucepan.  Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and ginger root.  Bring to a rolling boil over medium high heat.  Boil 10-12 minutes or until orange juice has reduced to approximately 2 Tbsp.  Remove sauce from heat.  Remove ginger slices using a fork and discard.   Set sauce aside.
Mix together the half and half, cornstarch and salt.  Set aside.  Whisk the softened butter, one Tbsp. at a time, into the 2 Tbsp. of orange juice.  Stir until melted.  Add half and half mixture.  Stir well.  Place saucepan back on heat.  Heat over medium- high heat until boiling.
Remove sauce from heat and mix in a blender 15-20 seconds or until smooth and lighter in color.  Set aside.
Prepare salmon.  Place vegetables in an 8x8 inch-baking pan.  Place salmon fillets on top of the vegetables.  Bake in preheated 450 degrees F oven 10-15 minutes or until cooked through, but still tender.
Place vegetables and salmon on serving plates.  Pour sauce over salmon.  Serve immediately.  Serve with steamed rice, if desired.
