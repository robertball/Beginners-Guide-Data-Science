Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup sugar
2 eggs
2 tsp grated orange peel
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1-1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 cup orange juice
2 cup chopped fresh or frozen rhubarb
1/2 cup slivered almonds

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in orange peel and vanilla.
Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger and nutmeg; add to creamed mixture alternately with orange juice. Fold in rhubarb and almonds.
Transfer to a greased 9-in. x 5-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350° for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
