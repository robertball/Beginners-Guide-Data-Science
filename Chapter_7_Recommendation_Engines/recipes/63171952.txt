Ingredients:
1 3-lb butternut squash
honey
brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Cut the butternut squash into sixths.  Remove the seeds.
Place parchment paper on a cookie sheet, and put the squash pieces there, skin side down.
Thoroughly brush all parts of the squash except for the skin with honey. Then rub in brown sugar on the same area.
Place the squash in the oven.
Every 10 minutes, remove and check; the honey may pool in some areas and some areas may dry out.  Brush the honey out evenly, and add more honey and brown sugar if needed.
After about 40 minutes to an hour, the squash should be done.  It is done when a fork easily slides into it.  Use a spoon to carefully scrape the skin off of the squash.  Note, this takes some time.  When all the skin is off, the squash is ready to eat.
