Ingredients:
4 eggs, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons garlic powder, divided
2 cups grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup vegetable oil for frying
2 large eggplant, peeled and sliced
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 (28 ounce) jar tomato pasta sauce, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a shallow mixing bowl combine 3 eggs, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, 1 cup Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.  In a separate, shallow dish or plate, pour the flour.
Heat oil in a large, deep skillet.  Dredge eggplant slices in flour, then in egg mixture and fry slices 2 or 3 at a time in hot oil.  Place fried slices on a paper towel lined plate to drain.
In a large bowl combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella, remaining 1 cup Parmesan, remaining 1 tablespoon garlic powder, 1 egg, parsley and spinach; mix well.
Spread about 1/3 of the pasta sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.  Place about 2 tablespoons of spinach mixture in the center of each eggplant slice and roll securely; place in prepared pan.  Pour remaining pasta sauce over eggplant rolls and top with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite recipes.  Thin sliced eggplant is stuffed with cheese and spinach and topped with marinara sauce.  I often use prepared jarred sauce to cut the cook time.
