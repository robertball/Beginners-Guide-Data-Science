Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) flank steak
5 teaspoons white sugar, divided
kosher salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
2 large eggs, beaten
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1 cup frozen peas, thawed
2 tablespoons water
3 cups cooked white rice
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon sesame oil

Directions:
Pat flank steak dry with a paper towel. Cut into bite-sized pieces and transfer to a medium bowl. Season with 1 teaspoon sugar, salt, and pepper. Add cornstarch and toss until well coated.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add eggs and scramble using a rubber spatula, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove eggs to a dish.
Add 1 teaspoon oil and 1/2 of the meat to the wok. Increase heat to high and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a plate. Add 1 teaspoon oil and repeat with remaining meat.
Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the wok and reduce heat to medium-low. Add onion, garlic, and ginger; cook until onions begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add peas and water; cook until peas are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cooked rice, breaking it up with a spatula, and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, remaining 4 teaspoons sugar, vinegar, and sesame oil. Add meat and scrambled eggs, toss together and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately.
