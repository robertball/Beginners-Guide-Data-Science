Ingredients:
4 tablespoons ground black pepper
1 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1 dash hot pepper sauce
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
2 pounds sirloin, cut into 1/2 inch thick slices

Directions:
In a large, nonporous bowl, combine the ground black pepper, soy sauce, vinegar, hot pepper sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well and add the meat slices. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Prepare an outdoor smoker for low heat and lightly oil grate.
Lay meat strips out on grill so that they do not overlap. Smoke over low heat. Jerky will be done when the edges appear dry with just a slight hint of moisture in the center of the slices, about 6 to 8 hours.
