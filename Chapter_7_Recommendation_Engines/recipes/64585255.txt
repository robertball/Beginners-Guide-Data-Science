Ingredients:
3 T. olive oil
1 large leek, washed and chopped
2-3 c. quartered button mushrooms
2 1/2 to 3 c. chicken stock
1 sprig rosemary
3 medium carrots cut into coins
3 boneless chicken thighs, diced
2 c. peas
2 T. cornstarch
1 c. flour
34 tsp. baking powder
1/8 tsp. baking soda
2 to 3 T. butter cut into bits
1/2 c. buttermilk
1 egg

Directions:
Heat oil in large oven-proof skillet (cast iron is great). Add leeks, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook until softened. Add mushrooms and cook till liquid has released and evaporated.
Add 2 cups stock and rosemary, bring to a boil and let bubble for a minute or two. Add carrots and chicken and reduce heat to simmer. Cook till carrots are almost tender and chicken is cooked, 8 to 10 minutes. Add peas and cook another minute or two. Remove rosemary.
Whisk cornstarch with some remaining broth. Add to mixture to thicken slightly. More broth may be needed to create a nice gravy. Turn off heat.  Preheat oven to 400.
For crust, cut  butter to flour (in a small bowl) and then add remaining ingredients. Mix till it just comes together; it should be sticky. Drop spoonfuls of batter on top of mixture. Smooth with a knife, covering the area but leaving gaps for steam.
Bake for 35 to 45 minutes till crust is golden.
