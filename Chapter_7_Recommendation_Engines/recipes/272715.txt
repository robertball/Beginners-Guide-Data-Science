Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (30 ounce) package frozen seasoned shredded potato rounds
8 large eggs
8 slices SmithfieldÂ® bacon
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
Chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Coat a 15 1/2- x 10 1/2-inch jelly roll pan with oil.
Arrange potatoes in a single layer in pan. Bake in preheated oven 10 minutes.
Remove potatoes from oven. Use the back of a wooden spoon to flatten potatoes until the rounds touch and cover the entire pan. Continue baking until crisp, about 20 minutes.
While potato crust bakes, cook eggs in a nonstick skillet over medium-low, stirring often, until very soft-scrambled. Set aside.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble once cool.
Top crust evenly with 3/4 cup cheese. Top with scrambled eggs and bacon. Sprinkle remaining cheese over breakfast pizza. Bake until cheese is melted and bubbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Garnish with chives.
