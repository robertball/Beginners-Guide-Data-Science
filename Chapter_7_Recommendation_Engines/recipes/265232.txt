Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 green bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice
2 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise and sliced into 1/2-inch slices
1 serrano chile, minced (optional)
1 ear fresh corn kernels
1/2 pound fresh spinach, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 cup sour cream
3/4 cup diced cotija cheese, divided
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
15 corn tortillas
1 (10 ounce) can enchilada sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper; cook until edges are golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Add zucchini, serrano chile, and corn kernels. Cook until slightly browned, about 5 minutes more.
Add spinach, garlic, paprika, salt, and cumin. Cook for 1 minute stirring constantly. Add sour cream, 1/2 cup cotija, and sour cream. Stir to combine. Remove vegetable mixture from heat and set aside.
Pour a thin layer of enchilada sauce into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Heat a small skillet over medium heat and warm tortillas 1 at a time until softened, about 10 seconds each. Transfer warm tortillas to a plate and keep warm under a towel.
Spoon 1/3 cup vegetable mixture into 1 tortilla. Fold sides in like a taco and place, seam-side down, into the enchilada sauce in the baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and vegetable mixture.
Pour remaining enchilada sauce over the enchiladas in the baking dish. Sprinkle remaining cotija cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly  bubbly and golden at the edges, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool at least 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
These enchiladas are full of fresh vegetables and my ace in the hole - cotija cheese. Sour cream makes a nice saucy filling. My vegetarian husband gives these 5 stars; I hope you like them, too! These go great with a side of black or pinto beans and a salad with chopped tomato and avocado. Enjoy!
