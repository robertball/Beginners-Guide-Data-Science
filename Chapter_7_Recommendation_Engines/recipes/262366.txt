Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package extra-firm tofu
1/2 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon liquid amino acid (such as BraggÂ®)
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 large red onion, thinly sliced
1/2 green bell pepper, sliced
1/2 red bell pepper, sliced
1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
cooking spray
4 (8 inch) whole wheat tortillas
1 avocado, sliced
1 Roma tomato, diced
1/2 cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Dry tofu by pressing firmly with paper towels. Cut into strips and place in a wide dish.
Mix lime juice, cumin, liquid amino acid, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl. Pour 1/2 of the mixture over the tofu; toss gently. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator, 20 minutes to overnight.
Combine remaining lime juice mixture, red onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and jalapeno in a large bowl. Toss well. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator, 20 minutes to overnight.
Spray a large non-stick skillet with cooking spray and place over high heat. Cook and stir tofu until browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Spray the skillet with cooking spray again and place back over high heat. Add onion-pepper mixture; cook and stir until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Return tofu to the skillet.
Warm tortillas and top with tofu mixture, avocado, tomato, and cilantro.

Description: 
I guarantee you will not miss the chicken or cheese when you eat these vegan tofu fajitas. Serve with Spanish rice and beans for a delicious meal. 

I got this recipe from Whole Foods Market and made a few modifications. The key to this recipe is the marinating, so be sure to let the tofu and vegetables marinate for at least 20 to 30 minutes.
