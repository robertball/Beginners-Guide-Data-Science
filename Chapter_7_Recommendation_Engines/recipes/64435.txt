1 (20 ounce) can DOLEÂ® Pineapple Slices
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
12 wonton wrappers
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup canned cream of coconut
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 cup toasted macadamia nuts, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1/4 cup flaked coconut, toasted
