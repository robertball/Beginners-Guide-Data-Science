Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds lean ground pork
1/2 cup minced onion
1/2 cup water
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Crumble the ground pork into a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and water. Cook, stirring frequently, until evenly browned. Remove from heat, and mix in the fresh bread crumbs. Season with salt, cinnamon, and cloves, and mix well.
Press one of the pie crusts into the bottom and up the sides of a pie plate. Fill with the pork mixture. Place the second crust over the top, and pinch the seams to seal. Poke a couple of holes in the top crust to vent steam.
Bake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until crust is golden.
