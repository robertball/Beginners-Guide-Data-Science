Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/4 cups milk, room temperature
1 egg, room temperature
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
3 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar, sift again.
Beat your egg, add the melted butter and beat lightly until blended, then lightly beat in your milk & vanilla extract (careful not to overbeat your egg).
Make a well in the center and pour in the liquid mixture; mix until smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.

This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.Modified from: Good Old Fashioned Pancakes
