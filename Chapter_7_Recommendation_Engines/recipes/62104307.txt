Ingredients:
1 lb sweet Italian sausage
10 oz sliced fresh mushrooms
6 oz fresh baby spinach
12 oz. roasted red peppers, chopped
2 Tbsp. chicken base (dehydrated chicken stock)
1 qt. water
1/2 of a 20-28 oz package fresh Three-cheese tortellini (in refrigerated dairy case)
Grated parmesan cheese, optional

Directions:
Coat a large sauce pan or Dutch oven with vegetable spray or 1 tsp olive oil.
Cook sausage over medium heat in sauce pan until it is crumbled and no longer pink.
When the sausage is completely cooked, add sliced mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are sautéed. Add the spinach, and cook, stirring occasionally, until spinach is lightly wilted. Add chopped peppers and stir thoroughly.
Add chicken base and water, and bring to a boil. Add tortellini and simmer on low for 10-15 minutes (use the time specified on the tortellini package for guidance here) until the pasta is cooked.
Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with parmesan cheese if desired.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me by a friend.  I made two changes:  I used bulk pork sausage instead of turkey sausage links and, as I can’t abide tomatoes, substituted chopped roasted peppers.  It was still damned good, however.
