Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
4 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon curry paste
1 (14.5 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (14.5 ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped

Directions:
Stir the coconut milk, ginger, garlic, and parsley into a deep skillet over medium heat. Season with salt, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, and curry paste. Bring to a slow boil. Then stir in black beans, kidney beans, and red and green bell peppers; simmer, stirring often, until about 1/3 of the liquid is evaporated and the sauce has thickened, about 30 to 45 minutes. Cover, and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
South Asian influenced beans with a kick. Great served over rice or in a tortilla as leftover burritos. Serve over rice (jasmine rice is my first choice). They come out really spicy, so add only as much spice as you're comfortable with.
