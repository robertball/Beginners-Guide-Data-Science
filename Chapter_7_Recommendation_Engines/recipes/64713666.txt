Ingredients:
Ingredients:
Tomatillos (about 15)
2 – 3 organic jalapeños (depending on how much heat you  like)
1 bunch cilantro
1/2 onion
3 large garlic cloves
1 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp organic cumin powder

Directions:
Peel and wash tomatillos.
Put all of the ingredients into a blender and process to the consistency that you like.
Add more salt or cumin to taste.
Pour into a mason jar.
Now here’s the trick that makes the flavor AMAZING: Lime Vitality essential oil! It’s the concentrated flavor from the lime peel and it takes the flavor of this salsa to a whole new level. Add about 5 drops to the jar, then shake.
