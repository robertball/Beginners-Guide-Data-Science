Ingredients:
One 10-ounce box frozen butternut squash puree
1 pound rigatoni with lines
Kosher salt
1 tablespoon EVOO
1 pound bulk sweet Italian sausage
3 to 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
1/2 cup white wine
4 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons flour
2 1/2 cups milk
Freshly ground black pepper
Freshly grated nutmeg
2 cups sharp yellow Cheddar
1 cup shredded Pecorino Romano cheese
Flat leaf parsley, chopped
Fennel and Celery Slaw, for serving

Directions:
Defrost the squash puree in a microwave and place in a strainer to drain.
Cook the pasta in boiling salted water to al dente, 7 to 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat the EVOO in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage to the skillet, crumble and brown. Add the garlic, onions and thyme and cook until tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the white wine.
Preheat the broiler with a rack in the upper third of the oven.
Melt the butter in a medium saucepot over medium heat. Whisk in the flour for 1 minute. Whisk in the milk and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg and thicken to coat a spoon. Stir in the butternut squash and bring the sauce back to a bubble and melt in the Cheddar.
Toss the pasta, sauce and sausage to combine. Top with the Pecorino Romano and parsley and broil to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with the Fennel and Celery Slaw.
