Ingredients:
6 large carrots, halved
3 tablespoons light soy sauce
3 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons sesame oil
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1/4 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to boil, add the carrots and parboil for 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
In a large glass dish, combine the remaining ingredients. Add the carrots and marinate for 30 minutes.
Prepare an outdoor grill with an oiled rack set 4 inches from the heat source. Using a oiled wire hinged vegetable basket or just directly on the rack ( whichever you find easier), grill the carrots, turning constantly for a total of 10 minutes, until slightly charred.
