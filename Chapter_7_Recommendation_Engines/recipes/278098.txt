Ingredients:
9 tablespoons water
3 tablespoons flaxseed meal
cooking spray
2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup avocado oil
1 (16 ounce) can solid pack pumpkin puree
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 tablespoon molasses
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Stir water and flaxseed meal together in a small bowl until well combined. Place in the refrigerator until flax "eggs" have thickened, about 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray two 9x5-inch loaf pans with cooking spray.
Combine sugar and avocado oil in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until blended. Mix in flax "eggs," pumpkin puree, applesauce, molasses, and vanilla extract.
Sift all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in 2 batches, stirring to combine after each addition. Divide batter between the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 5 minutes.
