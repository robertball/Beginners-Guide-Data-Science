Description: 
(KEEN-wah) us a protein packed ancient seed from South America, similar to the texture of brown rice when cooked, with a nutty flavor.  It contains all 9 essential amino acids, lysine, phosphorous, copper, iron and magnesium and it is easy to make.  It's not truly a grain, it's actually a relative of spinach.  It is recommended that you soak and rinse the seeds well before cooking.  Once cooked the seeds expand about 4 times their original size, so 1 c of uncooked quinoa seeds yields about 4 c cooked.  Prep is simple.
