Ingredients:
6 large red potatoes, cut into cubes, or more to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 white onion, chopped
8 slices turkey bacon, chopped
1/4 cup hot water
2 cubes chicken bouillon, or more to taste
20 fluid ounces evaporated milk
1 1/2 tablespoons garlic salt
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and add enough water to cover; bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion and turkey bacon until browned, 5 to 10 minutes.
Mix water and chicken bouillon together in a bowl, stirring and breaking cubes apart with a fork, until dissolved. Stir evaporated milk and garlic salt into bouillon mixture.
Drain potatoes, setting about 1/8 aside in a bowl. Mix the potatoes, evaporated milk mixture, onion-bacon mixture, and butter together in a pot until soup is creamy and smooth. Add the reserved potatoes to soup, breaking potatoes apart for desired texture. Bring soup to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until soup is heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.
