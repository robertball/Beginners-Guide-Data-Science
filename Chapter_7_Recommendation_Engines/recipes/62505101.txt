Description: 
I've been making this stuffing for over 25 years at thanksgiving and christmas.  My grandmother made something similar that I was able to collaborate through my sister and aunt.  It has changed a little over the years but still brings back my grannies awesome turkey stuffing.This stuffing is for a 20-25lb bird.
