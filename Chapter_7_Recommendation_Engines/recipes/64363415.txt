Ingredients:
3 cups cooked chickpeas (or 2 15-ounce cans, 1 drained)
3/4 to 1 cup water or chickpea cooking broth (or the liquid from 1 can of chickpeas)
2 to 4 cloves garlic, peeled
2 tablespoons tahini (or 4 tablespoons sesame seeds)
2 to 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 to 1 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/8 to 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chili powder or cayenne pepper
Salt to taste

Directions:
1.Place all ingredients except salt in the blender in the order listed, using the smaller amounts. Start the machine on low and increase speed to high. Use the Vitamix plunger to break up air pockets and push chickpeas toward the blades, if necessary. (Other blenders: Stop and use a spatula to do this.) If the mixture is too thick, add additional water a little at a time. Turn up to the highest speed and blend for a few seconds until hummus is completely smooth.
2.Stop blender and taste the hummus. Add additional seasonings and salt to taste and blend briefly to combine.
3.Store hummus in a sealed container in the refrigerator. It’s best after it’s had a chance to rest for at least an hour, but use within a week.
