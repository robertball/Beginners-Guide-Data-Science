Description: 
This loaf is full of mixed candied fruit and raisins. If desired, drizzle with lemon icing after baking. If you have a raisin cycle, use it to notify you when to add the candied fruit and raisins. Due to the sugar and high fruit content, this loaf has a dark coloured crust, so the authors recommend the sweet cycle.
