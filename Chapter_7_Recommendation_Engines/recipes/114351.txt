Ingredients:
10 ounces farfalle (bow tie) pasta
4 slices bacon, diced
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons diced red onion
1 teaspoon chopped garlic
1/4 cup diced Roma tomatoes
1 cooked chicken breast, thinly sliced
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch garlic salt
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons heavy cream
2 tablespoons grated Asiago cheese
1/3 cup Alfredo sauce

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the bow tie pasta and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until nearly crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon and wipe out the skillet with a paper towel.
Melt the butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Return the bacon to the skillet, and stir in the red onion, garlic, Roma tomatoes, chicken, black pepper, garlic salt, and salt. Cook and stir until the bacon is crisp and onions are translucent. Stir in the cream and Asiago cheese, and cook until the liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes.
Stir in the Alfredo sauce and the cooked pasta. Remove from heat, and allow to cool slightly before serving.
