Ingredients:
1 orange
3 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin
4 cups whole milk
1/2 vanilla bean (split lengthwise)*
1/2 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
4 cups mixed berries (raspberries, blueberries, sliced strawberries etc..)

Directions:
Slice or peel the rind off of the orange and cut into large strips. Set aside.
Pour water into a small bowl.  Slowly sprinkle gelatin over the water, allowing it to sit on top of the water.  Do not stir the gelatin into the water.   Let sit for about 10 minutes.  The gelatin will slowly absorb the water.
Pour the milk into a medium saucepan.  Add vanilla bean and orange rind.  Bring to a simmer.  Remove milk from heat as soon as it begins to a simmer.
Add gelatin mixture while stirring constantly.  Stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved.* *
Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and stir.  Pour the panna cotta through a fine meshed strainer into a pitcher with a spout.  Pour into 8 ramekins or dessert cups.
Chill panna cotta, uncovered, for two hours.
