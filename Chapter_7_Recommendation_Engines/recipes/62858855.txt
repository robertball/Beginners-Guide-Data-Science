Ingredients:
8 oz dried rotini pasta, cooked according to package directions
2 stalks celery, diced
1 green onion, thinly sliced, including green top
1/3 cup roasted red pepper
2 cups cooked chicken, cubed
1/2 cup Hellmann's Mayonnaise
2-3 tablespoons Frank's Red Hot Sauce (use according to taste)
1 teaspoon Worcestershire Sauce
1 tablespoon roasted red pepper brine (the juice the peppers are in)
2 tablespoons crumbled Gorgonzola cheese (or blue cheese)

Directions:
Mix pasta, celery, onion, roasted red pepper and chicken in large mixing bowl.  Set aside.
Mix together Mayonnaise, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper brine and crumbled Gorgonzola cheese.  I went with 2 tablespoons of the hot sauce as I would be feeding others and I didn't want to hurt anyone.  Turned out perfect.
Toss mayo mixture with pasta mixture and chill.
