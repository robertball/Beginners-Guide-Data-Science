Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) box banana quick bread and muffin mix, such as the PillsburyÂ® brand
1 cup water
2 eggs
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup cinnamon-flavored applesauce
1 medium banana, diced
1 cup sliced California Almonds, divided
3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips or chopped dark chocolate

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare a muffin tin with paper liners.
Prepare muffins according to package instructions using water, eggs and oil, but use only  1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2 cup, and add 1/4 cup applesauce.  Stir in banana,  3/4 cup almonds and chocolate.   Divide evenly among muffin cups and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup almonds.
Bake 15-20 minutes, until a tester comes out clean. Cool muffin tin on a rack for 10 minutes, then remove muffins and continue cooling on rack.  Store air tight at room temperature for up to 4 days.
