Ingredients:
1/4 cup orange juice
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup cold butter, cubed
1 cup whipping cream, whipped to soft peaks
1 (10 inch) angel food cake, cut in cubes
2 (15 ounce) cans Mandarin oranges, drained and patted dry

Directions:
Stir together orange juice, eggs, and sugar in a small saucepan. Place over low heat, and stir constantly until the sugar has dissolved, and the mixture is very thick. Once thick, strain mixture into a large bowl, and stir in butter cubes until melted. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.
Fold whipped cream into cold egg mixture until smooth. Recover and refrigerate for 3 hours.
To assemble, place half of the cubed angel food cake into the bottom of a trifle bowl. Spoon on half of the whipped cream mixture, and sprinkle with half of the Mandarin oranges. Create a second layer with the remaining angel food cake, whipped cream mixture, and Mandarin oranges. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
