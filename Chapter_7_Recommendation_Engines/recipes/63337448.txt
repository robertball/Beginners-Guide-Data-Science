Place the potatoes in a large bowl. Add the eggs, celery, relish and onions.
Mix the mayonnaise, mustard and sugar in a small bowl. Slowly pour the mayonnaise mixture into the potatoes - don't put it all at once - and mix together until moist. You might not use all of the 2 cups of the mayonnaise mixture (it depends on the potatoes). Add salt and pepper to taste.
