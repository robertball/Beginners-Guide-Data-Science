Description: 
Do you have extra cooked chicken on hand?  Combine it with crunchy cashews, celery and an easy mayo dressing, then wrap it in a flour tortilla. 'This is a very refreshing sandwich on a hot summer day,' says Janet Goins of Mesa, Arizona. Tip: It's great for picnics served with coleslaw and fruit.Modified from: Cashew Chicken Wraps
