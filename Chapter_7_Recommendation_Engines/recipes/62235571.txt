Ingredients:
Two 12-ounce packages frozen blueberries
or 4 - 4 1/2 cups fresh
1/3 cup plus 4 tablespoons granulated sugar
11/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
21/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
11/2 sticks (6 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
2/3 cup whole milk
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Directions:
1.	Preheat the oven to 375Â°. Butter an 8-by-8-by-2-inch baking dish.
2.	Mix the blueberries with 1/3 cup of the sugar and 2 tablespoons of the    flour. Spoon into the baking dish.
3.	In a large bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 cups of flour and 3 tablespoons of sugar with the baking powder and salt. Cut the butter into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or 2 knives until it resembles coarse meal. Add the milk and vanilla and stir with a fork to form a wet, sticky dough. Drop rounded teaspoons of the dough over the top of the blueberries to cover them. Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar on top of the cobbler and place the baking dish on the middle rack of the oven. (Place aluminum foil on the rack directly below the cobbler to catch any juices that might spill over.)
4.    Bake for 45 minutes, or until the top is golden-brown and the fruit filling is bubbling up through the crust.
5.	Let the cobbler cool for at least 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Description: 
A good old fashioned southern style cobbler. After searching for a cobbler recipe and not being able to find one where the reviews had to vary the recipe so much that it was no longer a recipe...I searched elsewhere and this turned out wonderfully!
