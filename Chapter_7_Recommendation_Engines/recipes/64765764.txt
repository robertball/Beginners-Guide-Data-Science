Ingredients:
4 russet potatoes
1 medium onion
3 cloves of garlic
1/2 cup of kalamata olives olive oil
butter
parsley

Directions:
Scrub and dry 4 russet potatoes. Stab the taters with a fork and microwave until cooked, about 9 minutes.
In the meantime, slice the onions, mince the garlic and halve olives.
Once the potatoes are cooked, let them cool off for a bit.
After they have cooled, slice into wedges. The thinner you slice, the crispier the final product. Be careful though, they will fall apart if you slice em too thin.
In a small pan, saute onions and garlic on medium-low heat with some olive oil, a little bit of butter and some salt and pepper. Cook until tender and sweet, then remove from heat.
In a large non-stick pan, over medium-high heat, add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan.
Cook potatoes in batches. Make sure the potatoes aren't crowded in the pan. Cook them, turning carefully, until golden brown and crispy. Keep the first batch in a 350-degree oven until the second batch is done.
After the second batch is brown, add olives to the pan and cook for a minute. Add potatoes from the oven, and onion and garlic mixture. Toss in pan until everything is heated. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with parsley, salt, and pepper.
