No Bake Pecan Pie Bars Recipe

Ingredients:
1 1/2 overflowing cups (176 g) raw pecan halves
1/2 cup (48 g) gluten-free oats (make sure to use certified gluten-free oats if necessary)
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt (do not omit)
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup (45 mL)
1 teaspoon vanilla
2-3 tablespoons mini dairy-free chocolate chips (I use Enjoy Life brand)(opt)

Directions:
Add the pecans, oats, mesquite powder and salt to a food processor and process just until powdery, but still with some pieces, about 10 seconds. (See above photo)
Add the syrup, vanilla and chocolate chips and pulse until large clumps form and the mixture holds when pressed together with your fingers.
Line a 9x5 loaf pan with parchment paper. Alternatively, you can double the batch and use an 8x8 pan. Just make sure to use a 9x5 and not a 10x5 if following the above measurements, as the 10x5 will be too large. Press the mixture into the pan, spreading out evenly to the corners. I used the back of my spoon to smooth it flat and press down flat and hard. Overlap the paper and press down really hard. Place in the freezer for about an hour before slicing. Slice into 7 bars and wrap individually in plastic wrap and they will hold their shape best that way. Keep stored either in the fridge or freezer, as they will soften some at room temperature.
