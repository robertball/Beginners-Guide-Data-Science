1 (10 ounce) bag vegan chocolate chips (such as Enjoy LifeÂ®)
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup evaporated goat milk
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Line an aluminum loaf pan with waxed paper.
Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
Mix walnuts, goat milk, corn syrup, vanilla extract, and salt into chocolate; stir until glossy. Pour into prepared loaf pan; cool until solidified, 2 hours or overnight.
Invert loaf pan to remove fudge, peel off waxed paper, and cut into squares. Refrigerate to set, about 30 minutes.
