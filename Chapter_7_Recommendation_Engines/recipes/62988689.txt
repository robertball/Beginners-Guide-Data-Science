Ingredients:
1 SMALL PACKAGE OF POULTRY FRESH SEASONING (ROSEMARY, THYME, SAGE)
1 BELL PEPPER
1 RED ONION
½ BAG OF BABY CUT CARROTS
2-3 STALKS OF CELERY
1 JUMBO CLOVE OF GARLIC LARGELY CHOPPED
2 CUPS CHICKEN OR TURKEY STOCK
½ CUP BROWN SUGAR
¼ SALT
WHITE DRY WINE
OLIVE OIL (JUST ENOUGH TO COAT INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF BIRD)
1 CUP OF WATER
1 STICK BUTTER SOFTENED/MELTED
(optional 2 tbls of vanilla extract, 1 gala apple, 1 naval orange, 2 extra cups brown sugar)

Directions:
Now that your turkey is ready for roasting prep you need to prep immediately any type of rub you want but first
rub olive oil all over my turkey inside and then my minced fresh poultry spices.
pull the skin away from the breast and rub underneath to hold in flavor
stuff the bird with largely sliced onions bell peppers celery and baby cut carrots
and one jumbo garlic clove peeled and somewhat sliced.
Any left overs  line my pan with to absorb heat.
Last but not least  add a cup of a dry white wine 2 cups of turkey or chicken stock and 1 cup of water and ½ cup of brown sugar to baste with and set the turkey in the pan breast side up
depending on the size of the turkey (12-18  lbs) it takes about 3.5-4.5 hours to cook. cook uncovered for one hour at 425 degrees then baste.
Then cover and cook at 275 and baste every 45 minutes for 4 cycles.
Flip your turkey using a turkey fork or paper towels.
Turn the oven up to 325 degrees and cook for 45 minutes
Take out of oven
(here you have two options, 1 option is to flip turkey cook on 425 for 10 minutes and be done.
Option 2
I removed my turkey poured all the juices in a pot and set to the side, in a small pot I made a brown sugar  (2 cups)citrus (1 naval orange squeezed and one small granny smith apple) and vanilla (2 tablespoons) with about 3 cups of water boiled for ten minutes or until apples are very soft
move turkey back into pan into original position breast side up, baste with citrus/brown sugar/vanilla mixture and pour rest into roasting pan.
Turn oven to 375-400 and cook until browned basting every 5-10 minutes
remove and let set for 20 minutes (i continue to baste the inside of turkey every so often
