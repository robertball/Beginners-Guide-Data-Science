Ingredients:
5 matzo crackers, crushed
1/2 cup red wine (such as ManischewitzÂ®)
1/4 cup water
5 ounces semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup white sugar
1 cup butter

Directions:
Cut a 12-inch long piece of waxed paper and set aside.
Place crushed matzo sheets in a bowl. Sprinkle with red wine and water; mix well.
Melt chocolate chips and sugar in a pot over low heat, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Thin with a spoonful of water if it becomes too thick. Remove from heat.
Beat butter in a separate bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Gradually beat chocolate mixture into butter until well blended.
Stir matzo mixture into chocolate-butter mixture with a wooden spoon.
Pour mixture lengthwise on prepared waxed paper.
Fold waxed paper around mixture to shape into a log. Fold paper at ends to enclose the roll.
Freeze the roll until solid, at least 2 hours. Cut into slices.
