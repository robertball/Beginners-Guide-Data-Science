Ingredients:
3 1/2 c all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 salt
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
3/4 tsp ground cardamom
1/4 tsp ground mace
1/4 tsp freshly ground pepper
pinch of ground cloves
1 1/2 stcks butter, room temp
1 c pckd light brown sugar
1/3 c water
confectioners sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl whisk together the flour, the spices, baking powder and salt.
Cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in half the flour mixuture. Beat in water, than remaining flour misture. Shape into 3 disks. Pat each into 1" thickness, cover and refrigerate for 1 hr.
Dust springerle mold with confectioners' sugar. Roll out dough to a 1/4"-3/8" thickness (deeper molds will need thicker dough). Cut a piece of dough about the size of mold. Press mold firmly into dough, flip over, and gently roll over dough with a rollling pin. Flip over and press onto an parchemnt lined baking sheet. Trim excess dough. Press almond slivers into the back of cookies. Gently coax out of mold with fingertips and onto a baking sheet. Repeat, spacing cookies 1" apart and placing same size cookies on same sheet. Freeze until firm, about 1 hr.
preheat over to 325 F. Place 1 sheet of cookies in oven, and immediatly reduce temp to 250 F. Bake 1 sheet at a time, until cookies are set and just beginning to turn light gold around edges, 55 to 65 minutes. Let cool on sheets on wire racks. Cookies will keep for 1 week, covered.
The flavor will get better with age.
