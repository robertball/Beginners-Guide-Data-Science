3 cups milk
2 pkg. (4 serving size)  JELL-O Chocolate Instant Pudding
2 cups thawed COOL WHIP Whipped Topping
16 OREO Cookies, finely chopped
8 maraschino cherries

Pour milk into medium bowl. Add dry pudding mix. Beat with wire whisk 2 min. Gently stir in whipped topping.
Spoon 2 Tbsp. of the chopped cookies into each of eight 8- to 9-oz. paper drinking cups. Cover evenly with half of the pudding mixture. Press gently with the back of a spoon to eliminate air pockets. Repeat layers. Cover with foil.
Freeze 5 hours or until firm. Remove from freezer about 15 min. before serving. Let stand at room temperature to soften slightly. Peel away paper to unmold onto dessert plates. Top each with a cherry. Store leftovers in freezer.
