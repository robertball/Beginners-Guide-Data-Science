Ingredients:
2 (9 ounce) packages fresh cheese ravioli
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 pound roma tomatoes - peeled, seeded and chopped
1 (6.5 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts
1/2 cup chopped green onions
3 cloves crushed garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook ravioli according to package directions.
While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce.  In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over a medium high heat.  Add tomatoes, artichokes, scallions, garlic, and salt and pepper.  Cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are warmed through.  Remove from heat.
Drain pasta well.  Transfer to a large bowl, and toss with 1 teaspoon oil.  Add half of the sauce to the ravioli; toss gently, but thoroughly to mix.  Transfer ravioli to a large serving platter.  Pour remaining vegetable sauce over ravioli.  Garnish with Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This sauce is quick and easy.  It goes well with other pasta types such as tortellini or penne.  I serve this with a good quality, crusty bread.
