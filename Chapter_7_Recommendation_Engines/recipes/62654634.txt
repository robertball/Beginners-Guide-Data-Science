Ingredients:
1 cup margarine
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
21/2 cups flour
21/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons vanilla

Directions:
Mix margarine, sugar and vanilla in food processor. Add eggs. In a separate bowl mix 2½ teaspoons baking powder with 2½ cups flour. Add the flour mixture to the wet mixture and mix until dough forms.
Taking one fourth of the dough, roll out on a lightly floured board to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut into 2 1/2-inch circles. With your finger, brush water around the rim of the circle. Drop 1 teaspoon of filling in the center. Then bring the dough around the filling and press 3 ends together to form a triangle.  Optional: Brush tops with egg wash for a golden brown cookie.
Bake in a preheated 375-degree oven on a well-greased cookie sheet for 10 to 15 minutes or until the tips are golden.

I usually try and make healthy food, but once in a while it is fun to splurge, especially using my grandmothers dough and an amazing filling for Purim.
