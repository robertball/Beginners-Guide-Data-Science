Ingredients:
1/4 cup margarine, softened
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons milk
3/8 teaspoon almond extract
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/4 cup chopped toasted almonds
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (195 degrees C).
Combine softened butter or margarine, brown sugar, flour, 1 tablespoon milk, and 1/8 teaspoon almond extract. Mix well. Spoon mixture into 12 ungreased muffin cups.
Separate dough into 4 long rectangles. Firmly press perforations to seal. Combine melted butter and 1/8 teaspoon almond extract; brush on dough. Sprinkle with nuts, and roll dough up jellyroll fashion.  Cut each roll of dough into 3 slices. Place in muffin cups.
Place muffin pan on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. When done, invert rolls immediately onto cooling rack.
Combine confectioners' sugar, 1 tablespoon milk, and 1/8 teaspoon almond extract. Drizzle over hot rolls.
