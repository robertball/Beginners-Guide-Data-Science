Ingredients:
4 tablespoons margarine
8 onions, chopped
20 cloves garlic, minced
4 teaspoons dried thyme
2 teaspoons salt
4 teaspoons brown sugar
4 cups red wine
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Melt the butter or margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute for 10 minutes, or until onions become caramelized. Add the garlic, thyme, salt, brown sugar and 2 cups red wine.
Stir well, bring to a boil and continue to heat until soup has reduced by half. Add the remaining 2 cups red wine and the parsley. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is a delicious onion soup that uses red wine for liquid - but don't worry, despite its title you'll only be drunk on happiness! This is delicious served with garlic bread. The salt can be reduced, and the wine should have a 0 or 1 sugar code.
