Ingredients:
I 4 lb pork roast
1 apple
2 cans whole berry cranberry sauce
1 (16 oz) can chicken broth
1 tsp ginger
1 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp cloves
2 tbsp cinnamon
1 orange, for zest

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400
Place pork roast in roasting pan, and slice apple and cover roast in the slices. If you're using whole cloves, poke them into the roast now. If using ground cloves, add it to the glaze mixture.
Combine all other ingredients in a large bowl and stir well. I use a potato masher to mix the cranberry sauce in well with the other ingredients. Pour about half of the mixture over pork roast and cook, covered, for about 30 minutes.
Pour the remainder of the glaze over the pork roast and zest the orange on top. Continue cooking until done, about 30 more minutes. Enjoy!
