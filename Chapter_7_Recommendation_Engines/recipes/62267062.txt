Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups of raw yam, peeled, shredded
1 cup of dried, whole cranberries
2/3 cup of chopped pecans
4 tablespoons of grape seed oil
3 tablespoons of rice vinegar
3 tablespoons of fresh-squeezed lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons of dried lavendar, crushed, ground
1 1/2 teaspoons of dried fennel, crushed, ground
2 pinches of fresh ground black pepper

Directions:
Using a hand held shredder or a food processor, shred yam and put in large bowl.  Add cranberries and pecans.
Using a pestle and mortar grind lavendar and fennel until crushed.  If you don't have one of these, you can either chop it finely with a blade, crush with your fingers or even add it to a miny mixer like the magic bullet.
Add oil, vinegar, lemon juice, lavendar, fennel and pepper to a cruet.  Shake well to mix or blend in the miny mixer.  You can also add dressing ingredients to a small bowl and wisk together until blended.
Toss dressing in the salad until all ingredients are thoroughly coated.
Place in refrigerator to chill.

Description: 
Aromatic, refreshing, quick and VERY healthy!  Not to mention easy too.  A side dish that goes with just about any chicken or fish dinner but can also be enjoyed just as a snack.  My mother and I came up with this little specialty about a year ago and has become a staple in our meal planning.
