Ingredients:
3 1/4 cups cornmeal
2 T. baking powder
1 T. kosher salt
2 T. sugar
1/2 cup (2 oz.) grated sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 cup (2 oz.) grated pepper jack cheese
1/2 cup finely diced onion
1/2 cup finely diced red bell pepper
2 cups milk
1/2 cup canola oil
1 (14.75 oz.) can Cream Style Sweet corn
1 (4 oz.) can diced Green Chile Peppers
1/2 cup Herdez Tomatillo Verde Mexican Cooking Sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Place a 9 x 13 casserole dish in the oven to heat up while you mix up the batter.
In a large bowl, mix together the cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
Add and mix in the cheeses, onion, and red bell pepper.
Add the milk, oil, corn, green chile peppers, and Mexican cooking sauce. Stir well.
Remove the hot baking dish from the oven carefully and spray it with cooking spray to avoid food sticking.
Immediately pour in the batter and put it back in the oven to bake for 50 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This cornbread is so moist I eat it with a fork rather than picking it up. It holds together better as it cools completely. It has a slight kick to it, but feel free to add more Herdez sauce or a jalapeno pepper for more spice. I prefer to serve it with chili, vegetable soup, and beef stew. But it also makes a great bedtime snack with a glass of milk!
