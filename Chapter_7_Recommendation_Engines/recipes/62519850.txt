Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. top sirloin
1 T. butter (do not substitute)
1 T. fresh onion, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 T. butter (do not substitute)
salt to taste
cracked black pepper to taste
2 -3 dashes of nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon dried basil (or 1 1/2 fresh basil, minced)
3/4 Cup dry white wine

Directions:
Slice top sirloin across the grain into thin strips about 1 1/2 inches long. The beef will cut easier if it is slightly frozen before slicing. Set aside.
Melt 1 T. of butter in a skillet. Add the minced onion and garlic and saute until soft.
Add the additional 2 T. butter, and when melted,
Add the beef to the pan and saute for about 5 minutes until browned. Drain the beef.
Season meat with salt and pepper to your liking, and add about three quick dashes of nutmeg and the basil to the beef.
Quickly add the wine to the beef, stirring occasionally and cook down until wine is reduced by half.
Remove beef from heat, and if desired, serve over hot steamed rice or hot buttered egg noodles laced with 1 Tablespoon freshly minced Italian parsley.

Description: 
Beef Stroganoff is a favorite dish of mine, but my family does not like mushrooms or the sour cream sauce. This recipe is based on the first several steps of making Stroganoff, minus the mushrooms and sauce. My family loves it, although I always finish off my portion with a dollop of sour cream stirred in!
