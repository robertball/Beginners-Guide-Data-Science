Ingredients:
1 lb. bag frozen cauliflower
1 cucumber
3 plum tomatoes, chopped (depending on size, more or less as you like)
2 green onion stalks, chopped
1 TBS minced garlic (more or less to your liking... I like lots!)
1/4 cup sliced black olives
1 package Italian dressing mix
red wine vinegar (according to package directions)
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (according to package directions)
Water (according to package directions)

Directions:
Place the frozen cauliflower in a glass dish and microwave for 5 minutes (or just enough to thaw but not cook) on hi.
Use the shredding attachment in the food processor and process the cauliflower.  It should look like rice when you are done.  You can also just shred fresh cauliflower in the processor without cooking it.
Mix together in a salad bowl, the cauliflower rice, chopped tomatoes, green onions, garlic, and black olives.
Mix Italian dressing according to package directions with the red wine vinegar and the extra virgin olive oil and water.
Mix 1/2 cup of the dressing, or as much as you desire, into the salad mixture and stir until all is coated well.  Chill and serve, or serve immediately.
