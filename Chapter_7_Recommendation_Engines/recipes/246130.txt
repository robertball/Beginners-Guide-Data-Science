Ingredients:
1 tablespoon red curry paste, or more to taste
2 (14 ounce) cans coconut milk
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon Thai seasoning (optional)
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced (optional)
1 stalk lemongrass, bottom third only, peeled and minced
1/4 cup Thai basil leaves, torn into bite-size pieces

Directions:
Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-low heat. Add curry paste; fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in coconut milk. Bring to a slow boil. Stir in chicken, fish sauce, brown sugar, Thai seasoning, and garlic. Simmer until sauce starts to thicken and chicken is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Stir red bell pepper into the wok; cook until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Add lemongrass and basil; stir to distribute flavors, about 1 minute.

Description: 
A red curry made with coconut milk. This goes well with chicken, beef, pork, or just veggies! For this recipe I used chicken, but adjust according to taste. Serve with sticky rice.
