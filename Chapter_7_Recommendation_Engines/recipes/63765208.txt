Ingredients:
For the kuih:
1½ bowls yam, diced into 1-2cm cubes
1 bowl rice flour
2 tablespoons wheat starch*
2 bowls water
½  ¾ bowl dried shrimps (heh bee)  I used ¾ bowl because I cannot express how much I love an abundance of it in or kuih
5 shallots, finely chopped
1 teaspoon five spice powder
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon white pepper
For the topping:
deep fried shallots (I buy mine ready fried from Chinatown)
spring onions, sliced finely
red chillies, sliced finely
dried shrimps (heh bee), chopped finely and fried (optional  you can just put more heh bee in the actual cake)

Directions:
1. Heat a pan over medium high heat, and fry the onions and dried shrimps until they become aromatic. This should take about 3-5 minutes.
2. Add the cubed yam to the pan, and fry it with the onion and dried shrimp mixture until it browns.
3. In a separate bowl, mix the rice flour, wheat starch and water, and stir until it forms a smooth paste. Take care to ensure there are no lumps in the mixture.
4. Add the flour mixture into the pan slowly, and stir until everything forms a thick paste.
5. Add the salt, pepper and five spice powder, and mix well.
6. Pour the mixture into a heatproof bowl/plate and steam over high heat for 45 minutes, or until cooked.
7. To serve, sprinkle with deep fried shallots, chopped spring onions, sliced chillies and chopped dried shrimp. Some chilli sauce on the side is also highly recommended.
