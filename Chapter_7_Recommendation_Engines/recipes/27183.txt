Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons butter

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a blender, combine eggs, sugar and butter.  Blend until smooth.  Pour in flour and milk, a little at a time, blending until smooth again.  Stir in vanilla.
Pour into muffin tins, filling 3/4 full.  Bake in preheated oven 45 minutes, until golden brown.  Serve hot or cold.

Description: 
Super easy to make, and these won't last long.  Try substituting almond or lemon extract for the vanilla.  Or top them with flaked coconut or fresh fruit before baking!
