Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
2/3 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 cup carrot baby food
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8x4 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt.
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and oil. Beat in eggs.  Blend this mixture into the flour mixture, stirring just to combine. Fold in the nuts. Scoop batter into prepared baking pans.
Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool loaf in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
