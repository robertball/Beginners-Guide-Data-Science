Slow Cooker Peanut Butter Cup Cake Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour (I used Pamela's Baking Mix)
1 cup sugar (divided. this is important, don't just start dumping, read on!)
1 teaspoon baking powder (even though Pamela's Baking Mix has baking powder in it, I used this amount)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter (unless you're a rebel, then use chunky)
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup boiling water

Directions:
Use a 4-quart slow cooker coated well with cooking spray.
In a mixing bowl, combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder and salt.
In the microwave, melt peanut butter for about 30 seconds, and then add to the mix along with milk, oil, and vanilla. Stir really well to combine.
Spread this mixture into the bottom of your slow cooker.
In a separate bowl, mix together cocoa powder, the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, and 1 cup boiling water (be careful!).
Pour this evenly over the peanut butter batter in your cooker.
Cover and cook on high for 2-4 hours, or until the top has set and an inserted toothpick (into the cake--underneath the cake is molten chocolate) comes out clean.
Let the cake sit uncovered in an unplugged crockpot for about 20 minutes, then serve warm in dessert bowls.
