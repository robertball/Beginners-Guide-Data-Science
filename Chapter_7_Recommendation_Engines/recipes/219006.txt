Ingredients:
1 (18 ounce) bottle mesquite-flavored barbeque sauce
1/4 cup steak sauce (such as A1Â®), or to taste
1/4 cup other favorite steak sauce
2/3 cup apple butter
1 large onion, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, minced (optional)
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring, or to taste
1 tablespoon grill seasoning
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the barbeque sauce, both steak sauces, apple butter, onion, jalapeno pepper (if desired), garlic, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, grill seasoning, allspice, cloves, salt, and black pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until mixture is warmed through, then reduce heat to low and cook until onions are translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes more.
Reserve 2/3 to 1 cup of the sauce to use for dipping, while the remaining sauce can be used to baste while grilling.

Description: 
This sauce is sweet, spicy, and I have yet to find something it doesn't taste wonderful slathered all over. And the extra flavor from the apple butter gives it just the extra boost to make it absolutely wonderful.
