Description: 
THESE delicious muffins were a significant part of the first dinner I had with my wife when we were courting. She's an excellent cook, and that first meal was truly a gourmet's delight.    Now whenever she plans a menu and asks for my suggestions, I make sure these muffins are on it. -Robert Luebke, Appleton, Wisconsin
