Ingredients:
1 (32 ounce) bottle ketchup
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 bay leaves
1 1/2 pounds 80% lean ground beef

Directions:
Mix ketchup, beer, Worcestershire sauce, and bay leaves together in a slow cooker (such as Crock-Pot(R)) set over High.
Form ground beef into meatballs. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and cook meatballs, turning as needed, until browned, about 7 minutes.
Place meatballs in the slow cooker. Cook on High until sauce is thick, about 5 hours. Remove bay leaves before serving.

Description: 
I got this recipe from my mother. We always have it at parties. The fondue is a thick, rich, tomato-type fondue. There is no cheese in it and it doesn't need it. The meatballs soak up some of the sauce to make it super yummy! It's always a hit for us, so I thought I'd share.
