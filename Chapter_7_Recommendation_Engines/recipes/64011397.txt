Ingredients:
1- 5 oz.   Can Tuna packed in water- drained
1- 15 oz.  Can Mackerel in Brine- drained
1- 3.5 oz. Bag of Plain Pork Rinds
1\4 C. Grated Parmesan Cheese
2- Eggs
4- TBSP Mayonaise
2- TBSP Dijon Mustard
1- Small Onion chopped
1- tsp  Ground Paprika
1- tsp  Ground Sweet Basil
2- tsp  Mrs. Dash or other seasoning blend

Directions:
Mix all ingredients except the pork rinds together in a large mixing bowl.  Place the pork rinds in a large Ziploc bag and smash them up.  They don't have to be finely crushed.  Add the pork rinds a little at a time until the mixture becomes a consistency that you can shape into a ball that will hold together and then slightly flatten the balls leaving them fairly thick. Heat a large non-stick skillet on med\high until it's good an hot.  Spray the pan with butter flavored non-stick cooking spray and place your cakes in the pan.  Spray the top of the cakes with non stick cooking spray. Brown on one side for about 3-5 minutes and gently flatten them just a little with a fork. Flip with a spatula and allow the other side to brown for an additional 3-5 minutes.  Remove and drain on a paper towel if needed.  Serve with Tartar Sauce or any sauce that compliments fish.
