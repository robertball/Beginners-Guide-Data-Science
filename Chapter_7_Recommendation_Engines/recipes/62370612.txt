Ingredients:
4 ears  corn, shucked
1/4 cup melted butter
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup grated cotija cheese
Mexican red chile powder (NOT chili seasoning!)
4 wedges lime (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
Grill corn until hot and lightly charred all over, 7 to 10 minutes, depending on the temperature of the grill. In southern California, the vendors I knew would use Squeeze Parkay, but you could also roll the ears in melted butter. Then spread evenly with mayonnaise. Sprinkle with cotija cheese and spicy red chile powder and serve with a lime wedge.
