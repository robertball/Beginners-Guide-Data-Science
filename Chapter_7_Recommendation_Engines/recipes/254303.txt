Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup quick-cooking rolled oats
2 tablespoons firmly packed brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup fat free milk
1/2 cup Egg Beaters速 Original
1/4 cup plain nonfat yogurt
1 tablespoon Pure Wesson速 Canola Oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
PAM速 Organic Canola Oil No-Stick Cooking Spray
1/4 cup honey
2 medium bananas, peeled and sliced
1/2 cup fresh blueberries
Reddi-wip速 Fat Free Dairy Whipped Topping (optional)

Directions:
Combine flour, oats, sugar, baking powder and salt in large bowl; set aside. Stir together milk, Egg Beaters, yogurt, oil and vanilla in small bowl. Add to flour mixture; stir just until blended. (Do not overmix. Batter still should be slightly lumpy.)
Spray griddle with cooking spray. Heat over medium heat until hot or heat electric griddle to 400 degrees F. Pour about 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle for each pancake. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbles form on top and bottom is golden brown. Turn and cook side until golden brown. Repeat with remaining batter.
Drizzle each serving with 1 tablespoon honey; top with fresh fruit. Serve immediately.
