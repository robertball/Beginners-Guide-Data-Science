Description: 
Sangrita ('little blood') is the traditional Mexican chaser for tequila. It's a mix of FRESH orange and lime juices with salt and a spicy touch. You can give it the bloody appearance by adding a splash of pomegranate juice - or try using blood oranges when available (they really make it better).
