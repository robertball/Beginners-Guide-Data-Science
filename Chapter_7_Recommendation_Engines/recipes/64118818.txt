Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon salt
2 large red onions, thinly sliced
2 large sweet onions, thinly sliced
1 (48oz) carton chicken broth
1 (14oz) beef broth
1/2 cup red wine (optional)
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon parsley
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1 bay leaf
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
4 thick slices French or Italian bread
8 slices Gruyere or Swiss cheese slices
1/2 cup shredded Asiago or mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Melt butter in large pot over medium heat.
Stir in salt(necessary for the proper caramelization of the onions, red onions and sweet onions. Cook 35 minutes, stirring frequently, until onions are caramelized and almost syrupy.
Add chicken broth, beef broth, red wine, Worcestershire sauce, parsley thyme and bay leaf. Simmer for 20 mins.
Reduce heat to low, add vinegar (the addition of balsamic vinegar at the end is very important-not only for taste but also because there's a chemical in red onions that tends to turn the soup gray and cloudy, and the balsamic vinegar corrects that.)
Cover and keep over low heat to stay hot while you prepare the bread.
Preheat oven broiler. Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet put cheese on bread. Broil until melted and slightly golden. Make sure to keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn!
Fill bowl with soup and top with bread.
