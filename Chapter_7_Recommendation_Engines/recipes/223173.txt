Ingredients:
1/2 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon anise seed
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
2 bay leaves
5 whole cloves
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 cup cider vinegar
1 orange, juiced
1 lime, juiced
2 pounds flank steak
1 onion, chopped
2 tomatoes, chopped
1/4 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, or to taste
3 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
24 (5 inch) corn tortillas
1/2 onion, chopped
1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped
1 bunch radishes, halved

Directions:
Place 1/2 chopped onion, 2 cloves garlic, parsley, oregano, paprika, anise seed, black pepper, cumin, sage, thyme, bay leaves, cloves, soy sauce, vinegar, orange juice, and lime juice in a blender; pulse until a very well-blended paste is achieved, scraping down sides as needed, 3 to 5 minutes. Spread paste on both sides of the flank steak. Wrap steak in plastic and refrigerate at least 6 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove excess marinade from flank steak.
Grill steak until it begins to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Chop steak into small pieces and transfer to a platter; cover and keep warm until ready to serve.
Place 1 chopped onion, tomatoes, chipotle peppers, and 3 cloves garlic in a blend; pulse until desired consistency. Add water if the salsa becomes too thick. Transfer salsa to a bowl.
Heat tortillas in a microwave safe plate until warm, about 1 minute.
Serve beef over stacks of two corn tortillas with salsa and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 chopped onion, radishes, and cilantro.

Description: 
I have had great success preparing tacos this way. I bought this recipe from a taqueria owner (taco restaurant) in Mexico City. I am translating the directions. It can be used for beef, pork, or just about any other type of meat. The spice mix on this recipe gives meat a really excellent flavor.
