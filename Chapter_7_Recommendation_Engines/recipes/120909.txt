Ingredients:
1 cup butter flavored shortening
1 cup sugar
4 eggs, separated
1/2 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons grated orange peel
2 teaspoons orange extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Beat in egg yolks. Combine the orange juice, peel and extracts. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with juice mixture. In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; fold in to creamed mixture. Fill paper-lined muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.

Description: 
There are many orange groves in this area, so I attempted to create a muffin recipe using the fruit. I think it turned out very well, and everyone who's tried it agrees with me.
