Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 red onion, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 whole Branzino (sea bass) fish, cleaned
2 wedges fresh lemon
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
1/2 cup white wine
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves
1/4 cup chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley
2 lemon wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil into a large baking pan; add onion and season with salt and pepper.
Place the 2 cleaned fish into the baking pan and stuff each cavity with 1 lemon wedge, 1 rosemary sprig, and some of the red onion. Pour white wine and lemon juice over each fish and sprinkle with oregano. Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over the 2 fish.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes. Gently slide a spatula between the bones to separate fish; remove all the bones. Serve fish on a platter and garnish with parsley and lemon wedges.

Description: 
This simple, healthy, and delicious Mediterranean fish, also known as 'Greek Sea Bass', should be cooked whole. The cavity of the fish can be stuffed with lemon and other ingredients for added flavor. It is a very mild-tasting and versatile fish. The oregano and lemon make it truly Greek cuisine that many will enjoy. Can be found wild-caught in many stores. Enjoy!
