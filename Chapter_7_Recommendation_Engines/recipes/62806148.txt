Description: 
While in Puerta Vallerta, Mexico on vacation (called just Vallerta by locals), I took a cooking class.  We made this wonderful beef dish, flavored with orange and lime juice, and ate it rolled up in freshly made Tortillas.  So delicious!  The orange flavor, radishes and potatoes are more unusual additions to this recipe.  My family all loves this!
