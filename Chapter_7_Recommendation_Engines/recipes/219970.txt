Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
2 1/2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Cream together the butter, sugar, egg, milk, vanilla extract, and almond extract in a large bowl.
Stir in the flour and baking powder.
Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Divide the dough into thirds. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion to 1/4-inch thick.
Cut cookies out using a floured cookie cutter.
Arrange cookies on an ungreased baking sheet about 1-inch apart.
Bake until cookies are lightly golden, 6 to 9 minutes.
Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
