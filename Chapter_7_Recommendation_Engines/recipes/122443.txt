Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can cut green beans, drained
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
1 egg
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
Paprika

Directions:
In a skillet over medium heat, cook beef, onion and green pepper if desired until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the tomato sauce, beans, salt and garlic salt. Simmer for 8 minutes or until heated through.
Meanwhile, separate crescent dough into eight triangles; place in an ungreased 9-in. pie plate with points toward the center. Press onto the bottom and up the sides to form a crust; seal perforations. In a bowl, beat egg and 1 cup cheese; spread over crust. Stir 1/2 cup cheese into meat mixture; spoon into crust. Sprinkle with paprika and remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
