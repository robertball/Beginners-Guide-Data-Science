Ingredients:
1 medium spaghetti squash
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Cream of Celery Soup (regular or 98% Fat Free)
3/4 cup water
1/4 cup milk
1 cup low-fat Swiss cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
Chopped fresh parsley
Chives

Directions:
Pierce squash with fork or skewer in several places. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50 minutes or until the squash is fork-tender. Cut in half, scoop out and discard seeds. Scrape the flesh with fork to separate the spaghetti-like strands.
Stir the soup, water and milk in a 2-quart saucepan. Heat over medium heat to a boil. Stir in the Swiss cheese.
Place the hot spaghetti squash in a 2-quart serving bowl. Pour the soup mixture over the squash. Toss to coat. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, parsley, and chives.
