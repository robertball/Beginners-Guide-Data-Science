Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 small eggplant, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1/2 (8 ounce) package shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced
1 medium red onion, cut into 1/2-inch wedges
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 Thai chile, sliced, or more to taste
1 (13.5 ounce) can light coconut milk
1 1/2 cups vegetable broth
4 tablespoons green curry paste
1/2 (8 ounce) package snow peas, trimmed
1 red bell pepper, sliced into 3/4-inch strips
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Add eggplant and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Heat another tablespoon of oil in the skillet. Add mushrooms and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the eggplant.
Add remaining oil, onion, garlic, and Thai chile to the skillet. Cook until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in coconut milk, broth, curry paste, snow peas, bell pepper, and salt. Return eggplant and mushrooms to the skillet.
Bring curry to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
