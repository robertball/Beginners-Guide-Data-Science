Description: 
Leaving the tender skins on the spuds not only saves time, it sparks the taste and adds color to these hearty mashed potatoes. They're perfect with the pork roast and versatile enough to go well with other entrees.                                                           --Christine Wilson                                                       Sellersville, Pennsylvania
