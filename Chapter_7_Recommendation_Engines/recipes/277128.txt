Description: 
I love the taste of deep-fried okra.  Sometimes though, I want to limit my carbs, so I make okra fries.  They give me the flavor of fried okra, but with far fewer calories, and much less fat. Okra fries are a tasty snack and they can be an interesting veggie side for dinner. I love to munch them, plain, as a snack. Serve with dipping sauce of your choice.
