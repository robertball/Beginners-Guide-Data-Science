Ingredients:
6 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 egg whites
BATTER:
1 cup pumpkin
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 egg
2 egg whites
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/3 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
For filling, combine the cream cheese, sugar, flour and egg whites in a bowl; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat the pumpkin, applesauce, egg, egg whites and oil. Combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves; add to pumpkin mixture. Stir in walnuts.
Divide half of the batter between two 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans coated with nonstick cooking spray. Spread each with filling; top with remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely. Refrigerate leftovers.
