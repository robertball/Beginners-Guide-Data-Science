Ingredients:
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips
1 tablespoon Mexican-style seasoning blend (sodium free)
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 medium onion, diced
2  red and/or green bell peppers, chopped
1 (32 ounce) carton low-sodium chicken broth, divided
1 (5.6 ounce) package Knorr(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Fiesta Sides(<sup>&trade;</sup>) - Spanish <sup>&reg;</sup>ice
4 cups low-sodium pinto beans and/or black beans, drained and rinsed
Sour cream, shredded cheese, chopped cilantro, lime wedges, tortilla strips

Directions:
Season the chicken with Mexican blend. In a large saucepan or Dutch-oven set over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and stir occasionally, until the chicken is cooked, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper and onions, cook for 3 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in same pan, add 2 cups of the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add the Knorr(R) Fiesta Sides(TM) - Spanish Rice and prepare according to package directions (cover and simmer for 7 minutes).
Stir in the chicken/onion and pepper mix, along with the beans and remaining chicken broth. Bring to a low boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Serve, if desired, with sour cream, shredded cheese, chopped cilantro, lime wedges and tortilla strips.
