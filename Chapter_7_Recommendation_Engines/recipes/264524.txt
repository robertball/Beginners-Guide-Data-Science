Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 ears corn, kernels cut from cob
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 small shallot, minced
1 tablespoon mayonnaise, or more to taste
1 teaspoon chile-lime seasoning (such as Tajin®), or more to taste
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
2 ounces Cotija cheese, crumbled
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Heat oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add corn kernels, in batches if necessary. Stir briefly; sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Cook, without stirring, until corn is slightly charred, about 2 minutes. Stir once and cook for 1 minute more. Remove from heat and set aside.
Mix shallot, mayonnaise, and chile-lime seasoning together in a large bowl. Stir in the corn and jalapeno until well coated in dressing. Stir in 1/2 of the cilantro and Cotija cheese. Taste and season as desired. Top with the remaining cilantro. Serve each portion with a lime wedge.
