Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 egg
3/4 cup vanilla soy milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon lemon zest
4 ounces dairy-free cream cheese (such as Tofutti®)
3/4 cup fresh blueberries
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
Combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar and baking powder in large bowl.
In a second bowl, beat egg. Mix in soy milk, oil, and lemon zest. Pour egg mixture into flour mixture and mix batter with a spatula until just moistened. Fold in blueberries. Mix in dairy-free cream cheese by the 1/4 teaspoon so there are small chunks all around the batter. Gently blend in. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 18 to 20 minutes.
Combine 3 tablespoons sugar and lemon juice and in a small bowl. Brush onto the warm muffins immediately after they come out of the oven.

Description: 
Being lactose intolerant, I have adjusted my Mom's old recipe to make it non-dairy. Here is the perfect alternative using Tofutti® cream cheese. You would never know it's not real cream cheese. Serve this for breakfast or brunch on a sunny spring day.
