Ingredients:
2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, sliced 1/4-inch thick
1 whole garlic clove
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing pan
2 cups heavy cream
1 tablespoon fresh thyme, leaves only
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided
Salt and pepper to taste
Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil. Set aside. The sheet will catch any spills in the oven later on.
Place the potato slices in a large pot and cover with cold water. Season with salt and bring to boil for 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and allow the potatoes to steam for 1 minute.
Rub a 10-inch baking dish with the garlic clove and generously butter the dish. Finely chop the garlic. Set aside.
With the heat off, transfer the potatoes back to the pot and add heavy cream, thyme, half of the Parmesan cheese, chopped garlic, melted butter, salt and pepper. Stir all of the ingredients together until the potatoes are well coated.
Layer the potatoes on top of each other in the buttered baking dish. Pour any remaining liquid on top of the potatoes. Place the baking dish on the prepared baking sheet. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Remove the foil from the baking dish, add the remaining cheese and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
