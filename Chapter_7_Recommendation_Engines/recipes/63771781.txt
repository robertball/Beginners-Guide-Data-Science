Ingredients:
1 1/3 lbs. ground turkey
2 eggs

1/2 can salt free green beans
1/2 can low sodium baby peas
(A little butter to grease the loaf pan)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix together in a large bowl until well blended. Put in a greased loaf pan and bake for 1 hour. Cut into 6 slices. One slice per day will add a healthy supplement to your dog or puppy's diet. Keep refrigerated.

Description: 
I wanted to add a healthy supplement to my German Shepherd's diet without getting into the raw diet suggested.  Both he and our Australian Shepherd mix get excited when they smell supper being fixed.
