Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups fresh gooseberries
1 cup white sugar
1 recipe pastry for double-crust pie
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1 cup sour cream
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, gently stir together the gooseberries and sugar. Let stand for 15 minutes. Press one of the pie crusts into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch pie plate.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Mix in the sour cream, eggs and vanilla. Add the gooseberry and sugar mixture, and stir to coat evenly. Spoon into the pie crust, and place the second crust over the top. Crimp the edges to seal, and cut some decorative slits in the top to vent steam.
Bake for 55 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until serving.
