Ingredients:
2 14 oz cans "Del Monte Original Recipe" Stewed Tomatos
2 cloves garlic
1 medium onion
2 jalepeno peppers including seeds ( remove just the membranes)
1 handful FRESH cilantro
1/2 lime juiced
1 tsp ground cumin
1 packet Goya "sazon" (yellow box)

Directions:
Get out your blender! Dump in both cans of tomatos, seasonings, and lime juice. Quarter onion, peel garlic, remove tops of peppers and cut in 4 pieces. Add these to blender. PULSE blender to desired consistancy. Sample! I enjoy this right when it's made but letting it sit will infuse the heat factor of the peppers and bring out the garlic flavor more. A mild version is 1 pepper and hotter 3-4 peppers.

Description: 
I've tried so many salsas and couldn't find one that just popped my tastebuds. one of those perfect blend types. I experimented a LOT! I came up with this version. The best part is you put all in a blender and pulse to desired consistancy. Talk about fast!! Talk about GREAT flavor!! I'm always asked for the recipe, and to bring to any function. I'm sharing my secret recipe here with you. I hope you try and post your thoughts!
