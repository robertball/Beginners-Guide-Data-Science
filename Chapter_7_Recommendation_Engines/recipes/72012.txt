Ingredients:
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
2 pork chops
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup olive oil for frying

Directions:
Before opening the onion soup mix, use your hands to crush the larger bits of onion in the packet. Open the packet, and pour the mix into a shallow bowl. Stir in the flour.
Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. The oil is hot enough when a pinch of the flour mixture sizzles when tossed into the oil. Coat pork chops in the onion soup mixture, and shake off the excess. Carefully place in the hot oil. Turn chops over after about 30 seconds to quickly sear both sides. Cook for about 4 minutes per side, or to desired degree of doneness.

Description: 
I made this up one day because I was wanting something different then the same old pan-fried pork chops (that is how my husband asked me to cook them that day). So I made this up real fast, and boy did he love them. Now he asks for them every time. I do this with boneless and bone-in pork chops. So it doesn't matter what kind you have on hand, just cook them up and enjoy.
