Ingredients:
1 cup 		crab meat (canned works well in this dish, but I used the imitation stuff)
1 Tbsp.	bread crumbs
1 Tbsp.	onion, minced
1 Tbsp.	Parmesan cheese, grated
to taste		salt
2 Tbsp.	minced parsley
12 		mushrooms, get the largest you can find
1 		egg, beaten
to taste		hot sauce
1/4 cup 	melted butter

Directions:
Remove the stems from the mushrooms and mince, finely. In a bowl, mix crab meat, bread crumbs, onions, cheese, salt, parsley and chopped mushroom stems. Add beaten egg and hot sauce. I dip each mushroom cap into melted butter then stuff with the crab mixture. Place on a baking sheet and drizzle remaining butter over the mushrooms, bake 350: until tender about 30 minutes. Serve hot. Can even sprinkle more cheese over the mushrooms before baking.
