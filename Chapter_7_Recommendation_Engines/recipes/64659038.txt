Ingredients:
1 lb green beans, trimmed
5oz pitted Kalamata olives, sliced (with juice)
1-2 shallots, peeled/diced
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter
4 garlic cloves, minced
juice of half a lemon
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
2 shallots, peeled/thinly sliced
1 tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Begin heating olive oil in a large saucepan or pot. Add in shallots, and let cook over medium-high heat (7/10) until softened, about 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Strain olives and save olive juice
Add the olive juice (about 1/2 cup... add water if you fall short) to the sauce pan and bring to a boil. Add the green beans and salt (use a steamer in the pain of you have one. If not, no worries). Cover and reduce heat to medium for 30 minutes. Drain the green beans/shallots and set aside.
Melt butter in saucepan; add garlic, olives, and lemon, and saute mixture over medium heat 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in green beans/shallots and top with black pepper. Saute 5 minutes, then season to taste and serve.

Description: 
Garlic, olives, and green beans go surprisingly well together! and the lemon pepper is a nice touch.  The key here is that the beans are steamed in the olive juice.
