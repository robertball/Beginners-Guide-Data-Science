Ingredients:
1/3 cup broccoli florets
1/3 cup cauliflower florets
1/2 cup shelled edamame (green soybeans)
1 large carrot, chopped
1 tablespoon water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 zucchini, sliced
5 large mushrooms, sliced
1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
1 1/2 tablespoons reduced-sodium teriyaki sauce
2 tablespoons agave nectar

Directions:
Combine broccoli, cauliflower, edamame, carrots, and water in a microwave-safe bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 1 minute until vegetables are tender. Set aside.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; add onion. Cook and stir until onion is softened and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes.
Stir cooked broccoli, cauliflower, edamame, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, and garlic into the pan; cook and stir until vegetables are cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Stir in reduced-sodium teriyaki sauce and agave nectar; cook 5 more minutes.

Description: 
I invented this while goofing around in the kitchen. It ended up being a hit with my family! If the veggies are steamed tender-crisp before being thrown in the pan, it cuts the cooking time in half and makes it a quick healthy lunch! Serve warm, topped with toasted sesame seeds.
