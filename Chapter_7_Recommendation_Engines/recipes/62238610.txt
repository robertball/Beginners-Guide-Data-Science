In a large resealable bag, mix together the soy sauce, lemon juice, brown sugar, chili sauce, and garlic powder.. Place the pork chops into the bag, carefully seal the bag, and marinate for 6-12 hours in the refrigerator. Turn the bag over about halfway through.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.
Arrange pork chops on the lightly oiled grate, and cook 5 to 7 minutes on each side, until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Or, cook on the George Forman grill for 7-8 mins.

Description: 
The marinade is prepared in minutes, and the meat can marinate in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours.  For a quick and easy dinner, I prepare the marinade in the morning before work then throw them on the grill when I get home.  Note: the name implies that they are spicy-hot, but we did not find them so.  Just a slight kick.Modified from: Marinated Spicy Pork Chops
