Ingredients:
2 T. cornstarch (we used arrowroot)
3/4 c. vegetable broth
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 t. dried thyme
1 T. water
1/2 c. sherry (we used sake)
1 T. soy sauce
1/4 cup whole-grain Dijon mustard (we used regular)
1 T. lemon juice
2 T. capers (with brine)

Directions:
Mix the cornstarch with the broth and set aside.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, saut√© the garlic and thyme in the water for about a minute.
Add the wine and soy sauce, and raise the heat to high. Once the mixture is boiling, lower the heat to medium and simmer to reduce, about four minutes.
Add the vegetable broth mixture, mustard, lemon juice, and capers, and whisk. When the sauce is bubbling, lower the heat and simmer for about three minutes. The sauce should be on the thick side.
Let cool a bit before serving; this sauce tastes great just above room temperature.
