Ingredients:
2 cups milk
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup lukewarm water
2 heaping Tbsp. yeast
2 tsp. sugar
2 1/2 tsp. salt
3 beaten eggs
7-9 cups flour

Directions:
In saucepan, combine 2 cups milk, 1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup sugar.
Bring to a boil, then cool.
In a small bowl, combine 1 cup lukewarm water, 2 heaping Tbsp. yeast, and 2 tsp. sugar.
Set aside and let dissolve.
When the milk mixture has cooled to lukewarm, pour into mixer. Add a cup of flour, all of the yeast mixture, salt, and 3 beaten eggs. Beat until smooth. Add flour a little at a time while mixing until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl but is not stiff.
Place dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with cooking spray, and let rise in a warm place until dough has doubled in size. Punch down, cover, and let rise again until doubled in size.
After dough has risen a second time, divide in half. Place on a floured board or counter. Roll out until 1/2 inch thick and cut into circles. Place on a greased cookie sheet so that rolls are almost touching. Let rise for about 30 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees for 12-15 minutes until golden brown.
