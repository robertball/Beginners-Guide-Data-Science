Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup rolled oats
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 mini crisped rice chocolate bars (such as Nestle® Crunch bar), roughly chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter and peanut butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and smooth; beat in brown sugar and white sugar until incorporated. Add egg and vanilla to creamed butter mixture and mix until smooth.
Whisk oats, flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until just incorporated. Carefully fold chocolate bars into dough. Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
We didn't have any chocolate chips in the house, but we did have a bag of Nestle® Crunch candy bars meant for Halloween! Add that to an existing peanut butter oatmeal recipe, with a few modifications, and peanut butter crunch cookies are born!
