Ingredients:
Marinade:
1 cup canola oil
3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
4 jalapeno peppers, chopped, or to taste
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 limes, juiced
1 tablespoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
1 pound fresh tilapia fillets
Habanero Cream Sauce:
1 cup Mexican crema
1 dash habanero pepper sauce, or to taste
10 (10 inch) flour tortillas
Toppings:
1/4 medium head green cabbage, julienned
1/2 red onion, julienned
2 bunches green onions, finely chopped
3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 cup salsa
3 limes, quartered

Directions:
Mix canola oil, cilantro, jalapeno peppers, chili powder, lime juice, salt, and black pepper for marinade together in a large bowl. Let sit for at least 30 minutes. Add tilapia fillets and marinate in the mixture for 30 minutes, up to 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove fish from marinade and rub off remaining jalapenos and cilantro.
Cook the marinated tilapia on the preheated grill until easily flaked with a fork, about 3 minutes per side.
Mix Mexican crema and habanero hot sauce together in a small bowl.
Shred cooked fish on a plate using 2 forks.
Heat a skillet over high heat. Warm flour tortillas in the hot pan, about 20 seconds per side.
Place a dab of habanero cream sauce on each tortilla. Place fish on top of cream sauce and add cabbage, red onion, green onions, and cilantro. Top tacos with salsa and a squeeze of lime juice.
