Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped pecans
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/3 cup shortening
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/3 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
1 1/2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Grind the 1/2 cup pecans in a blender, food processor, or food grinder.
Combine the nuts with the flour and baking powder.
In a separate bowl beat butter and shortening with an electric mixer for 30 seconds.
Add the sugar and beat until fluffy.  Add egg, sour cream and vanilla and beat until well mixed.
Stir in the flour, baking powder and the ground nuts.
Divide dough in half.  Cover and chill at least 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Work half of the dough at a time.  Keep the other half refrigerated.  Roll dough to 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly floured surface.  Cut with desired cookie cutter.
Place on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake 7-8 minutes or until done.  Remove from sheet and cool on a rack.
To make lemon glaze:  Beat 1 egg white until frothy.  Add 1 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar,  1 tablespoon lemon juice and a dash of salt.  Beat well.
Spread cookies with Lemon Glaze and sprinkle with nuts.
