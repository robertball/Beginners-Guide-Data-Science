Tomato Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
2 TBSP olive oil
1 large or 2 medium onions, halved and thinly sliced
1 carrot, chopped
Salt and freshly ground pepper
2 TBSP tomato paste
1 sprig fresh thyme, or 1/2 tsp dried
2 lbs tomatoes, cored and chopped, or 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes
2-3 cups water or tomato juice
1 tsp sugar, optional
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves for garnish, optional

Directions:
Put the oil in a large pot over medium heat. When it's hot, add onion and carrot, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until vegetables begin to soften (3-5 minutes). Add tomato paste, lower heat a bit, and continue to cook, stirring to coat vegetables with paste, until paste begins to darken--don't let it burn (1-2 minutes).
Strip thyme leaves from stem and add to the pot along with tomatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes break down (10-15 minutes). Add 2 cups of water or juice and bring to a boil, then adjust heat so mixture bubbles gently. Let cook until flavors meld (5 more minutes).
Taste and adjust seasoning; if soup tastes flat (but salty enough), stir in sugar. If it's too thick, add more water, 1/4 cup at a time. If it's too thin, cook until it thickens and reduces slightly (this will intensify the flavors). Garnish with basil, if using, and serve.

Description: 
This tomato soup is a healthy homemade version that can be ramped up by adding rice or couscous and curry or chili powder instead of thyme.
