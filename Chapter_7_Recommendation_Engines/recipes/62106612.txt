Ingredients:
2-3 lbs. skirt steak
1 bottle Guinnes stout
3 cloves garlic chopped
3 tbs dark brown sugar
1/4 cup olive oil
1/3 cup red wine vinegar
1 Tbs hot suace(I prefer Crystal)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in tupperware or any airtight container.  Let marinte for 8-24 hours.  Light grill and get it very hot.  Remove steaks from marinade, let excess drip off.  Place on very hot grill and let cook 5 1/2-6 minutes per side.
IMPORTANT:  DO NOT MOVE THE STEAKS ONCE THEY ARE ON THE GRILL.  YOU WANT A GOOD SEAR ON EACH SIDE.  LEAVE THEM ALONE UNTIL TURNING!!!!!
Turn steaks and finish on second side for about 5-6  minutes for med-rare.
Let rest 2-3 minutes in a warm oven before serving
