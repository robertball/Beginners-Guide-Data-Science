Ingredients:
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1 cup buttermilk
1 lb. lean ground beef
1 lb. ground pork
1 egg, lightly beaten
3/4 cup minced onion, pressed between paper towels to remove excess moisture
1/4 cup capers, chopped
2 Tbsp. Creole mustard
1- 1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 Tbsp. finely minced fresh parsley
3 Tbsp. butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups low-sodium beef broth
3-4 Tbsp. cream
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper and set aside.
Combine bread crumbs and buttermilk in a large bowl and allow to stand 10 minutes. Add beef, pork, egg, onion, capers, mustard, salt, pepper, garlic, and parsley and combine with your hands. Using a cookie scoop, scoop meat mixture into tablespoon-sized portions and shape into balls. Place on baking sheet. Broil 10-12 minutes on low until meatballs are brown.
While meatballs are browning, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add flour and whisk until smooth. Add about 1 cup beef broth and whisk together until completely smooth. Add remaining beef broth and increase heat to medium so the gravy begins to simmer and thicken. Add browned meatballs and simmer about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cream. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Serve with chopped fresh parsley; boiled red potatoes tossed with butter, salt, and pepper; and lingonberry or whole cranberry sauce.
