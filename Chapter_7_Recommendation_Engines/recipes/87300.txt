Ingredients:
2 soft-shell crabs, cleaned
1/4 cup cheriyaki glaze
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon mirin
1 tablespoon soy sauce

Directions:
In a deep skillet, mix together the cheriyaki glaze, Worcestershire sauce, mirin and soy sauce. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Place the crabs side by side in the sauce, with the top shell down. Cook for about 5 minutes, then turn and cook for 5 more minutes. Remove to serving plates, and serve with plenty of napkins!
