Ingredients:
1 acorn squash, halved and seeded
1/2 onion, cut into chunks
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon ground cumin
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
ground red pepper to taste
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
Cut squash into chunks and remove rind. Shred squash and onion in a food processor. Place in a colander and press with a potato masher to drain any excess liquid. Transfer to a bowl and mix with flour and egg. Season with cumin, salt, pepper, and red pepper.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place walnut-sized scoops of the squash mixture into the hot oil. Press flat with a spatula. Cook 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
