Ingredients:
2 very ripe bananas
6 ice cubes
1 cup milk
1 1/2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon peanut butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Blend bananas, ice cubes, milk, cocoa powder, peanut butter, and vanilla extract together in a blender on high speed until smooth.

Submitter: 
Chaya
Description: 
The sweetness of the bananas in this smoothie means you don't need to add any sugar to sweeten the cocoa. This is my go-to for a midday energy boost and kids love it too.
