Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) flat iron steaks
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons fresh lime juice

Directions:
Lay steaks out on a platter and allow to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Whisk together the olive oil, pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, brown sugar, and lemon juice in a small bowl. Evenly rub one side of each steak with the mixture.
Lay the steaks on the hot grill with the seasoned-side facing up for 2 minutes. Flip and sear the seasoned side about 2 minutes.
Transfer steaks to preheated oven; bake to desired doneness, seasoned-side up, 8 to 10 minutes for medium-well. Allow to rest 3 to 4 minutes before serving.
