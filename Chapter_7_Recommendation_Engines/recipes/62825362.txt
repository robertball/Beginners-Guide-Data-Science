Image:

Ingredients:
4 large Carrots
6 cups broth  (I use Chicken, but Vegie works well too)
1 large onion, roughly chopped
1 clove garlic, minced or pressed
2 TBS good curry powder
1/2 cup rice
1/3 cup crunchy peanut butter (creamy will do, of course)
8 oz frozen corn. (Canned would work, use the liquid.)
2 cups broccoli florets
salt to taste (Sometimes I use Tamari instead of salt)

Directions:
1. Slice carrots; cover with 3 cups of broth. Cover pot and simmer rapidly until carrots are very tender (25-30 minutes).
Drain, reserving liquid. Whirl carrots in processor til pureed to your liking. (I like mine quite lumpy. If I'm in a hurry, I don't bother pureeing.)
2. Return carrots to pot and stir in reserved liquid, remaining broth, onion, garlic, peanut butter, curry powder, corn, and rice. Cover, bring to boil, then simmer gently over medium-low heat until rice is tender to bite (30-40 minutes). Stir occasionally.
3. Add broccoli and cook just until tender, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
One of our favorite soups, it's relatively fast and easy.
If I'm serving guests, I often add shrimp and use canned baby corn instead of the frozen corn. 
One advantage is how easily it's adapted and/or stretched.
