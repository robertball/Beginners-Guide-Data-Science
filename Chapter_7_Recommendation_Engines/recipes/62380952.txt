Ingredients:
3/4 C toasted almonds
3/4 C Craisins
12 oz dark chocolate chips
8 oz white chocolate chips

Directions:
Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
Melt dark chocolate chips in microwave safe bowl on high power stirring every 30 seconds until smooth.
Spread on prepared pan to about 1/8-1/4" thick and top with craisins and almonds. (I press them into the chocolate a little with my hands)
In a different bowl, melt the white chocolate using the same method and drizzle over the top.
Cool and cut to desired shape and size.

Description: 
Easy treat that looks way harder than it is. I give it as gifts so serving size is a little debatable. It makes about 11 X 13 before cutting it up.
