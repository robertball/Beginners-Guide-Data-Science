1 1/2 cups fresh peaches, pitted and chopped
1 1/2 cups fresh pineapple chunks

1 cup chopped celery
3/4 cup slivered almonds
1/2 cup chopped red onion
HONEY DRESSING:
1 cup mayonnaise
3/4 cup peach preserves or orange marmalade
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine chicken, fruit, celery, almonds and onion. Mix dressing ingredients in a small bowl. Pour about 1/2 cup (just enough to moisten) over chicken mixture; toss to coat. Cover and chill salad and leftover dressing for several hours. Add remaining dressing just before serving.
