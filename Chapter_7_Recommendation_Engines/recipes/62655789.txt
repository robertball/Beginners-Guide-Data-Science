Ingredients:
2 cups low-fat vanilla yogurt,
1 cup low-fat milk,
1/3 cup white sugar,
1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract,
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips

Directions:
Combine the yogurt, milk, sugar and extracts into a food processor and puree until smooth, about 30 seconds.
Freeze according to your ice cream maker's instructions.  When five minutes are left in the freezing time, add the dark chocolate chips.
Pour mixture into a one quart container and place in the freezer for 2 hours to harden.  Stir the frozen yogurt to ensure all the chocolate chips haven't settled to the bottom.  Freeze for 2 more hours before serving.

Description: 
This is a good substitute for the real thing.  I use dark chocolate chips because I prefer the flavor, and they have health benefits, too.  You can use regular chocolate chips if you prefer.
