Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 cup lukewarm water
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Stir yeast and sugar into lukewarm water, using a fork. Let stand in a warm place until a creamy layer forms on top of the water, about 10 minutes.
Mix flour and salt in a large bowl. Mix olive oil into flour and stir for 2 minutes. Pour yeast mixture and beaten egg into flour mixture and stir to make a stiff dough. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until springy and smooth, about 8 minutes. Place dough into a floured bowl and cover with a piece of plastic wrap wiped with a thin film of olive oil.
Let dough rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down and roll out to desired shape.
