Ingredients:
1/2 cup wild rice
2 cups water
1 cup orzo pasta
3 tablespoons chopped red onion
3 tablespoons dried currants
2 tablespoons corn kernels, drained
3 tablespoons diced yellow bell pepper
3 tablespoons diced red bell pepper
3 tablespoons diced green bell pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoons honey
3/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup canola oil
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Bring the wild  rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender but not mushy, 20 to 45 minutes depending on the variety of wild rice. Drain off any excess liquid, fluff the rice with a fork, and cook uncovered 5 minutes more. Once finished, spread into a shallow dish, and refrigerate until cold.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the orzo pasta, and cook until al dente, 7 to 8 minute. Drain, rinse with cold water, and chill.
Place the chilled rice and orzo into a large mixing bowl. Stir in the red onion, currants, corn, yellow bell pepper, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper. Season with 2 tablespoons basil, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. In a separate bowl, whisk together the vinegar, honey, mustard, garlic, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and 1 1/2 teaspoons basil. Slowly whisk in the canola and olive oils until emulsified. Stir the dressing into the pasta, and refrigerate 2 hours before serving.
