Ingredients:
1 c. sugar
1/2 c. brown sugar, packed
1/2 c. oil
1 c. canned pumpkin
1/4 c. fresh squeezed orange juice
2 eggs
2 c. all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. each salt, cinnamon and nutmeg
1/4 tsp. ginger
1 Tbsp. orange rind, very finely grated
1 c. raisins or dried cranberries (optional)
1/2 c. chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease and flour a large loaf pan.
Combine sugars, oil, pumpkin, orange juice and eggs. Mix well. Sift together flour, soda, salt and spices. Add dry ingredients to wet and stir well to combine. Stir in orange peel, raisins or cranberries and nuts, if using.
Pour into prepared loaf pan and bake for 65 to 75 minutes or until toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean.
Remove and cool on rack for about 10 or 15 minutes. Turn out bread onto rack and continue to completely cool.
For muffins - Grease & flour muffin tins instead of loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool about 5 to 10 minutes and turn out onto cooling rack. Cool completely - these can be individually frozen, too.

Description: 
This is the best pumpkin bread! My grandma & mom always used this recipe and I can't resist making it when I feel that very first hint of fall in the air. Your house will smell like heaven. It also makes nice muffins - just bake about 25 minutes or so.
