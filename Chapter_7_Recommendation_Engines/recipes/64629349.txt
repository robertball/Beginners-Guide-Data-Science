1 cup rice
1 1/2 cup water
100 grams chicken
pinch of pepper
pinch of salt
1 Tbsp sake
1/3 pc carrot

Directions:
Soak the dried shiitake in water for 2 hours before starting. Wash the rice then soak it in 1 1/2 cup rice 30 minutes before cooking.
Add salt, pepper and sake to chicken. Cover and cook in the microwave for 2 minutes using 600W. Let it cool then reserve 1 tablespoon from the chicken juice you get after steaming in the microwave. Once it cools, shred the chicken into small pieces.
Remove the hard stem part of shiitake then thinly slice the head. Dice the carrot and mince the ginger.
In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, sake, reserved chicken juice, sugar, salt, pepper and sesame oil. Mix well. Add the mixture into the rice.
Add the shiitake, carrot, ginger, chicken, bacon and chestnuts to the rice then cover or wrap with a microwave-safe cling wrap. Microwave for 6 minutes using 600W.
Take out from the microwave and mix then let it cool for about 2 minutes. Bring back into the microwave then cook for 8 minutes using 600W.
Keep it covered for 5 more minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is a Chinese-inspired rice recipe that is popular in Japan. This is called okuwa in Japanese and usually mochi rice (glutinous rice) is used to cook this rice dish. I've used brown rice to make okuwa and it still turned out delicious.
