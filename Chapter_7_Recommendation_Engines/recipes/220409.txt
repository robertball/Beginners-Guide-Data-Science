Ingredients:
1/2 quart vegetable oil for frying
1/2 quart peanut oil for frying
1 egg
2 tablespoons water
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch cubes
3 cups water
5 tablespoons cornstarch
6 chicken bouillon cubes
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
ground white pepper to taste
1 cup cashews
1 cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Beat egg and 2 tablespoons water in a bowl.
Measure flour into a separate bowl.
Dip chicken cubes in egg mixture; remove. Roll chicken in flour until completely coated.
Carefully place small batches of coated chicken into hot oil using a slotted spoon. Fry until chicken is golden brown and center is no longer pink, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.
Arrange cooked chicken on a baking sheet and place in preheated oven to keep warm while continuing to fry remaining chicken.
Whisk 3 cups water, cornstarch, chicken bouillon cubes, oyster sauce, and white pepper together in a saucepan; simmer over medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes.
Pour sauce over cooked chicken to serve. Sprinkle cashews and green onions over each serving.

Description: 
Springfield, Missouri is the home of Cashew Chicken. This is supposed to be Leong's original recipe. Leong and his brother Gee developed this famous dish, creating a fried chicken with an Asian flair in the 1960s. This is the closest recipe I have ever found to tasting like the original. And since it is supposed to be the original, maybe that is why? There are numerous variations of this famous dish, so it is how you remember it! Make your favorite fried rice or order from your favorite restaurant to go along with the chicken. Enjoy!
