Chicken pieces (2 lbs or more); thighs or legs, or breasts
Vegetables: zuchini, carrots, celery (your choice) chopped or sliced
1 1/2 tsp garlic salt
3/4 tsp pepper
1 tbsp dried onion or 1/4 cup fresh green onions
3 tsps (up to 3 tbsps) chicken bullion granules
Lots of fresh or dried dill
1 1/2 packages frozen Grandma's noodles (found at Staters in frozen food dept)
or Large egg noodles

Directions:
Clean chicken and remove skin.
Put chicken in large pot of water (3/4 full pot of water)
Bring to boil and cook for 1 hour or until chicken is done (if froth develops just spoon off)
After cooked, remove chicken and allow to cool on a plate for 1 hour or less.
While chicken is cooling add vegetables and spices to broth.
Turn heat down and allow to simmer. When chicken is cool remove meat from bones and add to broth.
(you can put all of this into a crockpot now and cook on high for 2-3, or low longer)
Make sure you add more dill and bullion as per your taste.
