Ingredients:
¼ cup vegetable oil
1 (4 to 6 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces
1  onion, chopped
1  green bell pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cloves garlic
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 cup rice
2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1  bay leaf
2 cups chicken stock, or as needed to cover
1 cup green peas
½ cup sliced black olives
½ cup raisins
¼ cup chopped pimento peppers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir chicken pieces until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and place on a plate. Cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, minced garlic, and whole garlic cloves in the same Dutch oven until onion is softened, about 5 minutes.
Return chicken to the onion mixture. Add tomatoes, rice, salt, oregano, black pepper, and bay leaf. Pour in enough chicken stock to cover all the ingredients.
Bake chicken-rice mixture in the preheated oven until rice is tender and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Stir peas, olives, raisins, and pimento peppers into the chicken-rice mixture. Bake until warmed through, an additional 15 minutes.

Wonderful homey chicken dish. This is a recipe from a relative in Panama. Fluff the rice carefully with a fork before serving, and enjoy!
