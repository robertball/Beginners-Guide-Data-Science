Ingredients:
1 large can chicken, pureed with juices
1 cup water
1 T. baking powder
1 T. baking soda
2 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup dried milk
2-4 cups whole wheat flour (varies if you choose to add vegetable protein)
2 cups frozen vegetables
1 cup vegetable protein from healthfood store (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325.  In a large mixer, combine chicken, water, eggs, oil, baking powder and soda until blended.  Add dried milk.  Start adding your flour and mix until it is the consistency of thick pancake flour or  cookie dough.  Add your vegetables until folded into batter.  The batter will be stiff.
Spoon them into muffin molds.  I bake these in those silicon muffin pans, but if you use the metal ones, spray them first with oil.  Bake them for 30 to 40 minutes.  Watch these as you don't want them to burn.
Package the unused ones in freezer plastic bags and store them in the freezer until needed.  We just pop them into the microwave for 15 seconds and Voila!  I reuse my freezer bags many times.
My babies love these!!  They take some time to make, but even my husband knows how to do it now!
