Ingredients:
8 ounces bacon
1/2 pound ground beef
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into cubes
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon to a plate lined with paper towels, reserving drippings in the skillet.
Break ground beef into the skillet; cook and stir until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain beef, return skillet to stove, and reduce heat to low.
Stir diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, cream cheese, and shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend into ground beef. Crumble bacon and stir most of it, reserving a few teaspoons for garnish, into beef mixture; cook and stir until cheese begins to melt, 2 to 3 minutes; transfer to a slow cooker.
Cook in slow cooker on Low until hot and bubbly, 2 to 3 hours. Stir parsley into the dip. Garnish with reserved bacon. Keep in the slow cooker set to Low to serve.

Description: 
I made this a couple of years ago for a picnic, and it was a huge hit. Serve with bell pepper strips and bagel chips. Really good with tortilla chips, too.
