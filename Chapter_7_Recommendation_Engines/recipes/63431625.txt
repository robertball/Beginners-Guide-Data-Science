Ingredients:
2 lbs of 93% lean ground turkey breast
1 14-16 oz. bag of frozen pepper strips, defrosted
1 cup of Italian bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Cover a cookie sheet with foil and spray with no-stick spray for easy clean-up.
Open bag of pepper strips and pour in a colander to drain.  Then place peppers in a food processor or blender and puree.
Mix the turkey, pepper puree and bread crumbs together.  Form a loaf and place on the prepared cookie sheet.  Cook for about 45-60 minutes (depending on how well done you like it).

I created this on a cold day when I didn't want to go to the store so I came up with this using just what I had in the house.  With only 3 ingredients it couldn't be easier.
