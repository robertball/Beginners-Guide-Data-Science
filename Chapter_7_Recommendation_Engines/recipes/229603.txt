Ingredients:
6 cups water
3 cups instant rice
2 cups chopped cooked chicken
2 (8 ounce) cans sliced mushrooms, drained
1 (15 ounce) can French-cut green beans, drained
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
3 stalks celery, chopped
¾ cup sour cream
¾ cup mayonnaise
¾ cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
2 teaspoons salt-free garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 teaspoon salt
¾ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon monosodium glutamate (such as Ac'cent(<sup>&reg;</sup>)) (optional)
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 ½ cups crushed potato chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring water to a boil in a pot. Stir rice into boiling water, cover pot with a lid, and remove pot from heat. Let rice steam until water is absorbed completely, about 5 minutes.
Combine rice, chicken, mushrooms, green beans, cream of chicken soup, celery, sour cream, mayonnaise, onion, garlic, seasoning blend, salt, black pepper, monosodium glutamate, and red pepper flakes in a large bowl; stir until evenly mixed. Spread the mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle potato chips over the cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the potato chips are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
