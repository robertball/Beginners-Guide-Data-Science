Sweet Potato Casserole w/ Candied Praline Topping Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
5 large sweet potatoes or yams
1/2 stick of butter, softened
1/4 c. granulated sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1 tsp. vanilla
1/4-1/3 c. milk, cream or half & half
1/2 c. heavy cream
1 c. firmly packed light brown sugar
1/3 c. melted butter
1 c. chopped pecans

Directions:
Peel and cube sweet potatoes or yams.  Cook in boiling water until tender in a covered saucepan.
Lightly mash cooked sweet potatoes, adding the butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla and milk (or cream) mixing well. Pour the mixture into a baking pan or casserole dish.
Topping:  Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan, do not allow it to go to a heavy boil. Add the brown sugar and stir until it dissolves.
Cook the mixture over medium heat until it reaches the 'soft-ball' stage on a candy thermometer.  If you do not have a candy thermometer, drop a bit in to a cool glass of water.  If it becomes a 'soft ball' it is ready.  If you are not comfortable with candy thermometers and the like, do not worry, it does not have to be perfect for this recipe to be successful.
Remove from the heat and beat in the butter and the chopped pecans. Pour this mixture over the yams. Bake in a 350 degree oven until very hot and beginning to brown - 30-40 minutes.
