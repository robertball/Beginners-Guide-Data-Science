Ingredients:
4 boneless chicken breast
2.5 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar
4 Tbsp Extra Virgin Olive oil
2 tsp Coarse Ground Sea Salt
1/2 tsp Fresh Cracked Black Pepper
1 tsp Ground White Pepper
1/4 tsp Cayenne Powder
1/2 tsp Garlic Powder
1 tsp Onion Powder
1/2 tsp Smoke Paprika Powder

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a bowl or plastic bag (make sure to increase measurements if doing more than one breast).
Add the chicken. Marinate 30 minutes - 2 hours.
Prep your grill, getting a medium-high heat (roughly 375-400 degrees).
Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard marinade.
Place the marinated chicken breasts over direct heat, grilling for 3-5 minutes per side -- until an internal thermometer registers a temp of 160 degrees.
Remove from heat to a plate, covering it with foil. Allow the chicken to rest another 5 minutes or until an internal temperature of 165 is reached.
Slice for a salad or serve as desired.
