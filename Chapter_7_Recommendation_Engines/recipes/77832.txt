Ingredients:
3 cups frozen cranberries
1 cup pecans
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 2 quart rectangular baking dish.
Spread the cranberries evenly over the bottom of the baking dish, and sprinkle the pecans over the cranberries. Spoon 1 cup of sugar over the cranberries and pecans.
Place the eggs into the work bowl of an electric mixer, and beat on high speed about 1 minute, until the eggs are foamy. Beat in 1 cup of sugar, the flour, melted butter, and milk, and beat on Low until just mixed. The batter will be thick. Spread the batter evenly over the cranberry-pecan mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cake is lightly brown and a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Carefully invert the cake onto a serving plate, so the cranberry-pecan layer is on top. Let cool 30 minutes before serving.
