Ingredients:
1 cup chopped dates
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 egg white

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine the dates, water and sugar. Cook and stir until mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until mixture is thickened, stirring constantly.
In a large bowl, combine the oats, flour, brown sugar, baking soda and salt. Stir in the butter and egg white until blended. Pat half of the mixture into an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Carefully spread with date mixture. Gently pat remaining oat mixture over date mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into bars.
