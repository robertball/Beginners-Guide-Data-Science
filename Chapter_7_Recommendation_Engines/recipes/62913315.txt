Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup canned chicken broth, or water
3/4 cup uncooked quinoa,
1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar
2 Tbsp orange marmalade
2 tsp dark sesame oil
1 Tbsp ginger root, fresh, minced
1 tsp kosher salt
1 cup sugar snap peas, trimmed and halved
1 cup shredded carrots
1 cup shredded red cabbage
1 small sweet red pepper, thinly sliced
3 Tbsp cilantro, fresh, chopped
2 Tbsp scallion, thinly sliced
1 Tbsp sesame seeds, toasted

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine broth and quinoa; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, to make dressing, in a small bowl, whisk together vinegar, marmalade, oil, ginger and salt; set aside.
After quinoa has cooked for 10 minutes, toss in snap peas to partially steam them; cover and simmer until most of liquid has been absorbed, about 5 to 6 minutes.
Remove pan from heat and stir in carrots, cabbage, peppers and dressing; mix to thoroughly combine. Garnish with cilantro, scallions and sesame seeds. Serve warm, room temperature or chilled. Yields about 1 heaping cup per serving.
Check the box of quinoa you bought to see if it has been "prerinsed". If not, rinse the quinoa in a colander before cooking to remove its bitter outer coating.
Use prepackaged coleslaw mix or shredded vegetables to speed the preparation of this dish.

Quinoa is a good source of protein and makes a wonderful substitute for rice in salads. Buy the pre-rinsed variety to save time.
