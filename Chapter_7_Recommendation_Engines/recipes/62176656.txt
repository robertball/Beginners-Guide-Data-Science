Ingredients:
1 small red bell pepper
1 small yellow bell pepper
1 small green bell pepper
1 lb fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined
4 cups dry tricolor rotini pasta
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 small onion, diced
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms (optional)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried basil
1 4oz package crumbled feta cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Remove seeds from bell peppers and slice into 2-inch chunks, then add to skewers, alternating with shrimp.
Grill kebabs over medium flame for approx 10 minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper, until shrimp is cooked through and peppers are still crispy.
Bring 6 cups of water to boil, add pasta, and cook around 7 minutes, until pasta is cooked al dente. Drain, pour into large bowl, and mix in olive oil.
With a small amount of olive oil over medium-high heat, saute onion, mushrooms (optional), garlic, and spices until onions are translucent (about 7-10 minutes). Add to pasta.
Remove shrimp and bell peppers from skewers, dice the peppers, and add both shrimp and peppers to the pasta.
Add feta cheese to pasta, and stir. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Serve as is, or chill in fridge overnight.

Description: 
Blending the flavors of summer grilling into one unique dish that will win you praise at the next potluck picnic you're invited to! You can serve this hot or cold, depending on your preference. I have also added grilled spicy sausage chopped into small pieces before, but this is optional.
