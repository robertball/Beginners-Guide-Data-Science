Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup flour
2 cups chicken broth
4 cups milk (either non-fat or whole)
2 cans black beans, drained
2 cans diced tomatoes with juice
20 oz corn (either canned or frozen)
1 medium onion, chopped
1 red or yellow bell pepper, chopped
2 cans mild red enchilada sauce
4 chicken breasts (either boneless or bone-in)
2 cups shredded cheese for garnish - either cheddar or Jack
tortilla chips for garnish

Directions:
In a large sauce pan, stir flour into melted butter; whisk until smooth. Over low heat add 1 cup broth and 1 cup milk.  Cook and stir until thickened.  Remove from heat, and combine this mixture with remaining milk, broth and enchilada sauce.
In a large dutch oven or soup pot combine beans, corn, tomatoes, onion and pepper.  Place chicken breasts on top, and pour sauce mixture over all.
Simmer 1 hour or until chicken is done.  Remove chicken from soup and stir.  Tear chicken into bite sized pieces and return to soup.
Garnish with crumbled tortilla chips and cheese.
