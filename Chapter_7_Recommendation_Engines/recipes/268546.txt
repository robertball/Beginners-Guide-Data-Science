Ingredients:
1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 squeeze lemon juice, or more to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon flour, or more as needed
1 cup vegetable broth
1/2 cup creme fraiche, or more to taste
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Drizzle mushrooms with lemon juice.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until softened and liquid has mostly evaporated, about 5 minutes. Dust with flour and mix well. Add broth and cover. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir creme fraiche into skillet. Season mixture with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Stir parsley in before serving.

Description: 
I usually use button mushrooms or white mushrooms, but you can use any combination. I like using creme fraiche, but you can substitute cream as well. Serve with noodles, rice, or bread.
