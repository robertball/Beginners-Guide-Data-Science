Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place about a tablespoon of beef drippings into each cup of a 6 cup muffin tin.
In a medium bowl, whisk eggs until well blended. Stir in the milk, flour and salt. Fill the muffin cups about half way.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
