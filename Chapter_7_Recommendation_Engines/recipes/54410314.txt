Ingredients:
3 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup white wine
2 teaspoons butter
1 medium onion, chopped
1 cup rice, uncooked
1 medium zucchini, chopped
1 medium carrot, grated (optional)
5 marinated sun-dried tomatoes, softened and chopped
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan (or mozzarella) cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves, or to taste (optional)
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring chicken stock to a boil in a medium pot, then reduce heat to simmer.
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in onions and cook for 2 minutes, or until softened. Add the rice and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted. Gradually ladle in simmering stock, stirring continuously. Risotto will become creamy and slightly sticky, yet still firm in the center, or al dente.
When almost finished, stir in the zucchini, carrots, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic and thyme, adding stock as needed and stirring continuously. Stir in basil and 3 tablespoons cheese just before serving. Divide risotto among 6 bowls, sprinkle with remaining cheese, and season with pepper to taste.

Description: 
This creamy main dish gets a splash of color with the addition of zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and basil. With much less butter than in a typical risotto recipe and no wine, there's no running around for ingredients you don't have on hand! The result is a lovely, light flavor in a very filling meal.Modified from: Zucchini Risotto
