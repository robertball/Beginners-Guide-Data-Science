Ingredients:
1 whole chicken with giblets, patted dry and quartered
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons clarified butter
1 onion, trimmed
4 whole cloves, or more to taste
4 cardamom pods, or more to taste
1 bay leaf, or more to taste
1 quart water, or more as needed

Directions:
Rub chicken with salt and pepper.
Combine chicken, giblets, and butter in a 5-quart pot over medium heat. Add onion, cloves, cardamom, and bay leaf. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until moisture has evaporated. Cook chicken until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
Pour in enough water to just cover the chicken. Simmer until flavors combine, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
My husband taught me this traditional Egyptian recipe. He says I make it better than his mom did! The trick is knowing exactly when to add the water, giving the chicken enough time to fry a little, but not letting it burn. Serve with rice and stewed vegetables.
