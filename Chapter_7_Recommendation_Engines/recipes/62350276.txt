Ingredients:
3 medium-large Green Peppers
1/4 cup chicken broth (just enough to coat bottom of pan)
2 raw skinless boneless chicken breast (cut into small bite sized pieces, smaller the better)
1 small onion, diced small
2 tablespoons Olive oil
1-2 cups your favorite marinara or pasta sauce
2 cups rice (pre-cooked)(I use brown)
1/2 tsp Italian seasoning (optional)
1/2 cup feta cheese
1+ cup shredded Cheddar cheese (or more to your taste)

Directions:
Cut peppers in half (top to bottom)remove insides and seeds. Lay, open side up, in glass pan, pour chicken broth in bottom, cover pan with foil (to keep moisture in) and put in 350 oven while preparing stuffing mixture (15-20 minutes)  This will help pre-cook the peppers and ensure they are soft and cooked through when you serve)
On stovetop, in large fry pan, saute diced onion and chicken over medium heat until chicken is cooked through (5-10 minutes) add pre-cooked brown rice, and marinara to get a creamy (not wet mixture) add feta, cheddar. Taste! adjust cheeses and italian seasoning to your liking. Continue to simmer over low heat for 5-10 minutes.
Remove peppers from oven, they will still be firm, thats ok.  Be careful they will be hot! Stuff each pepper with the chicken, rice and cheese mixture until heaping full, add a few sprinkles of additional shredded cheddar cheese on top (for looks).  Tent with foil to keep in moisture and bake at 350 for approximately 30-45 minutes.
