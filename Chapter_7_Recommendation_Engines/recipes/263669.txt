Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 cups self-rising flour
1 cup lemon-flavored soda
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray; lightly dust with flour.
Sift self-rising flour into a large bowl. Combine lemon soda and cream and pour over the flour. Mix until dough is just combined. Turn dough out onto the prepared baking sheet. Flour your hands and gently pat dough into a large rectangle. Do not overwork the dough. Cut into triangles or squares.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 10 to 12 minutes.

Description: 
These scones are so quick and simple. They only have three ingredients and produce deliciously light scones. The bubbles in the lemon soda make them rise. There is no need to rub butter as in the traditional scone recipe. Serve hot with whipped cream and berry jam.
