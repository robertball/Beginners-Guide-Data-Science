Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Over medium-low heat melt oil in a large saucepan. Add onions, garlic and broccoli. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are soft.....allow time to cool.
Scatter most of the cheese over the pie crust bottom.
Add ham or bacon or sausage over cheese layer.
Beat eggs and then add the 1/2 and 1/2...season with a dash of nutmeg, salt and pepper.
Combine veggies and egg mixture.
