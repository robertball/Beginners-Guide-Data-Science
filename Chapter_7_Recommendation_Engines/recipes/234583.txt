Ingredients:
3 (4 ounce) links spicy Italian sausage, casings removed, crumbled
1/2 cup Old El Paso® enchilada sauce
1 (13.8 ounce) can Pillsbury® refrigerated artisan pizza crust with whole grain*
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
2 medium plum (Roma) tomatoes, chopped
1 medium yellow bell pepper, chopped (optional)
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro or green onions (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F for dark or nonstick pan (425 degrees F for all other pans). Spray 15x10-inch pan with sides with cooking spray.
In 12-inch skillet, cook sausage over medium heat, stirring occasionally to crumble sausage, until no longer pink; drain and remove from skillet. Gently stir enchilada sauce into sausage to coat.
Unroll dough in pan; starting at center, press dough into 15x10-inch rectangle. Bake about 8 minutes or until light brown.
Spoon and spread sausage mixture over crust. Sprinkle with 1 1/2 cups of the cheese. Top with tomatoes and bell pepper; sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted. Garnish with cilantro. To serve, cut into 6 rows by 3 rows.
