Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup long-grain white rice
3/4 teaspoon cumin
3/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup canned diced tomatoes
12 ounces shrimp without tails, thawed
2 teaspoons minced garlic
6 (10 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/3 cup pico de gallo
shredded lettuce
Cilantro Serrano Cream Sauce from Allrecipes.com

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until tender, stirring frequently. Stir in rice, and season with cumin and 3/4 teaspoon of garlic salt. Cook and stir until the rice is lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and the diced tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then cover and cook over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until all of the liquid has been absorbed.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray.  Saute shrimp  and garlic until pink.
Place about 1/4 cup of cheese onto each warm tortilla. Then place about 1/2 cup of shrimp on the cheese. Top with 1/4 cup of rice. Spread on about a tablespoon of cilantro serrano cream sauce, and pico de galo to taste. Roll up, and serve.

I worked at a Mexican restaurant that specializes in Baja dishes, and became addicted to this burrito... I moved away, so I had to create my own. The Chipotle Sauce is what makes it oh so yummy!Modified from: Shrimp Burritos
