Depends on how you like it. Pour brine into a shallow bowl, then lay all the strips of salmon into the shallow bowl. Put in fridge and let sit for 45 minutes. Line a medium sized baking sheet with tin foil and place a rack over top of the tin foil. Pre-Heat oven to 185 degress. Lay salmon strips on rack(s) and place into oven for 8 hours or until dry.
