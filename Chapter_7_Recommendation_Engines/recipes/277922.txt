Salad:
1 medium head Belgian endive, leaves separated

1/2 head butter lettuce, torn into bite-sized pieces
1/2 head red leaf lettuce, torn into bite-sized pieces

Directions:
Prepare the dressing the day before serving by combining cream, lemon juice, sugar, salt, white pepper, and marjoram in a small bowl. Mix well, making sure salt and sugar are dissolved. Cover and store in the refrigerator for 16 hours.
Arrange 2 endive stalks from the center to the edge of 4 small salad plates and sprinkle stems with orange juice. Combine red leaf lettuce, butter lettuce, and green leaf lettuce in a bowl and set a handful of the mixture on top of the endive stalks on each plate.
Mix dressing and drizzle about 3 tablespoons over each salad. Garnish with garden cress.
