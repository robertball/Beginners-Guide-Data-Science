Description: 
Cooked in a slow cooker, this is an easy and excellent way to use the fruit of a Fuyu persimmon tree. Spicy and full of natural sweetness, the jars make wonderful gifts or keep well in the refrigerator for one's own use. This spread is used just like jelly or apple butter and it is especially delicious on a hearty whole grain toasted bread.
