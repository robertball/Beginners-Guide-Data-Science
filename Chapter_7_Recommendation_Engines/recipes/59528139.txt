Description: 
This bread pudding is a cinch to make especially when you start by purchasing a loaf of cinnamon swirl bread, it has the cinnamon, raisins, and vanilla already in it.  No need to purchase any extra ingredients!  If the loaf is still fresh, cut bread into cubes and let it dry out  on a cookie sheet for an hour.Modified from: Bread Pudding II
