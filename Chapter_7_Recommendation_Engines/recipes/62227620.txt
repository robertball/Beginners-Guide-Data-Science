Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts, butterflied or cut a pocket (trick: do it when they are still partially frozen. It makes butterfly super easy).
1/4 cup of light garlic cream cheese
2 slices of prosciutto
Marinade:
1/3 cup of Kraft Sundried Tomato & Oregano dressing (Italian is a good substitution)
1/3 cup of President's Choice Vidalia Onion (any sweet onion dressing will do)
2 tbsp of light sour cream
1 tsp of Italian seasoning
1/2 tsp of garlic powder

Directions:
Mix the marinade and coat the chicken, even inside where you have butterflied it and let sit for an hour.
Pre-heat the oven to 350F.
Open the chicken breasts and spread the cream cheese mixture inside.
Wrap a piece of prosciutto around each breast and put in the oven for 35 minutes.

Description: 
Wrapping anything in bacon makes it better but unfortunately also quite fattening so substitute it with prosciutto which is just as flavourful but light on the fat. This is restaurant quality chicken that is so easy you won't believe it.
