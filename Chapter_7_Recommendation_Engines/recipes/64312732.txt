Ingredients:
2 small cans albacore tuna or one large one, drained
1/2 cup (or more) shredded cheese (mozzarella, or whatever you like)
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup crumbled bleu cheese
1 can creamed soup (any flavor)
1/2 cup half and half
1/2 onion, chopped
1/2 cup celery, chopped
1/2 cup chopped portabella mushrooms
1/2 cup shredded carrots
1/2 cup frozen peas
2 cups cooked pasta (al dente)
1 container of French's fried onions

Directions:
Saute all the vegetables, except peas and carrots, for about 15 minutes, until softened.  In a mixing bowl, stir together all other ingredients, except fried onions.  Add the sauteed vegetables, pour into a greased casserole dish, top with fried onions and bake for about 45 minutes.

Description: 
Okay, the greatest thing about this casserole is that it actually is quite tasty--and if you use albacore, not too fishy tasting at all.
