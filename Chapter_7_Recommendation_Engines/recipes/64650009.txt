Ingredients:
1 mashed banana or 1/2 cup pureed unsweetened peaches, pineapple, or strawberries
1-2 cups homemade yogurt
honey or saccharin for sweetening, to taste
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Blend ingredients in a blender well and then place in paper cups or popsicle molds and freeze.
For real ice cream texture, this mixture may be placed in an ice cream maker. Adjust the amounts of ingredients depending on the volume of your machine. If your ice cream maker calls for crushed ice, you can avoid that by pouring 1 cup of cold water in the space the ice is to be placed. Measure about 2 cups of ordinary salt and make layers of ice cubes, alternating with salt, until the space is filled. Use all the salt by the time you reach the top. Save up the equivalent of about 6 trays of ice cubes before starting. Pour another cup of cold water around the top of the cubes and start up the motor of the machine. It should be done in less than an hour.
Variation: Add 1 or 2 raw eggs to the mixture for a creamier texture.
