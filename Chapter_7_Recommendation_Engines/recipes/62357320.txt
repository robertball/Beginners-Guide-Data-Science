Ingredients
» 1 1/4 cups ricotta cheese or cottage cheese (I used low-fat cottage cheese)
» 1/4 cup water
» 1/2 teaspoon salt
» 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
» 1/4 tsp dried basil
» 1/4 tsp dried oregano
» 1/4 cup grated Parmesan
» 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella
» 1 pound lean ground beef
» 1 medium zucchini, diced (about 1 cup)
» 1 (26-ounce) jar pasta sauce
» 6 oven-ready (no boil) lasagna noodles

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta or cottage cheese, water, salt, basil, oregano, pepper Parmesan, and 1/2 cup of the mozzarella. Set the mixture aside.
Brown the beef in a large skillet set over medium-high heat until cooked, about 5 minutes. Drain fat. Add the zucchini. Stir in 2 cups of the pasta sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low.
Top the mixture with 2 lasagna noodles, set in the center. Break 2 more noodles each into half  and fill in the edges. Spread the cheese mixture over the noodles.  Break 2 remaining noodles in half each and lay on top. Pour the rest of the sauce into the skillet and spread evenly, then sprinkle on the remaining cup of mozzarella.
Cover the skillet and simmer the lasagna over medium-low heat until the noodles are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the lasagna cool for at least 5 minutes. After about 10 minutes most of the liquid was absorbed. Makes about 6 servings
