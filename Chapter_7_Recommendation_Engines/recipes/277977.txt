Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 egg
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1 cup grated and squeezed zucchini

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl.
Beat egg with sugar, milk, oil, and lemon juice in another bowl. Pour into the dry ingredients and add lemon zest and zucchini. Stir with a fork until moist, but very thick. Pour into the prepared pan and smooth the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes.

Description: 
This lemon zucchini bread has wowed every person my Mom made it for, and she has now passed this tried-and-true recipe to me, with the same results. If you are tempted to skip the nutmeg, don't! It's the secret ingredient that makes this bread pop. This loaf won't last a day in your house, so it's best to double or triple the recipe to ensure everyone gets a slice! The loaf freezes well, just slice before freezing.
