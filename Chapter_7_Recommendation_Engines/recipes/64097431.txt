Ingredients:
1 Cup Rice Flour
1/2 cup Tapioca Starch
1/4 teaspoon of salt, opt
1 1/2 to 1 2/3 Cup Water - Start with 1.5 cups add an extra tablespoon or 2 if the noodles are too stiff.

Directions:
Mix, pour some batter into greased steaming pan, enough to make a thin coating on bottom of pan, steam about 1 min. If batter doesn't spread enough to be as thin as wanted, shake pan lightly over the steaming water to set it.  Allow the freshly made noodle to cool a little. Fan for about 30 seconds and let rest for a minute or two.
Using a spatula, remove from dish. Scrape the steaming dish of any residual noodles and lightly oil before making another noodle. Cut the removed cake into noodle widths of your choice, either one at a time or stacked. If stacked, must oil top also to keep from sticking together. Use same day made if at all possible. May harden in refrigerator.
