Description: 
My husband's two favorite things are shrimp and quinoa. One night I combined the two into a fantastic 20-minute dish that tastes like a very light but flavorful fried rice. The recipe will serve 4 to 6 as a side dish, or makes two big bowls if served as a main. You can add ginger, extra veggies, chicken, ham...the possibilities are endless!
