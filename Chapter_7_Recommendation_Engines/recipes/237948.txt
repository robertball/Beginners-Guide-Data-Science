Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package vanilla wafer cookies
8 ounces pecans
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup bourbon whiskey
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/2 cup flaked coconut, or to taste (optional)
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, or to taste, for rolling

Directions:
Grind cookies in a food processor into fine crumbs; transfer to a large mixing bowl.
Grind pecans in the food processor; add to cookie crumbs. Stir 1 cup confectioners' sugar, bourbon whiskey, cocoa powder, and corn syrup with the cookies and pecans until the mixture holds together; roll into 3/4-inch balls.
Spread coconut onto a plate and 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar onto a separate plate. Roll balls in coconut and sugar to coat. Arrange balls onto a platter, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until hardened, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
I've tried several recipes I found online, and the mixture always comes out too wet to form balls. My grandmother used to make these, and I finally figured out my own recipe that's as close to hers as I could get.
