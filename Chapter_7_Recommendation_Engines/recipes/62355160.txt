Ingredients:
6 cups water
1 cup Thai tea
Â½ cup sugar
6 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk
6 tablespoons evaporated milk
Ice

Directions:
In a kettle, bring the water to a boil. Place the tea in a teapot or glass container. Pour the water over the tea and let steep until bright orange in color, about 4 minutes. Strain into a pitcher (or, if in tea bags, remove the bags).
Add sugar and condensed milk and stir to dissolve. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Fill 6 tall glasses with ice and add tea to 3/4 full. Add 1 tablespoon evaporated milk to each glass.
Serve with an iced-tea spoon or a straw so guests can swirl the mixture themselves.

Description: 
Restaurant Style Thai Iced Tea - My absolute favorite drink! Meant to be very sweet, almost dessert-like. It's great for soothing your mouth when eating spicy food...or any other time! Yummm.
