3 cups pumpkin puree

1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 Tbsp pumpkin pie spice
1 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp ginger
1/2 tsp cloves

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a large heavy saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about an hour, or until pumpkin butter has an almost caramel-like consistency.  Store in airtight jars in refrigerator.

Description: 
My version of pumpkin butter made with fresh pumpkin puree, sugar, apple cider and lots of spices.  I like to roast sugar pumpkins in the fall, then puree the pumpkin flesh and freeze in 2 or 3-cup portions - perfect for recipes!  Canned pumpkin can be substituted also.
