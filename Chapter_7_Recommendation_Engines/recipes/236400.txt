Description: 
This is a quick and easy vegan ice cream dish I created for some in-laws who are on a vegan diet. My husband added mini-chocolate chips (not vegan) and said this ice cream almost tasted like cookie dough! This recipe is much more healthy than traditional ice cream. Be sure to give it a try. Enjoy!
