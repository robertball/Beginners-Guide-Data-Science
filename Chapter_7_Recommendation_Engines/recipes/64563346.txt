Ingredients:
4 medium zucchini, spiralized
1 1/4 pounds ground turkey breast
1 cup green bell pepper, diced
1 tbsp minced garlic
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
2 cup baby spinach
1 tsp extra virgin olive oil
3 cups marinara sauce (I use an organic, no salt added, low sugar one)
2 tsp Italian seasoning
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat with olive oil.
Add turkey breast, garlic, bell pepper and seasonings. Using a spatula break up the meat and cook until just browned 4-5 minutes.
Next add baby spinach and marinara sauce and cook another 3 minutes then add zoodles to the skillet.
Using a tongs, stir zoodles into the sauce. Cook another 2-3 minutes to make the zucchini a little tender.
Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator up to 3 days.
