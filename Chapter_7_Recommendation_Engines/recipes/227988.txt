Ingredients:
2/3 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon salt
1 pound beef top sirloin, cut into 1-inch cubes
1/2 large onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 (10 ounce) cans tomato sauce

2 cups water
1 1/2 tablespoons ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground white pepper
2 teaspoons ground cumin
salt to taste
1 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over high heat. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon salt over steak cubes; cook and stir meat in the hot oil with onion and garlic until meat is seared, about 5 minutes; reduce heat to medium; cook and stir until meat is browned, about 3 more minutes. Remove steak pieces and set aside.
Stir tomato sauce and tomato paste into same pot; mix in okra, water, coriander, white pepper, and cumin. Bring to a boil; season with additional salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer until okra is tender, 30 to 45 minutes; return pieces of beef to the bamia. Simmer until flavors are blended, about 10 minutes; garnish with slices of jalapeno pepper.
