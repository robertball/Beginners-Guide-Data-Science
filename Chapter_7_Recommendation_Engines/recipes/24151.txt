1 1/2 cups brown sugar
2 eggs, lightly beaten
3 cups all-purpose flour

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place raisins in a bowl and cover with boiling water; set aside for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain well and dry raisins in cloth, set aside.
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until lightly brown. Drain, crumble into small pieces and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine sausage, white sugar and brown sugar; stir until mixture is well blended.  Add eggs and beat well.
