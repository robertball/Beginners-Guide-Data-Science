Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups thinly sliced green cabbage
1 cup chopped broccoli
3 cups hot prepared instant mashed potatoes
4 tablespoons butter, or as needed
1 pinch garlic salt
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the cabbage and broccoli in a saucepan, and fill with just enough water to cover the vegetables. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes; drain.
Stir in the prepared mashed potatoes, butter, garlic salt, and black pepper.

Description: 
This is a college try on a traditional favorite. Sometimes you're too poor to get all the ingredients for colcannon. It's a good quick filler for lunches in college. I like to put some brown gravy in mine, too, for more flavor.
