Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package cherry chip cake mix
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling
2 teaspoons almond extract
2 eggs
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour a bundt or tube pan.
Combine the cake mix, pie filling, almond extract, and eggs in a large bowl. Mix thoroughly by hand until well moistened. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool on rack for 15 minutes; invert cooled cake onto serving plate. Cool completely.
Whisk together the confectioners' sugar and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract in a small bowl. Add drops of water until glaze is drizzling consistency. Spoon glaze over cooled cake.
