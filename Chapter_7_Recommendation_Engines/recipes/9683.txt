Ingredients:
4 (1 ounce) squares milk chocolate, chopped
3/4 cup finely chopped blanched almonds
1 cup white sugar
1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
1/2 cup apricot preserves

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the almonds and the milk chocolate. Add half of the sugar, and mix well. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat the butter until soft.  Stir in the vanilla and remaining sugar until well blended.
Mix in the egg and apricot preserves. Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cocoa powder.  Stir into the egg mixture. Add the chocolate and nut mixture and stir until well blended.  Mixture will be stiff.
Spread two lengths of plastic wrap about 12 inches long on a counter.  Spoon half of the dough down each length of the wrap, forming strips 8 to 9 inches long. Bring the two long sides of the wrap together on top of one of the strips of dough.  Press together close to the dough and smooth into a strip about 9 inches long, 3 inches wide and 1 inch high.  Repeat with second strip. Freeze for at least 1 1/2 hours, or as long as you'd like.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil or baking parchment. Unwrap the frozen dough and cut 1/4 inch thick slices.  Place on cookie sheets 2 inches apart.
Bake for about 11 minutes.  Let cool on wire racks.
