Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fillets small, fresh, deboned bluefish
1 loaf Portuguese sweet bread (or challah or brioche)
1 bunch arugula, washed and dried
8 slices smoked bacon, crisped and warm
1/2 red onion sliced lengthwise
1 ripe tomato, sliced and seasoned with salt and pepper
2 ripe Hass avocados, halved and sliced into slices, seasoned with salt and pepper
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
16 toothpicks
1 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Preheat a broiler. Place the bluefish on a lightly-oiled cookie tin; season with salt and pepper. Place under the broiler until it is just cooked through (approx. five minutes).
While the bluefish is cooking, toast 12 slices of bread (enough for four sandwiches).
When the bluefish is cooked, sprinkle it with lemon juice.
Working quickly, spread mayonnaise on one side of eight slices of bread.
On four of those slices, place one piece of bluefish, a few slices of red onion and two pieces of bacon.
On the remaining four pieces of bread with mayonnaise, spread half of a sliced avocado, add a few leaves of arugula and one slice of tomato.
Top with the remaining bread, stick a toothpick in the center of each quarter of the sandwiches, and then cut it into four even pieces. Enjoy while still warm.
