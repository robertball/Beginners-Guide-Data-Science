Ingredients:
2 pounds sliced frozen peaches, thawed
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup dried lavender flowers
3 tablespoons lemon juice
3 cups water

Directions:
Puree peaches with sugar until smooth. Stir in lavender blossoms, and let stand at room temperature for 2 hours. Stir in lemon juice and water, then place into refrigerator and refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.
Freeze in a 6-quart ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.

Submitter: 
The Magpie
Description: 
This lovely and sophisticated sorbet is great for cleansing the palate after a heavy meal. Even though it's mostly fruit, it does taste rather rich; so keep portions small.  Freezing time is not included in this total, and will vary depending on your ice cream maker.
