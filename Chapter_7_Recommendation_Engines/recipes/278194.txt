Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon sesame oil
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup sliced cremini mushrooms
2 medium carrots, julienned
1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
2 tablespoons tamari
1 (10.5 ounce) package dried soba noodles
2 1/4 cups water, or as needed
1 green onion, finely chopped

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. When Instant Pot(R) displays hot, add olive oil and sesame oil. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in mushrooms, carrots, and pepper; toss to combine. Cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
Push vegetables to the outside of the pot, forming an empty circle in the center. Add tamari and soba noodles to the pot and enough water so noodles are just covered. Cancel Saute mode.
Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Mix sauce, noodles and vegetables together using tongs. Sprinkle with chopped green onion and serve immediately.
