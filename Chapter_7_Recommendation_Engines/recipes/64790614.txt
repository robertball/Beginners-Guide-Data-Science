Ingredients:
2 cups flour
5/8 cups powdered sugar
1 5/8 cups fat free greek yogurt
1 tbsp vanilla extract
1 egg
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tbsp cinnamon
1 cup powdered sugar
2 TBSP orange juice
fresh orange zest from 1 orange
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.
For Dough:
Combine 2 cups flour & 2 tbsp powdered sugar. Whisk together 1 1/2 cup yogurt, 1 tbsp vanilla & egg. Add yogurt mixture to flour mixture and stir with wooden spoon until just combined and keep mixing with hands until smooth. If dough is too sticky, add more flour until no longer sticky.
Sprinkle flour on parchment paper. Place dough on it and roll into 12 x 9 in rectangles. Sprinkle evenly with brown sugar & cinnamon all the way to edges. Starting with long edge, roll up tightly to form a 12 inch long roll.
Cut roll into  12 (1 in) slices. Arrange in baking dish coated with cooking spray & break until lightly browned for 22-25min. Let stand 10 min before topping with glaze.
If cinnamon glaze:
Combine remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 2 tbsp yogurt, 1/4 tsp vanilla, stirring until smooth. Drizzle over rolls.
If orange glaze:
Mix together all ingredients and drizzle of rolls. Add more orange juice to thin out.
