Ingredients:
3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled
1 1/3 cup unsalted butter, room temp
1 1/4 cup sugar
2 eggs, room temp
1 teaspoon vanilla
2/3 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups cake flour
1/3 cup sweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 with rack in the middle position. Grease, 2, 8-in round cake pans. line with parchment paper, grease parchment paper and four pans.
In a large bowl beat butter and sugar on medium speed until fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla until combined then add in melted chocolate and sour cream.
In a separate small bowl, sift together, cake four, sweetened cocoa powder
backing powder and salt.
Alternately add flour mixture with buttermilk; beat on low after each addition just until combined.
In a small bowl dissolve baking sod in vinegar. slowly add this to the batter and mix until just blended. Do not over mix.
Divide batter into prepared pans and bake for 25-35 minutes or until tops spring back when lightly touched. Cook on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove from pans and cool completely before stacking and frosting.

Description: 
A combination of what hopefully are the best parts of three chocolate cake recipes. The cake turned out incredibly light and moist. however it wasn't pretty. To fix this next time I am going to split the batter between 3 pans. Also if it is too light, I may omit the baking soda and vinegar. If that is done, simply add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in with the dry ingredients.
