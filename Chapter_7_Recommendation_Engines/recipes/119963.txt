Ingredients:
1 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup red wine vinegar or cider vinegar
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pound beef stew meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
1 pound sliced bacon, cut in half
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Remove 1/3 cup for basting; cover and refrigerate. Add beef to bag; seal and turn to coat. Refrigerate overnight.
In a skillet over medium heat, partially cook the bacon. Wrap each piece around a water chestnut slice. Drain and discard marinade from beef. On metal or soaked wooden skewers, alternately thread bacon-wrapped water chestnuts, pineapple and beef. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 10-15 minutes or until meat reaches desired doneness, basting frequently with reserved marinade.
