Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1(3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
4 eggs
2/3 cup cream sherry
1 1/3 cup water
2/3 cup canola oil
Just enough orange or mandarin zest so as not to  overpower
1 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 360 degrees.  Butter and flour a 10 inch bundt pan.
In a medium bowl, stir together the cake mix and pudding mix.  Add the eggs, sherry, water and oil.  Add zest and mix until smooth.  Sprinkle the sliced almonds into the bottom of the prepared pan.  Pour the batter over the nuts.
Immediately fter you put the cake in the oven, turn the heat down in the oven to 350 degrees, (a trick I use so the cake doesn't puff up too quickly).
Bake for 40 minutes, until inserted toothpick comes out clean.  Allow cake to cool in the pan for atleast 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.
Before serving, mix together some powdered sugar and cream sherry to make a glaze and then, if desired, top with some powdered sugar.
