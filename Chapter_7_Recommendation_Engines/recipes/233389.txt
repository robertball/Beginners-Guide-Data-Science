2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Blend Kalamata olives, green olives, lemon juice, anchovy fillets, garlic, thyme, and rosemary in a food processor until coarsely chopped; transfer to a bowl.

Description: 
A delicious olive and feta mixture great as an appy or at party as a spread. Traditionally tapenade is made without feta cheese, so you can remove the feta and replace with an even mixture of Kalamata and green olives.
