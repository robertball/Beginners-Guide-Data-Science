Description: 
These creamy lemon bars have a smoother texture than the usual custard texture of a boxed lemon bar mix.  I just died when I had them the first time.  A good friend made them for another friend's birthday.  I immediately asked her for the recipe as my Christmas present.  She courteously obliged.  They are the best!
