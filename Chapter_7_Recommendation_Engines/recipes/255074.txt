Ingredients:
nonfat cooking spray
2 russet potatoes, unpeeled
2 teaspoons taco seasoning mix, or to taste
6 bamboo skewers
2 teaspoons sriracha sauce, or to taste
1 pinch sea salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with cooking spray.
Slice each potato into long spirals using a spiralizer fitted with the straight-flat blade. Cut each spiral into 3 shorter pieces.
Thread a skewer through the middle of each potato spiral. Gently push down to fan out spiral.
Set skewers on the prepared baking sheet; spray generously with cooking spray. Sprinkle taco seasoning on top.
Roast in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 17 to 18 minutes. Season with sriracha sauce and sea salt.
