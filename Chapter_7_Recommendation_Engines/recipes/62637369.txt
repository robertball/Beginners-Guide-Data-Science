Description: 
A meal in Costa Rica would not be complete without gallo pinto or beans and rice. This fresh, fragrant, delicious peasant food is incredible. We know that many of these peasant dishes are healthy and delicious. This dish is common to many countries. Often breakfast is gallo pinto, eggs and a piece of toast, combined with some fresh fruit this is yummy, filling and healthy meal. Top the mix with a bit of your favorite sauce (Salsa Lizano or Salsa Inglesa) and its ready to go. The Worcestershire sauce (3 tblsps) seems a bit heady, however the rice quantity balances out the flavor.
