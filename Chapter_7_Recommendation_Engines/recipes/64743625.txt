Ingredients:
3 leg/thigh quarters
1/4 cup oil
2/3 cup all purpose flour
4 - 5 cloves garlic - sliced
1 med green bell pepper - sliced 2" pieces
1/2 small onion slice
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 32 oz jar of your favorite spaghetti sauce (I used roasted red pepper - Kroger brand)
1- 1/2 cups water as needed
Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat oil in a 10" skillet over med/high heat. Flour chicken and shake off excess. Brown pieces well on all sides, remove from pan and set aside.  Drain most of the oil from the skillet, leaving about 1/8 inch. Add vegetables and seasonings to pan and saute stirring constantly for 2 min.  Pour spaghetti sauce over mixture and add enough water to thin a little; sauce will thicken as it cooks.   Stir well and add chicken pieces to sauce.  Spoon sauce over chicken coat.  Bring to a simmer, cover, lower heat and cook for another 40 minutes, turning chicken and scraping bottom of pan often.     Serve over rice or your favorite pasta with Parmesan cheese!
