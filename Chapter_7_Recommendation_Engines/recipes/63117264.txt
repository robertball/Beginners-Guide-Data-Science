Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1"pieces
4 cloves garlic smashed and coarsely chopped
2 T olive oil
1 1/2 lbs. boneless chicken (thighs)
2 t smoked paprika
4 T chopped parsley
2 lemons--1 juiced, 1 cut into wedges
2 lrg or 3 med red onions, halved and thinly sliced
salt

Directions:
Position a rack in the upper 1/3 of the oven. Place a large baking dish or rimmed baking sheet on the rack and preheat to 500d. Put potatoes, garlic, olive oil, 1 T water and 1/2 t salt in large micowave-safe baking dish and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap, pierce the plastic in a few places with knife and microwave 8 min to partially cook.
Meanwhile, pat the chicken dry and transfer to a bowl. Sprinkle with the paprika, 1 t salt and 1/2 t pepper.  Add 2 T parsley and the lemon juice, toss to coat. Set aside.
Remove the hot baking dish from the oven, carefully add the potatoes and spread in an even layer. Scatter the onions on top. Roast until potatoes start to brown, about 12 min.
Flip the potatoes and lay the chicken pieces on top, adding any accumulated juices from the bowl; return to oven and roast until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is cooked through, about 12 more minutes. Remove from the oven and top with the remaining 2 T parsley. Serve with the lemon wedges.
