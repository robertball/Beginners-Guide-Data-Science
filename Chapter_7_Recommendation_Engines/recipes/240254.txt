Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 large eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Place cauliflower into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain.
Mash cauliflower in a bowl until smooth. Beat Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, cayenne pepper, and salt into cauliflower.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Pour cauliflower mixture into hot butter and cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Flip cauliflower mixture; cook and stir until mixture is more crumbly than creamy, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
I got this recipe and it wasn't low carb and included breadcrumbs instead of Parmesan cheese so you could form patties (like a latke). Since I'm living a low-carb lifestyle, I decided to adapt it, but the patties were less-than-desirable visually the taste wasn't that impressive. I had one completely fall apart on me in the pan so I just scrambled it up and viola; we had a new fave! You can add bacon and garlic as a yummy addition, if desired.
