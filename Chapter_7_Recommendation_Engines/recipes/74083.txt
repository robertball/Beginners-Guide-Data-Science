Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1/8 cup lemon juice
12 fresh asparagus spears
6 cups fresh spinach leaves
1/8 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon seasoned slivered almonds

Directions:
Preheat a grill for low heat. Combine the lemon juice and olive oil on a plate. Place asparagus on the plate, and roll around to coat.
Grill asparagus for about 5 minutes, turning at least once, and brushing with the olive oil mixture. Remove from the grill, and place back onto the plate with the oil.
In a large bowl, combine the spinach, Parmesan cheese, and slivered almonds. Cut asparagus into bite-size pieces, and add to the salad along with the lemon juice and oil from the plate. Toss to blend, then serve.

Description: 
It's just one of those salads that was created on a gorgeous summer evening with a bunch of stuff I had in the fridge. Grilled asparagus is tossed with spinach and Parmesan cheese. My husband and I love it!
