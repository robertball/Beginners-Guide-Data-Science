Bombay Aloo Recipe

Ingredients:
- 5 or 6 Tablespoons of oil for frying (I prefer mustard oil, but any will do)
- 1 teaspoon black mustard seeds
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander seeds
- 4 green chillies deseeded and chopped
- 1 lb potatoes, cut to 1 inch pieces
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 teaspoon chilli powder
- 1 teaspoon garam masala (optional)
- 3 medium tomatoes, cores removed, chopped (can be peeled or not as you like)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 pint of water
- fresh coriander (cilantro) for garnish

Directions:
In a small pan, smallest you have, heat 1 Tablespoon of the oil to hot, then, holding the lid handy to rapidly cover the pan, drop the mustard seeds in the hot oil and cover the pan. The seeds will sizzle and pop, and if you don't do this quickly, popped mustard seeds fly around your stove top. When the popping has stopped, remove from the heat.
While this is going on, in a larger pan, heat the remaining oil to hot.
Quickly scrape the popped mustard seeds and oil from the small pan into the larger one and add the cumin and coriander seeds and the chillies. Cook for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring constantly. We want the chillies to be fried (as this produces a back-of-the-throat "heat", rather than a violent tongue-burner!) so they should cook but NOT catch, hence the stirring.
Now add the chopped potatoes, the turmeric, the chilli powder, the garam masala, the tomatoes and salt, and stir well to get an even mixture. Again cook for a minute or two, stirring all the while.
Finally add the water, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes or so until the potatoes are cooked, and a nice thick sauce is obtained.

Description: 
A super Indian side, can be used as well as or instead of rice as an accompaniment to a curry. Can even be a starter or a vegetarian main. Another dish I learned in the kitchens of a 5-star hotel in India.
