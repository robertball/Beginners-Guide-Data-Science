Ingredients:
1 recipe flaky pastry dough
2.5 c fresh peaches, pears or apples, peeled, pared, pitted or seeded, and sliced about 1/2" thick
2.5 c fresh berries -- raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, cherries, etc.
~ 1 c raw (turbinado) sugar, depending on the sweetness of the fruit you're using
~3 TB quick-cooking tapioca or corn starch
1 TB fresh lemon juice
1/4 tsp almond extract (optional, but best with peaches)
1/8 tsp salt
~ 2 TB unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Prepare your best pastry dough and fit it into a 9-inch pie pan.  Refrigerate.
Combine fruits and berries with sugar, cornstarch or tapioca, lemon juice, salt, and almond extract (if you're using it) and let the fruit mixture stand for about 10 - 15 minutes.
Pour the mixture into the cold crust and dot with butter.    At this point, you may want to brush the overhanging edge of the crust with milk to give it a nice finish.  We make this as an open-faced pie; but if you choose to make a top crust for it, make sure you cut vents in it before baking.
Bake the pie with something under it to catch any juices that may overflow for 30 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to about 350 degrees and bake for another 25 minutes or so until the thick juices bubble.  Cool pie completely on a rack before serving.
