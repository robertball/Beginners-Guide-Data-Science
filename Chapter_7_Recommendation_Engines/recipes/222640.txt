Ingredients:
4 strips bacon, chopped
1 cup shredded carrots
1 large onion, chopped
1 teaspoon olive oil
6 cups chicken broth
3 cups water
1 cup salsa
16 ounces dried lentils, rinsed
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (10 ounce) package fresh spinach, torn
1 cup cubed potatoes

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet or Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in carrot, onion, and olive oil cooking until tender, about 5 minutes.
Cover bacon mixture with chicken broth, water, and salsa; mix in lentils, bay leaf, cumin, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until lentils are tender, 40 to 50 minutes. Stir in spinach and potatoes; simmer until spinach is wilted and potatoes are cooked, 10 to 15 minutes longer.
