Ingredients:
1 box of yellow cake (or your cake of choice)
1 tub of frosting of your choice
1 package of vanilla almond bark
1 pack of sucker sticks (found at any craft store)
sprinkles and other cake/cookie decorating items

Directions:
Bake your cake as directed on the box. When done let cake cool completely. Once cooled crumble your cake completely and mix with your tub of frosting. Roll cake/frosting mix into small sucker size balls (about the size of a tootsie pop). Place balls onto a pan lines with parchmant paper and put in freezer for about 15 min. In the mean time place about 3 or 4 blocks of almond bark into sauce pan on low heat and melt. Once melted pull out cake balls, take your sucker stick and dip one end into the melted almond bark and insert that end into the cake ball. Continue with the rest. Put back into freezer for 15 min. Melt the remaining almond bark. Pull out balls, and dip into melted bark. Be careful and go slow, better to spin them. Make sure you cover the entire ball. You will want the almond bark to connect with the stick to hold the ball in place. Sprinkle with your decorations and place into a white foam holder. Cake balls will harden with in a minute so decorate quickly. ENJOY!
