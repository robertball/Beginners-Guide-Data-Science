Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup HERSHEYÂ®'S Cocoa Powder
3 eggs
1 cup light corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped pecans
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
1/2 cup heavy cream, chilled
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 F.
Melt butter in medium saucepan over low heat; add sugar and cocoa, stirring until well blended.  Remove from heat; set aside.
Beat eggs slightly in medium bowl.  Stir in corn syrup and salt.  Add cocoa mixture; blend well.  Stir in chopped pecans.  Pour into unbaked pie crust.
Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until set.  Cool.  For a crispy top on pie, cool and serve.  For a softer top on pie, cool and cover; let stand about 8 hours before serving.  Garnish with Sweetened Whipped Cream and pecans, if desired.
To make Sweetened Whipped Cream:  Stir together 1/2 cup cold whipping cream, 1 tablespoon powdered sugar and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract in small bowl; beat until stiff.
Variation:  Fudgey Mocha Pecan Pie:  Dissolve 1 teaspoon powdered instant coffee in 1 teaspoon hot water in small bowl; add to pie filling when adding corn syrup and salt.
