Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cremini mushrooms, chopped
1 1/2 cups cooked quinoa
1 cup cooked lentils
1 white onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
1/4 cup almond meal
1/4 cup flax seeds
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 pinch dried sage
1 pinch dried oregano
1 pinch dried basil
1 pinch dried rosemary
1 pinch dried thyme
1 pinch dried mint
1 pinch ground cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Place mushrooms, quinoa, lentils, onion, and garlic in a food processor or blender; pulse until coarsely combined.
Sprinkle nutritional yeast, almond meal, flax seeds, Worcestershire sauce, sage, oregano, basil, rosemary, thyme, mint, and cayenne pepper into the food processor. Blend until mixture is combined but still slightly choppy.
Shape mixture into balls and arrange on the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until darkened and slightly crispy on the outside but moist on the inside, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
My recipe today is a meaty substitute made of mushrooms (it is also vegan and vegetarian), but the end result is as savory and satisfying as a beef meatball!
