Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
6 green onions, chopped
1 (16 ounce) package frozen peas
1 cup crushed tomatoes
1 potato, peeled and cut into wedges
1/2 cup chopped fresh dill
1/2 cup water (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat and cook onions until soft but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add peas, tomatoes, potato, dill, salt, and pepper. Add water if there is not enough liquid from the tomatoes.
Stir thoroughly and bring to a boil. Lower heat and cook, partially covered, until peas and potato are soft, about 30 minutes. Ensure that any remaining water from the tomatoes has evaporated before serving.
