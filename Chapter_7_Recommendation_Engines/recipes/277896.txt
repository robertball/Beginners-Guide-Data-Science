Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups spelt flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
2 eggs
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup coconut milk
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper or foil liners.
Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat sugar and coconut oil together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating in between additions. Stir in vanilla extract. Add flour mixture alternately with coconut milk; beat well. Fold in chocolate chips. Fill the prepared muffins cups 3/4-full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 17 to 20 minutes.
