Ingredients:
10 tablespoons (142 grams) unsalted butter
20 cups (850 grams) miniature marshmallows, divided
1 teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon vanilla extract
12 cups (317 grams) Rice Krispies cereal

Directions:
Line a 9×13-inch baking dish with foil, then coat with non-stick cooking spray; set aside.
In a large saucepan or stockpot, melt the butter and 16 cups of the miniature marshmallows over low heat until the marshmallows are just melted. Stir in the salt and vanilla to combine. Remove the pan from the heat, add the Rice Krispies and mix until it is completely and evenly coated with the marshmallow mixture. Stir in the additional 4 cups of miniature marshmallows.
Turn the mixture out into the prepared pan and, using a wooden spoon or spatula that has been coated with non-stick cooking spray, press the mixture firmly into a packed, even layer. Allow setting at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Using the foil, remove the treats from the pan and slice into squares. Leftover Rice Krispies treats should be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
