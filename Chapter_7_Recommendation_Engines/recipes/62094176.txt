Ingredients:
4 Whole Bell Peppers, Green or red
1 lb ground beef
1 link Italian sausage, removed from casing
1 15 OZ can diced tomatoes
1 6 oz can tomato sauce
1 large onion, chopped
2 chopped garlic cloves
1 Teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon fennel seed
1 cup rice
2 cups water or chicken stock
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese plus
2 Tablespoons for tops
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut off tops only of peppers and take seeds out of the inside. Place in a large stockpot and cover with water. Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the water. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 5 minutes. Gently remove the peppers and drain thoroughly.
In a medium skillet, cook ground beef, sausage, garlic and onions. Once meat is browned, drain in a colander to remove the excess fat.
Return ingredients to pan and add diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, fennel seed and stock or water. Bring to a boil and add rice. Return to boil and then gently simmer until rice has absorbed the stock and has cooked through, about 20-25 minutes. Remove from heat.
Add tomato sauce and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, salt and pepper to taste. Place reserved peppers in a large casserole baking dish and stuff with ground beef/rice mixture. Top with remaining 2 tablespoons parmesan cheese and Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.
