Ingredients:
Add about 1 TBSP baking soda to your beans when you cook them.  I learned this trick years ago and you cannot taste the soda.  Mine are always yummy.

Directions:
That is all it takes and you have very well done beans.  The soda also helps remove some of the gas from the beans so you don't have as much a problem with that either.

Description: 
I learned this trick from my Granny, and it really works.  Also to help the beans cook faster, add a new 16 penny nail to them when you are cooking them, just be sure to remove before you serve.
