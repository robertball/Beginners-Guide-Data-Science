Ingredients:
Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (1 per sandwich)
1 large onion (red onion is best)
Butter
Sugar (optional for carmelized onions)
Large sandwich rolls
Lettuce
Cheese (your choice)
Tomato
Buffalo Sauce
Mayonnaise
For breaded chicken:
All of the above
2 eggs
Flour
Oil

Directions:
Bake chicken breasts at 375 degrees F for about 35-40 minutes.
Remove from oven and let cool.
If breading chicken, dip cooled chicken breasts in beaten eggs and then a bowl of flour coating the entire chicken breast. Do this dipping 3 times between the egg and flour for each chicken breast.
Place coated chicken breasts in oiled saucepan on medium-low to medium heat to fry breading.
Fry chicken breading until golden brown, flipping each side.
It is easier to fry breaded chicken for only a few minutes than frying to cook the entire chicken because breading tends to burn and fall apart. Baking the chicken first turns out better through my experimentation.
For Carmelized Onions:
Add 1 tbs. of butter to pan on medium-low heat.
Cook 1 large onion (cut into thin slices or ringlets) until golden brown.
Add a pinchful of white or brown sugar for extra sweet onions and stir until melted(optional).
Sauce:
Mix equal parts of buffalo sauce and mayonnaise together. Less mayo if you like a spicier sauce.
Coat chicken breasts with sauce.
Assemble sandwich with desired ingredients. I recommend toasting buttered sandwich rolls for a tastier sandwich.
