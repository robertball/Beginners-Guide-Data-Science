Ingredients:
Reynolds® Parchment Paper
1 cup butter, softened
1 3/4 cups sugar, divided
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup chopped pecans, toasted
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Cinnamon Buttercream Frosting:
2/3 cup butter, softened
8 cups powdered sugar, divided, or more as needed
1/4 cup milk, plus more as needed
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line two cookie sheets with Reynolds(R) Parchment Paper.
Beat the butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds in a large mixing bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt. Beat until combined, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition just until combined. Beat in the vanilla. Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. Using a wooden spoon, stir in any remaining flour and the pecans. Cover and chill about 1 hour or until the dough is easy to handle.
Combine 1/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a small bowl.
Shape dough into 1 1/2-inch balls. Roll the balls in the sugar mixture to coat. Arrange 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Flatten the dough balls slightly.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until edges are firm and bottoms are very light brown. Let cool on the cookie sheets for 2 minutes. Slide the parchment paper with baked cookies on it to wire racks and let cool completely. Once cooled, slide the parchment paper onto a work surface.
Spread Cinnamon Buttercream Frosting onto the flat side of half of the cookies. Top with remaining cookies, flat-sides down.
Cinnamon Buttercream Frosting: Beat butter with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Add 2 cups powdered sugar, beating well. Beat in 1/4 cup milk, cinnamon, and vanilla. Gradually beat in 6 cups more powdered sugar. Beat in 2 to 4 teaspoons more milk until the frosting is of spreading consistency.
