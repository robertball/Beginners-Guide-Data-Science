Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 cloves garlic, minced
24 baby red potatoes
1 cup shredded smoked Gouda cheese
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 pound bacon, cut into thirds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Place potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl; add 1 tablespoon olive oil and toss to coat. Heat in the microwave until potatoes are tender enough to easily poke with a fork, about 6 minutes. Cool until easily handled.
Slice potatoes in half and scoop filling into a bowl. Set potato skins aside.
Mash garlic, potato filling, Gouda cheese, onion powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Fill potato skins with potato mixture and sandwich the potato halves together. Wrap a bacon slice around each filled potato and place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is cooked and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes.
