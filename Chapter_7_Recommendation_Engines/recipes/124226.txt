Ingredients:
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1/3 cup sliced green onions, divided
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup chicken broth
2 cups cooked rice
1 1/2 cups finely chopped cooked chicken
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 cup finely crushed cornflakes cereal
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
1/4 cup milk

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, saute celery and half of the onions in butter until tender. Stir in flour. Add broth; cook and stir for 2 minutes (mixture will be thick). Stir in rice, chicken, cheese, egg, salt, chili powder and poultry seasoning until well mixed.
Shape 1/4 cupfuls into balls. Roll each in cornflake crumbs and place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in.x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine soup, milk and remaining onions. Cook and stir over medium heat until smooth and heated through; serve over balls.
