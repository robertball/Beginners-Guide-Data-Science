Ingredients:
1/4 cup sausage
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 ready-made pizza dough
1 (8 ounce) can pizza sauce
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 cup diced pepperoni
1 (8 ounce) package Italian style shredded cheese
10 pepperoni slices

Directions:
Preheat oven to 420 degrees F (215 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add sausage; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. (Drain and discard grease.)
Roll dough out into a 9x14-inch rectangle. Cut 8 equal-sized slices along the 2 long edges using a knife or kitchen scissors, leaving a 4 inches of the center uncut.
Spoon pizza sauce down the center of the dough. Add garlic, diced pepperoni, sausage, and cheese in that order. Top with pepperoni slices.
Fold sliced edges across the filling in an alternating pattern (braiding). Pinch ends to seal.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Rotate pan and continue baking until golden brown, about 10 minutes more.
Remove from oven and allow to stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
