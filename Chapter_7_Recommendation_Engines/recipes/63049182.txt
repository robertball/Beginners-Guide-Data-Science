Really Good GF Sandwich Bread Recipe

Ingredients:
1 Tbsp. bread machine yeast
1 Tbsp. sugar
1 ½ c. water (105 degrees or a little less than hot)
2 ½ cups gluten free flour mix
2 tsp. xanthan gum
1tsp. salt
3 eggs
1 ½ Tbsp. oil
1 tsp. cider vinegar

Directions:
Start by combining the yeast and sugar in a small bowl (I use the smallest in my set of three nested mixing bowls). Add the water while gently stirring the yeast and sugar. Let this mixture sit while you mix the rest of the ingredients – bubbles and foam should form if the yeast is happy.
Combine the flour mix, xanthan gum and salt in the largest mixing bowl and stir well.
In a third bowl, whisk the eggs, oil and vinegar until the eggs are a bit frothy.
By this point the yeast mixture should be foamy, so you can pour the two liquid mixtures into the flour mixture. Blend the dough with a mixer for 4 minutes.
Scoop the dough into a greased loaf pan. Allow the dough to rise in a warm area until is is about 1 inch from the top of the pan. Then bake at 375 degrees for 50 – 60 minutes.
