Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups whole-wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed light brown sugar
3/4 cup ground flax seed
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups oats
2 (6 ounce) packages butterscotch chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Mix flour, salt, and baking soda in a bowl.
Beat the butter, brown sugar, flax seed, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in one egg until completely incorporated. Beat in the last egg along with the vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated. Fold oats and butterscotch chips into the dough just enough to evenly combine; drop by ice cream scoop or heaping spoonfuls onto baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until browned, 12 to 14 minutes. Allow to cool on baking sheets for 3 minutes before transferring to cooling rack to cool completely.

Description: 
LOVE 'em cookies. 'Thanks mom,' said my son. These cookies were a test, and they scored an 'A+.'  Made with whole-wheat flour and flax, they are a nice change to the everyday chocolate chip.
