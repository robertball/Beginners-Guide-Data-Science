1 (3 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 (1 pound) fillet salmon
cooking spray
2 tablespoons lemon juice
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine tomatoes, feta, and balsamic vinegar in a bowl. Refrigerate salad until ready to use.
Place salmon onto a sheet of aluminum foil that has been coated with cooking spray. Pour lemon juice onto fish and season with salt and pepper. Fold foil up to make a packet.
Cook salmon on the preheated grill until it flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes.
Place salmon on top of salad mix and top with tomato-feta mixture. Serve.
