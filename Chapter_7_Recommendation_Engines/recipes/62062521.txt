Ingredients:
5-10 cloves fresh garlic, minced
1/4 cup olive oil
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts

Directions:
1) Preheat your oven to 425.
2) Warm the garlic and olive oil to blend the flavors - stir well.  In a separate dish, combine the bread crumbs and the parmesan cheese.
3) Set the chicken breats in the olive oil and garlic mixture for 2 mins on each side.  Remove from there and dip breasts into the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese - coat well.  Place coated chicken breasts in shallow baking dish.
4) Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or unil no longer pink.
We serve this with spaghetti, and sometimes add some mozzerella cheese to the breasts for the last five minutes of cooking time.  So wonderful!
