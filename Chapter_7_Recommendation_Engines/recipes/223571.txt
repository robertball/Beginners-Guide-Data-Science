Description: 
Refreshing Mexican-style green sauce to put on tacos, enchiladas, or anything else you desire. A light, refreshing, and hot sauce that is perfect for summer time! Serrano chili peppers can be really hot. I use 1 to start with. If you want more heat, add additional peppers until your desired heat.
