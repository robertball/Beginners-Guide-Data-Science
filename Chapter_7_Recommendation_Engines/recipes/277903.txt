Ingredients:
4 cups fresh cranberries
1 1/2 cups water
1 orange, zested and juiced
4 cinnamon sticks
1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
6 whole cloves
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice

3/4 cup maple syrup

Directions:
Mix cranberries, water, orange zest and juice, cinnamon sticks, ginger, vanilla extract, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice together in a large saucepan until well combined; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, until many of the cranberries pop and sauce starts to thicken, about 20 minutes.
Add blueberries and maple syrup; cook and stir until mixture returns to a simmer. Cook, stirring frequently, until desired consistency, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool completely. Remove cinnamon sticks and cloves; refrigerate for 6 hours, to overnight.
