6 large eggs
2 tablespoons full-fat plain Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon everything bagel seasoning, or to taste
1 teaspoon sliced scallion greens

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.
Slice eggs in half lengthwise and set the whites aside. Place yolks in a mini blender or food processor; pulse several times until finely chopped. Add yogurt, mustard, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and sugar and blend until smooth.
Transfer yolk mixture to pastry bag fitted with a large star tip and pipe filling into the egg whites (or stuff filling into egg whites with a spoon). Sprinkle with everything bagel seasoning and garnish with sliced scallions. Chill in the refrigerator until ready serve.
