Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1  56-64oz jar of ragu
1  lb ground beef
1 pint part-skim ricotta cheese
1 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup milk
1 pound mozzarella cheese shredded for the top
1/2 lb of sliced pepperoni for top

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of salted water to boil, add lasagna noodles and bring water to boil again. Cook until noodles are al dente (8-9mins). Drain well.
Mix together ricotta, eggs, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and 1/3 cup milk.
Saute hamburger, drain and stir in tomatoes and spaghetti sauce.
Spray pans with pam
Spread 1/2 cup of the tomato mixture into a 9x13 inch baking pan. Place 1 layer of noodles on top of the tomato sauce; pour 2 cups tomato meat sauce onto the noodles; spread all of the ricotta mixture onto the noodles; place another layer of noodles atop of the ricotta mixture; arrange another layer of noodles; pour the remaining tomato sauce over the final layer of noodles and top with 1 lb mozzarella cheese and finish with a single layer of pepperoni  (cover the entire top so the cheese barely shows).
At this point you can cover with plastic wrap and foil and freeze/refridgerate. If frozen you will need to bake 2hrs. If thawed bake the lasagna for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This delicious recipe can be divided in to two 9x13 pans or you can use a large shafer pan. I use the tin foil pans when I give lasagna away!Modified from: Lasagna
