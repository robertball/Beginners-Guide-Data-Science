3/4 pound cooked shrimp - peeled and deveined
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon lemon juice
6 artichoke hearts, drained
1 cup French dressing

Directions:
Cook the asparagus in boiling salted water until tender. Remove and cool under cold water. Reserve six stalks and cut remaining asparagus into 1 inch pieces.
Cook and clean shrimp. Again reserve the best six and dice the remainder. In a bowl, combine shrimp and asparagus, mix gently with mayonnaise and lemon juice.
In a separate bowl, marinate the artichoke hearts in 1 cup French dressing.
Place shrimp and asparagus in an attractive shallow bowl. Garnish with sieved egg and arrange reserved asparagus on top to resemble the spokes of a wheel.
Drain the artichoke bottoms and garnish each with a dollop of mayonnaise, 1 whole shrimp  and 1 parsley sprig. Arrange them around the salad.
