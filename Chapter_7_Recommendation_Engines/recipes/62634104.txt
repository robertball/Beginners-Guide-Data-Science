Ingredients:
1 cup long grain white rice
1-inch piece cinnamon bark
8 cups water
1/2 cups sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
Ice cubes

Directions:
Using a spice grinder or blender, grind/blend rice until fine: combine with the cinnamon bark. Add 3 1/2 cups water, stir, cover and let sit overnight.
Using a blender, blend rice mixture until smooth. Add 2 1/2 cups of water and continue blending.
Strain horchata into a bowl first using a fine metal strainer (sieve), then strain again using a double layer of cheesecloth. Add sugar and vanilla extract to taste and up to an additional 2 cups of water if needed (I omitted) until it achieves a milky consistency. Enjoy chilled over ice.
