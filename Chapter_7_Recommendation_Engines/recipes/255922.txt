Ingredients:
1 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons barbeque sauce
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 serving cooking spray (such as PamÂ®)
2 cups crushed corn flakes
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 (.7 ounce) package Italian dressing mix
1 tablespoon ground poultry seasoning
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Combine buttermilk and barbeque sauce in a gallon-sized resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, turn to coat well, and seal. Place chicken in the refrigerator to marinate, 2 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Set a wire rack on top and grease with cooking spray.
Combine corn flakes, bread crumbs, Italian dressing mix, poultry seasoning, Cajun seasoning, garlic powder, and black pepper in a gallon-sized resealable plastic bag. Add oil and toss until well mixed.
Remove chicken from buttermilk mixture and dredge in corn flake mixture, pressing to coat thoroughly. Place onto the wire rack. Discard buttermilk mixture.
Bake chicken in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
