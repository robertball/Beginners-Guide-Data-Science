Ingredients:
3 cups chicken stock
1 cup lentils
2 Tbsp olive oil
meat from one roasted chicken, chopped into spoon-sized pieces
1 bay leaf
2 carrots, sliced
1 large onion, chopped
3 ribs celery, chopped
1 tart green apple, cored and chopped
4 tsp minced fresh ginger
2 Tbsp flour
2 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp ground turmeric
2 tsp ground cardamom
1 Tbsp curry powder
pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 - 1 cup coconut milk (optional)
hot cooked Basmati rice

Directions:
Bring 2 cups stock to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Add lentils and bay leaf; return to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer ~20 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil over medium heat in large heavy soup pot.  Add onion, carrots, and celery; cook until somewhat softened.  Add apple and ginger and cook a few more minutes.  Reduce heat and add spices.  Stir constantly until very fragrant.
Smooth in flour.  Pour in remaining cup of stock and stir well.  Add lentils/broth/bay leaf into the vegetable mixture.  Add in chicken pieces.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, simmer 30-45 minutes.  Add hot water as necessary to maintain proper thickness during simmering.  Remove from heat and stir in coconut milk.  Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Serve in bowls with a about 1/2 cup rice mounded up in the center.
