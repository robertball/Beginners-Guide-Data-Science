Gingerbread Cinnamon Rolls Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup warm water (divided)
1 pkg. active dry yeast
1/2 tsp. sugar
1/2 c. molasses
1 egg
2 Tbls. Sunflower Oil (may use canola)
2 Tbls. toasted wheat germ
1 tsp. ground ginger
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 tsp. cloves
3/4 tsp. Kosher salt
3  3/4 c. whole wheat flour
Filling:
2 Tbls. butter, softened
1/2 c. packed brown sugar
1 T. cinnamon (or to taste, you may prefer less)
Icing:
5 oz. softened cream cheese
2 Tbl. softened butter
1/2 tsp. vanilla
Confectioners Sugar

Directions:
Proof yeast in 1/2 c. warm water with sugar. It will get happy :).
Mix together remaining water, molasses, egg and oil. Add salt, spices and wheat germ. Sprinkle with 1 c. flour and stir in yeast mixture. Add remaining flour 1/2 c. at a time, until it forms a ball. Knead 5-10 minutes, until smooth. Place in greased bowl, turn to cover top with oil, allow to rise until double (about an hour). Punch down dough, and dump on floured counter top down. Sprinkle with flour and smooth over, allow to rest 10 mins. Gently stretch dough into 12 x 12 square. Spread with softened butter, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar mixture. (May also add raisins and/or nuts at this point, to taste). Roll up jelly-roll style, pinch seam to seal. Cut into 12 pieces, place in prepared pan. (I used a jelly roll pan, lined with parchment paper. Could use greased 9 x 13 baking dish.) Cover and let rise until nearly doubled (30-40 mins.) Bake at 375 degrees 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
Icing: Stir together butter, cream cheese and vanilla, add confectioners sugar to desired consistency.
Frost with icing or brush with butter and dust with confectioners sugar, as you wish. Would also be good brushed with honey butter while still warm.
