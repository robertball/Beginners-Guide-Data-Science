Ingredients:
8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni
2 dill pickles, chopped
6 ounces Colby-Jack cheese, cubed
1 (5 ounce) can albacore tuna in water, drained and flaked
1/2 cup light mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard
1 teaspoon dill pickle juice

Directions:
Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni, and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Rinse under cold running water, then drain well and pat lightly with paper towels.
In a large bowl, stir together the macaroni, pickles, cheese, tuna, mayonnaise and mustard. Season with a splash of pickle juice, salt and pepper. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This recipe came from my grandmother, who used peas in her version instead of pickles. My mother changed the recipe and I have altered it even more. The flavors of these ingredients blended together in what is reminiscent of a cold macaroni or potato salad will be your family's new favorite!
