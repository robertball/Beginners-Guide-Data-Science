Ingredients:
2 (5 ounce) cans tuna packed in water, drained
2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste
3/4 teaspoon celery salt
3/4 teaspoon onion powder
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/3 cup chopped celery
1/3 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped yellow bell pepper
1 tablespoon butter, or to taste
3 English muffins, split
6 slices American cheese
6 slices fresh tomato

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Flake the tuna into a medium bowl. Mix in the mayonnaise, celery salt, onion powder, and garlic powder. Stir in celery, onion, and yellow bell pepper.
Butter English muffin halves, place them on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.
Spoon tuna mixture onto each muffin half and top each with a slice of cheese. Return to the oven and continue baking until the cheese has melted, about 8 minutes. Top each with a tomato slice before serving.
