Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups plus 3 tsp flour
1 1/4 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1 1/4 cups unsalted butter at room temperature
1 1/4 cups packed light brown sugar
1/2 c granulated sugar
3 large eggs
1 1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/3 cup unsulfered molasses
1 1/2 cups white chocolate chips
1 cup coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Coat 12 x17" rimmed baking sheet with nonstick (butter-flavored) spray and line the bottom with parchment paper.  Spray parchment paper and set aside.
Stir together flour, soda, salt, and spices in a bowl.
In a larger bowl, beat butter and sugars on medium-high speed until creamy (about 3 minutes).  Add eggs one at a time, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally.  Next, add vanilla & molasses and mix on medium.  Add flour mixture from the other bowl and mix on low speed until combined.  Stir in white chocolate and nuts by hand.
Spread batter evenly into prepared pan and bake until golden on edges, about 22-27 minutes.  Let cool completely in pan.  Cut into 2" squares.  These bars can be stored in airtight containers at room temperature for about a week.
