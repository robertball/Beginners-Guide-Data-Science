Ingredients:
1 package yellow cake mix
2 TBS. Vegetable Oil
2 8 oz. packages cream cheese
1/2 cup. sugar
4 eggs
1 1/2 cup. milk
3 TBS. lemon juice
4 tsp. madagascar bourbon vanilla
2 16 oz. cans of cherry or blueberry pie filling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 F.
Reserve 1 cup of dry cake mix, set aside.
In a large bowl combine remaining cake mi, 1 egg and oil.(mixture will be crumbly)
Press crust mixture evenly into bottom and 3/4 the way up the sides of a 9 x 13 inch pan or two 9 inch round cake pans.
In the same bowl blend cream cheese and sugar.
Add 3 eggs and reserved cake mix,  beat 1 minute at medium speed. Be sure not to over beat the mixture to prevent cracking during bake time.
At slow speed add milk, lemon juice and vanilla, mix until smooth.
Pour into crust, bake at 300 F for 45 - 55 minutes for a 9x13 inch pan or 40 -50 minutes for 9 inch round pans, until center is firm.
When cool, top with pie filling.
Chill before serving. I have found the flavor is the best when chilled over night.

Description: 
I've been using this recipe since I was 12 and it's very delicious. The crust is better than the usual mundane grahm cracker crust for traditional cheese cakes and cheese pies.
