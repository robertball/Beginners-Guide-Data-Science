Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 cups quick cooking oats
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (15 ounce) can sweetened blueberries, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar. Stir in flour, salt and oats. Mix until well combined.
Pat 2/3 of the mixture into an ungreased 9-inch pie pan to form the bottom crust. Spread blueberries evenly into crust. Pat the remaining oat mixture onto top of blueberries.
Bake in preheated oven until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 40 to 50 minutes.
