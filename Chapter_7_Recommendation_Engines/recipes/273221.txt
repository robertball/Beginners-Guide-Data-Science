Ingredients:
1/2 cup coconut oil
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup almond milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup vegan chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cream coconut oil and brown sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until thoroughly mixed, about 5 minutes. Mix in almond milk and vanilla until incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Add the flour mixture to the almond milk mixture, stirring until combined; dough will be crumbly. Fold in chocolate chips.
Roll the dough into tablespoon-sized balls and place on ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheets. Flatten each ball out a bit with your palm, pressing any crumbs back together.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown and set, about 8 minutes.

Description: 
These are yummy, kid-friendly, vegan chocolate chip cookies! Add in any other mix-ins of your choosing. Remember, the texture of the cookies will be different from regular baked goods because of the lack of dairy and eggs. The dough may be a little crumbly, but just smoosh it together and it will work fine!
