Ingredients:
8 (5 ounce) lamb loin chops, about 1 1/4-inches thick
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
1/2 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1/2 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1/2 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
1/2 tablespoon minced fresh chives

Directions:
Trim any excess fat down to 1/8-inch around each lamb chop and sprinkle both sides with seasoning salt. Let sit for about 30 minutes to come to room temperature.
Preheat an outdoor grill to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil the grate once the grill is hot.
Place lamb chops on the hot grate and grill for 2 to 3 minutes. Rotate chops, to achieve crisscross grill marks, and continue grilling, 2 to 3 more minutes.  Flip the chops and grill for 2 to 3 minutes. Rotate chops and continue grilling an additional 2 minutes, or until they have reached desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).
Remove chops from grill and sprinkle with fresh herbs. Allow to rest under foil, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Enjoy fresh herbs with these grilled lamb chops. I used what was in my garden: mint, rosemary, parsley, and chives. You may use whatever combination you like! Lamb is very delicate and will stay tender and tasty at medium-rare. Lamb chops grill very quickly, so watch them closely.
