Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 (10 ounce) package white mushrooms, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch chopped fresh parsley, or as desired

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook and stir until slightly soft, about 1 minute. Stir in mushrooms and cook until softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool 10 minutes.
Transfer mushroom mixture and liquid to a blender and add cream cheese, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth and creamy. Pour into a glass or ceramic bowl. Cover and refrigerate until firm and has a pate-like texture, about 2 hours.
Garnish pate with parsley before serving.
