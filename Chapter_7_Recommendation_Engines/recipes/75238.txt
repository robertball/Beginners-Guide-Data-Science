1/2 cup peach preserves
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar

1 clove garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the peach preserves, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, orange juice, tequila, onion, garlic, salt and pepper. Use half of the mixture to marinate your meat. Pour the remainder into a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Boil for about 10 minutes, or until thickened. Use as a sauce for your cooked meat.

Description: 
This is a marinade I came up with that I use mostly on pork tenderloin, but is good on steaks, chicken and fish as well.
