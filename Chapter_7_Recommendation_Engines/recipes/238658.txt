Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1 cup diced fresh tomatoes
1/2 cup thinly chopped apples (such as Honeycrisp)
2 tablespoons chopped jicama
2 teaspoons coarsely chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives
1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh basil
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoons white vinegar

Directions:
Cook and stir garlic in a skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir tomatoes, apples, and jicama into garlic; cook and stir until tomatoes are hot, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir cilantro, chives, basil, and salt into tomato mixture; drizzle lime juice and vinegar over the top. Cook and stir until apples are juicy but still crisp and tomatoes are warm but still firm, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain some of the accumulated juices and transfer salsa to a bowl; refrigerate until chilled.

Description: 
This is a fresh salsa that I submitted to an apple cooking contest. I don't like spicy salsas so it's more flavorful than hot, but you can spice it up however you want. I used 'on-the-vine' tomatoes because of their juiciness. I toasted my own tortilla chips in the oven for 3 minutes on each side then cut them size. I didn't want the oil and salt from store bought chips, but try whatever kind of chips you want.
