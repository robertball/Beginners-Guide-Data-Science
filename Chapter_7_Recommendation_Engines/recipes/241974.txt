Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 medium sweet onion, diced small
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound lean ground beef
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 cups Ragu® Old World Style® Traditional Pasta Sauce
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (16 ounce) can mild chili beans, undrained
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon cumin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and beef. Stirring frequently, cook until meat is browned and crumbly, about 3 minutes. Drain excess fat.
Stir in chicken broth, Ragu(R) sauce, diced tomatoes with mild green chilies, beans, chili powder, and cumin. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil and stir in pasta; cover, reduce heat to a simmer and cook until pasta is al dente, about 14 minutes.
Remove from heat. Stir in the cheese and parsley. Serve immediately, garnished with additional cheese and parsley, if desired.
