Ingredients:
2 spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
4 tablespoons avocado oil, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup butter (such as KerrygoldÂ®)
2 cups half-and-half
2 tablespoons paprika
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
1 1/2 cups finely grated Parmesan cheese
3 cups fresh prawns
1 cup chopped shiitake mushrooms
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/8 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Brush squash halves with 1 tablespoon avocado oil and season with salt and pepper. Place face-down on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, 35 to 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in half-and-half, paprika, salt, and pepper. Heat slowly to a light boil, about 4 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese and stir until blended, about 1 minute. Remove sauce from heat.
Heat remaining avocado oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add prawns, mushrooms, and garlic. Cook until prawns are nearly opaque, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain any accumulated liquid and pour sauce over prawns. Stir in parsley and simmer on low heat until fully but not overcooked, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Scrape flesh from cooked squash into a serving plate. Top with seafood Alfredo sauce.

Description: 
Not low-fat, but low-carb and full of protein and nutrients. A 'treat' meal. May top with an additional sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese and parsley. I prefer Himalayan salt.
