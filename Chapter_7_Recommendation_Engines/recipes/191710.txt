Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cornmeal
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
2 large eggs
3 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled

Directions:
Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.  Whisk buttermilk, eggs and butter in a separate large bowl.  Stir the liquid mixture into the dry mixture until blended and smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.  For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup batter on griddle and cook until browned, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute.  Continue with remaining batter.
