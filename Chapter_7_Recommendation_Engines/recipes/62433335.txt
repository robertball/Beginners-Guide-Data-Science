Ingredients:
4-6 Bell Pepper Halves (color is your choice, cleaned and de-seeded)
8 Cups Bread Cubed
1 Med. Onion (finely chopped)
2 ribs Celery (finely chopped)
1 Cup Chopped Mushrooms
1/2 Cup Butter
Chicken Stock
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
Poultry Seasoning to taste

Directions:
Saut√© the celery, onions and mushroom in the butter until tender. Mean while, cube bread and add dry seasonings. Once celery, onions and mushrooms are tender, add to bread mixture. Slowly add enough chicken stock to moisten but not make soupy. Stuff pepper halves. Preheat BBQ Grill to about 350 - 375 on the temperature gauge (this is LOW setting on my grill). Lightly oil the top grate of the grill (this would be the one that moves up and down when the lid is opened and closed). Place stuffed pepper halves directly on grate and allow to cook about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
