Ingredients:
Marinade:
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 tsp sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon low sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon water
1 1/2 lbs flank steak, sliced into thin strips:
Ingredients:
1/2 c low-sodium soy sauce
2 tbsp brown sugar
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tbsp flour
1 tbsp sherry (optional)
3 tbsp vegetable oil
2 heads broccoli, crowns only

Directions:
For the Marinade: Whisk together the baking soda, sugar, cornstarch, soy sauce, water, and vegetable oil in a large bowl. Toss the steak with the marinade to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour, then proceed below.
Directions: In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, flour and sherry until smooth. Set aside.
In a large wok or saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil over high heat until shimmering. Add broccoli and saute 3 minutes, stirring often. Transfer broccoli to a plate.
Carefully add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the hot pan. Add the marinated meat and half of the sauce mixture and saute for 3-4 minutes, stirring often, until the meat is cooked through and no longer pink. Stir in the broccoli and remaining sauce. Saute 1 minute more. Serve.
Note:  Serve over white or brown rice
