2 tablespoons margarine
1 fresh poblano chile pepper, seeded and diced
1 quart heavy cream
1 quart half-and-half cream
1/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon lobster base (optional)
1 pinch ground dried chile de arbol
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup all-purpose flour

Description: 
This is a very creamy and spicy corn chowder with shrimp and poblano peppers. The lobster base is optional, but in my opinion you really need to use it if you can.
