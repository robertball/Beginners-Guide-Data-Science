Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup quick cooking oats
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup blueberries
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
1 large or 2 small bananas, mashed
1 cup low-fat buttermilk
1 egg
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12 cup muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray very well, making sure to spray the top of the pan also since the muffins will rise.
In a large bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, quick-cooking oats, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Gently stir in the blueberries and walnuts.
In a separate bowl, mix together the mashed banana, buttermilk, egg, oil and vanilla. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and mix just until blended. Spoon into muffin cups, filling all the way to the top.
Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops of the muffins spring back when lightly touched.
Let cool for 5 minutes, then invert onto cooling rack to cool for a couple of minutes-serve warm!
