Ingredients:
3 potatoes, peeled and quartered
2 teaspoons salt
4 tablespoons creamy salad dressing (e.g. Miracle Whip)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover. Add 2 teaspoons salt.  Bring to a boil; cook until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain, and allow to cool until easily handled but still warm.
Cut potatoes into bite size pieces, and transfer to a medium mixing bowl.  Add salad dressing, and gently stir until well coated.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Serve warm.

Description: 
This is a good potato salad recipe for us folks who don't like onions. I really wanted to try a potato salad recipe, and they ALL had onion of some sort.  By not putting any, I'd lose half the taste.  Well, this may seem a silly recipe to some of you, but I love it and so does my brother!
