Ingredients:
Muffins:
1 1/4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
1/2 cup quinoa flour
1/4 cup ground flax seed
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 scoop vanilla whey protein powder
2 packets stevia powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup cooked and mashed sweet potato
2 eggs, beaten
3 ounces Greek yogurt
1/3 cup coconut oil
1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Glaze:
1/2 scoop vanilla whey protein powder
2 packets stevia powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
Whisk oats, quinoa flour, ground flax seed, baking powder, baking soda, 1 scoop protein powder, 2 packets stevia powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Stir sweet potato, eggs, Greek yogurt, coconut oil, applesauce, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir in flour mixture until batter is smooth. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 17 minutes. Cool slightly, about 15 minutes.
Whisk 1/2 scoop protein powder, 2 packets stevia powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, and water together in a bowl, adding more water to thin the glaze. Brush glaze over slightly cooled muffins.
