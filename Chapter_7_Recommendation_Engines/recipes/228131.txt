Ingredients:
1 cup orzo pasta
1/4 cup butter
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic in melted butter until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir orzo into garlic mixture and mix in Parmesan cheese, milk, parsley, salt, and black pepper.
