Ingredients:
1 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour
1/2 cup frozen margarine cut in 6 or 8 pieces
1/4 cup ginger ale, or 7up.+
1/ tablespoon white vinegar.

Directions:
Put the steel knife in the food processor and process flour and margarine with on/off turns until the mixture begins to look like coarse oatmeal. Combine ginger ale with vinegar and add through the feed tube while machine is running.Process JUST until the dough begins to gather in a mass around the blade, about 8-10 seconds. Do not over process or the dough will be tough.  Remove dough from machine, divide into 2 balls, wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge at least 1 hour, or over night. The colder the dough, the easier to roll out.*SEE NOTES**
