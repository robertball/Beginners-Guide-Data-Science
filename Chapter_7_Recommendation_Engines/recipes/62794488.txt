Ingredients:
1 cup soy sauce
1 cup dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 Tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 onion, chopped
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4  teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (optional)
1 teaspoon ground paprika (optional)
5 pounds skinless chicken thighs

Directions:
Put all ingredients (except onion) and blend for 30 seconds. Add the onion and pulse until chopped.Pour into large zip lock bag over chicken thighs and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. I prefer 24 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Remove the chicken thighs from the marinade. Discard the remaining marinade. Grill the chicken thighs on the preheated grill until cooked through, about 15 minutes per side.
