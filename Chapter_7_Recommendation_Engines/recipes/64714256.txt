Ingredients:
2 can (20 ounces) unsweetened pineapple chunks
2 package (12 ounces) frozen fully cooked homestyle or Swedish meatballs, thawed (or smoked sausage cut into 1" slices)
1 large green pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 large red pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 large yellow pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 large onions, cut into 1-inch pieces
6 Tbsp cornstarch
1/2 cup cold water
1/4 cup cider vinegar
2 Tbsp soy sauce
2/3 cup packed brown sugar

Directions:
Drain pineapple, reserving juice. Set pineapple aside. Add enough water to juice if needed to measure 2 cups. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the meatballs, green pepper and juice mixture until heated through.
In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, cold water, vinegar and soy sauce until smooth. Add brown sugar and reserved pineapple to the pan; stir in cornstarch mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. If desired, serve with rice.

Description: 
The super nice thing about this recipe is that most of the items can be found already made in the store if you are short on time (or just lazy). Using the already prepared meatballs make this a very easy. You can use your own homemade meatballs or store-bought if you're in a pinch. I have even used summer sausage cut into 1 slices in a pinch. It also can be made into a full meal by serving over rice.
