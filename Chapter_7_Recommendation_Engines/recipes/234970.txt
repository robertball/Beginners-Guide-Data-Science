Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose baking mix
1 1/3 cups milk
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 banana, chopped
1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Stir baking mix, milk, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until batter is smooth; fold in banana and chocolate chips until just combined.
Heat a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Sprinkle a few drops water in skillet; they will dance and disappear when skillet is ready.
Spoon just under 1/4 cup batter into the pan; cook until bubbles appear on the top of each pancake and bottom is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip each pancake and cook until bottom is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

These pancakes are something that I just threw together one morning and they tasted wonderful! Plus it's good with whipped cream and confectioners' sugar.
