Ingredients:
175g (6oz) unsalted butter
150g (5oz) light muscovado (or Demerara) sugar
2tbsp golden syrup (or Golden Corn Syrup)
375g (13oz) porridge oats
100g (3 1/2oz) dried cranberries
50g (2oz) sultanas
50g (2oz) pecans, roughly chopped
25g (1oz) each pumpkin seeds and pinenuts
1 level tsp ground cinnamon
1 level tbsp plain flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 180C (350F). Melt the butter, sugar, and syrup in a pan over low heat.
Put the remaining ingredients in a bowl, pour the melted butter mixture over and mix until thoroughly combined.
Spoon the mixture into a 20.5x30.5cm (8x12in) baking pan and press down the contents into the corners.
Bake for 25-35mins or until golden. Press the mixture down again if necessary. Use a knife to carefully mark out 12 bars then leave mixture in the pan and let cool COMPLETELY!
Seriously people... It will be tempting because if you've snacked at all you will know how good just the mixture tastes but if you remove anything before it is COMPLETELY cooled you will have granola and not nice chewy bars.
Once the bars have COMPLETELY cooled you may remove them and chow down!
Store in a container to avoid drying out.
