Ingredients:
1/2 cup melted butter
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9 inch baking pan.
In a medium bowl, mix together the butter, sugar, and vanilla. Beat in eggs. Combine flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt; gradually stir into the egg mixture until well blended. Stir in walnuts, if desired. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the brownie begins to pull away from edges of pan.  Let cool on a wire rack before cutting into squares.

Description: 
I personally think these are  the best brownies in the world. Try them, I think you'll agree!  To make the brownies rich and buttery, use melted butter instead of the vegetable oil.Modified from: Mmm-Mmm Better Brownies
