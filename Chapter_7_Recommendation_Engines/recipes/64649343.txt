Ingredients:
1 cup of arugula
8 cherry tomatoes
150g bocconcini di mozzarella
1/4 cup alfalfa sprouts
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves
2 Tbsp EVOO, divided
1 Tbsp pine nuts
Pinch of salt
1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
3 lady finger cookies
2 Tbsp cold espresso
1/2 cup mascarpone
Pinch of sugar
1 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa

Directions:
In a large mouth canning jar, add the arugula then top with the mozzarella. Add the tomatoes and top with alfalfa sprouts. Keep in the refrigerator.
In a mortar, add the basil and begin to work the pestle pushing the leaves to the sides of the mortar in a circular grinding motion. Continue this movement until the leaves start to break apart. Add the pine nuts and continue grinding. Add a pinch of salt. When the mixture becomes fine, add 2 tsp of oil. Continue to grind and mix until creamy.  Put the mixture into a small jar and add the lemon juice and remaining oil. Refrigerate until needed. Shake well before using.
In a small canning jar, crush the lady fingers on the bottom. Drizzle the coffee over the cookie crumbs. Mix the pinch of sugar in with the mascarpone with a whisk until fluffy. Pour it over the cookie crumbs. Top with the cocoa using a sieve. Close the jar and refrigerate until you are ready to eat it.
