Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
3 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 egg yolk
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter or fork until only small lumps remain. Sprinkle the water and 1 teaspoon vanilla over the mixture and mix well using a fork. Set aside.
In a small bowl, mix together 1/4 cup butter, egg yolk and sugar until smooth. Beat in 1 teaspoon vanilla, cocoa  and coconut until smooth. Set aside.  Use 1/2 of the dough at a time. On a cloth covered board, dusted generously with sugar, roll dough out to 1/16 inch thick. Cut the dough into 2 1/2 inch squares.  Spread 1 teaspoon of filling onto each square, bring the corners to the center and press lightly to seal. Place them onto an ungreased cookie sheet about 2 inches apart.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until edges are golden. Cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
