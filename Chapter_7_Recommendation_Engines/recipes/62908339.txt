Ingredients:
1 T olive oil
1/2 c onion, diced
1 cup long grain rice
2 t italian seasoning
1/2 t tumeric
4-5 saffron threads
1/4 t cumin (optional)
2 cup chicken broth
1 cup peas, frozen, (optional)

Directions:
If possible, nuke or warm the broth, and add the saffron threads to warmed liquid to release scent/color.
Heat oil in skillet.
Add onion, season with salt & cracked pepper, and saute 3 to 4 minutes.
Add rice, tumeric, and italian seasoning.  Stir and continue to cook for a couple of minutes or until rice is nicely coated with oil and goldened up a bit.
Add cumin if using, and chicken broth with saffron.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 15 to 18 minutes.
If using peas, add after about 15 minutes, stir, cover, and let sit additional 5 minutes or so.

Description: 
OK - This isn't the *perfect* clone for that bagged yellow rice stuff, but it's pretty close.  Notes:  no matter how I try, you simply must add salt to rice after cooking - - - I hate that, but it really is necessary.
