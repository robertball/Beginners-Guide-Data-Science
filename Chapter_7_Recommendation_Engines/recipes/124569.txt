Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
2 tablespoons sugar
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1 teaspoon dill weed
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram, crushed
1/2 cup finely chopped almonds, toasted, divided
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water; set aside. In large mixing bowl, combine butter, salt and milk. Stir in yeast mixture, 2 cups flour, herbs and 2 tablespoons almonds. Beat until well-mixed. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl, turning once to grease dough surface. Cover; let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down and cut off 1/3 of dough; set aside. Divide remaining dough into three equal parts, shaping each into a 14-in. rope. Braid ropes and place on greased baking sheet. Divide set-aside dough into three ropes and braid. Place smaller braid on top of larger braid. Cover; let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Combine egg and water. Brush over entire loaf; sprinkle with remaining almonds. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes.

Description: 
I got this recipe from a neighbor, who's a great baker and cook. She had just taken a loaf of this bread out of the oven one day when I stopped by, and it was so fragrant and attractive that I just had to have the recipe!
