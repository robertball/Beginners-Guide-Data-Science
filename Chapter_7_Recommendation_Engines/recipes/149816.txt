1/2 cup olive oil
1 head red lettuce leaves, rinsed, dried, and torn
1/2 small red onion, peeled, cut into 1/2-inch-wide slivers
1/4 cup sliced almonds, lightly toasted
1 pint fresh strawberries, rinsed and sliced

Directions:
To make the dressing, place the balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, shallot, garlic, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a mini food processor. Pulse until blended. Slowly pour in the olive oil, and pulse again until thoroughly blended. Set aside or refrigerate until needed.
