Description: 
Ever since my friend Sonja made this and brought it into work, it is my signature appetizer dish to take to parties! I tweaked it a little to my taste. It is the first appetizer to go and everyone will be asking for the recipe! Serve with crackers or sliced bread. Absolutely delicious!
