Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup crushed pineapple, juice reserved
8 (1 ounce) squares semi-sweet chocolate
1 tablespoon shortening

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine sugar, margarine and crushed pineapple. Stir in a small amount of pineapple juice if the mixture needs more moisture. When the mixture is well blended shape it into two 1/2 pound eggs (or a bunch of smaller eggs). Freeze for one hour.
While the eggs are freezing, cut semi-sweet chocolate into small pieces and place in top of double boiler with shortening.  Melt over medium heat,  stirring frequently until smooth.  Stick a long-tined fork in top of each pineapple egg, dip it in melted chocolate to cover then drain on waxed paper.

Description: 
If pineapple isn't your favorite candy flavoring you could substitute coconut, maple-flavoring or even maraschino cherries and juice for the pineapple and pineapple juice. Decorate the eggs after the chocolate has cooled if you'd like.
