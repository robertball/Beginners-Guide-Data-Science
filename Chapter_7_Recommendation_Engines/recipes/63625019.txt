Ingredients:
1 (12 oz) package al fresco Sweet Apple Chicken Sausage, sliced into 1" chunks
1/2 cup fresh pineapple, cut into 1" chunks
1/2 cup red onion, cut into 1" chunks
1/2 cup green bell pepper, cut into 1" chunks
1/2 cup orange or yellow bell pepper, cut into 1" chunks
1 cup grape tomatoes
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
4-6 skewers
1 cup apple cider or juice
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1/2 cup olive oil
2 tbsp cider vinegar
2 tbsp brown mustard
1 tbsp dijon mustard
4 tsp fresh sage, minced or 2 tsp crumbled dried sage
1 tbsp fresh thyme, minced or 1 1/2 tsp dried thyme
2 scallions, chopped
cooking spray

Directions:
Pre-heat grill to medium-high.
Avoid crowding, thread the chicken sausage, pineapple, onion, peppers, and tomato, alternating each ingredient, onto each skewer. Lightly coat with cooking spray and season with salt and pepper.
Combine apple cider, onion, olive oil, cider vinegar, mustards, and herbs. Brush each kabob with marinade.
Grill the kabobs uncovered over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, turning to cook on all sides, until the veggies are browned and chicken sausage reaches internal temperature of 165 degrees. Garnish with scallions.
