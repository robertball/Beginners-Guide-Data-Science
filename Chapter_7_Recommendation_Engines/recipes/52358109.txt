Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil or butter
2/3 cup long grain white rice or basmati rice
1 cups water
1 lime
2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
salt to taste

Directions:
In a 2-quart heavy saucepan, heat oil or butter over low heat, stirring occasionally until melted.
Add rice and lime juice, stir for 1 minute.
Add water and salt, bring to a full rolling boil.(Some people have had success with 1 cup of water, but when I've made it with 2 it worked for me).
At boiling, cover, turn down to simmer over low heat until rice is tender and the water is absorbed, about 25 minutes.
Add in the cilantro and fluff rice with a fork.
