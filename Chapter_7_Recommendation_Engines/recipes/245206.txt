Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package brownie mix
1 egg
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup mini semisweet chocolate pieces
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
3/4 cup sugar
3 eggs
1 (21 ounce) can LUCKY LEAFÂ® Regular or Premium Cherry Fruit Filling & Topping
Frozen whipped dessert topping, thawed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9-inch spring-form pan with cooking spray; set aside.
In a medium bowl, stir together brownie mix, one egg and oil until combined. Stir in chocolate pieces. Spread batter in prepared pan.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until brownie is just set. (It will not be completely done at this point.)
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar on medium speed until well combined and smooth. Add in the eggs on low speed and set the mixture aside.
Carefully spoon 1/2 can (1 cup) of cherry fruit filling into center of brownie, leaving a 2-inch brownie border along sides of pan.
Dollop cream cheese mixture over surface; carefully spread to edges of pan.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until center is set, but jiggles when the pan is lightly tapped.
Cool in pan on a wire rack for 1 hour. Cover and chill at least 4 hours before serving.
Top cheesecake with remaining cherry fruit filling. Garnish with whipped topping, if desired.
