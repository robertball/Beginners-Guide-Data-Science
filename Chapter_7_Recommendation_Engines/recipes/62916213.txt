Ingredients:
1 cup fresh lime juice
2 cups simple syrup
3 cups amber rum
4 cups orange juice
4 dashes bitters
freshly grated nutmeg

Directions:
In a pitcher, combine lime juice, simple syrup, rum and orange juice. Add a few dashes of bitters and some grated nutmeg to taste. Serve chilled over ice.
Great recipe! For anyone who may need a bit of clarification (like me), here is what I discovered. It takes about 6 limes to get a cup of juice. You can make simple syrup by heating equal parts sugar and water in a saucepan until the sugar dissolves. Simple syrup and bitters can also be purchased rather inexpensively at the liquor store. I used Meyers dark rum and grated about a half teaspoon of fresh nutmeg over the top of the whole batch and stirred it in. The punch has a really wonderful flavor and a bit of a delayed effect so watch out! Thanks for sharing, I will be making this again
