Ingredients:
1 bunch celery, chopped
1/2 bag baby carrots, chopped
1 bundle green onions, chopped
3 tbs olive oil
4 tbs vegetable "Better Than Bouillon"
5 cups water
1 small purple cabbage, chopped
2 ears fresh corn, off cob
1 can diced tomatoes
1 cup mushroom spaghetti sauce
1 tsp lemon pepper
hot sauce

Directions:
1. Saut√© green onions, carrots, and celery in large pot with olive oil on medium heat. Add the water and bouillon to the pot. When that is mixed, add in the cabbage, corn, tomatoes with juice included, spaghetti sauce, and kidney beans. It won't really be stirrable at this point because of all the raw vegetables, so just try to distribute things the best you can, and cover the pot.
2. Once the vegetables have started to cook down, add the lemon pepper and however much hot sauce you want. At this point, the soup can basically be left alone for about 45 minutes with the lid on. It's a slow process, but it's well worth it in the end, I promise.
3. If you've cooked everything long enough, it will look like the picture. Basically everything is purple/red from the cabbage and none of the vegetables should be al dente.

Description: 
I modified this recipe to be vegan based on something my mom used to make. Let me just tell you upfront, I hate celery and I'm not a huge fan of cabbage or carrots either, but for some reason, the combination of them in this soup is fantastic. It makes a lot so I hope you're hungry. You don't have to worry about eating a ton of it though because it's super healthy.
