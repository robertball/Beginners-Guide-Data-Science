Ingredients:
2 lb Roma Tomatoes
1 Medium sized sweet onion
6 cloves garlic, peeled and whole
1/8 cup Olive Oil
1/8 cup Balsamic Vinegar
2 Springs Oregano â€“optional  (leaves only, remove from stem)
5-6 Fresh basil leaves
Salt and Pepper to taste.
2 Cups Chicken Broth
1/4 cup half and half (optional, but the texture is better)

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.   (Your entire house will smell wonderful as this cooks!)
Wash and cut tomatoes into quarters, placing in a 13x9 baking dish cut side down.
Add onion pieces, garlic, oregano and basil to the pan.  Drizzle vegetables with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.
Bake for 45 minutes.
Place entire roasted vegetable mixture in blender and begin puree. Slowly add broth until  soup has desired consistency. Continue blending until smooth. Pour into pot and heat to desired temperature, Add half and half.
Serve garnished with shredded parmesan cheese and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar if desired (careful not too much)   I also serve it with some hot crusty sour dough bread.
