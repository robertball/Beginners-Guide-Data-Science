Description: 
I just love a great one-pot dish that makes everyone go wow. I prepare, cook, and serve right out of my beautiful braising pan. You can also use your paella pan. 

Thank you to D&D Market (the new Wethersfield, CT store) for the fresh ingredients to make this great recipe. Using cauliflower as your rice makes this dish a perfect paleo side dish or main course! This is also a stove-to-table dish without any mess in 30 minutes!
