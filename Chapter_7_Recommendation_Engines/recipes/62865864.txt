Ingredients:
Streusel:
2 1/4 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1/2 cup)
1/2 cup regular oats
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons butter, melted
Filling:
2/3 cup cabernet sauvignon or other dry red wine
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon grated lemon rind
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
4 peeled Bosc pears, cored and thinly sliced (about 1 1/2 pounds)
Cooking spray
Remaining ingredients:
3/4 cup frozen reduced-calorie whipped topping, thawed
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°.
To prepare streusel, weigh or lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup; level with a knife. Combine flour, regular oats, brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon allspice, and salt in a medium bowl. Add butter, stirring with a fork until crumbly. Set aside.
To prepare filling, combine wine and granulated sugar in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium. Add lemon rind, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon allspice, and sliced pears to pan, stirring to coat; simmer for 15 minutes or until the pears are tender.
Spoon pear mixture into an 8-inch square baking dish coated with cooking spray. Sprinkle streusel evenly over pear mixture. Bake at 350° for 30 minutes or until bubbly and lightly browned. Serve with whipped topping. Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon, if desired.
