Ingredients:
2 teaspoons butter
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped, or more to taste
2 (16 ounce) packages frozen peas
1/2 teaspoon dried dill, or to taste
1 (900 ml) carton chicken broth, or as needed
1/3 cup milk (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot butter until golden and translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir garlic into onions and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir peas and dill into onion mixture and pour in enough chicken broth to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until hot, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir milk into soup.
Puree soup with an immersion blender or pour pea soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Recovering from surgery and a bad case of strep throat, I threw this together to aid my body through recovery.  Eating this soup is a great way to pack in the nutrients. Light, clean, filling, and full of flavor. My kids love it. I just add a little milk to cool it down so they can eat it right away.
