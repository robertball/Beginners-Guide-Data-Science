Ingredients:
3 cups Gluten Free Baking flour
1 1/2 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoon Himalayan salt
1 1/2 tablespoon honey
1 cube of butter
1/2 cube of butter (reserved for pan)
1 1/2 cup milk
1 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate container, combine and stir apple cider vinegar in with milk.  Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Gradually stir in milk/vinegar mixture until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.
Turn out onto a floured surface, and knead 15 to 20 times. Pat or roll dough out to 1 inch thick. Cut biscuits with a large juice glass and place biscuits into 9X13 bapking pan with 1/2 cube of melted butter.  Repeat until all dough is used.
Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges begin to brown.
