Ingredients:
2 cups milk
1 (0.6 ounce) cake cake yeast
1/4 cup warm water - 100 to 110 degrees F (40 to 45 degrees C)
6 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 slice bread, toasted
3 pounds walnut halves
1 1/4 pounds pecan halves
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup honey, or to taste
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 teaspoon nutmeg
4 egg whites
2 cups milk, or as needed
1/4 cup butter, melted - divided
2 egg yolks
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Heat 2 cups of milk in a saucepan over low heat until the milk just comes to a simmer; remove from heat, and let cool. Mash the cake yeast with the warm water in a bowl, and set aside.
In a bowl, whisk together the flour with 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg. In a separate large bowl, mash the butter with 1 cup of sugar and the salt until the mixture is smooth and creamy.  Beat in 2 eggs and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. After milk is cooled to a warm temperature, stir the yeast mixture into the scalded milk, and stir the milk mixture to the creamed butter mixture. Beat in 3 cups of flour until completely incorporated, and beat in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the mixture forms a smooth dough that's almost sticky. Dough will be very soft.
Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place the dough into an oiled bowl, and turn the dough over to coat all sides with oil. Cover with a floured kitchen towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 2 to 3 hours.
Punch down the dough, cut into 6 equal pieces, and roll each piece into a ball. Cover with floured kitchen towel, and set the balls into a warm place to rise until doubled, 40 minutes to 1 hour.
While dough is rising the second time, make the nut filling: tear toasted bread into a few pieces, and grind toast with walnuts and  pecans in a food grinder, or process in the work bowl of a food processor until finely chopped. Place the nuts into a bowl; mix in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1 cup of honey, 1/2 cup of sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg until thoroughly combined. Mix in milk, a little at a time, to make a workable mixture.
Beat egg whites to stiff peaks in a bowl with an electric mixer, and gently fold the egg whites into the nut mixture until completely combined.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll out each piece of dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch square;  brush with melted butter. Spread 1/6 of the nut mixture onto each square of dough, and roll each into a log; pinch ends and seam tightly together, and tuck the ends underneath the roll. Place filled rolls on the prepared baking sheet, seam sides down.
Beat egg yolks and 1/2 cup of milk together in a small bowl, and brush the rolls with the egg yolk mixture. If desired, allow to rise 30 more minutes (for more puffy rolls). Poke holes in the rolls every 4 inches.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 50 to 65 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a roll will come out clean. Brush rolls with melted butter after removing from oven; allow to cool on racks.
