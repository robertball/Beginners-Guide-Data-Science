Ingredients:
3 kohlrabi bulbs, trimmed and peeled
4 slices bacon, cut into small pieces
1/2 medium yellow onion, sliced
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed (optional)
salt to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Cut kohlrabi into thin noodles using a spiralizer.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Brown bacon and onion, until bacon is beginning to crisp and onion is caramelized but not burning, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer bacon and onion to a small bowl, reserving 1 tablespoon bacon grease in the skillet.
Add kohlrabi noodles to the skillet and season with salt. Cook noodles over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they begin to wilt down and soften, 12 to 14 minutes. Stir in butter until melted. Add in bacon and onion mixture and stir in 1/2 the Parmesan cheese.
Serve immediately topped with remaining cheese and parsley.
