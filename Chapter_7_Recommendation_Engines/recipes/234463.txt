Ingredients:
2 egg yolks
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
2 teaspoons tarragon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon tarragon vinegar
1 teaspoon water
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Whisk egg yolks, black pepper, tarragon Dijon mustard, tarragon vinegar, water, and salt in a metal mixing bowl or small saucepan. Place over low heat and whisk until mixture foams, small wisps of steam appear from the sauce, and sauce is hot and thick, 1 to 2 minutes. Raise and lower the pan over the heat to increase or reduce heat.
Remove from heat and whisk a few more seconds to make sauce slightly fluffy. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a really quick, easy, nice sauce for steak that has no butter. Did I mention it has no butter? Just a few minutes of preparation and onto the steak it goes.
