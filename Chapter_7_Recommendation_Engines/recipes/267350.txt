Ingredients:
1 cup lukewarm water
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Mix water, sugar, and yeast together in a bowl. Let stand until yeast is foamy, 5 to 10 minutes.
Place flour, oil, and salt in a food processor; mix briefly. Add yeast mixture. Mix until a ball forms. Transfer to a bowl. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough gently to deflate. Roll out to form a pizza crust.
