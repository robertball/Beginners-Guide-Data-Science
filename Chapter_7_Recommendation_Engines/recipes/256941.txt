Description: 
I wanted to use my slow cooker convenience for fresh summer eggplant and squash, so I came up with this recipe. Using the slow cooker makes this an easy and tasty stew. Even people who don't like eggplant love this stew. Serve in bowls with your favorite whole grain bread to sop up the juices.
