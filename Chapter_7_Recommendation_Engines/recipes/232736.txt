Ingredients:
6 cups skim milk
5 large sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped
3 apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
1 large onion, sliced
3 carrots, chopped
3 stalks celery, chopped
6 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
8 black peppercorns

Directions:
Combine milk, sweet potatoes, apples, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, salt, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and peppercorns in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are soft, 20 to 30 minutes.
Pour soup into a food processor or blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.

Description: 
This is a great way to use sweet potatoes and other staples you have laying around. Cooking for a Crohn's husband, we're always trying to find ways to cook vegetables down so he can still enjoy them. If necessary, thin with additional milk. Serve hot with a sprinkling of pepitas, if desired.
