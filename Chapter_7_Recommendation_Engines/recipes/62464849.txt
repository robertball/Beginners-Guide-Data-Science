Ingredients:
6-8 cups peeled and sliced peaches or apples
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (or more, to taste)
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons tapioca (1 tablespoon if you're using apples)
Topping:
1.5 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons brown sugar
1.5 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
9 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons boiling water
MIX TOGETHER:
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine peaches, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and tapioca. Toss to coat evenly, and pour into a 2 quart baking dish or 9x13 pan. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine flour, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Blend in butter with your fingertips, or a pastry blender, until mixture resembles coarse meal (or can use food processor).  Stir in water until just combined.
Remove peaches from oven, and drop spoonfuls of topping over them. Sprinkle entire cobbler with the sugar and cinnamon mixture. Bake until topping is golden, about 30 minutes.
