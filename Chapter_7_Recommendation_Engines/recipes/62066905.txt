Authentic Cuban Black Beans (Frijoles Negros) Recipe

Ingredients:
1 pound black beans
6-7 cups of water
1 green pepper, cut in half
1 bay leaf
1 onion
olive oil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/8 teaspoon of pepper
1/2 to 1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 tablespoon white vinegar
2 tablespoons sherry

Directions:
1. Pick out all the little rocks and nasty-looking beans in a 1-pound bag of black beans. Cook the beans in water for 45 minutes in a pressure cooker with one-half of a green pepper and a bay leaf. (No need to cut up the half of a green pepper. Save the other half.) If you don't have a pressure cooker, boil for five minutes with one-half of a green pepper and soak overnight.
2. Right before you are ready to serve, dice the other half of the green pepper and one onion. Put them in a small frying pan and cover with olive oil. Sauté the onion and green pepper until softened. (This onion-green pepper mix is called a “sofrito.” It's the basis of a lot of bean dishes and other Cuban dishes.)
3. Add the dried oregano, basil, pepper and garlic salt. Cook a little longer. 4. Add the vinegar and sherry.
5. Add the sofrito to the beans. If the beans are too thick, add water and heat up. If too thin, just simmer the beans until they're the way you like them.

Description: 
My Havana-born mom makes excellent and authentic Cuban black beans (frijoles negros). There's no sour cream, jalapenos or chile peppers -- all of which are unknown in Cuba. In Cuba, we serve these beans over rice. In this country, people often just eat them like soup. They're good any way you do it!
