Ingredients:
3-4 lemons (or 1 cup lemon juice)
Lemon zest from the lemons
4 eggs
3/4 cup sugar
1.5 cup butter
roll phyllo dough
1.5 cups really coarse sugar
Fresh fruit - I recommend strawberries, kiwis, blueberries,and other berries

Directions:
Mix together the Lemon juice, eggs, and lemon zest so that the juice and eggs are combined
Put the Lemon mixture, sugar, and 1/2 cup butter into a saucepan over a medium low heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves and the butter melts.
Cook for 10 minutes until bubbles form and the curd shows marks from where you whisk it.
I usually use pour the curd through a mesh strainer into a bowl, to make sure no lemon seeds/egg chunks get into the final curd, but this is optional
Let it cool for about 30 minutes in the fridge
Preheat oven to 375 degrees
Cut phyllo dough into squares ~ 4x4 inches
Melt the remaining butter
Dip 1 square of phyllo dough into the butter and then into the coarse sugar.
Layer the dough into a cupcake/muffin tin, so it forms a cup shape.
Bake for 10 minutes **Keep an Eye on it, and don't let them burn**
Assemble by putting the curd into the cups and top with fresh fruit.
