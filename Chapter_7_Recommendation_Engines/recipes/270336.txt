Ingredients:
5 slices candied ginger, coarsely chopped
3 cups very hot, but not boiling, water

Directions:
Combine chopped candied ginger slices and hot water in a bowl.
Allow to steep for at least 20 minutes; the longer it steeps, the more pronounced the ginger flavor will be. Stir water and drain to remove candied ginger slices, reserving water into another container. Serve water heated like tea or drink cold.
