Ingredients:
6 cups all-purpose flour
3 eggs
1 pinch salt
water as needed
5 pounds potatoes, peeled
1 pound processed cheese, cubed
salt and pepper to taste
onion salt to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain.
Combine flour, eggs and salt.  Mix in a little water at a time until dough is somewhat stiff.  Roll dough in small sections about 1/4 inch thick.  Using a large biscuit cutter or drinking glass, make circle cuts.
To make filling: Mix together potatoes, cheese, salt, pepper and onion salt.  Fill each with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture, fold over and seal edges.  To cook, bring a large pot of water to boil, carefully dropping in one at a time; stir once. They are done when they float to the top.
