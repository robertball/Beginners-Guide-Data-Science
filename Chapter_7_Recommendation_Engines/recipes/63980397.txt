Ingredients:
3 cups bread flour
1 1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Combine all dry ingredients.
Add water and stir with a rubber spatula until you have a thoroughly mixed, wet, sticky mess of dough.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for 12 to 18 hours.
Turn out bread onto a floured surface.  Dust lightly with flour and cover with a tea towel.  Let rise for another 1 to 2 hours.
About 30 minutes before second rise is complete, place a cast iron dutch oven in the oven.  Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.
Remove pot from oven (very carefully).  Sprinkle cornmeal in the bottom.
Uncover dough and shape into a round by folding it over itself a few times.  Drop round into pot, dust with cornmeal, and put the lid on the pot.  Return the pot to the oven.
Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the lid.  Bake an additional 10 minutes, or until browned.
Remove pot from the oven.  With a sturdy spatula, pry the loaf out of the pot and place on a cooling rack.  Allow to cool at least 1 hour before slicing.
