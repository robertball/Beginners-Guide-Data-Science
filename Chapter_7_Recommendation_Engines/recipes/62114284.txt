Ingredients:
2 pounds of Chicken Breasts
Ken's Steakhouse Italian Dressing
Garlic Powder, to taste
Onion Poweder, to taste
2 Tablespoons of Emeril's Essence

Directions:
1) Trim the fat from the chicken breasts. If using for sandwiches butterfly in half for a thinner slice of meat.
2) Mix dressing and all spices together in a ziploc bag. Put chicken in the bag and marinade in the refridgerator overnight for the best flavor.
3) When ready to cook, place on pre-heated grill and sprinkle with Essence. Cook until juices run clear (for thin sandwich pieces, 4 minutes on each side is perfect)
