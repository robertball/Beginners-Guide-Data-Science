Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 beaten egg yolks
2 beaten egg white
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)

Directions:
Whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, vanilla, and egg yolks in a saucepan. Place over medium-low heat and gently cook until the mixture thickens, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, about 30 minutes. Pour into a heatproof serving dish and set aside.
Whip the egg whites with confectioners' sugar to stiff peaks (see Editor's Note). Spread meringue on top of milk mixture. Refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours. Sprinkle with cinnamon before serving, if desired.
