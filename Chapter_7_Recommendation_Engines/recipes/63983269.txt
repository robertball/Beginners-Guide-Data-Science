Ingredients:
Brine:
1 gallon cold water
1 cup Kosher salt
2 cups real Vermont maple syrup
Spray:
Â¾ apple cider filled spray bottle
4 tablespoon real Vermont maple syrup

Directions:
Take a large pot and put all of your brine ingredients in. Stir the brine for 2 minutes or until everything is well incorporated. Then, take your pork butt and put it in the brine for 2 hours and 45 minutes. While you are waiting for that to brine, soak your apple wood chips in warm water. Once the brine and the wood chips are finished, put your wood chips in the smoker, put your grill rack back on top and put your brined pork butt on the grill rack at 280 degrees. Take the spray bottle and spray the meat every 45 minutes. After 12 hours of cooking, making sure you spray the pork butt every 45 minutes, check the temperature with the thermometer and it should reach up to 195-200 degrees. If the pork butt reaches 195-200 degrees, take the pork butt out of the smoker, put it on a cutting board and cut or shred it.
