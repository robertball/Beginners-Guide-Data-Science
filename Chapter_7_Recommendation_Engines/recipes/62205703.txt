Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 (10 ounce) jar maraschino cherries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Beat butter and sugar.  Add eggs and vanilla and beat well.  Add dry ingredients and stir until smooth.
Roll into 1-inch balls about the size of a walnut (Keep them small or you'll lose the cherry!).  Place on ungreased cookie sheet.
Drain cherries and reserve juice.  Press center of each ball with thumb.  Place a cherry in indentation.
In a saucepan, heat condensed milk and chocolate chips until chips are melted.  Stir in 6 tablespoons of cherry juice.  Spoon about 1 teaspoon of mixture over each cherry and spread to cover cherry.  Bake for 10 minutes.
Drizzle additional frosting on cookies once they are removed from the oven.
