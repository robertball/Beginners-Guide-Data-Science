Ingredients:
Marinade
3 large shallots, about 8 ounces total, each peeled and quartered
3/4 cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
8 large garlic cloves, peeled
1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1-1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 boneless leg of lamb, 5 to 5-1/4 pounds, butterflied, excess fat, sinew, and silver skin removed
Vegetables
2 fennel bulbs (with fronds), about 1-1/4 pounds total
1 pound butternut squash, peeled, halved lengthwise, seeded, and cut crosswise into 1/3- to 1/2-inch slices
1 pound medium zucchini, trimmed, each cut lengthwise into 1/3- to 1/2-inch slices
2 large red bell peppers, each cut lengthwise into 8 wedges
45 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
Couscous
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
12 ounces finely chopped shallots (about 2 cups)
2 large garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1-1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 boxes (each 10 to 12 ounces) 5-minute plain couscous
3/4 cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves, coarsely chopped, divided

Directions:
Processor marinade ingredients into an almost smooth puree. Place lamb, opened flat, in large glass baking dish or on a sheet pan. Spread the marinade evenly all over both sides of the lamb. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours. Allow the lamb to stand at room temperature for 45 minutes to 1 hour before grilling (do not scrape the marinade off the lamb).
Cut off thick stalks, roots and fronds from fennel bulbs and discard. Cut each fennel bulb in half lengthwise and then cut into 1/3-inch slices. Combine all cut vegetables and toss with 1/4 cup oil, salt, and pepper, being careful not to break the vegetables.
Prepare grill for direct cooking over medium heat (350° to 450°F). Grill lamb, fat side down first, over direct medium heat, with lid closed as much as possible, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat registers 125° to 130°F, 30 to 45 minutes for medium rare, turning once after 20 minutes.
About 15 minutes before lamb is done, prepare the couscous. Heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Add shallots and garlic and sauté until golden and tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in cumin, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken broth and bring to boil. Stir in the couscous. Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand 5 to 10 minutes.
Remove lamb from the grill, tent with aluminum foil, and rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Maintain the heat of the grill.
While the meat is resting, grill the vegetables over direct medium heat, with the lid closed as much as possible, until they are tender and lightly charred on the outside, turning occasionally.
