Ingredients:
1 rack pork baby back ribs (cut into individual pcs 2 per)
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup ketchup
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup rum
1/2 cup chile sauce
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 dash ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut ribs into serving size portions, wrap in double thickness of foil, and bake for 3 hours. Unwrap, and drain drippings. (I usually freeze the drippings to use later in soups.) Place ribs in a large roasting pan.
In a bowl, mix together brown sugar, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, rum, chile sauce, garlic, mustard, and pepper. Coat ribs with sauce and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour, or refrigerate overnight.
Preheat grill for low- med heat. Position grate four inches above heat source.
Brush grill grate with oil. Place ribs on grill, and cook for 10 minutes, basting with marinade.
