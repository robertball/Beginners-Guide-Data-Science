1/2 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese, at room temperature
1 cup half-and-half
1/4 cup espresso

2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon vanilla bean paste

Directions:
Whisk mascarpone cheese, half-and-half, espresso, coffee-flavor liqueur, sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla bean paste gently in a bowl until smooth.
Divide mascarpone cheese mixture among ice pop molds. Cover and freeze until slightly firm, about 1 hour.
Insert ice pop sticks 2/3 of the way into the molds. Freeze until firm, about 4 hours more.
Run molds under warm water to release and pull out ice pops.
