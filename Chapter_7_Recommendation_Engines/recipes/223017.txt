Description: 
My mother has been making this cake for over 40 years and it is always a crowd pleaser! The ingredients are from the original recipe. I have had good success with substituting SplendaÂ® for half the sugar and using egg whites instead of the whole eggs. Frost, if desired. I use vanilla frosting and dust with cinnamon-sugar.
