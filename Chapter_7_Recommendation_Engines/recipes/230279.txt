Ingredients:
5 3/4 cups unsweetened shredded coconut
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract

Directions:
Place coconut in a bowl; add sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Mix well. Refrigerate batter for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet.
Loosely mold batter into 2-inch balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are evenly golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a sheet of waxed paper to cool completely.

Description: 
These scrumptious coconut macaroons are very simple to make and only use four ingredients. They are golden and just a little crispy on the outside, soft and chewy inside. Almond extract really brings out the flavor of the coconut. So divine and so easy! I often double this recipe around holiday time because I can't seem to make them fast enough for my coconut lovers!
