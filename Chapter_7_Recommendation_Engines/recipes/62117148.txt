Ingredients:
2 pounds pork meat, cut in large cubes
5-6 leeks, coarsely chopped
1 whole celery, chopped
1 medium carrot, chopped (optional)
1 large potato, cubed
1/4 cup virgin olive oil
salt and pepper
1 egg yolk
juice of 1 lemon

Directions:
Pour the olive oil in a casserole and quickly fry the meat at high temperature for about 8-10 minutes.
Reduce heat. Put the pork aside and in the same casserole stir-fry the vegetables until leeks become tender but not overcooked.
Add the pork, salt and pepper to taste and 3 glasses of water, just to cover the ingredients. Simmer for about 20 minutes.
When the food is ready, prepare the avgolemono sauce; in a bowl whisk the egg yolk with the lemon juice and  add from time to time tablespoons from the stock. Pour the sauce in the casserole.

Description: 
This recipe is very common in my country. Itâ€™s a rather easy way to cook pork in winter, flavored with celery. For a lighter dish, chicken can substitute for pork.
