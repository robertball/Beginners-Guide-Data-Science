Ingredients:
1 cup black beans, rinsed and slightly crushed
1 pound ground turkey
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup Japanese-style bread crumbs (panko)
1 egg
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix black beans, ground turkey, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, egg, and onion soup mix with your hands in a large bowl. Divide into 6 portions and shape into patties.
Cook on preheated grill until no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
