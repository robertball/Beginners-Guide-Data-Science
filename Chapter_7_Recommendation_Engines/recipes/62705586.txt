Ingredients:
2 cups pancake/waffle mix
3/4 cup milk
1 egg
3 tablespoons butter
2 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup pecans, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Place butter in 9x13 pan and place in oven while it's preheating.  Keep an eye on the butter to make sure it's just melting and not burning!
Mix together pancake mix, cinnamon, milk and egg until blended.  Set aside.
While butter is melting in pre-heating oven, peel, core and slice your apples.  When butter is melted, remove pan from oven and place apples in a layer on the bottom of pan.  Sprinkle brown sugar and pecans over apples.  Pour batter over apples.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes or until top springs back when touched.
