Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup raw sunflower seeds
8 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups fresh spinach leaves
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1-1/3 cups grated goat gouda cheese

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the quinoa, and cook until the quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain in a mesh strainer, and rinse until cold; set aside.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, stir in the sunflower seeds, and cook until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic, and cook until the garlic softens and the aroma mellows, about 2 minutes. Stir in the cooled quinoa and spinach; cook and stir until the quinoa is hot, and the spinach has wilted. Stir in the lemon juice, and all but a pinch of the cheese. Stir until the cheese has melted. Serve sprinkled with the remaining cheese.

Description: 
Quinoa is a very nutritious grain, similar to couscous, and this is one of my absolute favorite ways to fix it! It only takes about 20 minutes and has an amazing flavor and texture. Look for quinoa that is prewashed, as it is difficult to strain. Recipe makes 4 servings.Modified from: Cheesy Quinoa Pilaf with Spinach
