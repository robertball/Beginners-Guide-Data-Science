Ingredients:
3 Cups Cornbread Mix
1 cup water
1 cup canned pumpkin
1 egg
1 Tablespoon vanilla
2 Tablespoons Vegetable Oil
2 Tablespoons of sugar
1 Tablespoon Molasses
1 Tablespoon Pumpkin Pie Spice
Optional 2 Tablespoons of Oat Bran

Directions:
Stir all ingredients together until mixed thoroughly. Pour into a greased 1.5 quart loaf pan. Bake 350 degrees for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out of the center clean. Different sized pans or cupcake tins may be used, but cooking time will need to be adjusted.

Description: 
Use a premade cornbread mix, and add a few ingredients for a special fall twist that is healthier than traditional pumpkin bread. As the recipe is written, it is only slightly sweet (but adequate for my sweet tooth!) If you are wanting a sweeter bread, increase the molasses and sugar. As written, it is a perfect side for soup or chili.
