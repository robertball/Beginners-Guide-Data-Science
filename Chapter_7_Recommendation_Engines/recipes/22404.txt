Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup HERSHEY®'S Cocoa Powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (8 ounce) package HERSHEY®'S MINI KISSES™ Milk Chocolate Baking Pieces
1/3 cup milk
1 1/2 cups miniature marshmallows
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Prepare Chocolate Petal Crust:  Beat butter, sugar, egg and vanilla in large bowl until fluffy.  Stir together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt; beat into butter mixture.  Shape soft dough into two rolls, about 7-1/2 inches long.  Wrap each roll in wax paper or plastic wrap; refrigerate several hours or overnight.
Heat oven to 375 F.  Grease 9-inch pie plate.
Cut one roll into 1/8-inch-thick slices; edges touching, on bottom and up side of prepared pie plate.  (Spaces between slices of dough in crust fill in during baking.)
Bake 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool completely.  NOTE:  Remaining roll of dough may be frozen up to 6 weeks for later use.
For the Hershey's Chocolate Pie:  Microwave Mini  Kisses with milk in large microwave-safe bowl at HIGH (100%) 1 minute; stir until well blended.  Stir in marshmallows.  Microwave 30 seconds; stir.  If necessary, microwave an additional 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating until marshmallows are melted.  Cool to room temperature.
Beat whipping cream in medium bowl until stiff; carefully fold into chocolate mixture.  Spoon into prepared crust.  Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.  Cover; refrigerate leftover pie.
