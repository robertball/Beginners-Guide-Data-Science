Description: 
I customized this recipe by using healthy coconut oil (a good fat); Sucanat, an unrefined brown sugar that is pure dehydrated cane juice; and spelt flour (an ancient grain that lends a lightness not found in baked goods using all whole wheat flour.) These items are easily found at healthy markets like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and Better Health Markets.Modified from: Whole Wheat Banana Nut Bread
