Ingredients:
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 tablespoon paprika
6 (6 ounce) fillets salmon
olive oil
1 1/2 cups tomato-vegetable juice cocktail
1 tablespoon balsamic or cider vinegar
1/2 cup chopped tomatoes
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound mixed salad greens, rinsed and dried

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, allspice, cumin, white pepper, and paprika. Reserve 1 1/2 tablespoons of the mixture for the vinaigrette, and sprinkle remaining spice mixture over salmon fillets. Cover, and refrigerate for 6 hours.
Preheat grill for high heat.
Lightly oil grill grate, and spread a small amount of olive oil on salmon fillets. Cook salmon 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until easily flaked with a fork.
In a small bowl, mix together tomato-vegetable juice cocktail, vinegar, tomatoes, olive oil, and reserved spice mixture to make vinaigrette. Place salad greens in a large bowl, drizzle with vinaigrette, and toss to coat.
Divide greens among individual serving plates. Top each plate with a salmon fillet, and spoon any remaining vinaigrette over the salmon.
