Ingredients:
1/2 cup nonfat sour cream
1/2 cup nonfat mayonnaise
1 tablespoon wasabi powder
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and finely chopped
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
salt to taste

Directions:
In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream and mayonnaise. Mix in the wasabi powder, jalapeno pepper, vinegar and salt. Refrigerate for about 15 minutes to let the flavors develop. If you want to add more wasabi, add a little bit, and then refrigerate for about 5 minutes. The wasabi will get hotter upon sitting.

My husband and I wanted to come up with a zippy sauce to use with a variety of foods - raw veggies, deep-fried calamari, fish cakes, etc., etc.  This is a staple!
