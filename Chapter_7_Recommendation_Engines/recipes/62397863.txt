Ingredients:
1 cup long-grain white rice
3/4 cup milk
1 cube (1/2 cup) margarine or butter
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
4 chicken breasts (or 8-12 chicken tenders, or 1 cut up whole chicken)
1 (1.5 ounce) package dry onion soup mix

Directions:
Pour rice on bottom of greased 9x13 baking dish.
Pour milk over rice.
Slice butter over dish.
Spoon can of cream of mushroom soup over rice.
Place chicken on top.
Sprinkle dry onion soup mix over chicken and rice.
Cover with foil.  Bake at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. May require slightly less time for chicken breasts.  Long enough for rice to absorb moisture.  Rice will be 'crunchy' on the bottom.  Mix up and serve.  No Peeking till done!
