Ingredients:
1 teaspoon oil, or as needed
6 ounces round steak, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 cup onion, chopped
1 (32 fluid ounce) container beef broth
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon sriracha hot sauce, or more to taste
1 (8 ounce) package thin rice noodles, broken into pieces
1 cup diced carrots
1 cup sliced cabbage
1/2 green bell pepper, sliced
1/2 red bell pepper, sliced
1/2 cup diced celery

Directions:
Heat oil in a stock pot over medium heat and cook and stir steak until it begins to brown, about 2 minutes; season with onion powder and garlic powder. Stir chopped onion into steak mixture; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes.
Stir beef broth, brown sugar, soy sauce, ginger, and sriracha sauce into beef mixture; bring to a rolling boil. Reduce mixture to a simmer, and stir in rice noodles, carrots, cabbage, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and celery; cover and simmer on low, stirring occasionally, until rice noodles are tender, about 8 minutes.
