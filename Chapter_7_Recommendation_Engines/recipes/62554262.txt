Ingredients:
2 Tbsp Butter
1 Bay leaf
1.5 Tbsp Fresh Rosemary Minced or Sage Chiffonade
.25 Cup Brown Sugar, Packed
1 C Onion, Chopped Fine
1 Tbsp Cognac or Cointreau
1 Tbsp Fresh Lemon Juice
.5 Cup Fresh Orange Juice
.25 tsp Finely Ground Sea Salt
1 Large Country-Style Italian Loaf, about 1 Pound
1 Cup Dried Sour Cherries Soaked in 1 Cup Water

Directions:
Melt butter in a medium skillet.  Add the bay leaf and rosemary.  Reduce heat to medium and add the onion.  Saut√© until soft, and stir in sugar.  When the sugar has melted, add the liqueur and lemon and orange juice, water from the cherries and salt. Stir and cook until the liquid has reduced to about .5 Cups and it has reached a syrupy consistency, about 3 minutes.  Add the drained cherries and remove the bay leaf.
Remove the thicker parts of the crust from the loaf of bread.  Cut the bread into 1/2-inch cubes to make about 8 cups.  Place the bread in a large bowl.  Add .5 cup of the brown butter syrup, and toss to coat. Spread the bread in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake until golden and crispy on the outside and still chewy inside, turning occasionally, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Let cool.
