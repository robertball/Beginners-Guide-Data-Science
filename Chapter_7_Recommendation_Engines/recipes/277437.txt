Ingredients:
aluminum foil
1 cup butternut squash seeds or other hard squash seeds
olive oil
chili powder to taste
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Clean pumpkin seeds so there are no strings or pulp attached to them. Pat dry or let air dry in a strainer.
Spread seeds in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle seeds lightly with olive oil and stir to coat evenly. Sprinkle lightly with chili powder and sea salt.
Bake, stirring every 5 minutes, until just slightly golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool.

Description: 
Cooking up some winter squash? Stop tossing out the seeds. Seeds from butternut, spaghetti, acorn, and other hard squashes can be roasted into a crispy snack or salad topper, just like pumpkin seeds. Season with chili powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, or curry.
