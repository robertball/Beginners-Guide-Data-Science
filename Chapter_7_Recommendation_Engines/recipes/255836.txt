Ingredients:
3/4 cup warm water
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
3 tablespoons shortening
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided

Directions:
Stir water and brown sugar together in a small bowl. Sprinkle yeast evenly over the surface. Cover with a clean cloth and let stand until yeast softens and forms a creamy foam, about 7 minutes.
Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, shortening, and salt together in a large bowl until shortening is thoroughly incorporated. Pour in yeast mixture; mix with your hands or a wooden spoon until dough comes together.
Dust a flat work surface with flour. Knead dough until smooth and holding its shape.
Lightly grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Add dough; turn to coat with oil. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise until doubled, about 35 minutes.
Gently punch down dough to deflate. Dust your work surface with more flour. Roll dough out until it is 1/3-inch thick. Fold in half and roll out again. Repeat this process 4 times.
Fill a large baking pan with 1 inch water and place it on the bottom rack of the oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lightly grease a jelly roll pan with 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Cut dough into 9 pieces and place on the greased pan. Cover with a clean, damp cloth; let rise until puffy, about 25 minutes.
Bake in the preheated oven above the water until browned on top, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
One of my favorite things growing up was warm Haitian bread dipped in hot chocolate. It's not easy to find outside of New York or Florida, so this is my own taste of home.
