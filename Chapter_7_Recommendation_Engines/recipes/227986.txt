Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 pound boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 1-inch pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 cups water, or as needed to cover
1 (10 ounce) package frozen okra, thawed

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion until translucent, about 7 minutes. Mix in lamb, salt, and black pepper; cook and stir until lamb is lightly browned, 5 to 10 more minutes.
Stir in tomato sauce and water; season with salt and black pepper. Bring lamb mixture to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer lamb in sauce until very tender, at least 1 hour, adding more water as needed. Stir occasionally.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir okra into lamb mixture, adding more water if necessary, and bring to a boil. Spoon the bamia into a 2-quart baking dish and adjust salt and black pepper; cover dish with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until okra is tender, about 45 minutes; uncover for last 10 minutes of baking.
