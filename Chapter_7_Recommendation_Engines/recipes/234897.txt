Ingredients:
6 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 pound cooked ground beef
1 cup white sauce
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 pound shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. Mash potatoes using a potato masher or fork.
Stir ground beef and white sauce together in a bowl; spread into the prepared casserole dish. Layer corn over beef mixture.
Measure about 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese and set aside. Sprinkle the remaining Cheddar cheese over corn layer; top with mashed potatoes. Sprinkle reserved 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese over potatoes.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
My grandmother, Julia O'Malley (Nanny), always made this when I was growing up. It is neither Chinese, nor pie, so we don't know why it was called that - it's more like a shepherd's pie, but that's what it was called in our family. Believe it or not, this is great when you smush it all together and put ketchup on it! The kids love it!
