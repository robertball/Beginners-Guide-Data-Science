Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 (1 ounce) package dry ranch salad dressing mix
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup beer, or as needed
seasoned salt to taste
cayenne pepper to taste

Directions:
In a bowl, mash the cream cheese with the ranch dressing mix until thoroughly combined, then stir in the Cheddar cheese. Mix in beer, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you reach the desired consistency (add more for a thinner dip). Stir in the seasoned salt and cayenne pepper. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a GREAT alternative to chips and dip.  I take this everywhere and always get asked for the recipe.  It is awesome!  It is best served with mini-twist pretzels, but it's also great with veggies.
