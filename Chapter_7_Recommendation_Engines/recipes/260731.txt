1 tablespoon ground sweet paprika
1 teaspoon spicy chili powder
salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste

Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add potato and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in lentils. Pour in vegetable broth and simmer for 20 minutes. Add kidney beans, corn, and tomato puree. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
I like to serve soy yogurt with the chili, especially if it's too spicy. Leftovers taste great with noodles as pasta sauce.
