Ingredients:
4 cups Mann's Vegetable Medley
1 large red-skinned potato, finely chopped
1/4 cup green onions
1 tablespoon pimiento, diced
1 cup Cheddar cheese, sharp, shredded
5 eggs
1 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground
1/2 cup salsa (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a 9 inch square greased baking dish, arrange Mann's Vegetable Medley in a single layer. Top with even layers of potato, green onions, pimiento and cheese.
In a medium bowl, combine eggs, milk, salt and pepper; whisking to blend. Pour over vegetable mixture. Bake until the vegetables are crisp-tender and lightly browned on top, about 45 minutes. Insert a knife into the center of the torta. If the knife shows no evidence of uncooked egg, the torta is cooked thoroughly.
Let cool 5-10 minutes before cutting into squares. Serve hot, at room temperature or cold, with salsa as an accompaniment.
