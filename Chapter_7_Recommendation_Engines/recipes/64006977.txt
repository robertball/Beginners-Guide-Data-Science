Ingredients:
36 to 48 oz	bacon, diced
4 to 6 c	cooked ham, diced, and bones
3	        yellow onions, diced
16 oz	        baby carrots, diced
4 thick stalks	celery, sliced
½ tsp	        salt (or to taste)
¼ tsp	        pepper (or to taste)
½ tsp	        garlic granules
1 @ 28-oz can	tomato sauce
1 @ 28-oz can	crushed tomatoes
2 @ 15-oz cans	cannelloni beans & liquid
2 @ 15-oz cans	butter beans & liquid
2 @ 15-oz cans	white beans, drained
2 @ 15-oz cans	garbanzo beans, drained
2 @ 15-oz cans	kidney or red beans, drained
2 @ 15-oz cans	black beans, drained
46 oz	        chicken broth or stock

Directions:
Divide the diced bacon in half and sauté in two skillets over medium heat until crispy, draining frequently but reserving drippings (I use a colander in a Pyrex bowl).  Remove bacon to a 12-quart slow cooker or roaster oven.  Add the diced ham and ham bones, if any, to the cooker.
Divide the diced onions in half and, using 2-to-3 tbsp drippings per pan, sauté until browned around the edges; drain in a colander and place in cooker.
Add a bit more drippings to the skillets and sauté the carrots in one and the celery in the other with the salt and pepper until starting to brown (the celery will cook faster than the carrots); add the garlic granules and place in cooker.
Set the cooker to high (400-450º) and add the tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes and stir well.
Add the cannelloni and butter beans with their liquid to the cooker, and then add the remaining drained beans.  Add the broth and stir well.
Put the lid on the cooker and keep it on high until the soup starts to bubble, and then turn it to medium-low (300º) until soup is heated through.  Turn heat to low (200-250º) until ready to serve.

Description: 
Use any beans you prefer.  It sounds like a lot of bacon drippings, but remember you are making 12 quarts of soup.  You could use a healthier oil instead of drippings, but you would lose a lot of flavor.  Using two skillets cuts the browning prep time in half.
