Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 (15 ounce) can baked beans with pork
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup raisins (optional)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour five 16 ounce cans OR two 8 x 4 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, mix sugar, oil, eggs, and beans until smooth.
In a separate bowl combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and soda. Add to bean mixture, stirring just until combined. Stir in raisins and vanilla. Fill cans 2/3 full with batter, or divide batter into prepared loaf pans.
Place cans or pans on a baking sheet.  Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.  Cool completely on wire racks before removing bread from cans or pans.
