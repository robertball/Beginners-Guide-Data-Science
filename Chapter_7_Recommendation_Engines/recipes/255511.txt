Ingredients:
2 teaspoons unsalted butter, softened
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups white sugar
1/2 cup toasted walnuts
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 tablespoons butter
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1/2 banana, mashed
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 7x3-inch loaf pans with 2 teaspoons butter.
Mix flour, sugar, walnuts, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger together in a large bowl. Cube 2 tablespoons butter into the bowl.
Whisk pumpkin puree, vegetable oil, eggs, banana, and honey together in a bowl until smooth. Fold in flour mixture just until blended. Pour into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes; invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.
