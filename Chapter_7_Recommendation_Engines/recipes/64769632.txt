Ingredients:
8 ounces ground pork (butt)
8 ounces ground lamb (shoulder)
8 ounces ground beef (round)
5 ounces frozen spinach (thawed and drained)
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese (finely grated)
1 large egg
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Combine the pork, lamb, beef, spinach, cheese, egg, basil, parsley, garlic powder, salt, red pepper flakes, and 1/4 cup of the bread crumbs in a large mixing bowl. Using your hands, mix until all ingredients are well incorporated. Use immediately or place in refrigerator for up to 24 hours.
3. Place the remaining 1/4 cup of bread crumbs into a small bowl. Cover a scale with plastic wrap. Weigh meatballs into 1 1/2-ounce portions and place on a half sheet pan. Using clean hands, shape the meatballs into rounds, roll in the breadcrumbs and place the meatballs in miniature muffin tin cups. Cook for 20 minutes, or until golden and cooked through.
