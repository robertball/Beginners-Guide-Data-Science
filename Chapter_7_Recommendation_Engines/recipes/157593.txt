Ingredients:
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 (14 ounce) can thinly sliced bamboo shoots
2 tablespoons peanut oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 fresh red chile pepper, seeded and minced
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
3 ounces ground pork
1 teaspoon Shaoxing rice wine
salt to taste
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
2 teaspoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons chicken broth
3 green onions, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon sesame oil

Directions:
Heat one tablespoon peanut oil in a wok set over medium heat.  Add the bamboo shoots to the pan; stir-fry until dry and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove from wok and reserve.
Increase temperature to high, and pour in the remaining peanut oil. Quickly fry the garlic, red chile, and red pepper flakes in the hot oil until fragrant. Stir in the pork, and continue to stir-fry until it is cooked through. Pour in the wine; season with salt to taste.
Return the bamboo shoots to the wok, and heat until sizzly. Stir in the rice vinegar, soy sauce, chicken broth, and additional salt to taste. Cook and stir for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the flavor to penetrate the bamboo shoots. At the end of cooking, stir in green onions. Remove wok from heat; stir in sesame oil before serving.
