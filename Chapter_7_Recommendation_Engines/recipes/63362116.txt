Ingredients:
•1/2 cup white whole-wheat flour (see Note) or all-purpose flour
•1/2 cup low-fat milk
•2 large eggs
•2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
•1/2 teaspoon baking powder
•1/2 teaspoon salt
•1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
•2 cups fr corn (about 2 lrg ears) or frozen
•1/2 cup chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Whisk flour, milk, eggs, 1 tablespoon oil, baking powder, salt and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Stir in corn and basil.
Brush a large nonstick skillet lightly with some of the remaining 1 tablespoon oil; heat over medium heat until hot (but not smoking). Cook 4 cakes at a time, using about 1/4 cup batter for each, making them about 3 inches wide. Cook until the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, 1 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining oil and batter, making 10 cakes total. Reduce the heat as necessary to prevent burning.
