Ingredients:
1 bag mini-marshmellows
1 lb confectioner's sugar
1 tbsp water
Flavor extract (vanilla or almond)

Directions:
Place full bag of marshmellows in a large bowl. Add enough liquid to equal 1 tbsp (ie. if you use 1 tsp of vanilla, add enough water to bring the total volume up to 1 tbsp. 1 tbsp=3 tsp). Place bowl in microwave and heat on high for 15 seconds. Remove and stir contents. Continue until marshmallows are completely melted.
Slowly fold in confectioners' sugar. The mixture will stiffen to the point that you may need to work in final amount by hand.
Color with gel colors as needed.
Can be stored in air tight containers and used the following day.
