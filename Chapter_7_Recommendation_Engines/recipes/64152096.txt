Ingredients:
Pastry:
3 cups flour
1 TBSP baking powder
1 tsp salt
1 cup shortening
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup milk
Filling:
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/4 cup quick cooking tapioca
6 cups chopped rhubarb (about 8 large stalks)
Topping:
1/2 cup butter or margarine
3/4 cup sugar
2 TBSP milk
1/2 tsp vanilla extract (white is preferred)
1 cup slivered or sliced almonds

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder and salt; cut in shortening as for pie dough.  Mix eggs and milk.  Add to dry ingredients and stir with fork just until it stays together.  Add a little more milk, if necessary.  Shape into a ball and take approximately 2/3 for the bottom crust.  Roll pastry between sheets of waxed paper or roll directly into the bottom and up the sides of a 15 in X 10 in X 1 in pan with a small rolling pin.
Combine filling ingredients and pour over dough in pan.
Roll out remaining pastry and cut out 2 inch stars (or other interesting shapes).  Place stars over filling.
For the topping, in a saucepan, melt the butter.  Add sugar and milk.  Bring to a gentle boil and boil 2 -  3 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.  Pour over stars first, then rest of filling.  Sprinkle almonds on top,
Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Reduce heat to 300 degrees.  Bake 30 - 40 minutes longer or until golden brown.  Serve warm or cold.  Yield: 24 servings
