Description: 
I have always considered Shepherd's Pie to be the ultimate family  comfort food, especially prepared the way my mom always made it when I was growing up.  However, I took Mom's basic recipe, and modified it so that it is now worthy of being served to guests as well as my family.  I call it Love on a plate!
