Ingredients:
6 pounds pork spareribs, cut into serving-size pieces
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup molasses
1/3 cup vinegar
1/4 cup prepared mustard
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon instant coffee granules
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange ribs in a shallow roasting pan; season with salt and black pepper.
Bake ribs in preheated oven for 1 hour.
Mix molasses, vinegar, mustard, water, Worcestershire sauce, instant coffee granules, and hot pepper sauce together in a bowl. Brush generously over the ribs.
Continue baking ribs, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until the meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 1 additional hour.
