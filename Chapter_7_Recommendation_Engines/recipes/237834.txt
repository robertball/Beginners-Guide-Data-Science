Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water with the onion mixture until smooth; add sugar, parsley, basil, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel, and pepper. Stir the mixture, bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened and the seasonings have permeated the sauce, 1 hour to 90 minutes.
