Description: 
Each year, I look forward to tomato season, to make this delicious fresh-tomato pie. For Vegetarians, it may be made without the bacon, with great results.  However, using canned or hot-house tomatoes will significantly alter the flavor. Delicious side dish, or as a light dinner. I like to serve with a green salad and fresh multigrain bread.
