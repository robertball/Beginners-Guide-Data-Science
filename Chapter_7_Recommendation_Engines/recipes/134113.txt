Description: 
Calimocho, or kalimotxo, is a very popular Spanish cocktail that is served in many bars and prepared by Spanish youth during traditional 'botellon' parties.  Calimocho originated in the Basque region of Spain but has spread throughout the entire country and to many other parts of the world.  Coca-Cola is the 'authentic' cola for preparing calimocho, but any cola will work.
