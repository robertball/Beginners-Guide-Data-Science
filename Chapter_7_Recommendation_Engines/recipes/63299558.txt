Description: 
This is a wonderful way to use up the rhubarb in your garden without going to the trouble of making pie.  It is more of a savory oatmeal instead of sweet.  If sweetness is what you desire, add maple syrup instead of honey (brown sugar will also suffice).  My children love this for breakfast and get excited when I make it!
