Ingredients:
* 4 chicken breasts
* 1 cup cornstarch (or little more)
* 3 eggs (or more)
* salt and pepper
* 1/4 cup canola oil (or other oil)
Sauce:
* 3/4 cup honey
* 3/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 cup ketchup
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil (or other oil)
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 1 Tablespoon cornstarch
* Additional sesame seeds for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Cut chicken breast into bite-sized pieces and season with salt and pepper.
In separate bowls, place cornstarch in one bowl and the beaten eggs in another bowl. Dip chicken into cornstarch then coat in egg mixture (you could also put the chicken pieces in a zip lock bag of cornstarch  and shake to coat).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook until chicken is browned. Drain off all oil.
In a saucepan combine honey, soy sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil (or other oil), minced garlic, and 1 Tablespoon cornstarch. Cook over burner until desired thickness.
Pour sauce over chicken and bake for 15-20 minutes. Put sesame seeds in chicken mixture and stir in well. Top with sesame seeds. Enjoy!
