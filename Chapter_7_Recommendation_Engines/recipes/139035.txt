Ingredients:
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1 packet instant, banana-flavored oatmeal

Directions:
Whisk together egg, oil, and milk until smooth. Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt; add to egg mixture along with brown sugar, and oatmeal; stir until just combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or spoon the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.

Description: 
This recipe I made because I wanted to use up some instant banana oatmeal I had.  I don't use syrup on it because of the sweetness from the oatmeal and brown sugar.
