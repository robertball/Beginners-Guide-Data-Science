Ingredients:
Rice:
4 cups water
2 cups brown rice
salt
Beans:
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans
1 onion, chopped
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
1/2 lime, juiced
Mojo Cubano (Garlic Sauce):
4 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 white onion, sliced
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons orange juice
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin (optional)
Presentation:
1 cup grated Cheddar cheese
1 cup fresh salsa
1 cup sour cream, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Mix rice with water and a dash of salt in a 4-quart saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir, cover, reduce heat, and let simmer until tender, 40 to 45 minutes.
At the same time, drain most of the liquid from the beans and combine with onion and cayenne in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, 15 to 20 minutes. Add cilantro and lime juice, stir, and remove from heat.
Combine garlic and salt for sauce in a small bowl; mash together to form a paste. Add garlic paste to sliced onion, olive oil, lemon juice, orange juice, and cumin in an electric blender and process until smooth. Transfer to a small nonstick skillet and simmer, stirring regularly and taking care not to burn, for 5 minutes.
Layer 1 cup of rice, 2 to 3 tablespoons mojo Cubano, 3/4 cup black beans, a generous sprinkling of Cheddar cheese, salsa, and a dollop of sour cream in a large bowl. Repeat for each serving.

Description: 
Based on a local street vendor favorite. The tangy mojo Cubano (garlic sauce) makes all the difference in this tasty and filling recipe. Don't be intimidated by the number of separate preparations, as it all comes together while the brown rice cooks.
