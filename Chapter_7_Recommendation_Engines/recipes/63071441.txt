Ingredients:
2 cups (500g container) thick coconut yogurt (Liberte`s Mediterranean coconut yogurt)
1/2 cup ripe mashed banana
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tbsp coconut oil

Directions:
In a small pot on low heat, mix mashed banana with sugar and coconut oil and heat just until dissolved - Do not boil. Let cool down for a couple of minutes.
Transfer sweet liquid to a food processor and blend for a few seconds. Add coconut yogurt and blend until well combined, then transfer to a large-bottomed plastic container and let chill in the freezer.
Once the mixture starts to get hard on the edges, maybe after 30 minutes (depending on your freezer), transfer back to the food processor and blend for a few seconds, then transfer back to the container and to the freezer. Repeat this a couple more times as the mixture becomes harder and harder, about 4 times in total. Once you process it for the last time, transfer it to a freezer container you would like to store it in, covered, and keep frozen. Let the mixture become hard again before serving, but keep in mind that it`s best eaten the next day as it`s had the time to really settle. Enjoy!
