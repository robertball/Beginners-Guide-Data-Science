Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 pound fresh green beans, cut into 2 inch pieces
1/4 cup chicken broth
1/4 teaspoon salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.  Add sesame seeds.  When seeds start to darken, stir in green beans.  Cook, stirring, until the beans turn bright green.
Pour in chicken broth, salt and pepper.  Cover and cook until beans are tender-crisp, about 10 minutes.  Uncover and cook until liquid evaporates.

Description: 
I had always been indifferent to green beans... until I tried this recipe, given to me by a friend.  For such a simple dish, you will be surprised at how much flavor this has!  Broccoli is equally delicious prepared this way.
