Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup frozen strawberries, partially thawed (optional)
10 cups clean fresh snow
1/4 cup milk, or as needed

Directions:
Stir the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract together in a large bowl.
Place the  strawberries into a blender, and puree until almost smooth. Mix the strawberries into the condensed milk mixture until thoroughly combined.
With a large spoon, gently mix in the snow, about 1 cup at a time. Mix in the milk, 2 tablespoons at a time, until the snow ice cream is soft and holds its shape when spooned. Serve immediately; store leftover ice cream in an airtight container in the freezer.

Description: 
We always had snow ice cream as children and my Dad perfected the recipe over the years! Let the kids help as much as you can stand, because the little mess will be outweighed by the amazing memories you're making! Fun and delicious! Use frozen strawberries, blueberries, or peaches for optional fruit flavors.
