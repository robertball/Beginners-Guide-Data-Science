3 CUPS OF MILK

BEAT BOTH PUDDING PKGS AND CREAM CHEESE WITH MIXER AT MEDIUM SPEAD WITH  3 CUPS OF MILK TO A SOFT SET, THEN ADD 1 CUP (8 OZ) OF COOL WHIP, MIX INTO PUDDING SET ASIDE.  YOU WILL NEED A LARGE PLASTIC CONTAINER W/LID OR OTHER PAN W/LID (NEEDS TO BE AT LEAST APPROXIMATELY 13 X 9 PAN)  THEN START LAYERING, I USE ABOUT 1/3 CUP OF PUDDING MIXTURE ON BOTTOM, THEN A LAYER OF COOKIES ALL ON BOTTOM AND ONE LAYER AROUND THE SIDES, THEN LAYER OF SLICED BANANAS, THEN PUDDING THEN COOKIES, ETC.  FOR THE TOP LAYER USE THE REMANING WHIP TOPPING & A FEW COOKIES TO DECORATE.  REFRIGERATE UNTIL SET (AT LEAST 2 TO 3 HOURS â€“ BEST IF OVERNIGHT)
