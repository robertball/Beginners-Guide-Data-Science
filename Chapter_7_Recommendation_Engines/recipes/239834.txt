Ingredients:
1 baguette, cut into 3 sub-size portions and then sliced open lengthwise
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (8 ounce) can roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
2 tablespoons creamy goat cheese
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, or to taste
1/4 cup arugula
1/4 cup torn fresh basil leaves, or to taste

Directions:
Slice each baguette segment lengthwise. Brush the cut sides with olive oil. Toast in toaster to your preferred darkness, 2 to 4 minutes.
Heat red peppers in a saucepan over medium heat until hot, 2 to 3 minutes.
Spread thick layers of goat cheese onto the cut sides of each baguette piece. Spread red peppers onto 3 of the baguette pieces. Sprinkle balsamic vinegar over the red peppers; top with arugula and basil. Place remaining baguette segments atop the fillings to finish the sandwiches.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite healthy vegetarian sandwich recipes! The red peppers give it the bulk or 'meat' of the sandwich, the arugula and basil compliment the red pepper flavor beautifully, and the balsamic and goat cheese give it a little kick!
