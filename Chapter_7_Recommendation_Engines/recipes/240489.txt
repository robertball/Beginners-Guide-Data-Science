Ingredients:
pico de gallo:
3 tomatoes, diced
1 small onion, chopped
1 small jalapeno pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 lime, juiced, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups dry black-eyed peas
water to cover

Directions:
Mix tomatoes, onion, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, and garlic together in a bowl; add lime juice and salt and mix well. Refrigerate pico de gallo until flavors blend, at least 4 hours.
Place black-eyed peas in a stockpot and pour in enough water to cover by 1 inch; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until peas are tender, about 1 hour. Stir pico de gallo into peas.
