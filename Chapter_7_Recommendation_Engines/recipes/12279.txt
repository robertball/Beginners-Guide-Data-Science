Ingredients:
1 cup sliced fresh peaches
3/4 cup peeled, cored and sliced apple
3/4 cup peeled, cored and sliced pear
1/2 cup blueberries
1/2 cup pitted and sliced cherries
1/2 cup pitted and sliced plums
1 egg
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart baking dish.
Arrange the peaches, apple, pear, blueberries, cherries, and plums in the prepared baking dish. In a medium bowl, beat egg, sugar, and milk. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the egg mixture. Stir in vanilla and melted butter. Cover the fruit with the batter mixture.
Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Cobbler should be bubbly and lightly browned. Serve warm.

Description: 
Never use more than 1 quart of fruit. Only use fresh fruit for this recipe. Any variation will work! I usually do use sweetened peaches and lightly sugared berries, but this is optional. Serve warm with cream, ice cream, or whipped cream.
