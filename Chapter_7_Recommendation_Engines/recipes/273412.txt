Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 cups quinoa
4 cloves garlic, minced, divided
4 cups chicken broth
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
1 tablespoon chicken base (such as Better Than Bouillon® Roasted Chicken Base)
1 tablespoon vegetable base (such as Better Than Bouillon® Seasoned Vegetable Base)
1 head broccoli, chopped
2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons water, or as needed

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pot over medium heat. Add quinoa and 2 cloves of garlic; cook and stir until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth.
Reduce heat to low, cover, and let quinoa cook until no liquid remains, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in a skillet over medium heat. Mix chicken, remaining garlic, chicken base, and vegetable base together in a bowl. Add mixture to the hot oil in the skillet and cook until golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes.
Place broccoli and butter into a microwave-safe bowl; add just enough water to cover the bottom of the bowl. Cover and steam in the microwave until tender, about 8 minutes. Combine chicken mixture and broccoli with the quinoa until well mixed.
