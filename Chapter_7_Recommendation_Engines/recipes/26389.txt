Description: 
My mother was given this recipe by a friend years ago.  I've made it for many occasions...perfect for Super Bowl parties (Go Rams!) or taking to work. I have yet to prepare it without getting multiple requests for the recipe.  It's a great recipe to freeze or make ahead -- it tastes great the second day!
