Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1 egg
2 1/2 cups sliced fruit
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix flour, 1 tablespoon sugar and baking powder in a bowl. Cut in butter until mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Stir in 2 tablespoons whipping cream and 1 egg. Press in bottom of ungreased 9-inch square pan and arrange fruit over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes. While cake is baking, in a bowl, combine 1/2 cup whipping cream, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 egg. Beat well, and pour mixture over plums and bake an additional 20 to 30 minutes or until custard is set. Serve warm or cool. Store in refrigerator.

Description: 
This is a recipe I've had for years.  It's great served warm, but cooled to room temperature is good, too. Keep leftovers in the fridge, if you have any.Modified from: Plum Custard Kuchen
