Description: 
Originating in Hungary, Goulash is a soup or stew of meat, noodles and vegetables (especially potatoes), seasoned with paprika, and other spices. It is one of Hungary's national dishes. Here in America Goulash is cooked totally different than it's Hungarian counterpart. This is my moms recipe that my wife has cooked for the past 35 years. It does not have potatoes or paprika like they cook it in Hungary, but if you wanted to you can add it. I have had it both ways. I have seen this also made with garlic on the show The Chew
