Ingredients:
2-3 cups of fresh Pico De Gallo
16oz (1LB) of Velveeta cheese
1 (8oz) block of 1/3 less fat cream cheese
1(10oz) box of frozen spinach, defrosted and strained of all water.

Directions:
Cut velveeta and cream cheese into cubes and put in a microwave safe container. Heat up slowly making sure to stir it often so the cheese melts evenly and doesn't burn.  Defrost the spinach in the microwave and squeeze the spinach to ensure all the water is out of it, than add it to the cheese mixture. Make sure the spinach and cheese mixture is nice and warm than stir in the pico de gallo. Enjoy with chips.

Description: 
This is my replica of a Spinach Con Queso I use to eat at a Mexican restaurant back home in Arizona. It's a great cheesy dip to bring to any tailgate party, full of flavor and so simple. Use a fresh Pico De Gallo recipe it taste best when you eat it right after adding the pico de gallo. If it feels like to much spinach for you add more Velveeta, to much cheese add more spinach, you can't go wrong!
