Ingredients:
4 pounds beef chuck roast
1/2 cup margarine
1 tablespoon onion salt
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 (.75 ounce) packets dry brown gravy mix
5 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and diced
2 pounds carrots, peeled and diced
2 cups water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Lightly coat the beef chuck roast with margarine. Sprinkle onion salt, garlic salt, white and brown sugar and one package of gravy mix over the roast.
In a large roasting pan, spread a layer of potatoes and carrots on the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle 2/3 package of the gravy mix over the potato layer. Place the prepared roast on the bottom layer of potatoes and carrots. Surround the roast with the remaining potatoes and carrots, and sprinkle on the remaining gravy mix.  Add the remaining margarine and the water to the pan.
Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and continue baking for 2 hours and 15 minutes, or to desired doneness.
