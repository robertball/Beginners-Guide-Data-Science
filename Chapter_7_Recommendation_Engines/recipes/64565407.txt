Directions:
Saute onion, celery, cabbage and any other raw vegetables of choice in coconut oil until tender, adding garlic half way through.
Add cooked chicken and any leftover cooked vegetables you have. Heat just until warmed through.
Transfer to the VitaMix and add 2 C. of the stock, or however much fits. Run on high until everything is smooth. Return to the pan and add additional stock and heat through.
If you don't want to put it in the blender, cook everything until very tender and then use the immersion blender to make it smooth.
