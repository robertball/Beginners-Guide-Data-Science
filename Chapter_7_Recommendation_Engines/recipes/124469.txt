Description: 
My grandmother first made this gingerbread over 100 years ago. It was inexpensive, and the ingredients were always on hand. I remember that the kitchen smelled like heaven when Grandmother baked her gingerbread. The only thing better was when she took it out of the oven and served it with a generous topping of fresh whipped cream!
