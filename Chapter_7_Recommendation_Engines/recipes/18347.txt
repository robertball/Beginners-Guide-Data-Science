1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 cup milk
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 egg, beaten
1 cup frozen blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Sift flour, cornmeal, brown sugar, salt and baking powder together into a large bowl. Dredge the blueberries in the sifted ingredients.  In a small bowl, combine the milk, butter and egg. Stir the wet ingredients into the flour mixture just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin tins.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Let muffins sit for 10 minutes before removing from the pan.

Description: 
Blueberry muffins with the hearty flavor of cornmeal. Moist, rich, and heavenly! I'm happy to share my recipe with you. Fresh or frozen berries can be used, and if you like lots of berries, you can add as much as 1 cup additional berries to this recipe.
