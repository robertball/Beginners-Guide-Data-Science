Ingredients:
4 Boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 Tablespoons garlic powder
2 Tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground red pepper
4-6 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Preparation
Preheat broiler.
Combine the 5 dry ingredients in a large bowl. Add each chicken breast to bowl individually; toss to coat. The more seasoning on the chicken the spicier it will be; to reduce spiciness, just sprinkle ckicken with seasonings. Place chicken on a broiler pan (or baking dish) coated with cooking spray. Broil chicken 5 minutes on each side.
Put honey in small bowl, microwave for about 30 seconds to make honey more managable. Remove chicken from oven; brush  honey on one side of chicken. Broil 1 minute. Remove chicken from oven and turn over. Brush other side of chicken with remaining honey. Broil 1 additional minute or until chicken is done.

Description: 
This is a delicious and very simple recipe for chicken breasts that provides a kick, but then a little sweet to punch up the flavor. It's spicy, so be prepared. To reduce the spiciness, halve the dry ingredients and just sprinkle, to desired level, the chicken breasts instead of coating.
