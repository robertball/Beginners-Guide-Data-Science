Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 pound Italian sausage
4 carrots, quartered
1 large onion, quartered
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (30 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (30 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons dried oregano
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and Italian sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Chop carrots and onion in the food processor.
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir carrots, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir ground beef-sausage mixture, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, brown sugar, basil, black pepper, and cinnamon into onion mixture; simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have blended, about 30 minutes. Season with salt.

Description: 
This spaghetti sauce is 'secret' because it has loads of onions and carrots 'hidden' in it. My husband and kids love it - I quadruple the recipe every time and freeze the extra in zip-lock bags.
