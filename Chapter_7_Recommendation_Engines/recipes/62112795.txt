5 small Yellow Squash or mix Yellow and Zuchinni Squash, sliced or diced
4 ears of Sweet Corn, cut off the cob
1 onion, diced
1 large Green Bell Pepper, seeds removed and diced
1 mild or hot Banana Pepper , seeds removed and diced
2 fresh Tomatoes , scalded and peeled then diced
2 Tbls. Butter. or more if desired
1 Tbls. Olive Oil
fresh ground Pepper
1 tsp. Salt or to taste

Directions:
Melt butter and olive oil into a large skillet, add squash.corn,onion,peppers and stir until tender, add tomatoes, salt and pepper and cook and stir 4 minutes.
Optional: If you want to make this a full meal, brown Italian Sausagein a seperate skillet,(skins removed and crumbled, drain off fat) add with other ingred. This is good either way you serve it. with or without the meat. This would probably be great with Lima beans added, but I have not tried that, but I may next time I make it.
