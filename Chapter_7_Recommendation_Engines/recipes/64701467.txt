Ingredients:
2 cup flour
1/4 cup paprika
2 tbsp dried oregano
2 tsp chili powder
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp cayenne
1/2 tsp dry mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Oil a large enough pan to hold the chicken without overlaping. Set aside.
Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl or a plastic bag.  Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture. I use a plastic bag so I don't have to clean a bowl plus it seems to coat better.)
You can dip the chicken in an egg mixture or buttermilk before coating if you want but many times I just use the coating.
Put the coated chicken on the pan and place in preheated oven.  Cook for about 45 minutes or until nicely brown.  (The time it is in the oven depends on the temperature  of the raw chicken)
Take the chicken out of the pan and serve.
