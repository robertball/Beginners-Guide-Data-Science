Ingredients:
1 tablespoon brown sugar substitute
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
2 large egg whites
1/4 cup white sugar substitute
1 1/2 cups pecans
1 1/2 cups walnuts
1 1/2 cups almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Mix brown sugar substitute, cumin, cinnamon, salt, ground ginger, chili powder, and cloves together in a small bowl.
Beat egg whites and white sugar substitute together until the sugar dissolves completely.
Combine pecans, walnuts, and almonds together in a large bowl. Sprinkle brown sugar and spice mixture over the nut mixture; top with the egg white mixture. Fold the nuts until evenly coated; spread onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven, stirring every 20 minutes, until the nuts are golden brown, about 65 minutes. Cool nuts on baking sheet before storing in an air-tight container.
