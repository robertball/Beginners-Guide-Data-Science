Ingredients:
2 1/4  cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
Pinch of salt
1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons heavy cream
1/2 cup currants

Directions:
In a food processor bowl, add flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Pulse to blend. Add butter and pulse until it resembles oatmeal. Pour into a mixing bowl. Fold in heavy cream until it is just combined. (Do not over mix.) Fold in currants. Place dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap folding plastic over to completely cover dough. Shape dough into a 1-in thick disk and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375F. Unwrap dough and place on parchment paper or a silicon mat over a baking sheet. Cut dough vertically, horizontally and diagonally to create 8 wedges. Bake 12-15 minutes.
Variations: Dried cranberries, blueberries, or raisins can be substituted for currants.
