4 cups red potato chunks
2 (14 ounce) cans sauerkraut, drained and rinsed
2 1/2 pounds fresh Polish sausage, cut into 3 inch pieces
3 garlic cloves, minced

1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon caraway seed

Directions:
In a 5-qt. slow cooker, layer carrots, potatoes and sauerkraut. In a skillet, brown the sausage; transfer to the slow cooker (slow cooker will be full). Reserve 1 tablespoon drippings in a skillet; saute garlic until tender.
Gradually add wine or broth. Bring to a boil; stir to loosen browned bits. Stir in pepper and caraway. Pour over sausage. Cover and cook on low for 8-9 hours or until vegetables are tender and sausage is no longer pink.
