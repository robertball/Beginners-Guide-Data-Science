https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 pounds carrots, peeled, trimmed and halved if more than 1/2-inch thick
2 pounds parsnips, peeled, trimmed and halved if more than 1/2-inch thick
4 tablespoons butter or extra virgin olive oil
Kosher salt and black pepper
Freshly squeezed lemon juice
Chopped fresh parsley, dill, mint, basil or chervil leaves for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except lemon juice and garnish in a skillet with a cover; add a quarter cup of water. Bring to a boil, then cover and adjust heat so mixture simmers gently. Check every few minutes and add more water if necessary.
Cook until the vegetables are tender and the liquid is almost gone, about a half-hour. Uncover and boil off remaining liquid if necessary, then taste and adjust seasoning, adding lemon juice as needed. Garnish and serve hot, warm or at room temperature.

Description: 
In this simple side dish, carrots and parsnips are simmered in a few pats of butter and a splash of water until tender, then hit with a dash of lemon juice and a sprinkling of fresh herbs. Use the smallest carrots and parsnips you can find; the smaller, the sweeter.  From the New York Times Cooking
