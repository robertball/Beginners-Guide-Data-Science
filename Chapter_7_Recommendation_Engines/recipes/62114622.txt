Ingredients:
1 pound piece of ricotta cheese
Extra virgin olive oil
Sea salt and freshly ground pepper
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 a dried chili, crumbled
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 Tbsp butter
2 14 oz cans plum tomatoes
3 Tbsp balsamic vinegear
1/2 tsp sugar
1 pound pappardelle or other wide ribbon pasta
Handful of fresh basil, leaves torn
2 handfuls of freshly grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Rub the ricotta all over with the olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano and chili, place on a baking tray, and cook in the oven for 20-25 minutes until golden and firm.
In a pan, slowly fry the onion and garlic in the butter and a tsp of olive oil. Cook for 4 minutes, until softened. Add the tomatoes, simmer for about 15 minutes, then break the tomatoes up with a spoon. Add the balsamic vinegar and sugar and stir until well blended into a tomato sauce.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil and cook the pappardelle according to the package instructions. When cooked, drain and reserve some of the cooking water. Toss the pasta with the tomato sauce and add a little of the reserved water to loosen, if necessary.
Adjust the seasoning to taste and add most of the basil and parmesan cheese. Place into a warmed bowl, rip over some extra basil and grate over a little extra parmesan. Crumble the baked ricotta over the pasta and serve immediately.

Description: 
A simple, but very elegant pasta dish - perfect for an intimate dinner party.  I like to serve this with a tossed green salad, crusty buns and a glass of merlot.
