Description: 
My grandmother has always made this for holidays, Superbowl, etc. I had to call her for the recipe because I couldn't find any online that were exactly the way she does it. It disappears EVERY time! We always serve with Fritos corn chips, sometimes we omit the pecans because not everyone likes them.
