Ingredients:
1 pound bulk sausage (chorizo or regular)
2 T flour
1 egg
1 c fresh bread crumbs
6 hard boiled eggs, peeled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Place the 2 T of flour on a plate, set aside.
Beat the egg in a small bowl,set aside.
Place the bread crumbs in a pie plate,set aside.
Lightly butter a 13 x 9-inxh baking dish, set aside.
Divide the sausage into six equal portions. Flatten each portion into a patty roughly the size of an egg.
Press sausage patty around each hard boiled egg, covering the egg completely.
Roll each sausage-wrapped egg in the flour, dip the egg into the beaten egg then roll in the bread crumbs to completely cover.
Place eggs on the prepared baking dish.
Bake for 30 minutes, turning the eggs over halfway through the cooking time.
Let rest for 5-10 minutes then eat hot or let cool to room temperature. These eggs are very good eaten cold too.
**To reheat any eggs that have been refrigerated, place
egg(s)on a cookie sheet and put them in a cold oven. Turn the heat on to 400 degrees F and let them cook for 15 minutes. The eggs regain their crispy texture...

Description: 
A staple of Pub Grub in the UK, this updated version bakes the eggs instead of frying them. Experiment with the type of sausage you use - Chorizo is absolutely FANTASTIC for this recipe (but so is deer sausage, regular breakfast sausage as well as Italian). Serve with pickled beets and a beer for a great authentic meal.I have to make these for the holiday gathering at my father-in-law's house every year because of popular demmand but they make a great summer lunch too!
