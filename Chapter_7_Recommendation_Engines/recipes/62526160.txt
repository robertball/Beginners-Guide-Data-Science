Ingredients:
2 lbs lean ground beef
2 large onions, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 small carrots, chopped into small rounds
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 16 oz can diced tomatoes
3 cups beef broth
2 cups vegetable cocktail or tomato juice
2 cups water
2 bay leaves
1 tsp dried rosemary
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp worcestershire sauce
1 cup elbow macaroni or other short pasta
salt and pepper

Directions:
In a large soup pot, brown ground beef over medium-high heat until cooked, about 10 minutes. I add some water to the pot (about 1/4 cup) to make this easy.  Season with onion powder and garlic powder.
Add the chopped onions, celery, and carrots, and the minced garlic, saute a further few minutes.
Add the can of tomatoes, the beef broth, the water, the vegetable juice, the potatoes, and all of the seasonings.  Bring to a simmer and skim any foam from the top.  Cook, covered, over low-medium heat, for about 30 minutes or until veg is tender. Remove the bay leaves and discard.
Add the pasta, and continue to simmer for about 8 minutes.  Check the seasoning, add salt and pepper to taste.  Enjoy!
