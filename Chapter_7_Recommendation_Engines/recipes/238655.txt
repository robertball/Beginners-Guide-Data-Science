Description: 
This is a really great cucumber salad that's light and flavorful and makes a great starter! Tastes fine as it is, but can be salted and peppered to taste, if desired. Just remember to add all ingredients and mix before adding in the tomatoes, as they are extremely delicate and do not withstand stirring very well once they are cut.
