Ingredients:
1 cup Ghirardelli速 Dark Melting Wafers
24 bite-size pretzels (squares or twists)
12 baking caramels, unwrapped
1 teaspoon water
24 whole pecans
1/3 cup Ghirardelli White Melting Wafers

Directions:
Line a large rimmed baking sheet with non-stick parchment paper and set aside.
Melt Ghirardelli Dark Melting Wafers according to package directions. Using a 1 teaspoon measuring spoon, scoop 1 teaspoon of melted dark melting wafers onto prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining melted dark melting wafers until you have 24 small circles.
Gently place one pretzel on top of each circle of melted candy. Chill until firm. Remove from refrigerator.
Place unwrapped caramels and 1 teaspoon of water in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high for 30-45 seconds or until caramel is melted. Stir and allow to cool for 30 seconds. Using a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon, scoop 1/4 teaspoon amounts of melted caramel on top of each pretzel. Top each cluster with one whole pecan. Chill until firm.
Melt Ghirardelli White Melting Wafers according to package directions. Transfer to a zip top bag and cut off a very small amount of one corner of the bag, creating a piping bag. Drizzle melted white wafers over the clusters. Allow to set or chill until firm.
Store clusters in a cool, dry place.
