Ingredients:
2 large onions, cut into rings
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon salt
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Soak onion rings in a bowl of ice water for 1 hour; drain and pat dry with paper towels.
Whisk 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, milk, egg, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, and salt together in a bowl until smooth.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Dip onion rings in the batter, working in batches, until evenly coated and arrange in 1 layer on a plate.
Fry the battered onion rings, working in batches, until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer fried onion rings to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.

Description: 
These are great homemade onion rings that are batter-fried rather than having a bread crumb coating. They are addictive, so be careful!
