Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 cup whole grain sorghum
2 tomatoes, chopped
1 rib celery, chopped
1/2 small onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped cilantro, or to taste (optional)
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 cup light Italian salad dressing
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Combine water and sorghum in a small pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until sorghum is tender yet firm to the bite, about 1 hour. Drain any excess water and cool, about 10 minutes.
Transfer sorghum to a large bowl. Add tomatoes, celery, onion, cilantro, jalapeno, and garlic; toss to combine. Stir in Italian dressing and lemon juice. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill before serving, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
I love whole grains, but could find very few recipes with sorghum. I had some vegetables from the garden and decided to throw a few things together. It was delicious! Other grains and vegetables can be added depending on what you have on hand.
