Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 small onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), undrained
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 cup fresh spinach, or to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; saute onion until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir chickpeas with liquid from can, lemon juice, coriander, cumin, garam masala, and curry powder into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, until liquid is mostly evaporated and sauce is thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.
Stir spinach into sauce and simmer until wilted, about 5 more minutes.

Description: 
This version of chana masala uses spinach instead of tomatoes, like my favorite Indian restaurant makes. It is so easy to throw together, and pretty healthy to boot! A perfect meal on a cold winter night when served with naan and basmati rice.
