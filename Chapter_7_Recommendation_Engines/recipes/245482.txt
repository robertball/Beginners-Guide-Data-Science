1 tablespoon ground cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon ground jalapeno pepper
1 tablespoon ground habanero pepper
½ teaspoon dried oregano

12  chicken wings, thawed if frozen

Directions:
Combine cayenne pepper, jalapeno pepper, habanero pepper, oregano, salt, sugar, black pepper, and cinnamon in a small bowl; mix well to make dry rub.
Place chicken wings in a large resealable bag or container. Add dry rub mixture to wings; seal container and shake well until evenly distributed.
Preheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook the chicken wings on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until the chicken is well-browned and no longer pink, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
Dry rub for chicken wings to either bake or grill or fry. They go great with beer, blue cheese dressing and celery. I absolutely love spicy food so if you do too you are in for a treat! If they are too hot for you, milk will help with the heat.
