Ingredients:
2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
1 (3 pound) pork shoulder roast
1/2 (16 ounce) jar golden pepperoncini, undrained
2 teaspoons adobo sauce
1 yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic
1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves
water as needed

Directions:
Rub the Cajun seasoning into the pork shoulder; place in the bottom of a slow cooker. Pour the pepperoncini with the juice, and the adobo sauce over the pork. Top with the onion, garlic, and cilantro. Pour enough water into the slow cooker to cover the bottom half of the pork shoulder.
Cook on Low until the meat begins to fall apart, 6 to 8 hours. Shred meat with two forks inside the slow cooker before serving.

Description: 
This is not your bbq slow pulled pork. It really shows off the pork! Just a touch of adobo sauce gives the pork a nice smokiness. Pair with fresh condiments and corn tortillas! Super easy to make and oh so tasty. Serve with corn tortillas and your favorite condiments (i.e. lime, avocado, fresh cilantro, corn salsa, and queso fresco).
