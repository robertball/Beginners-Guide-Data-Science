Ingredients:
2 tbsps vegetable oil
1 lbs ground venison
3 large beefsteak-style tomatoes, chopped
2 large carrots, chopped
2 bell peppers, chopped
1 onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 6-oz. can tomato paste
12 oz cream-style ale
2 cups no-salt added chicken broth
2 cups water
1 15-oz. can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 tbsp molasses
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
2 bay leaves
1 tsp salt, or to taste
1/2 tsp black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
1. In a 6-quart Dutch oven, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add in ground venison and cook until browned, 5-7 minutes.
2. Add in onion, carrots, and bell pepper; cook 3 minutes or until onion is translucent. Mix in garlic and cook another 30 seconds. Stir in chili powder, paprika, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
3. Mix in tomato paste and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add in ale, stirring often, and cook an additional 2-3 minutes. Stir in chopped tomatoes and cook 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, water, molasses, and stir to combine. Add bay leaves and beans. Bring chili to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook an additional 30-45 minutes. Taste, adjust seasonings, and discard bay leaves before serving. Serve warm, topped with cheese, if desired.
Note: You can substitute a hot pepper for 1 of the bell peppers for a spicier chili.
Depending on the moisture content of your fresh tomatoes, you may need to add or subtract the amount of water added.
You can substitute whatever ground meat or beer you prefer.

Description: 
This chili came about when we had an over-abundance of produce from our garden. Fresh tomatoes, carrots, peppers, and onions make for a delicious chili!
