Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 large yellow onions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups water
2 (15-ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 (15-ounce) cans diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 bay leaves
3 Tablespoons soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 cups elbow macaroni, uncooked

Directions:
In a large Dutch oven, sauté the ground beef over medium-high heat until no pink remains.  Break up the meat while cooking.  Add onions and garlic and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes.
Add the 3 cups water, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, basil, marjoram, oregano, rosemary, sage, thyme, bay leaves, soy sauce, salt and pepper.  Stir well.  Cover and simmer for 15 to 25 minutes.
Add the macaroni, stir well, cover and simmer 25 minutes.
Remove from heat, remove the bay leaves and allow the mixture to rest about 30 minutes more before serving (this resting will make the spices pronounced).  Leftovers are even better the next day.
