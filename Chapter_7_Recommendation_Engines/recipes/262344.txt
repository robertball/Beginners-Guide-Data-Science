Ingredients:
1 (12.3 ounce) package light firm tofu, drained
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground thyme
1 teaspoon dried basil
2  eggs, beaten
1 cup seasoned bread crumbs, or as needed
4  hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Wrap tofu in paper towels and gently press out excess water. Chop finely. Place in a bowl and mash with a spatula or potato masher until smooth. Add salt, garlic powder, cumin, black pepper, thyme, and basil; mix evenly. Mix in eggs until combined. Pour in bread crumbs slowly and mix well. Form mixture into 4 patties.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in the hot oil until just browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Do not cook all the way through. Place patties on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until firm and browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool and serve on buns.

Description: 
Excellent alternative to hamburgers for a vegetarian or anyone looking to eat better. Doesn't even taste like tofu! Serve with sliced cheese, ketchup, mustard, mayo, tomato slices, lettuce, or any condiments of your choice! If desired, place cheese on patties 3 minutes prior to completion of cook time.
