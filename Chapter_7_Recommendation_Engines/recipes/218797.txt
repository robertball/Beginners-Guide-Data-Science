Ingredients:
2 tablespoons corn oil
1 extra large onion, thinly sliced
1 1/2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHotÂ®)
1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons tomato paste

Directions:
Heat the corn oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the hot sauce, yellow mustard, sugar, chili powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue to cook for about 5 minutes. Stir in the water and tomato paste; simmer until liquid has reduced, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I love the push cart hot dogs, mainly because of the onions they serve on top...so I mixed and matched many different ingredients until I came up with the perfect combination for this recipe! This tastes just like the kind of onions I often would get from my favorite hot dog stands!
