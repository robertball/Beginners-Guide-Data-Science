Ingredients:
3 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 Tablespoons light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup b utter, melted
3 cups milk (either heavy cream or even 2%)
10 slices of a hearty sandwich bread, toasted and cut into cubes
1 cup raisins
VANILLA SAUCE:
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1 Tablespoon all purpose flour
Dash cinnamon
1 large egg
2 Tablespoons butter
1 1/4 cup milk
Pinch of Salt
1 Tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine first 4 ingredients; stir in butter and milk.  Gently stir in bread and raisins.  Pour into a deep, buttered 2-quart baking dish. Bake at 375 degrees for 50-55 minutes, covering with foil after 30 minutes to prevent excessive browning. Let pudding stand 10 minutes before serving, warm with vanilla sauce.
For Sauce:
Whisk together the first 7 ingredients in a heavy saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly; about 10-12 minutes or until thickened and coats the back of a spoon.  Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Pour all of sauce over still warm bread pudding or serve separately for individual servings.

Description: 
We found this recipe tucked inside my mom's bible when going through her things. It has become a family tradition on the first snow day of the year and if that doesn't happen, which can be the case here in central Va, we know it'll be the featured dessert at Easter and anytime a comfort food is in order.
