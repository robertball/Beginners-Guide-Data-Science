Ingredients:
3 tablespoons peanut oil
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup unpopped popcorn
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 2 to 3 quart saucepan or pot with a lid set over medium-high heat. Pour in popcorn kernels and sprinkle enough salt to lightly cover the layer of kernels. Remember, you can always add more salt later. Add the butter to the pot and cover with the lid.
As soon as the kernels start to pop, shake the pan back and forth across the burner constantly until the popping slows down. As soon as the pops are about 2 seconds apart, remove from the heat and pour into a serving bowl. Taste, and season with additional salt if desired.

Description: 
With all of the artificial ingredients and disregard of our health in the store-bought microwave popcorn, I've been making homemade popcorn every weekend the old-fashioned way. I like to use peanut oil due to its high smoke point, but if you have allergies, then substitute vegetable oil.
