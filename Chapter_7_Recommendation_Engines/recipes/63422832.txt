Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2 Tbsp. sugar
2 Tbsp. shortening
1 tsp. salt
1 pkg. active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
1 egg, beaten
31/2 to 33/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
1. In small saucepan combine milk, sugar, shortening, and salt; heat to lukewarm (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F). In large bowl dissolve yeast in warm water. Add egg and milk mixture. Gradually stir in enough flour to make a soft dough. Turn out onto lightly floured surface; knead gently 2 to 3 minutes to make a smooth ball. (Knead in just enough remaining flour so dough is no longer sticky.) Place in greased bowl, turning once to grease surface. Cover and refrigerate 8 to 24 hours.
2. Punch dough down; turn out onto a lightly floured surface; allow to rest 10 minutes.
3. To shape rolls, roll or pat dough to a 10x8-inch rectangle about 3/4 inch thick. Cut in 2-1/2x1-inch strips. Lightly roll each strip and place in a greased 15x10x1-inch baking pan, leaving about 1/2 inch between each roll. Cover and let rise until nearly double in size (about 30 minutes).
4. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until golden and rolls sound hollow when lightly tapped. Remove from pan. Serve warm or cool. Makes about 32 rolls.
Test Kitchen Tip: To make rolls without chilling step: Prepare dough through step one but instead of chilling, cover dough and let rise in a warm place until double in size. Proceed with step 2.
Frozen Bread Dough Option: Thaw a 1-lb. loaf of frozen bread dough. Roll or pat to 10x5-inch rectangle. Cut into 2-1/2x1-inch strips.
Lightly roll each strip and place almost touching in a greased 9x9x2-inch pan. Cover and let rise until nearly double in size (about 30 minutes). Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or
until golden and rolls sound hollow when lightly tapped. Remove from pan. Serve warm or cool. Makes 20 rolls.
