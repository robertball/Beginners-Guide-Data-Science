Ingredients:
1/2 cup regular oats (not instant)
6 T whole wheat flour
1/4 cup Fiber One bran cereal (original)
1/4 cup Splenda No-Calorie Sweetener (granulated)
1/2 cup Gerber peaches (or another brand of pureed peaches found in the baby food aisle)
1/4 cup canned pure pumpkin
1/4 cup egg substitute
1 T golden raisins
1 T Ocean Spray Craisins (original)
2 T brown sugar (not packed)
2 T Coffee-mate Sugar Free French Vanilla powdered creamer
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Chop raisins and Craisins into small pieces. Set aside.
In a food processor or blender, grind Fiber One to a breadcrumb-like consistency.
In a large bowl combine oats, flour, Fiber One crumbs, Splenda, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt until mixed well.
In a medium bowl, dissolve powdered creamer in 2 tablespoons hot water. Add all other wet ingredients and stir until mixed well.
Add liquid mixture to dry ingredients and stir until completely blended. Slowly sprinkle chopped raisins and Craisins into the batter, making sure they don't all stick together.
Spray a large baking sheet with nonstick spray and spoon batter into 4 evenly spaced circles. Spread batter out a bit with the back of a spoon.
Bake in the oven for 12 to 14 minutes, until tops of treats are just slightly crispy. Allow to cool slightly on the sheet. Grab 'n go!
