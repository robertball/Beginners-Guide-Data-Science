Ingredients:
Marinade:
1/2 cup Kikkoman Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce
1/3 cup orange marmalade
1 teaspoon Kikkoman Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, or more to taste
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 pound (1 inch thick) beef top sirloin steak
1 summer squash, cut into 1-inch pieces*
1 medium red or green bell pepper, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces

Directions:
Cut beef steak into 1-1/4 inch pieces. Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl, stirring well. Reserve 2 tablespoons marinade. Place half of remaining marinade and beef in food safe plastic bag; turn to coat. Place remaining marinade, squash and bell pepper in another food-safe plastic bag. Close bags securely; refrigerate 30 minutes to 2 hours, turning occasionally.
Remove beef and vegetables from marinade; discard marinade. Alternately thread beef and vegetables evenly onto four 15-inch metal skewers.
Place kabobs on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, covered, 8 to 10 minutes (over medium heat on preheated gas grill, 9 to 11 minutes) for medium rare (145 degrees F) to medium (160 degrees F) doneness, turning occasionally and brushing kabobs generously with reserved 2 tablespoons of marinade.
