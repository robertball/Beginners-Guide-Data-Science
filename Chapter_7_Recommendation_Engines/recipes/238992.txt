Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pint fresh figs, quartered
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
4 cups fresh spinach
1/4 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion with a pinch of salt until lightly browned and caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Add figs and balsamic vinegar to onion; cook over medium heat until vinegar is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Season fig mixture with salt and pepper.
Spread spinach onto serving plates and top with fig mixture and Gorgonzola cheese.

Description: 
Surprisingly light but decadent-tasting salad. The balsamic reduction provides enough moisture so that no additional salad dressing is needed. Serves 2 entree-sized salads or 4 small appetizer salads.
