Image:

Ingredients:
- 125 gram flour
- 125 gram buckwheat flour
- 1 egg
- 250 ml milk
- about 250 ml water
- 15 gram fresh yeast
- 50 gram melted butter
- salt, in case of unsalted butter

Directions:
To bake poffertjes, you need a special poffertjes pan. I have used a blini's pan, others have used a danish "aebleskiver"pan or a "donutfactory".
Dissolve the yeast in 3 table spoons of luke warm milk. Mix the 2 types of flour. Make a batter of the flour, yeast, milk and water. The batter has to be slightly thick. . Stir in the salt, melted butter and egg. The batter needs to be luke warm. Put the batter aside in a warm place to rize for about 30 minutes.
Heat the pan and put some oil or butter in there to make sure the poffertjes don't stick to the pan. Put a little batter in each hole. When the top side of the poffertjes are almost dry, turn the poffertjes over to bake the other side. The poffertjes need to be light brown on each side.
You eat poffertjes with butter and icing suger, some liquor can also be added, depending on yr wishes.
