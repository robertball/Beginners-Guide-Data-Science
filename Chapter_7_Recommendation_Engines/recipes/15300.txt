Description: 
This cookie is incredible.  It's so rich and tasty.  I cannot tell how many times I get asked for this recipe.  Everyone loves it and it's easy to make.  These keep very well.  You can make dough ahead time and freeze it.  Defrost when ready to use and follow baking instructions.  Great cookie for the holidays.
