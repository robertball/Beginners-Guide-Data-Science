Ingredients:
Dry ingredients:
1-1/4 cup gluten free flour blend
1/4 cup ground flax seeds
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
pinch of salt
1/4 cup dried cranberries
Wet ingredients:
1-1/4 cup almond milk (either original or vanilla) or regular milk
1/4 cup melted butter or oil
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon honey
Toppings:
100% pure maple syrup
sliced bananas
crushed or chopped walnuts

Directions:
If flour is chunky, make sure to break it up with a fork or sift if you wish. Mix dry ingredients together in a large bowl.
Place wet ingredients in a bowl and whisk until well combined.
Add wet ingredients to dry and stir until combined.
Heat a frying pan or griddle on medium heat or until a drop of water 'sizzles and dances' when dropped. Pour a bit of batter in pan - when it starts to bubble, flip sides and cook a few minutes longer.
Serve with 100% pure maple syrup, sliced bananas and crushed walnuts.
