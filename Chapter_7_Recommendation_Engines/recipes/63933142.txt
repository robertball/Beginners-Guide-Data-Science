Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, palm shortening, or coconut oil
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1 cup fresh sourdoughstarter
2 bananas, mashed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Cream together the butter (or shortening or coconut oil), sugar, egg, and vanilla. Mix in the sourdough starter and mashed bananas.
In a separate bowl combine the flour, salt, and baking soda. Add the flour mixture to banana mixture and mix just until combined. Do not over-mix.
Pour the batter into a greased 9x5-inch bread pan. Bake at 350Â°F for 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool completely prior to slicing.
