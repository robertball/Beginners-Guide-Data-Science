Ingredients:
Five cans of beans, drained-any beans. I usually use a mix of dark and light kidney and black beans.
Two cans of diced tomatoes, not drained.
One onion
Three cloves garlic, minced.
Two tablespoons chili powder
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Dice the onions and saute them until translucent, about eight minutes. Add garlic and saute for another minute.
Add beans and tomatoes
Bring to a boil
Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer, uncovered, until most of the liquid has cooked out. Time will vary depending on amount of liquid.
Once it is at a desired consistency, cover and let simmer for another half an hour.
Add chili powder, salt, and pepper to taste. It won't be very spicy like this, so if you prefer it to have a kick, add more chili powder. Or some hot sauce.
Serve. Garnish with cheddar cheese and chopped onions, if you like.
For more variety, add diced peppers and celery. Saute them with the onions and continue as written.

A family favorite, this chili doesn't need to cook all day like some chilis and it's so easy and delicious. For added variety, serve as nachos.
