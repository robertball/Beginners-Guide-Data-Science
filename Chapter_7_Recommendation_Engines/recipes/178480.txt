Description: 
This is a wonderfully colorful cole slaw perfect for celebrating Mardi Gras or any other time. It is presented in the official colors of Mardi Gras: purple, green, and gold. The sauce is a perfect blend of sweet and tart, with a little cayenne pepper for bite. Do not dress the coleslaw ahead, or it will become soggy.
