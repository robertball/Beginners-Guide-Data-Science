Ingredients:
1/3 cup olive oil, divided
1/2 onion, minced, divided
6 cloves garlic, minced, divided
2 (8 ounce) packages seitan chunks
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
4 bay leaves
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat 1/2 of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/3 of the onion and 1/3 of the garlic and saute until onions become translucent, about 5 minutes. Add seitan chunks and cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
Place remaining onion and garlic, remaining olive oil, soy sauce, vinegar, bay leaves, and pepper in a saucepan over low heat; cook for 5 minutes. Add seitan mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, an additional 7 minutes.

Description: 
This is a take on the Filipino-style dish, chicken adobo and the closest attempt to the real thing that I'm told there is. For those that don't know about this dish, it is traditionally chicken sauteed with vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic. Serve over white rice.
