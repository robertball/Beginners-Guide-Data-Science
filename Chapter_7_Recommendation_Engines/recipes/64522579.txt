Ingredients:
12 graham crackers (4 3/4x2 1/2 inch)
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate  chips
1 cup (3-4 oz) walnuts, pecans or almonds, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Line a 15 x 10 x 1 inch baking pan with foil, leaving a 2" overhang at each end.
Line bottom of pan with graham crackers (it will be a tight fit).
Melt butter in saucepan over moderately low heat, then add brown sugar &  salt and cook, whisking until smooth and well combined, about 1-2 minutes.
Pour butter and sugar mixture over crackers, spreading evenly and bake in middle of oven until golden brown and bubbly ~ 10 minutes.
Scatter chocolate chips evenly over crackers and bake in oven until chips are soft, about 1-2 minutes.
Remove pan from oven and  gently spread chocolate evenly over crackers with spatula. Sprinkle nuts evenly over chocolate.
Cool crackers in pan for 30 minutes.
Place pan in freezer and freeze for 10-15 minutes.
Carefully lift crackers from pan by grasping both ends of foil, then peel foil from crackers. Break into pieces & serve.
Note: Store crackers chilled between wax paper for 2 weeks.  Can add additional topping such as coconut, toffee and mixed nuts.

Description: 
Years ago I worked in a hospital, the CEO's son worked as our intern and his mother would bring these in every week for us and we would devour them within minutes! Now I make them for my own family, they love them and rave about them!  Rich sweet chocolatey goodness that is very addictive, yet easy and quick to make. Enjoy!!
