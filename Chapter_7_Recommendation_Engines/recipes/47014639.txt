Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
2  1/2 cups grated zucchini
3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2  cups chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease or line two 12 cup and one 6 cup muffin tins with paper liners.
In a large bowl beat the eggs. Beat in the sugar and oil, vanilla, zucchini and stir well.
Stir together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Mix into wet ingredients just until moist.
Pour batter into prepared muffin tins filling 2/3 of the way full. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool in pans for 5 minutes. Remove from pan and let cool completely on a wire rack. Store loosely covered.
