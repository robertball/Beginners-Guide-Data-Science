Ingredients:
Chocolate Dino Teeth
1/4 cup melted coconut oil
2/3 cup cacao powder
4 tbsp maple syrup
Peanut Butter Mite Legs
1/2 cup coconut butter
1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
2 tablespoons maple syrup
Red Cape Frosting for Dipping
1/4 Cup Powdered Sugar
Drop of Red Food Dye or Drink Mix
1 or 2 Teaspoons of Water

Directions:
Mix together the ingredients for the Chocolate Dino Teeth.  Spread the mixture(which will be very thick) onto a piece of parchment paper so that it is about 1/2 inch thick.  Refrigerate until it is firm.  Cut into strips and mold into the shape of dinosaur teeth.  Put back in the refrigerator.
Mix together the ingredients for the Peanut Butter Mite Legs and warm over a double boiler until melted evenly.  Pour into a shallow pan and refrigerate until firm.  Cut into strips and role into the shape of mite legs.
Mix together the powdered sugar and dye.  Slowly add water and stir until the frosting is the desired thickness.
Once the Chocolate Dino Teeth and Peanut Butter Mite Legs are solidified, place them on a plate with the dipping sauce and snack away!
