Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1  yellow onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
4 large carrots, peeled and chopped
2 cups chopped spinach
2  chicken breasts
2 cups elbow macaroni
28 fluid ounces chicken stock
1 (14 ounce) can coconut cream
1 tablespoon sriracha hot sauce
1 tablespoon paprika
salt to taste

Directions:
Pour oil into the pot and add onion and garlic; turn to the "Saute" setting. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is tender, about 10 minutes.
Mix carrots and spinach into onion mixture; stir well. Lay chicken on top; add macaroni. Pour chicken stock and coconut cream over macaroni; add sriracha sauce, paprika, and salt.
Close lid and cook using the "Manual" setting on high until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Release pressure through manual release.
