Ingredients:
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into bite size chunks
1/2 onion, finely minced
2 tablespoons butter
3 cloves garlic, minced or grated
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
2 teaspoons curry powder
1-2 teaspoons curry paste ( I used Thai Red Curry Paste and 2 teaspoons)
2 tablespoons garam masala
1/2-1 teaspoon turmeric ( I used 1/2 since my family is not crazy about turmeric)
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (use less if you are not a spicy person)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk, regular or lite (I used regular), plus more if needed to thin the sauce
1/2 cup greek yogurt (I used 0%)
1/4 cup half and half or heavy cream
cooked white rice, for serving

Directions:
In a large glass measuring cup or bowl mix together the coconut milk, greek yogurt and cream.
Stir in the tomato paste, garlic, ginger and all the spices. Mix well.
Spray the inside of your crockpot bowl with cooking spray or grease with olive oil.
To the bowl sprinkle the onion over the bottom.
Add the chicken and then pour the coconut milk mixture over the chicken so the chicken is completely covered.
Add the butter and place the lid on the crockpot. Cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 6 to 8 hours. I like to stir mine once or twice during cooking, but it is not necessary.
When ready to serve taste and season with salt and pepper if desired. Serve over rice.
