Ingredients:
Shortbread Layer:
1 1/2 cups almond flour
1/4 cup grapeseed oil
3 tablespoons agave syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
Caramel Layer:
11 Medjool dates, pitted
1/4 cup hot water
1/4 cup almond butter
Chocolate Layer:
6 1/2 tablespoons raw cacao powder
1/3 cup coconut oil, melted
2 tablespoons agave syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper.
Mix almond flour, grapeseed oil, 3 tablespoons agave syrup, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl. Press evenly into the bottom of the loaf pan to create the crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until pale golden, about 20 minutes. Let cool.
Process dates into a paste in a food processor. Add hot water and almond butter; process until very smooth. Spread mixture evenly over the crust.
Whisk cacao powder, coconut oil, and agave syrup together in a bowl. Pour over date layer.
Refrigerate until cacao layer is firm, 8 hours to overnight. Cut into squares.

Description: 
Millionaire's shortbread bars traditionally have a bottom layer of shortbread cookie, a middle caramel layer, and a top chocolate layer. For my recipe, I made the cookie layer with almond flour to get a delicious nutty flavor. The middle layer is a caramel made mostly out of dates. Finally, I made the top chocolate out of cacao, coconut oil, and agave. Keep leftovers in the refrigerator.
