2/3 cup sugar snap peas, cut into bite-size pieces

2 cloves garlic, pressed
1 1/2 teaspoons ginger, minced

1 pound fresh Shanghai noodles
2 tablespoons peanut oil
2 cups vegetable broth
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon red curry paste
Flour as needed (optional)

Directions:
Heat peanut oil in a large wok. Add in broccoli, carrots, peas, green onions, garlic, ginger, peppers, and water chestnuts. Cook for 4-5 minutes over medium heat until carrots and broccoli are tender. Season with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, stir together the vegetable broth, soy sauce, and curry paste until smooth. Pour over vegetables in wok and add Shanghai noodles. Stir so all noodles are coated in sauce. Simmer the mixture over medium-low heat for 10 minutes or until sauce thickens a little. Stir in flour to thicken further if desired. Serve hot.
