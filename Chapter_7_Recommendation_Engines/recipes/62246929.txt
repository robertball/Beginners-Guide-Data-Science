Ingredients:
1 pound dried navy beans
5 cups chicken stock
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter
1 tablespoon minced garlic
3/4 cup diced onion
8-10 chopped jalapeno peppers (fresh)
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts (chopped)
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon chile powder
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 to 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 bunch cilantro leaves, chopped

Directions:
Rinse beans well, cover with cool water, and soak for 2 hours. Drain. Place beans in a large pot with chicken stock and bring to a boil over high heat.
In a pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, and chiles and saute for 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook until chicken is no longer pink. Add chicken mixture to pot with beans.
Add all the spice, and cilantro. Lower heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, for approximately 1 1/2 hours.

Description: 
I made this for a Chili-cookoff at church and won.  It is spicy, but very comforting at the same time. Make sure it suits your tastes, and really enjoy it. My family loves spice, so this is good for us. Oh, one caution, if you use canned jalapenos, it will be very, very spicy, using fresh peppers you can control the heat.
