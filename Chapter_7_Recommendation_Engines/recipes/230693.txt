3/4 cup quick-cooking oats
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 tablespoon pancake syrup
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1/3 cup raisins
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Mix buttermilk, oats, butter, eggs, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, syrup, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl; fold in raisins.
Oil a griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 5 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
