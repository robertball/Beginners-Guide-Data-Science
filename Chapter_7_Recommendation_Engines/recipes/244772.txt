Ingredients:
2 pounds ground turkey
1 1/2 cups fresh bread crumbs
1 1/2 cups chopped baby spinach
1/2 cup light Greek dressing
5 ounces feta cheese, cubed
1/4 large onion, finely chopped
1 egg
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine turkey, bread crumbs, spinach, Greek dressing, feta cheese, onion, egg, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; form into patties.
Cook turkey burgers on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
