Cake:
2 eggs
2/3 cup sugar
4 Tbsp pineapple juice
1tsp baking powder
2/3 cup flour
1/4 tsp salt
Topping:
1/4 cup butter (1/2 stick)

6 pineapple rings
6 maraschino cherries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large mixing bowl beat eggs, sugar, and pineapple juice. Beat for two minutes. In a separate bowl, combine dry ingredients (flour, salt, and baking powder.) Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and beat for two minutes. In a saucepan, melt butter and brown sugar until well combined. Spray muffin tin with non stick spray and then spoon a 1/6 of the butter mixture into the bottom. Layer on pineapple slice with a maraschino cherry in the center. Top with cake batter.
Bake for 25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Invert the muffin tin onto waxed paper. Perfect individual pineapple upside down cakes.
