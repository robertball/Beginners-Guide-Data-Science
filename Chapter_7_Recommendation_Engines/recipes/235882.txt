Ingredients:
1 teaspoon coconut oil, or more as needed
6 large bananas, sliced
6 eggs
3 tablespoons extra-virgin coconut oil
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Heat 1 teaspoon coconut oil on a griddle set to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) or a skillet over medium heat.
Place bananas in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add eggs, 3 tablespoons coconut oil, vanilla extract, salt, and baking soda; beat until batter is smooth and fluffy.
Gently ladle batter, about 1/4 cup per pancake, onto the hot griddle; sprinkle with cinnamon and arrange walnuts on each pancake. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 4 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more coconut oil between batches.

Description: 
My smallest loves pancakes but I hated to constantly make him those enriched flour and unhealthy pancakes. So as I entered my journey into paleo I discovered these absolutely heavenly pancakes and have modified the recipe to make them even more perfect. Now I don't have to feel like a bad mom when I make him his favorite almost everyday.
