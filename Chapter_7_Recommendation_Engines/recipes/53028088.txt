Ingredients:
1 large eggplant
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
This is a great base recipe, but I did do a few things differently. I first salted each piece of eggplant, let it sit for 30 minutes, drained and then rinsed each piece with water. This allows it to lose a lot of moisture so that the roasting gives it a very nice texture and consistency. Then I added basil, oregano and garlic powder to spice it up so that I can serve this with pasta and sauce. It is a delightful alternative to eggplant parm, and a lot healthier

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease.
Slice the eggplant in half lengthwise, then cut each half into quarters lengthwise. Cut each of those in half to make two shorter quarters. Place the eggplant onto the baking sheet with the skin side down. Brush each piece with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
Roast in the preheated oven until softened and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with lemon juice. Serve hot.
