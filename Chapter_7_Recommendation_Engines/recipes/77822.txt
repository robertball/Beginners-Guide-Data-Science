Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup shortening
3 cups sugar
5 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped black walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, shortening, and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing just until the yellow disappears. Combine the flour, baking powder, and cinnamon; stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the milk. Stir in the vanilla and walnuts, and pour into the prepared pan.
Bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until a knife or toothpick inserted into the crown comes out clean. Cool in the pan for about 15 minutes before turning out of the pan onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I got this recipe from an old Army mess hall sergeant who later became a chef down in Savannah, GA. This is a wonderful, different nut cake. It is equally good served warm or cold. This cake can be wrapped and frozen 3 to 5 months. Thaw, and if desired, reheat to serve.
