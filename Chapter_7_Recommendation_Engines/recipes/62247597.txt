Ingredients:
1 tsp. oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 tsp. dried basil
1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes
3/4 c. ricotta
1/4 tsp. salt
1 (10 oz) pkg. frozen chopped spinach, thawed & squeezed dry
2 oz. shredded provolone or Parmesan
7 Basic Crepes (recipe follows:)
---1/2 c. flour
---1/4 tsp. salt
---3/4 c. milk
---2 large egg whites
---1 large egg

Directions:
Make crepes:  Combine flour and salt in a bowl.  Combine milk, egg whites, and egg in a bowl; stir well with a whisk.  Gradually add to flour mix, stirring with whisk till smooth.
Heat an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Pour a scant 1/4 c. batter into pan; quickly tilt pan in all directions so batter covers pan with thin film.  Cook about 1 to 2 minutes.
Carefully lift the edge of the crepe with a spatula to test for doneness.    The underside should be lightly browned.  Turn crepe over and cook for 15 seconds.
Place crepe on a towel; cool.  Repeat, stacking crepes between wax paper layers.
Make Torte:  Saute garlic in hot oil 1 minute.  Add basil and tomatoes and bring to a boil.  Cook till most of the liquid evaporates, about 4 minutes.  Sp0on into a bowl; reserve 1/4 c.  Add ricotta, salt, and spinach to remaining tomato mixture; stir well.
Place 1 crepe in a 9-inch pie plate coated with cooking spray; top with 1/3 c.spinach mixture and 1 T. chese.  Repeat layers, ending with a crepe.  Spoon reserved 1/4 c. tomato mixture over top, and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Bake in preheated 425 degree oven till thoroughly heated.
