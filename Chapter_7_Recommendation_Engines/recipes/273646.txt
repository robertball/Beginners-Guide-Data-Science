Ingredients:
4 large russet potatoes, scrubbed
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
1 teaspoon Greek seasoning

Directions:
Pierce potatoes all over with a fork. Place potatoes in the microwave and cook until soft, about 15 minutes.
Mix lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and Greek seasoning together in a small bowl.
Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and score the flesh. Brush on the seasoned oil.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Place potatoes flesh-side down and grill until browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
