Ingredients:
1 pound fresh wax or green beans
6 bacon strips
1/4 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
Place beans in a saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, for 8 minutes or until crisp-tender.
Meanwhile, in a skillet or microwave, cook bacon until partially cooked, about 3 minutes; drain on paper towels. Drain beans; place about 12 beans on each bacon strip. Position one end of beans so they are nearly even; cut about 1/4 in. from that end so stalks will stand when served. Wrap bacon strip around beans; secure with a toothpick. Lay stalks flat on an ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle with onion powder. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until bacon is crisp.
