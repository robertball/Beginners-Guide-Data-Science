Ingredients:
14 1/2 ounces ziti pasta
1 medium onion, chopped
1 pound ground beef
2 (19 ounce) cans tomato-basil soup (such as ProgressoÂ®)
1 (12 ounce) can tomato paste
1/2 cup diced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup small curd cottage cheese, pureed
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
While the pasta is cooking, cook onion in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it starts to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ground beef and stir until beef is browned and onion is soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease and return skillet to medium-high heat.
Add tomato-basil soup, tomato paste, diced mushrooms, pureed cottage cheese, mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese to the skillet; stir until well mixed. Reduce heat to medium and cook until cheese is melted and mixture is heated through, about 5 minutes.
Drain pasta and return to the pot. Add the skillet mixture to the pasta; stir until well mixed. Transfer to a 11x13-inch baking pan. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and Cheddar cheese. Cover pan with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until all cheese is melted on the top, about 20 minutes.
