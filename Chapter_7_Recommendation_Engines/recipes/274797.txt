Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons almond extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups pitted sour cherries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Mix sugar, oil, and almond extract together in a large bowl until well blended.
Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in another bowl; stir into sugar mixture until combined. Beat in 1/2 of the cherries using an electric mixer until moistened. Fold in remaining cherries. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until brownies spring back when gently touched, 25 to 30 minutes.

I came up with this brownie recipe after being overwhelmed with cherries on our tree this year. It has the taste of a chocolate-covered cherry.
