Ingredients:
1 package frozen puff pastry
8 slices bacon
1/2 cup onion, finely chopped
2 cups fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 pound pork sausage meat
1 med. tomatoe, sliced
pepper to taste
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 F.
Remove puff pastry from freezer two hours before cooking time.  Cut a piece of brown paper to fit an edged cookie sheet/jellyroll pan.
Fry bacon until crisp; reserve fat, then cool and crumble the bacon.  Place in a bowl.  Fry onion and mushrooms in bacon fat over medium heat for 3-4 minutes, drain and add to bowl.
Add uncooked sausage meat to bowl and mix well.
Roll out puff pastry to fit the cookie sheet.  Place on brown paper sheet.
Spread the meat mixture down the middle of the pastry.  Place tomatoe slices along the top and sprinkle with pepper.
Cut exposed pastry on each LONG side into 1 inch wide strips(They will be about 3 inches deep). Fold each SHORT end up over the filling, then lay the strips from each long side over the top(to produce a braided effect).
Brush pastry with beaten egg.
Bake on brown paper and cookie sheet for 1 hour and 25 minutes.

Description: 
My mom has made this delicious sausage roll every Christmas morning for as long as I can remember.  It takes a bit of time to prepare, but the puff pastry on the outside is beautiful, and the pork sausage filling is moist and full of flavour!
