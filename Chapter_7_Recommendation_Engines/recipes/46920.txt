Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
1  onion, thinly sliced
1  green bell pepper, cut into strips
1  red bell pepper, cut into strips
2 cups fresh okra, cut into 1/2 inch slices
1  whole boneless, skinless chicken breast, cubed
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
1 pound whole cooked crawfish, peeled
¼ cup butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 cups milk
⅓ cup half-and-half cream
1 pinch salt
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese
⅓ cup chili powder
1 tablespoon ground paprika

Directions:
Spray a heavy bottom pot with cooking spray, and place over medium heat. Saute onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper and okra until soft. Season with a pinch of Cajun seasoning. Remove from pot, and set aside.
Coat pot with cooking spray (turn off flame while spraying), and return to medium high heat. Saute chicken until no longer pink, and juices run clear. Season with 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning. Stir in crawfish, and cook for 1 minute. Remove from pot, and set aside with vegetables.
Melt butter in pot on medium low heat. Whisk in flour until roux begins to bubble. Add milk, and whisk until smooth. Add half-and-half, and whisk continuously until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add a pinch of salt. Stir in shredded Cheddar cheese a little at a time until well incorporated. Add grated Romano cheese and whisk until incorporated. Season with chili powder and paprika. Stir in chicken, crawfish and vegetable mixture. Simmer for 5 minutes.
