Ingredients:
2 lbs leeks
1 lb ground beef
1 c white bread crumbs
2 eggs
Salt to taste
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tbsp butter
3/4 c water

Directions:
Remove tough outer leaves of the leeks and trim both ends. Wash, then boil in lightly salted water until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool. Chop very fine or put through food processor.
Mix beef with leeks, bread crumbs, and eggs in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well and shape into walnut-sized balls and fry in olive oil in a large skillet until brown all over.
Add lemon juice, butter, and water to skillet and bring to a boil. Simmer meatballs, covered, for 15-20 minutes or until well-cooked. If liquid becomes too thick or evaporates, add a little more water.
Serve over couscous with sour cream.
