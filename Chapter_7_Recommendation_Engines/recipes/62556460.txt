Ingredients:
7 oz. Fluff (marshmallow creme)
2/3 C evaporated milk
1 1/4 C white sugar
2 tbsp butter
1/4 tsp salt
2 C milk chocolate chips
1 C semisweet chocolate chips
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 C plus 2 tbsp chopped nuts, separated (optional)

Directions:
Combine Fluff, evaporated milk, sugar, butter, and salt in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Boil mixture 5 minutes, still stirring constantly, or until it reaches 235 degrees Fahrenheit, or passes the soft ball* test. Candy will have turned a more golden/tanned shade.
Remove from heat and add chocolate chips and vanilla, being careful not to let the chocolate chips hit the bottom of the pan and burn. If desired, add 1/2 cup chopped nuts.
Pour into greased 8x8 tin. Top with remaining nuts, if desired. Set in the refrigerator for 2 hours or until firm. Slice into 48 1-oz. squares.
