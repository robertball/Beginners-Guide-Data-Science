Ingredients:
Jack Daniels, about ½ to ¾ cup, or to taste (I ended up using 1 ½ cup)
½ cup chopped onion
4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
2 cups ketchup
1/3 cup vinegar
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
½ cup brown sugar, firmly packed
¾ cup molasses
½ teaspoon pepper
½ tablespoon salt
¼ cup tomato paste
1 teaspoon liquid smoke (I left it out since I was smoking)
½ teaspoon Tobasco sauce (I used Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce)

Directions:
Combine onion, garlic and Jack Daniels in a 3 quart saucepan. Saute until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add all remaining ingredients Bring to boil. Simmer uncovered until reduced and thickened, about 15-25 minutes. Add more Jack Daniels if a stronger flavor is desired.
