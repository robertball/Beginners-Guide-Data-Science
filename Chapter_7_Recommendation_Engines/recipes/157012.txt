Ingredients:
4 large potatoes, peeled and diced
2 bunches green onions, chopped
1 bunch fresh spinach leaves, chopped
1 bunch fresh sorrel, chopped
2 eggs, beaten
salt to taste
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon white vinegar, or to taste
1 cucumber, diced (optional)
2 hard-cooked eggs, diced (optional)
1/4 cup sour cream, for topping (optional)
2 sprigs fresh dill weed, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Fill a large pot about 3/4 full with water; bring to a boil. Add diced potatoes and cook until fork-tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in green onions and cook another 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in spinach and sorrel; cook another 2 to 3 minutes, or until wilted; remove from heat.
Pour the beaten eggs into the mixture in a slow and steady stream, stirring constantly, until the soup thickens. Season with salt, sugar, and vinegar to get a slightly sweet and tangy taste. Pour soup into a large bowl; allow soup to cool before transferring to the refrigerator to chill completely.
Garnish with any combination of cucumber, chopped egg, sour cream, and dill.

Description: 
This highly-unusual spring or summer soup was called 'green borscht' in my family. It's served chilled and is very pleasant and refreshing.
