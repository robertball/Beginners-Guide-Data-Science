Ingredients:
4 T Unsalted Butter
3 Large Yellow Onions, Sliced
2 tsp Salt
2 QT Beef Stock
1/2 C Sherry
1 Bunch Thyme tied with twine
2 Bay Leaves
Salt & Pepper to taste
1 Five Grain Baguette,1/2 inch slices
8 Oz Jarlsburg Cheese, Shredded

Directions:
Melt unsalted butter on medium heat in a dutch oven or large soup pot. Add sliced onions and sprinkle with 2 tsp salt. Cover and sweat the onions for 45 minutes, uncover and let liquid reduce for 15 minutes.
Add 1 qt beef stock and reduce liquid almost all the way down until the onions look a caramel brown approx 1 hour. Add second qt of beef stock, 1/2 C Sherry, Thyme,and Bay Leaves,simmer for 30 minutes.
While the soup simmers, arrange the baguette slices in single layer on baking sheet and bake in a 400-degree oven until the bread is dry, crisp, and golden at edges, about 10 minutes. Set aside.
Remove and discard herbs, then season with salt and pepper.
Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Set individual broiler-safe crocks on baking sheet and fill each with about 1 1/2 cups soup. Top each bowl with 1 or 2 baguette slices (do not overlap slices) and sprinkle evenly with Jarlsberg Cheese. Broil until cheese is melted and bubbly around edges, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Jarlsberg cheese made in Norway is known for its distinctive sweet and nutty taste and is a wonderful topper for onion soup. I like to serve this with my Petite Sirloin Steak Baguettes with Pink Mayo.
