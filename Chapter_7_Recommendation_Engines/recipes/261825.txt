Ingredients:
1 bunch collard greens
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup basmati rice
1 sweet onion, chopped, divided
1 tablespoon pine nuts
1 tablespoon minced garlic
3 cups water
1 cup plain meatless ground beef substitute
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste
Sauce:
1 cup ketchup
1 cup water
2 small tomatoes, diced
1 red bell pepper, minced
1/2 cup chopped prunes
1/2 cup raisins
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon lemon zest, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon mustard seeds

Directions:
Remove thick stems from the collard greens, leaving a v-shaped cut at the bottom of each leaf. Reserve 12 of the largest leaves. Shred the remaining greens.
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute rice and 1/2 the onion, stirring constantly, until fragrant but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add pine nuts and garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 3 cups water, ground beef substitute, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and dill. Reduce heat to medium; simmer until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cover with a lid and reduce heat to the lowest setting. Cook until filling is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir shredded collard greens and lemon juice into the filling. Remove from heat and let cool, uncovered.
Combine remaining 1/2 onion, ketchup, 1 cup water, tomatoes, red bell pepper, prunes, raisins, ginger, lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and mustard seeds in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Simmer until sauce is thick and coats a spoon evenly, 20 to 25 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place 1/3 to 1/2 cup of filling in the center of each leaf; fold sides over filling and roll. Arrange rolls seam-side down in a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Pour sauce on top.
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until rolls are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe was originally made by my Austrian great-grandmother with cabbage leaves, which are very tricky to prepare. I've since adapted it to make it vegan, for health reasons, and changed it to collard greens, which are far easier to prepare and more nutritious. Other than these changes, the rest remains the same and is a family favorite for a post-sledding day winter meal.
