Ingredients:
8 (5 ounce) salmon fillets, with skin
1/4 cup olive oil
4 plum tomatoes, diced
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/4 red onion, diced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
4 kalamata olives, sliced
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Brush each salmon fillet on all sides with olive oil and arrange into the bottom of a glass baking dish with the skin side facing down. Scatter the tomatoes, feta cheese, onion, basil, and olives over the fillets; sprinkle with the lemon juice.
Bake in the preheated oven until the salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.
