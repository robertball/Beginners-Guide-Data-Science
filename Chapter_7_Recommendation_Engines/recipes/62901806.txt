Ingredients:
Pic crust or filo dough
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk or half and half (or blend)
Salt & pepper
Pinch of fresh ground nutmeg
Your favorite filling (spinach, tomatoes, parmesan, scallions)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F.
When using the pie crust recipe, use a biscuit cutter or drinking glass to cut out circles to fit into your mini muffin tins.   When using filo dough, butter in between each layer, and cut into squares.
Oil muffin tins REALLY WELL before lining them with the crusts.
Whisk all ingredients together.
Place the fillings into the pie crusts in the muffin tins. This makes it easier to make sure for an even distribution, or even do some veg and some non-veg.
Pour the custard over the fillings.
Bake the mini quiches at 375 F (190C) for about 30 minutes, or until set.
Cool on a wire rack, and try not to eat them all before the guests arrive!
