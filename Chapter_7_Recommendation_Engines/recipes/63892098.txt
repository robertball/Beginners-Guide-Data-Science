Linguine and Clams Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 Cans Diced Clams
1 Can Baby Clams
1 14.5 oz Can Chicken Broth
1 14.5 oz Can Diced Tomatoes
2 Leaks Thinly Sliced
1 Head Chopped Garlic
4 Shallots Sliced
4 Tablespoons Capers
1 Cup White Wine
2 Tablespoons Olive Oil
Salt and Pepper to taste
1 lb Linguine

Directions:
Put a pot with 4 quarts of water on a high burner for the pasta and bring to a boil so it's ready.
In a large (5 qt) pot, saute leaks, shallots and garlic until softened (five minutes)
Add one cup white wine (I use cheap champagne because it's fun to drink) and capers, simmer for five minutes to cook down and release the caper-goodness.
Add the two cans of minced clams, one can of baby clams, one can of chicken broth and one can of diced tomatoes and bring to boil
Add pasta to boiling pot of water - boil for only five minutes
After five minutes, drain pasta and transfer to the pot with the clams and other ingredients. Stir well to mix everything and simmer for another five to seven minutes stirring occasionally to avoid sticking until the pasta is done cooking and you notice that a lot of the liquid has been absorbed.
Serve and Enjoy!
