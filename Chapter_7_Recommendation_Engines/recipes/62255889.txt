Description: 
When the tomato plants start to yeild a large volume of tomatoes, this is one of my  favorite summer meals! Tomatoes are stuffed with a flavorful tuna salad and cheese then baked.  We generally serve with a salad made with fresh from the garden veggies.  When it's too hot for a warm meal, they are just as good without baking.
