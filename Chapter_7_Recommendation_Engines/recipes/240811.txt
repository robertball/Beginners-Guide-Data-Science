Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
1 large red onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, chopped
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons maple syrup
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup walnuts
1/4 cup sweetened dried cranberries
2 ounces crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Combine Brussels sprouts, red onion, and garlic in a large bowl. Drizzle balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and maple syrup over the sprouts mixture and toss to coat. Season vegetables with salt and pepper; pour onto a baking sheet.
Roast vegetable mixture in preheated oven until the sprouts are tender and the sauce thickened, about 40 minutes.
Transfer vegetables and sauce to a large serving bowl; add walnuts, cranberries, and feta cheese and stir to mix.
