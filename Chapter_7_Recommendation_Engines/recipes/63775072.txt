Ingredients:
Patsy's Baked Potato Soup
( makes a stock pot full & is comfort food NOT healthy lol)
My mama taught me many things but cooking is one of those things I can tell people about;-) believe me, you probably don't want to know lol enjoy!!
In...gredients:
4 to 5 pounds potatoes peeled and cubed
I large onion diced
2 stalks celery diced
Half gallon milk ( use whole)
1 cup milk to make thickener
1 stick butter
4 table spoons corn starch
2 cups of potato starch water saved from the boiled potatoes
Salt & pepper to taste
Optional:
Cooked crumbled bacon
Cheddar cheese
Sour cream
Directions:
Boil potatoes, onion, and celery until tender but still firm. In measuring bowl mix corn starch with 1 cup of milk. Stir until smooth and set aside. While potatoes are cooking melt butter and heat half gallon of milk on medium high heat. I add my salt and pepper now before it gets thick. When milk and butter are heated to almost boiling ( do not bring to a boil) turn off heat and add corn starch mix stirring constantly with a wire wisk. Make sure to re-stir the corn starch mix before adding to the pot. When milk has reached your desired thickness remove from the burner. If it seems to thick add more milk. If not thick enough make more corn starch mix to add. This will continue to thicken after sitting for a while and the potato starch will also thicken it some. Drain some of the water off cooked potatoes keeping about 2 cups of starch in the pot. Add directly to soup mix in stock pot and stir. Add cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon and a dollop of sour cream to individual bowls of soup.See More
