Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour (such as Bob's Red MillÂ®)
2/3 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons xanthan gum
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup canned pumpkin
2 eggs, beaten
1/3 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, xanthan gum, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda together in a large mixing bowl. Beat pumpkin, eggs, and butter together in a separate bowl; add to flour mixture and beat until the mixture blends into a batter. Stir walnuts through the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
