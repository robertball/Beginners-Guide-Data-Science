Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package spice cake mix
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
3/4 cup water
2 eggs
1/3 cup canola oil
1/2 cup shredded carrot
1/3 cup chopped pecans (optional)
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt(R) pan.
In a bowl, mix together the cake mix, tomato soup, water, eggs, canola oil, carrot, and pecans until the mixture forms a smooth batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Invert the pan and turn the cake out onto a cooling rack; cool to room temperature.
In a bowl, mix together the confectioners' sugar with lemon juice until smooth; drizzle glaze over cake.
