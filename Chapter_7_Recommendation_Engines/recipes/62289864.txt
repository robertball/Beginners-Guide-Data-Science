Ingredients:
1 cup bread flour
1 cup wheat flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup raisins
ICING:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, sugar, cinnamon and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add milk and raisins; stir ONLY until combined. Turn dough onto a floured surface. Knead just until smooth, about 8 to 10 times. Roll to 3/4-in. thickness. Cut with a floured 2-1/2-in. round cutter; place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F for 11-13 minutes or until golden.
Meanwhile, combine the icing ingredients. Drizzle over warm biscuits.
