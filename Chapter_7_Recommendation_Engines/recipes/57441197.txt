Ingredients:
8 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted and sliced
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
3/4  cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 rolled oats
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and grease an 8 inch square baking dish.
Toss the peach slices in the almond extract and place in bottom of the baking dish.
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, brown sugar, oats, cinnamon, and salt. Cut the butter into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles crumbs.
Sprinkle the flour mixture in an even layer over the top of the peaches, and bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, until the peaches are bubbling and the topping is browned.
