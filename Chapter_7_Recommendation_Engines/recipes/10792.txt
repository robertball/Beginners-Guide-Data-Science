Ingredients:
1 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
3 eggs
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 1/2 cups dates, pitted and chopped
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup water
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Blend together shortening, 1 cup white sugar, and brown sugar.  Add eggs, vanilla, flour, salt, and soda.  Mix well, and set dough aside.
To Make Filling:  In a saucepan, combine dates, sugar, water and nuts.  Cook over medium heat until thick. Cool filling.  If necessary, add water until mixture can be spread easily on the dough.
Divide dough into 4 parts.  Roll out each piece on a floured surface to 1/2 inch thick.  Spread with cooled, not cold filling.  Roll up jelly-roll style.  Close ends and place rolls on cookie sheets.  Refrigerate until cold.
Slice chilled rolls, and bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes.
