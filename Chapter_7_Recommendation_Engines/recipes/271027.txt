Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 pounds baby Yukon Gold potatoes, halved
8 ounces baby bella mushrooms, halved
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 ounces sugar snap peas, ends and strings removed
1/2 white onion, minced
1/3 cup chopped green onion

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with cooking spray.
Combine potatoes, mushrooms, and melted butter in a bowl and toss to combine. Spread vegetables onto the prepared baking sheet and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
Roast in the preheated oven until cooked through and tender, about 45 minutes, turning every 15 minutes.
After vegetables have been roasting for 35 minutes, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add snap peas and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft and translucent and snap peas are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Combine roasted potato mixture and sauteed snap peas in a large bowl, sprinkle with green onions, and toss to combine.
