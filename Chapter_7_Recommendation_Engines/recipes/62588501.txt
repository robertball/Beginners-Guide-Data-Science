Ingredients:
Pkg. of pork tenderloin (2 in pkg.)
1 can cream of onion soup
1 can beef broth
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 clove garlic, crushed
Onion slices

Directions:
Place tenderloins in crock pot.  Mix next 4 ingredients and pour over pork.  Place onion slices on top.  Cover and cook on high 4-6 hours.  I cooked mine about 6 hrs. only because I was away from home :)  I think it was done sooner because it fell apart when I cut it but it melted in my mouth...YUM!

This is so easy and has a wonderful taste.  It's good re-heated and I even made sandwiches with the leftovers.
