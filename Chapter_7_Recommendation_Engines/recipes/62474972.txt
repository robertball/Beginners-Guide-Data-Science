Ingredients:
2 bunches of collards
4 big garlic cloves
2 tablespoons of olive oil
1/2 cup chicken or beef broth
1 tablespoon garlic powder

Directions:
Soak/Wash the greens twice and remove tough stem-ends. Run garlic through a press or mince. Heat olive oil in cast-iron skillet; add garlic and cook over low heat until garlic is slightly browned. Turn stove off. Meanwhile, chop greens into 1 inch wide slices. Do not dry greens; only shake off and add them to oil and garlic all at once and stir until all are coated with oil and garlic. Turn to lowest setting and add garlic powder and 1/2 cup broth; stir again and cover. Cook on low for 1/2 hour to 1 hour. Add more broth if needed to keep moist.
