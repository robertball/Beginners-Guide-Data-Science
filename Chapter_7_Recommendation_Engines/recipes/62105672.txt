Ingredients:
1½ cups elbow macaroni
2 pinches salt
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon salt
1½ cups milk
1½ cups shredded medium cheddar cheese

Directions:
Boil water in medium saucepan with 2 pinches of salt. Add macaroni and cook for 10 minutes.
While pasta is cooking, put a small saucepan on low heat and add flour, butter, and salt. Stir until combined and butter is starting to melt.
Turn up heat to medium high for butter mixture and add milk. Stir until milk thickens and bubbles. Slowly add cheese and stir until combined.
Pour cheese sauce over the top of the pasta. Mix so that all the pasta is covered in the sauce. Let the sauce thicken over the pasta for about 5 minutes. Enjoy!
