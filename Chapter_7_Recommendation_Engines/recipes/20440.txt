Ingredients:
1/3 cup chopped dried apricots
1/2 cup pineapple juice
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3/4 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Place apricots and pineapple juice in a small saucepan. Warm over medium heat until bubbling. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, mix together whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, ginger, coriander and cinnamon.
In a separate bowl, beat together egg, vegetable oil and buttermilk; combine with cooled apricot mixture. Gradually stir buttermilk/apricot mixture into flour mixture until blended. Pour batter into prepared 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let cool 5 minutes then loosen sides of loaf with a blunt knife. Remove from pan and allow to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
