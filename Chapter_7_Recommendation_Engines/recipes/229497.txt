Description: 
This is a low-fat favorite in my household. The bok choy and shiitake complement each other perfectly. Best of all, it's fast and easy to make! If you are watching your sodium intake, use low-sodium soy sauce. I also like to use the sauce from this dish as a dip for boiled eggs. Enjoy!
