Ingredients:
1 pound ground breakfast sausage
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
1 cup frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
5 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Brown breakfast sausage in a large skillet until no longer pink and the meat is crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease and set sausage aside.
Separate crescent roll dough into triangles and place into a 12-inch pizza pan with a rim, points toward the inside. Press the triangles together to join; pinch a 1 1/2-inch rim up the side of the pizza pan.
Spoon cooked sausage into the bottom of the crust. Spread hash browns over the sausage and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until smooth and pour the egg mixture over the cheese layer. Sprinkle pizza evenly with Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set and crust is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
