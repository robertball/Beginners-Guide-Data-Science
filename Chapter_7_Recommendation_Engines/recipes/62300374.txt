1½ cup Lentils
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1 tablespoon coriander
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon nutmeg
½ teaspoon clove
½ teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon paprika
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 tbsp Chili Powder
2 tbsp Olive Oil
2 tbsp Ginger Paste
3 cloves Garlic Minced
5 Tomatoes Pureed
2 tbsp white sugar
Salt to taste
6 tbsp Butter
1 cup Heavy Whipping Cream
Spritz of lime to taste

1. In a saucepan rinse and soak Lentils 1 hour then bring to boil for 5 minutes. Drain
2. Place Cumin, Turmeric, Coriander, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Clove, Allspice, Paprika, Bay Leaves, Cayenne Pepper, Black pepper and chili powder in skillet and heat on medium for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. This allows the oils in the spices to activate.

4. Add sugar and salt. Cook until thickened into pulpy sauce or about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is my adaptation of Dal Makhani. This is a slightly sweet and savory version opposed to the tomato-like versions out there, it reminds me more like what you would get in a restaurant. I use  sugar, cinnamon, and more butter than other offerings in my version.
