Ingredients:
FOR CHICKEN PATTIES
1 pound of Ground Chicken
2 tablespoons of crumbled blue cheese
2 cups of Panko Bread Crumbs or Bread Crumbs
3 tablespoons of finely diced onion
3 tablespoons of finely diced celery
1/2 cup of milk
1 teaspoon of garlic poweder
Salt and Pepper to Taste
4 Burger Buns (White or Whole Wheat)
4 tablespoons of olive oil
FOR MAYO and DIJON SAUCE
1 Cup of Mayonnaise
2 tablespoons of Dijon Mustard
Optional:
Lettuce and tomato for each burger

Directions:
1 - Mix together ground chicken, bread crumbs, milk, onion, celery, salt and pepper, and garlic powder.
2- Make into four patties.
3- Make and mix Mayo and Dijon sauce in a small bowl and set aside in fridge.
4- Heat skillet on medium heat and add 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil.
5- Cook burger patties on skillet for about 10-15 minutes. Flip every 5 minutes. Make sure they are cooked all the way through. They will develop a slight darker char (see picture) on the outside right away. Do not worry about this, this is due to the milk and will not affect the taste of the burger.
6- (optional) - Butter burger buns and toast on skillet (optional)
7- Spread mayo and dijon sauce on bun and serve!
