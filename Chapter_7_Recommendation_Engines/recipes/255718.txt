2 (8 ounce) packages low-fat cream cheese, at room temperature
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree

2 egg whites
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Combine cream cheese, pumpkin puree, sugar, egg whites, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves in a large bowl; mix until well blended and no lumps remain.
Place 1 vanilla wafer in the bottom of each lined cup. Scoop in batter using an ice cream scoop, filling each cup approximately 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 23 to 26 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 1 hour.
