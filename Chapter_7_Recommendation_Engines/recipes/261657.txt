Ingredients:
1 cup feta cheese
1 cup sour cream
1 cup cottage cheese
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese (such as PhiladelphiaÂ®), softened
2 eggs
1 (8 ounce) package phyllo dough
1 cup milk
1 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet lightly.
Mix feta cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese, cream cheese, and eggs together in a bowl. Whisk milk and oil together in a small bowl.
Brush milk-oil mixture over 3 sheets of phyllo dough and stack together. Place some of the cheese mixture in a straight line on one end of the dough. Roll up tightly to form a spiral shape. Transfer spiral to the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining milk-oil mixture, phyllo dough, and cheese mixture.
Bake burek in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
An Eastern European delicacy. Probably one of the most loved foods from the Balkans. There are two ways to create burek: with homemade dough or with phyllo dough (pre-made store-bought). In this recipe we will be using the pre-made phyllo dough. You can put potatoes, meat, spinach, boiled cabbage, or feta cheese inside! This one will be with feta cheese. Truly a tasty meal! And very easy to make! Eat with yogurt for authenticity.
