Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia
2 teaspoons butter
1/4 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning TM, or to taste
1 clove garlic, minced
1 lemon, sliced
1 (16 ounce) package frozen cauliflower with broccoli and red pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees F). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Place the tilapia fillets in the bottom of the baking dish and season with Old Bay seasoning. Melt butter with garlic in a small bowl in the microwave; pour over fish. Top each fillet with a slice or two of lemon. Arrange the frozen mixed vegetables around the fish, and season lightly with salt and pepper.
Cover the dish and bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until vegetables are tender and fish flakes easily with a fork.
