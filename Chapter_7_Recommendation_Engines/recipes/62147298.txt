Ingredients:
2-3 boneless skinless chicken breasts or 6-8 boneless skinless chicken breast tenders
2 cups complete pancake mix (the kind you just add water to)
1 cup of water
6-10 teaspoons of your favorite hot sauce (I use Franks)
1/2 cup flour
enough oil to fill a deep pot (veggie or peanut works best)

Directions:
Preheat oil to 350 degrees.
Slice chicken breasts or chicken tenders into bite size tenders
Mix pancake mix and water together (mixture should be thick) and then stir in hot sauce
Dredge the chicken pieces in flour and then into the pancake mixture
Carefully place in oil and fry until medium to dark golden brown turning pieces often (should take about 5-7 minutes)
Drain on papertowel.
Serve sprinkled lightly with hot sauce with ranch or blue cheese for dipping. OR serve with spicy ranch... 1/4 cup of ranch combined with 2-3 teaspoons of hot sauce. (gauge it to your liking)

Description: 
These chicken tenders fry up nice and golden brown but stay real moist and tender with a little bit of a kick. Why go to the bar? Stay at home and make your own bar food or leave out the hot sauce and use to make your favorite restaurant style sweet and sour chicken.
