Ingredients:
1/3 cup cumin seeds
3 tablespoons coriander seeds
3 (4 inch) cinnamon sticks, broken into pieces
5 bay leaves
1 teaspoon nutmeg
5 whole star anise pods
14 green cardamom pods
1 teaspoon whole cloves
1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
1 teaspoon ground mace

Directions:
Toast the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, nutmeg, anise pods, cardamom pods, cloves, peppercorns, and mace together in a skillet over medium heat until very fragrant and you can literally see the scent rising into the air, 8 to 12 minutes; remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
Pour the spice mixture into a grinder; grind into a fine powder. Store in an airtight container.

I needed this to make butter chicken one night and didn't have any on hand. I keep a well stocked spice cabinet and was able to come up with this.
