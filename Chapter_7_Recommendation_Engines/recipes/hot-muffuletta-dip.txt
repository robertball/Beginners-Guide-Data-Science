Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup cubed salami
1 (6 ounce) jar pitted green olives, drained
1/2 cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
1/2 cup drained giardiniera ( pickled carrots, cauliflower, celery, and hot peppers)
4 ounces provolone cheese, cubed
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix cream cheese, salami, olives, roasted red peppers, giardiniera, provolone cheese, and garlic together in a bowl; transfer to a 9-inch pie plate.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and hot, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle parsley over dip.

Description: 
A tasty hot-and-spicy spread worthy of your your Mardi Gras celebration. I find giardiniera in the store by the pickles and other jarred, pickled vegetables. I like to serve this with chunks of French or focaccia bread, but it's great with crackers or tortilla chips, too.
