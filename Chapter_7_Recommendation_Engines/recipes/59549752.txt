Ingredients:
3/4 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes w/basil, garlic and spices
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato sauce w/sausage
2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons dried parsley
12 lasagna noodles
16 ounces ricotta cheese
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a Dutch oven or heavy pot, cook ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato-sausage sauce. Season with fennel seeds, 1 tablespoon salt, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups  meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
