https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/460585.jpg
Ingredients:
3 Hass Avocados, halved, seeded and peeled
1 lime, juiced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 onion, diced
2 Roma tomatoes, diced
1 or 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (to your liking)
1 clove garlic, minced

Directions:
In a large bowl place the scooped avocado and lime juice, toss to coat. Mash in the ingredients, salt, cumin and cayenne pepper. (I use a potato masher) Then fold in the onions, tomatoes, cilantro and garlic.
Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour and then serve. This allows all the flavors to fuse together.
Note: I put clear plastic wrap over the guacamole in the bowl. Push out all the air and let it sit on the counter.

Description: 
Everytime I make this batch of Guacamole, I am left wanting more. Probably because it is gone before I can even get my hands on it.
