Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 egg whites
1 cup almond milk
3 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 teaspoons coconut sugar
1/2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup coconut flour
1/4 cup tapioca flour
1/2 cup almond flour
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon arrowroot flour, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Combine eggs, egg whites, almond milk, vanilla extract, coconut sugar, and gelatin in a large bowl.
Combine coconut flour, tapioca flour, almond flour, and salt in a separate bowl. Fold into the egg mixture and mix to just combine. Add arrowroot flour to thicken batter, if desired.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
I have been paleo for 3 months and discovered I couldn't enjoy my favorite breakfast...pancakes. I was temporarily relieved when I found paleo pancake recipes, but was disappointed because I couldn't find one that would stay together when flipped, didn't have a real eggy flavor, and had the mouthfeel of a real wheat pancake. I experimented and it took 4 tries, so I call it pancake V4. These pancakes stay together and have the texture you are looking for.
