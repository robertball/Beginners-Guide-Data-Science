Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package cinnamon swirl coffee cake mix
1 egg
1/2 cup shortening
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove the cinnamon packet from the mix and reserve 1/3 cup for later.
In a large bowl, stir together the cake mix, the rest of the packet of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and black pepper. Mix in the egg and shortening until a dough forms. Form dough into 1 inch balls, roll the balls in the reserved cinnamon packet and place them 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the tops are cracked and puffy. Let cookies set on cookie sheets until completely cool.
