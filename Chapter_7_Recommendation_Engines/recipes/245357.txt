Ingredients:
2 cups unsweetened grated coconut
1/2 cup coconut milk
1 1/3 cups white sugar
1 cup almond flour
1/4 cup unsweetened grated coconut, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Combine 2 cups grated coconut and coconut milk in a bowl until thoroughly mixed.
Place sugar in a saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring frequently, until sugar is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in coconut mixture and almond flour until well combined; cool until easily handled.
Roll coconut mixture into bite-size balls. Pour 1/4 cup grated coconut into a bowl and roll balls in coconut until coated. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 15 minutes.

Description: 
Recently I was planning an African-themed party, and I came across a recipe for a Somali snack by this name. The first version I tried was a little too sweet for me, and the consistency was all wrong for rolling into balls. I made some adjustments in the proportions, and this is the result. Yum!
