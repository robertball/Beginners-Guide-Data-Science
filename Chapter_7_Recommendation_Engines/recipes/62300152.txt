Ingredients:
6 whole green chilies (canned)
6 large wonton wrappers
6 strips of Monterey Jack Cheese
oil for frying

Directions:
Lay the chilies on paper towels and gently pat dry.
Insert a strip of cheese into each chili
Lay the chilies diagonally across the egg roll wrapper.
Moisten all four edges of the wrapper.  Fold the sides in and gently press to seal the ends.  Starting at the bottom fold the point up and gently press around the chili.  Roll up and seal the edges.
Set aside and heat about 1/2" of oil in a heavy pan.
When oil is hot, about 350, carefully lower the egg rolls into the hot oil.
They will cook fast.  When the first side in nice and brown gently flip over and brown the other side.
Work in small batches so the egg rolls don't touch while frying.
Serve warm.
