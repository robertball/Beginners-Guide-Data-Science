Ingredients:
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound shrimp, cut into bite-sized pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 shallot, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup dry white wine
1 bunch thick asparagus, shaved using a vegetable peeler
1 cup light cream
1 cup grated Parmesan-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Melt butter and oil together in a pan over medium heat. Add shrimp and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook and stir until mostly opaque, about 1 minute, then transfer shrimp to a bowl.
Add shallots and garlic to the pan and cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Add wine and cook until reduced by about 1/3, about 3 minutes more. Add shaved asparagus and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook until slightly tender, about 2 minutes. Add cream and bring to a slow simmer, about 5 minutes. Add Parmesan-Reggiano cheese and return cooked shrimp to the pan. Cook until heated through, about 1 minute more.
