Description: 
This was a cinch to make and seriously delicious. Casey and I both loved it and it will definitely be a regular on our menu. It made a fabulous meal served with Brussel Sprouts with Bacon and Walnuts. It was one of those meals that left me completely satisfied and happy but without feeling like I overdid it.
