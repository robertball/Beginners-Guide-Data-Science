Ingredients:
1/2 C butter
2 eggs
1/2 C sugar
1/2 C brown sugar
1/2 t vanilla extract
1/8 t salt
1/2 C flour
1 C chocolate chips, plus more for sprinkling
unbaked pie crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Melt butter in a cup in the microwave.  Set aside to cool while preparing the rest of the batter.
Beat the eggs with an electric mixer for 2-3 minutes so they're nice and frothy.
Beat in the sugars, vanilla extract and salt.  Beat in flour.  Check that the butter is warm rather that hot, then beat that in too.
Check that the batter is cool enough that the chocolate chip won't melt, then stir them in.
Pour into the pie crust and bake for 40 minutes.  Sprinkle top of pie with an additional handful of chocolate chips.
Bake about 10 minutes longer, or until top is lightly golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean.
Let pie cool for 20 minutes or so, then cut slices and enjoy!  Room temperature leftovers are almost as good, assuming the pie lasts that long!

Description: 
I made this for the first time today and couldn't be more pleased!  It tastes great, is easier and faster to make than cookies, doesn't make a ton, is cute, and has the texture of a soft, freshly baked chocolate chip cookie- even after it has cooled down.  My fiance and I ate over half of it in one evening.
