Ingredients:
3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
2 tablespoons melted butter
1-2 teaspoon butter
***for healthier substitute use: 1/2 cup whole wheat flour & 1/2 cup all purpose flour instead of the 1 cup of all purpose***

Directions:
1st, Let the egg & pre-measured milk sit out untill they reach room temp(approx 1 hour). Combine milk with vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to "sour".
**if you don't have time to get the milk and egg to room temp, some leave the finished batter out for 15 min before cooking.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk egg and butter into "soured" milk. Pour the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and whisk until lumps are gone.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side.
