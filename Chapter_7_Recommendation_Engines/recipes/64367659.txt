Description: 
This dish is designed to be a crowd pleaser.  We serve this dish in our feeding program feeding 50-100 people daily.  We use all-beef Kielbasa in order to accommodate the folks in our programs who do not eat pork.  We use a hotel pan, grease the pan with melted butter and double layer the ingredients, (potatoes, sausage, cheese x2), and top with heavy cream, (high-cal version).Modified from: Sausage-Potato Casserole
