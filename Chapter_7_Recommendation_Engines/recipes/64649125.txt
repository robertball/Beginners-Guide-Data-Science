Ingredients:
1/2 cup brown rice
1/2 cup fresh fava beans, shucked
1/4 diced red bell pepper
1/4 cup frozen peas
1/4 cup diced Swiss cheese
1/4 cup canned artichoke hearts, cut into quarters
1 hard boiled egg
2 tsp Dijon mustard
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 tsp white wine vinegar

2 Tbsp pomegranate seeds
1 tsp chia seeds
6 Cinnamon Energy Bites (AR recipe by Ali Shircliff)
1/4 cup frozen blueberries
2 Tbsp pomegranate seeds

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the rice. Cook for about 8 minutes. Add the fava beans, bell pepper, and peas. Cook until the rice is tender, about 6 minutes more.  Drain. Do not rinse.
Allow the rice to cool.
Mix together the cooled rice mixture, cheese, and artichoke hearts. Mix together the mustard, oil, and vinegar to make the dressing.  Toss the rice salad with the dressing and put it into a bento box with the hard boiled egg.
Add the yogurt in a separate compartment in the bento box. Top with 2 Tbsp pomegranate seeds, chia seeds, and diced avocado.
Add the energy bites to the bento box.
In a portable drink container, add the blueberries, two tbsp pomegranate seeds, and jasmine flowers. Add 500 ml of water. Allow to sit in the refrigerator overnight.
