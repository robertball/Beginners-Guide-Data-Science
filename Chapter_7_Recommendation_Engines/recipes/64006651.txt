Ingredients:
(260g) 2 cups all purpose unbleached flour; spoon into dry measuring cup & level to rim
(50g) ½ cup natural cocoa powder; measure & sift
2 tsp baking powder
½ tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
4 tablespoons buttermilk powder
1 1/4 cups water
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tsp  red gel food colouring
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter; can be cold from the refrigerator
(300g) 1½ cups sugar
4 large eggs; can be cold from the refrigerator

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 pure convect.
Grease and flour two 8" round cake pans.
In a bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, buttermilk powder, baking powder, baking soda & salt.  Set aside.
Mix the water together with the vanilla extract. Set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on low speed until soft. (If the butter is cold, it will warm quickly from the beaters – taking about 60 seconds).
Add the sugar in a steady stream at the side of the bowl. Increase speed to medium & beat for 2 minutes until light yellow & fluffy. Stop the mixer & scrape the side & bottom of the bowl with a large rubber spatula.
Add the food coloring to the butter/sugar mixture and beat until well blended.
With the mixer on low, add the eggs one at a time & beat for 20 seconds after each addition.
After the eggs have been added, increase the mixer speed to medium & beat the mixture for 2 minutes. (If the eggs are cold, the batter will curdle slightly. It’s ok. It will come together as the batter warms from the beaters.) The mixture will become fluffy & aerated.
With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture in 3 equal portions, alternating with the water  in 2 equal portions, beginning & ending with the flour. (If the milk is cold, the batter will curdle slightly. It’s ok. It will come together when you add the flour.)
Then, let the mixer run for 30 seconds on LOW. The batter will be thick & fluffy. STOP the mixer. Do NOT overmix.
Divide the batter equally into the prepared pans & lightly smooth their tops.
Bake the cake layers for 20-30 (25 minutes at 325 pure convect) minutes or until the top feels firm & gives slightly when touched. (If you insert a toothpick in the middle & remove it, it should have a few moist crumbs attached, but
