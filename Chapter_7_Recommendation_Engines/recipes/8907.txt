Ingredients:
6  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 cups sour cream
2 cups crushed cornflakes cereal
1 teaspoon Italian-style seasoning
6 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Rinse and trim the chicken breasts. Pat dry. Generously coat both sides of each breast with sour cream. Put crushed cornflake crumbs in a shallow plate or bowl and season to taste (I use onion salt and garlic salt). Dip the sour cream coated chicken in the seasoned cornflake crumbs.
Place coated chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Drizzle with melted butter/margarine and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
