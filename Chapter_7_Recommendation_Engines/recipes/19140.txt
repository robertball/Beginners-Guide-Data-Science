Ingredients:
2/3 cup orange zest
2 cups water
2 cups white sugar
2/3 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3 cups cranberries
1 tablespoon brandy

Directions:
In a small pan over medium heat, combine the orange zest and water.  Cover and bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  Drain, reserving zest and 1/3 cup liquid.
To the reserved liquid, add the sugar, orange juice and lemon juice.  Bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer for 3 minutes uncovered, stirring often.
Add cranberries; increase heat to medium-high and boil for about 10 minutes or until the cranberries have popped and a small spoonful of sauce sets on a cold plate.
Remove from heat, stir in brandy.  Pour into 4 1/2 pint jars leaving 1/2 inch space from top.  Place lids onto jars, and store in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.
