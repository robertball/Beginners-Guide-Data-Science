Ingredients:
2 pounds salmon fillet
1 cup orange juice
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh ginger root
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place orange juice in a small saucepan over medium low heat. Cook and stir 10 to 15 minutes, until reduced by about 1/2 and thickened. Remove from heat, and allow to cool.
Stir balsamic vinegar and ginger root into orange juice.
Line a medium baking dish with parchment paper. Place salmon fillet on paper, skin side down. Season with salt and pepper. Cover with 1/2 the orange juice mixture.
Bake salmon in the preheated oven 10 to 15 minutes. Brush with remaining marinade, and continue baking 10 to 15 minutes, until easily flaked with a fork.
