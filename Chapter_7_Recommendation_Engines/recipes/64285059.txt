4 eggs
4 ripe bananas (about 1 1/2 cups)
2/3 cup water

2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon real vanilla extract
1 teaspoon banana extract

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease bottom of two 8" or 9" inch loaf pans. Cream sugar and butter in a mixing bowl. Stir in eggs until blended. Add bananas and water; beat about 30 seconds. Stir in remaining ingredients just until moistened. Pour into pans. Bake until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, about an hour; cool 5 minutes in the pans; remove loaves from pan to a rack and then cool completely before slicing.

Description: 
This was a recipe that originally came from a vintage Betty Crocker cookbook.  Over time, my family has added some things and deleted others to make it ours.  (i.e. no nuts, added extracts to enhance flavors, increased bananas and water to up the moisture)  I love that it doesn't require shortening!  Very flavorful, very moist and really delicious.  It also freezes extremely well!
