Ingredients:
1 large head broccoli, cut into florets

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Toss broccoli and garlic together in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over the broccoli; toss to coat. Spread broccoli and garlic onto a baking sheet; season with onion powder, salt, and black pepper.
