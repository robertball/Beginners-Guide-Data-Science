Ingredients:
2 LARGE CANS, 6 SMALL CANS OR 2 BOXES OF CHICKEN, BEEF OR VEGETABLE STOCK/BROTH (YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN IF YOU HAVE IT FROZEN OR AVAILABLE.)
4 CUPS WATER
LEFTOVER COOKED MEATS
LEFTOVER COOKED VEGETABLES OR A COUPLE OF CANS OF VEGETABLES
LEFTOVER SOUPS (AS LONG AS THEY DON'T HAVE A CREAM BASE)
LITTLE BITS OF UNCOOKED VEGGIES OR FROZEN VEGGIES
BARLEY, RICE OR COOKED NOODLES (OR ALL THREE IF U LIKE BUT YOU WILL NEED MORE WATER/STOCK)
ALL INGREDIENTS ARE FLEXIBLE AND OPTIONAL EXCEPT THE STOCK AND WATER!!  I ALWAYS LIKE TO ADD ONION AND MUSHROOMS IF I HAVE THEM BUT THIS IS OPTIONAL, TOO.

Directions:
TURN BURNER ON TO MEDIUM HEAT
POUR STOCK INTO LARGE POT AND ADD WATER
CUT UP THE MEAT INTO CHUNKS AND ADD TO POT
CUT UP THE MEAT INTO CHUNKS AND ADD TO POT
IF USING A LEFTOVER SOUP POUR THAT IN POT
PUT IN THE FROZEN VEGETABLES AND UNCOOKED VEGETABLES (MAKE SURE UNCOOKED VEGGIES ARE CUT INTO CHUNKS)
BRING TO A BOIL AND THEN TURN DOWN, LET SIMMER AND SERVE WHEN IT TASTES READY AND ANY FRESH VEGGIES USED ARE COOKED.
IF USING BARLEY FOLLOW DIRECTIONS FROM MANUFACTURER
PUT IN RICE OR NOODLES JUST BEFORE YOU SERVE
