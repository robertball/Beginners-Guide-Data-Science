Ingredients:
2 ounces garlic butter
2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1/2 cup flour
4 ounces sliced mushrooms
20-25 capers
1 ounce lemon juice
2-3 ounce white wine
1-2 ounces chicken demi glace
Fresh fine chopped parsley
salt and pepper
Lemon slices

Directions:
Remove the centerline cartilage of the chicken breasts and and butterfly from the thick side to thin. Flatten gently with a meat hammer until evenly thin. Dredge in the flour.
Melt garlic butter over high heat, when it quits foaming and is fully clarified place chicken in the pan. Cook only until light gold and brown on each side, add salt and pepper when you flip it, the butter will allow the seasoning to stick. Remove from pan as soon as possible.
Immediatly add the mushrooms to the pan and stir them around to help them absorb the remaining butter, allow them to begin browning at the edges. Watch your heat!
Add capers, lemon juice and white wine. Stir together and allow to reduce by about 1/3. Add demi glace and incorporate. When all is mixed and bubbly adjust final seasoning. Mix the parsley in the sauce and serve over the chicken. Garnish with lemon slices.

Description: 
While many have heard of Veal Scallopini, most don't seem to know that you can make this Italian dish with most any meat, or even vegetables, the trick is to use a demi glace of the same style--i.e a venison demi if using deer. You can 'fake' a demi glace by reducing an apporpriate brown stock and adding slurry to thicken.
