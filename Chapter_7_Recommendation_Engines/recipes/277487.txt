Ingredients:
2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet baking chocolate
2 cups crushed chocolate wafers (such as Oreo®), filling discarded
1/4 cup corn syrup
1/4 cup dark rum
1/4 cup chocolate sprinkles, or as needed

Directions:
Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl for 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each interval, until almost melted, 1 to 3 minutes. Mix crushed wafers, corn syrup, and rum into melted chocolate until well combined.
Cover and refrigerate until firm enough to handle, about 1 hour.
Shape into 24 balls and roll in chocolate sprinkles to coat. Place in a covered container and refrigerate for 2 days to allow flavors to develop.

Description: 
I make this every Christmas and usually give them as gifts. They are an easy, no-bake treat and taste wonderful! Substitute orange juice for the non-alcoholic version of this.
