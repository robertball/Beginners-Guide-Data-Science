Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Olive Oil
2 cups chopped onion
2-4 cloves garlic-minced
1 pound lean ground beef
1 pound lean sausage
3 tablespoons flour
1 small can tomato paste
1/2 cup beef stock (can add up to 1 can) -optional
1/2 cup red cooking wine (or any red wine. can add up to 1 cup)
1 can sweet corn, drained
1 can peas, drained
1 can baby carrots, drained
mashed potatoes (I just use instant mashed potatoes & make 6 servings)
2 tablespoons butter
paprika
Seasoning mix;
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/2 teaspoon parsley
1 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (use less or omit if you don't like spice)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Heat olive oil in large, deep skillet over med heat.
Saute onions & garlic 2-3 minutes
Add meat; when it begins to brown, dust with flour & stir.
Sprinkle in 1/2 of seasoning mix, add tomato paste & stir.
Add wine & beef stock, bring mixture to a bubble.
Add remaining seasoning mix & all vegetables, stir well & let simmer 10 minutes.
Well mixture is simmering, prepare mashed potatoes (enough to cover mixture in 9x13 pan. I use a lot because my family loves the mashed potatoes).
Pour mixture into 9x13 glass baking dish & top with mashed potatoes. Rough potatoes with a fork for texture & browning while baking.
Dot 2T of butter over potatoes & sprinkle with paprika.
Bake 30 minutes, or until mixture is bubbly around edges & potatoes have browned a bit.

Description: 
This is one of my very favorite recipes from when I was a kid. It is my father's personal twist on a classic. It has become a regular request from my own children!  My favorite thing about this recipe is that almost everything in it can be left out, or replaced & it's still great! Shepherd's Pie is also widely known as the Left Overs casserole & that's why it is so versatile!
