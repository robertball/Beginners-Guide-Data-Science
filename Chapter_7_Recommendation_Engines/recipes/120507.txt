1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder

In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, combine the carrots, applesauce, egg substitute and oil; add to dry ingredients and stir until blended.  Stir in apricots.
Spoon into an 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan coated with nonstick cooking spray.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.  Combine confectioners' sugar and water; drizzle over bread.
