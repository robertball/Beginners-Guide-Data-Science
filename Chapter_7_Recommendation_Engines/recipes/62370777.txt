Description: 
My one birthday request from my grandmother would be Mayonnaise Cake with Fluffy frosting.  I adapted her recipe to get 24 cupcakes and frost them with either a simple vanilla or peanut butter frosting!  Hint:  To get moist cupcakes, make sure you use regular mayonnaise.  Low-fat or non-fat seems to make the cupcakes dry.
