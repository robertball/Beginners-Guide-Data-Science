Ingredients:
-2 large daikon radishes, cubed
-6 Tbsp kosher salt (this gets rinsed off after one day and is not eaten)
-3 Tbsp fresh ginger, minced
-6 cloves garlic, minced
-5 Tbsp Korean red pepper paste (Gotchujang)
-8 tsp Korean red pepper powder (Gotchukaru)
-2 Tbsp Fish Sauce (like in Thai cooking)
-7 tsp white sugar
-water

Directions:
-Take the cubed radish in a bowl, add the kosher salt, mix and then pour water just to level with the radish(let the water slide down the side of the bowl and not rinsing too much salt off).  Cover and set in a cool place overnight (approx 12-24 hours).
-Drain the radish and rinse it thoroughly.
-Add the ginger, garlic, red pepper paste, red pepper powder, fish sauce and sugar. Mix thoroughly.
-Place the mixture into a sealed container and put it in a cold place.  The ggakkdugi will be ready to eat anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks, depending on your preference.  The longer you wait, the more sour and developed the flavour becomes = yummy!
