Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 Tbsp Olive Oil
2-4 Tbsp Minced Garlic (Depending on your taste)
1 tsp Black Pepper
1 tsp Salt
1 1/2 c milk (I used 2%)
1/2 tsp cornstarch in cold water (To thicken)

Directions:
Simple.  Heat the oil on medium-low heat, toss in the garlic.  Saute for a few minutes to bring the flavor out, but don't burn!  Add the milk, salt and pepper.  Let it come to a nice boil, stirring frequently (you don't want the milk to scorch).  When it gets good and hot, stir in your water/cornstarch mix.  Stir constantly.  When it thickens to your like, that's it!
I made this up because I didn't have any butter for my kids' noodles, and dry noodles just won't do!  Pour over your favorite noodles (I used wide egg noodles) and enjoy!

Description: 
A simple pasta sauce using a few common ingredients.  It's kind of like an alfredo, but not nearly as rich - very light and flavorful.  And, it's pretty low fat, depending on what kind of milk you use.
