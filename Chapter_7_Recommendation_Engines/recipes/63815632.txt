Ingredients:
1 (12 oz) pkg al fresco Sundried Tomato Chicken Sausage
2 tbsp Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, divided in half
1 lb cherry tomatoes
1/4 cup sundried tomatoes, drain and reserve the oil
cup Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil
4 cloves garlic, cloves, fresh, minced
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
12 shrimp, large, peeled & deveined
cup parsley, fresh, chopped
1/4 tsp chili pepper, crushed red pepper, optional
(8 oz) Colavita Capellini D'Angelo

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 F. Toss the cherry tomatoes with 2 tbsp olive oil. Pour onto a rimmed cookie sheet and roast in the oven 10 - 15 minutes, or until they just begin to break down and are very soft. Remove from the oven, stir in the sun-dried tomatoes.
Heat the reserved oil from the sun-dried tomatoes in a skillet, add the sausage and cook until browned on all sides, remove and slice on the diagonal.
Meanwhile, heat cup olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the garlic along with salt and pepper, simmer slowly, for about 5 minutes.
Add the shrimp and allow to "poach" in the olive oil, turning once, until just cooked through. Add a dash or two of red pepper flakes, if desired. Stir in the parsley.
Add the sausage along with the tomatoes and any accumulated juices, stir gently to combine; cook until heated through.
Cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain well; divide between four warmed wide bowls, top with the sausage and shrimp mixture. Serve immediately.
