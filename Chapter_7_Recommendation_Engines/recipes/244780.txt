Description: 
Quick and easy! 2 ingredients + 25 minutes = yummy.  You may use pre-made pesto from the store, or you can make your own (preferred) using one of the recipes on this site; try the one titled 'Easy Pesto'. A great new way to use all that basil in the garden! Serve with toasted slices of French bread.
