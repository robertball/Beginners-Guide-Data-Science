Ingredients:
4 cups water
1 cup uncooked wild rice
salt to taste
1 medium head radicchio, cut into wedges
2 large plums, pitted and cut into wedges
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
salt to taste
1 ounce crumbled goat cheese, or more to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil, or to taste
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste
1 teaspoon aged balsamic vinegar, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring water, wild rice, and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Drain any excess liquid, fluff rice with a fork, and cook uncovered 5 minutes more. Set aside.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place radicchio and plum wedges on skewers. Coat in 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt.
Grill skewers on the preheated grill just until slightly charred, 1 to 3 minutes per side.
Let radicchio and plums cool slightly, about 2 minutes. Slice radicchio into smaller, bite-sized pieces and arrange with plums on a plate. Sprinkle cooked wild rice on top and add goat cheese, basil, thyme, remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper.
