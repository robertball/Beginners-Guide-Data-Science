Ingredients:
Crust:
26-30 vanilla wafers
4 tbsp butter
Filling:
4 packages cream cheese
1 cup sugar
3 tbsp all-purpose flour
1 tsp lemon zest
4 eggs
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 can cherry or blueberry pie filling (optional)

Directions:
Bring all ingredients to room temperature before baking.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place vanilla wafers in a bag and crush into fine crumbs. Melt 3 tbsp of butter and mix with wafer crumbs.
Melt 1 tbsp of butter and brush bottom and sides of springform pan.  Add crumb mixture to bottom of pan.  Press into pan and bake 8 minutes.
While crust is baking, place cream cheese, sugar, flour, lemon zest, and juice in a large bowl and mix at medium speed for 3 minutes.  Add eggs and mix at low speed for 2 minutes.  Blend in sour cream and vanilla extract by hand.
Pour filling into crust.  Bake at 325 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until center area appears nearly set when gently shaken.  To prevent overbaking, do not cook until this area is set.  It will fully set while the cheesecake cools.
Immediately run a knife around the edge of the cheesecake after baking to loosen it from the pan. Let the cheesecake cool, and then refrigerate at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight, before serving.
(Optional) Top with pie filling before serving.
