Ingredients:
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
1 (.25 ounce) package rapid-rise yeast
3/4 cup warm milk (115 degrees F (46 degrees C))
1 egg
1/4 cup orange marmalade
2 tablespoons butter, melted
3 cups bread flour
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
1 teaspoon salt
Filling:
1 1/2 cups chopped fresh cranberries
6 tablespoons brown sugar
6 tablespoons water
6 tablespoons chopped walnuts
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 egg white
1 teaspoon water
Glaze:
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon frozen orange juice concentrate
1 teaspoon water, or as needed

Directions:
Combine warm water and yeast in a large bowl; stir to dissolve. Add warm milk, egg, marmalade, and butter. Stir to combine.
Mix flour, oats, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add to yeast mixture and stir until moistened. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat both sides. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine cranberries, brown sugar, and water in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until cranberries begin to soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in walnuts, butter, and lemon juice. Let cool.
Punch dough down. Roll dough into a 10x20-inch rectangle on a floured surface.
Whisk egg white and water together. Brush lightly over the dough. Spread cranberry filling over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. Roll up tightly, starting from a long edge. Seal edges and cut off any tapered sides with no filling.
Transfer roll to a large square baking sheet. Join ends together to form a ring. Use sharp kitchen shears to make cuts at 1-inch intervals, cutting 2/3 of the way through the dough. Twist each slice gently to expose the swirled filling. Gently shape dough into a perfect ring. Cover and let rise until doubled, 20 to 25 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack. Let cool completely.
Stir powdered sugar and orange juice concentrate together in a small bowl. Add enough water to reach a glaze-like consistency. Drizzle glaze over tea ring. Allow glaze to set before slicing.
