Ingredients:
• 1 medium-sized green pepper, sliced
• 1 medium-sized red pepper, sliced
• 1 small yellow onion, peeled and sliced
• 2 large cloves of garlic, minced
• 1 tablespoon honey
• The juice from one lime
• 1 tablespoon chili powder
• 2 teaspoons cumin
• 1 teaspoon paprika
• 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
• 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced

Directions:
Prep
1. Label your freezer bag.
2. To your freezer bag, add all ingredients. (Add the chicken to the bag last,
so it’s the first ingredient poured into your slow cooker.)
3. Remove as much air from the freezer bag as possible, seal, and lay flat in
your freezer.
Cook
1. The night before cooking, move frozen bag to your refrigerator to thaw.
2. The morning of cooking, pour contents of freezer bag into your slow
cooker and cook on “low” setting for 4-8 hours, or until chicken is cooked
through and tender.
(Tip: You can also cook this meal in a pan on your stovetop!)
SUGGESTED SIDE DISH: Tortillas and fajitas toppings, like cheese, lettuce, tomato,
and guacamole.
