Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 1/4 cups chopped onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 habanero pepper, chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground allspice
3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 1/4 cups cooked black beans, rinsed and drained
2 1/4 cups cooked long-grain white rice
2 1/2 cups dry bread crumbs
6 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and garlic; cook and stir for a few minutes. Mix in the habanero pepper and continue cooking until tender. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl. Pour in the beans, rice and bread crumbs. Season with ginger, salt, allspice and nutmeg. Mix thoroughly using your hands. Form into 6 patties.
Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat (you can use the same one). Fry the patties until golden on each side, about 10 minutes total. Serve on buns with your favorite toppings.
