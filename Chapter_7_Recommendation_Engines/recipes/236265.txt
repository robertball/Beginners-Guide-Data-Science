Ingredients:
2 tablespoons avocado oil, or as needed
6 eggs, beaten
4 ripe tomatoes, sliced into wedges
2 green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon avocado oil in a wok or skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir eggs in the hot oil until mostly cooked through, about 1 minute. Transfer eggs to a plate.
Pour remaining 1 tablespoon avocado oil into wok; cook and stir tomatoes until liquid has mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Return eggs to wok and add green onions; cook and stir until eggs are fully cooked, about 30 more seconds.
