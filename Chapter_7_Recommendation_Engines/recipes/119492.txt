Description: 
'This is one of my favorite recipes for last-minute school bake sales,' writes Sandy Kerrison from her home in Lockport, New York. 'The cake-like snacks are the first items to go...that is, if they're not grabbed by a teacher first. I also include them in Christmas cookie gift baskets.'
