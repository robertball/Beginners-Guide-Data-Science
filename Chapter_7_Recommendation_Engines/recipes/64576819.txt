Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups icing sugar (1.5x = 3 3/4)
1/3 - 1/2 cup cocoa powder, adjust for desired darkness/taste (1.5x = 1/2 - 2/3)
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened (1.5x = 1/2)
1/4 (or less) milk or water (1.5x = 1/4 - 1/3)
1 tsp. vanilla (1.5x = 2)

Directions:
Put all ingredients in bowl.
Beat slowly until moistened.
Adjust milk and sugar as needed to reach desired consistency.
Beat until smooth and fluffy.
Makes about 2 cups (enough for 9"x13" cake).
I use 1.5 x for large pan (11"x17") of brownies. Quantities are in brackets.
