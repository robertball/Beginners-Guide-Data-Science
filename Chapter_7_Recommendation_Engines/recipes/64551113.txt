Melt butter in a frying pan and saute the minced garlic and ginger until fragrant.

Add in your marinated chicken and cook for another 10 minutes or until chicken is fully cooked.
Add heavy cream, sugar and salt to taste. Simmer for 1­2 minutes. Serve with some cream and chopped parsley if desired.
To make the naan bread, combine flour, 2/5 cup plain yogurt, baking powder, a pinch of salt and olive oil. Knead until no longer sticky.
Place your dough onto a floured surface and cut into two. Mold the dough into an oblong shape.
