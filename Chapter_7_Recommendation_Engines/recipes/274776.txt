Ingredients:
water, as needed
12 eggs, at room temperature
ice cubes (optional)

Directions:
Fill a pot with enough water to cover all eggs. Bring to a boil. Lower eggs gently into the boiling water using a slotted spoon.
Return to a gentle boil and cook for 13 to 15 minutes, depending on how firm you want the yolks. Remove from heat and drain water, keeping eggs in the pot. Fill the pot quickly with cold water to cool eggs. Add ice to speed the process.
When eggs are cool enough to handle, remove each one and gently crack the shell on all sides, without removing any shell. Place eggs back in the cold water and let stand for 15 minutes. Peel and remove egg shells to serve.
