Ingredients:
4 eggs
4 cups confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons lemon zest
4 1/2 cups cake flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
4 drops anise oil

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until very light and fluffy. Stir in the anise oil and lemon zest. Add the flour and baking powder; mix until well blended. Cover and chill dough for 3 to 4 hours.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4 to 1/8 inch thickness. Use a springerle rolling pin or board to make the designs. Cut into 1 1/2 inch rectangles, place onto a cookie sheet, and let them sit out overnight, uncovered, in a cool dry place.
The next morning, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake the cookies for 15 to 20 minutes. Do not let the cookies brown. Allow cookies to cool, and store in an airtight tin for 1 week to blend the flavors.

Description: 
This is a 100 year old recipe from Germany. I use it every Christmas. Its traditionally served with black coffee to dunk the cookie in. I prefer to eat them when they are still warm as the lemon flavor and the anise is a wonderful combination and the lemon is stronger at that time.
