Ingredients:
2 lbs lean top round, trimmed of fat, cut into 1" cubes.
2 Tb olive oil
2 large sweet onions- diced
2 cups celery- cut into chunks
4 large carrots- peeled and cut into large rounds
1 lb crimini mushrooms- cut into chunks or thick slices
2 Tb minced garlic
2 cups dry red wine
1 1/2 lb red bliss A creamers- cut in halves or quarters (1" chunks)
4 large tomatoes- chopped
1 tsp dried thyme (or 1 Tb fresh)
1 tsp dried marjoram or oregano (or 1 Tb fresh)
1/2 tsp dried sage (or 2 tsp fresh)
1 Tb dried basil or 1 Tb fresh minced
1 Qt beef stock
1/2 Qt marinara or tomato sauce

Directions:
In a hot skillet, brown towel-dried pieces of beef in olive oil, in batches to avoid over-crowding.  Remove beef and set aside.
In the same pan on very high heat, brown the onions, celery, and carrots briefly until browned.  Add garlic and mushrooms and deglaze with the red wine.  Cook until all the liquid is cooked off and add tomatoes, scraping any brown bits on the bottom of the pan.
Add all remaining ingredients and either cook uncovered on a low simmer on the stove top or in a crock pot for 4 to 6 hours(boiling very low) or until beef is very tender and sauce is thick.
Serve in bread bowls, in bowls with crusty bread, OR over noodles or rice.
