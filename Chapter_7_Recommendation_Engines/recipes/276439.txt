Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon ends and pieces
1 large white onion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups water
2 bunches collard greens, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Place bacon in a heavy pot and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until fat begins to render, about 5 minutes. Drain off 1/2 of the bacon grease.
Reduce heat to medium and add onion. Cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper; cook and stir for 2 minutes.
Increase heat to high and immediately pour in 3 cups water. Bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add chopped collard greens and 1 more cup of water. Bring back to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until greens are tender, about 1 hour.

Description: 
Good ole country collard greens with bacon and onion. These are so hearty and satisfying, even those who say I don't like greens will eat these up! You might even get a Wow! after the first bite and a not at all like I remember them tasting. You can eat them alone but they're best with hot buttered cornbread. Mustard and turnip greens are great this way too. Enjoy!
