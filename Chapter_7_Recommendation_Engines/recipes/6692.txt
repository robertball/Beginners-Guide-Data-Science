Ingredients:
1 cup water
3 cups bread flour
2 tablespoons dry milk powder
3 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons margarine
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/2 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Place water, flour, powdered milk, sugar, salt, butter or margarine, tomatoes, and yeast into bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer.  Set to Dough cycle, and start the machine.  Dough will be 1/2 pound.
When the bread machine has finished the Dough cycle, take the dough out.  Knead for 1 minute by hand.  Place in an oiled bowl, and turn a few times to coat the surface of the dough.  Cover with a damp cloth, and let rise for 15 minutes in a warm place.
Dust a 10 x 15 inch baking tray with cornmeal.  Roll out dough to fit the pan.  Make indentations in the dough with your finger tips.  Brush top surface with oil, and cover with a damp cloth.  Allow to rise for 30 minutes.
Sprinkle with parmesan, rosemary, garlic salt, and mozzarella.
Bake at 400 degree F (205 degrees C) for 15 minutes, or until nicely browned.  Cool slightly, and cut into squares for serving.
