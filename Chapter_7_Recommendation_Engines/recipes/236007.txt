Ingredients:
Avocado Fries:
1 avocado, sliced into 12 'fry' lengths
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg, beaten
1 cup dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or as needed
Dip:
3 tablespoons sour cream
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon tomatillo salsa
1 dash chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®), or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Pour flour into a shallow bowl. Pour egg in another shallow bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a third bowl.
Gently press the avocado slices into flour to coat and shake off any excess flour. Dip into beaten egg and press into bread crumbs. Place breaded avocado slices onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over breaded avocado slices.
Bake avocado in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and 'fries' are golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Stir sour cream, garlic powder, tomatillo salsa, and chile-garlic sauce together in a bowl until thoroughly mixed.
