Ingredients:
330 grams King Arthur gluten free all purpose flour
50 grams coconut palm sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/3 Cup butter, chilled
350 ml unsweetened almond milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
100 grams Enjoy Life chocolate chunks
1 movie theater box dark chocolate raisinets
100 grams red hots candy
3-4 tablespoons water
8-10 tablespoons powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In mixer bowl, combine flour, sugar, and baking powder. Cut in the butter slowly by cutting off small rectangular pieces of the butter, and dropping them in while the mixer runs on low. It should resemble a crumbly mixture in the bowl when it is done. Don't over mix. Slowly add in the milk and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined. No, these are no longer scone like. Stir in the raisinets and chocolate chunks. Spoon into greased muffin tins until cup is half full. Bake for 20 minutes or knife comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes after removing from oven. To make the glaze: melt red hots and water down until liquid. Stir in powdered sugar 2 tablespoons at a time. Glaze should be a sturdy liquid. Pour over bites and enjoy!
