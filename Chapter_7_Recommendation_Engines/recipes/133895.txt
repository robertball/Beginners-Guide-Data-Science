Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
2 red bell peppers, seeded and sliced into strips
1 large carrot, thinly sliced
3 tomatoes, chopped
4 olives, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup ground cumin
3 tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt to taste
5 pounds tilapia fillets

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garbanzo beans, bell peppers, carrots, tomatoes, and olives; continue to cook until the peppers are slightly tender, about 5 minutes more.
Sprinkle parsley, cumin, paprika, chicken bouillon, and cayenne over the vegetables. Season with salt. Stir to incorporate. Place tilapia on top of the vegetables and add enough water to cover the vegetables. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork and juices run clear, about 40 minutes.
