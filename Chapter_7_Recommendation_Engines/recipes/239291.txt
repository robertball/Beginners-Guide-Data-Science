Ingredients:
4 cups chopped zucchini
1 onion, minced
4 carrots, chopped
1/4 cup butter
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 (28 ounce) can no-salt-added tomatoes
2 tablespoons beef bouillon granules
6 cups water
2 cups cooked green lentils
2 cups ditalini pasta, or more to taste

Directions:
Mix zucchini, onion, and carrots in a bowl. Add enough water to cover and soak for 15 minutes; drain.
Heat butter in a large stockpot over high heat; cook and stir zucchini, onion, carrots, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning until onion is transparent, about 7 minutes. Add tomatoes and beef bouillon to zucchini mixture; cook and stir until heated through, about 7 minutes.
Mix water, lentils, and ditalini pasta into zucchini mixture; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until pasta is tender, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
I love lentils and always am looking for new ways to have them. With a garden full of zucchinis, this recipe was a no-brainer; one of our favorite staples. It is even good served cold on hot days.
