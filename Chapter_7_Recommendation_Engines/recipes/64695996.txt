Ingredients:
2 lbs hamburger
2 bunches cilantro, minced
1 large white onion, chopped
8 plum tomatoes, chopped
4 carrots, chopped or quartered
2 potatoes, sliced, cubed, or french fry shape
1 cup tomato sauce
1-2 tablespoon salt (to taste)
2 eggs, scrambled
Cilantro leaves for garnish
Serve with flour tortillas

Directions:
Mix hamburger, eggs, and 1 tablespoon salt together
Prepare meatballs by using you choice of measuring spoon (1 1/2 tablespoon) to form meatballs, set aside.
Chop tomatoes, carrots, onions and add to large pot
Cut potatoes in to large slices, large cubes, or large fry size, your choice, add to pot.
Add tomato sauce
Add meatballs.
Fill with water
Add salt to taste
Bring to boil, let simmer for 20 minutes.
Add minced cilantro to soup, simmer for 10 more minutes, stirring every few minutes.
Feel free to add any other type of vegetables.  I opt for sweet potatoes over regular.  Potatoes have a tendency to disintegrate into the soup, so cut them large.
