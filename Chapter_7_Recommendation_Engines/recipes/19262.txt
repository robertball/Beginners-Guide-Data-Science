1 cup shortening
2 cups brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
6 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup hot water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups confectioners' sugar

In a small bowl, soak currants in 1/2 cup of hot water until swollen; drain and set aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheets.

Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Fold in the chopped walnuts and dried currants.
