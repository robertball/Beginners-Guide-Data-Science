Ingredients:
1 pound of elbow macaroni
3 hard boiled eggs
2 cans of tuna (chunk light is best not albacore)
1 carrot diced (or  5 baby carrots)
1 can of peas
1/4 red onion
1 Cup mayonnaise
Salt & pepper

Directions:
Cook macaroni in salted water until al dente.
Rinse cooked macaroni in cold water.
Put macaroni in a large bowl.
Grate the red onion with a micro plane onto macaroni. You can dice it but Emily hates onions so I need to hide them.
Peel and dice carrots.
Peel and chop eggs.
Drain tuna
Add mayonnaise (may need to adjust amounts but it should be wetter than you like it as macaroni will absorb most liquid during refrigeration).
Salt & pepper to taste.
Add all the above ingredients to bowl and mix.
Drain and rinse peas.
Gently fold peas into salad.
Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
