Description: 
It's hard to make slow-cooked food look pretty, and this pork seriously fell apart when I tried to take it out of the slow cooker, so don't judge this by its picture. I promise that this recipe is delicious! My husband even said that this is one of his favorite Sunday dinners. I also made mashed potatoes and the gravy was delicious on them. Use roast between 2 to 3 pounds.
