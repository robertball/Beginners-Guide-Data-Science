Ingredients:
1 pound of penne pasta (or your favorite pasta)
1/2 pound of jumbo shrimp
1/2 pound of scallops
1/2 cup of heavy cream
1/2 cup of parmesan cheese
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 can (15 oz) of petite diced tomatoes
3/4 cup of white wine
2 tablespoons of dried basil
2 teaspoons of dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (optional)
1-2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

Directions:
In a large pan fill with water to a boil and cook you pasta based on box directions (be sure to salt your water)
Peel and devein shrimp and prepare your scallops
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the pasta and set aside.
In a saut√© pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, scallops, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Cook, stirring frequently until the shrimp turn pink and the scallops are cooked through, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the shrimp from the pan and set aside.
Add the tomatoes, 1 1/2 tablespoon of basil, 1 teaspoon of parsley, and the red pepper flakes. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the wine and heavy cream. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 7 to 8 minutes until the sauce thickens. Add 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, the cooked shrimp, the cooked pasta, and the remaining herbs. Toss together until all ingredients are coated.
Transfer the pasta to a large serving bowl. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and serve immediately.
