Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground chorizo
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 cups chicken broth, or to taste
1/4 cup uncooked orzo pasta
2 tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup fresh corn kernels
1/2 cup black beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup fresh spinach, or to taste
1 dried red chile pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot saucepan until it starts to release its fat, about 5 minutes. Add onion and cumin; cook until onion is soft, another 5 minutes. Drain and discard grease if there is a lot of fat in the pan, or pat dry with paper towels.
Add chicken broth to the saucepan; bring to a boil. Add orzo and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add tomatoes, corn, black beans, spinach, and chile pepper. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.

Description: 
This recipe made itself one night when I was scouring my fridge and pantry for the makings of a quick meal. Experiment with the solid and liquid ingredients so you get the soupiness or stewiness to your liking. You can throw just about anything into the pot and it will be delicious! I'm not much for measuring, so use your best judgement with proportions and seasonings, and don't forget to taste along the way. Garnish with cilantro and sour cream or plain yogurt.
