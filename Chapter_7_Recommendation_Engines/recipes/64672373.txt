Ingredients:
Base and Topping:
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup flour
1 cup finely chopped walnuts
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp cinnamon
Cranberry filling
1 package (12 oz or 340g) fresh cranberries
1 tbsp crystalized ginger, very finely chopped
1 med. size orange, only half peeled, very finely chopped
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 cups sugar

Directions:
Start by making the filling so you can let it cook and chill a bit.
In medium sauce pan, cook all the Filling ingredients together for approx. 15 minutes, until the mixture thickens slightly.
In a seprate bowl, mix all the base/topping ingredients together until well combined but still crumbly.  Set aside.
Assembly:
Press 2 cups of the Base/Topping mixture in bottom of an 8x8 pan.   Layer on 1 cup of the cranberry Filling and sprinkle on the rest of the topping mixture.
Bake at 350 for 35 mins or until slightly brown and bubbly.
The filing can be made a few days ahead of time.  Best of all, you will have leftover fillingt.  It's great as a "ketchup"/chutney for turkey or even spread over toast as a jam.
