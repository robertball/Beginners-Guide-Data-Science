3 cups self rising flour
2 sticks butter, softened
2 cups dark brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 bag Hershey's Heath Brickle Bits
Pinch of salt

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Combine butter and brown sugar until smooth and creamy. Add eggs and vanilla; combine well.  Add flour and salt.  Batter will be very stiff. Add in brickle bits and mix well.
Shape dough into 1-2 inch balls. Place on parchment paper covered cookie sheet. Flatten slightly with fingertips or bottom of glass.  Bake in 325 degree oven for 12 to 14 minutes or until edge of cookie is beginning to turn golden brown. Remove from oven and cool on wire rack. Cookies will be slightly crunchy around the edge and chewy in the center.
