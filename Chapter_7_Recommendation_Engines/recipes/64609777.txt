Ingredients:
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 lb chicken thighs, chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
salt
paprika
1 cup sour cream
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
8 oz penne pasta
2 cups fresh spinach

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil with tomatoes and minced garlic on medium heat.  Add chopped chicken  to the tomatoes and oil - generously season the chicken in the skillet with salt and paprika. Cook chicken until it's cooked through completely.
To the same skillet with chicken and tomatoes, add 1 cup of sour cream and 1/4 teaspoon salt - bring to boil. Add shreddded cheese and stir for about 30 seconds to melt the cheese. Reduce the heat from boil to simmer and continue stirring to make sure all cheese melts. At this point, if the sauce is too thick, add another 1/3 cup of sour cream and stir. Taste the sauce - if 1/4 teaspoon salt was not enough, add more.
Cook pasta according to package instructions. Drain, rinse.
Add cooked and drained pasta to the sauce. Add spinach, mix everything - cover with the lid and let the pasta sit to allow spinach to wilt, on low simmer. After spinach has wilted, stir everything together to combine, taste and add more salt, if needed.
