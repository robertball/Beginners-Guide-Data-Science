Ingredients:
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup dried oregano
2 teaspoons salt, divided
5 chicken drumsticks, or more to taste
1 pound bone-in beef chuck
1 pound bone-in pork loin roast
2 large lemon, juiced
2 large onion, quartered, divided
10 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 1/4 gallons water, or more as needed
1 (13.75 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (10.5 ounce) can beef consomme
4 cubes beef bouillon cubes, divided
1 1/2 pounds Spanish pumpkin, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
1 pound eddeos, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
1/2 pound yuca (cassava) roots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
1/2 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
2 green plantains, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
2 ears corn on the cob, cut into quarters
3 stalks celery, diced
2 large carrots, chopped, or more to taste
1 large green bell pepper, diced
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
1 dash adobo seasoning (optional)

Directions:
Mash garlic, oregano, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a bowl.
Douse chicken, beef, and pork with lemon juice in a large bowl. Drain half the liquid. Mix the mashed garlic, half of the onions, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, and vinegar into the meat mixture.
Heat the remaining 1/2 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meat mixture in batches and cook until browned on all sides, 15 to 20 minutes.
Transfer the browned meats into a large pot. Add half of the water, chicken broth, beef consomme, 2 bouillon cubes, and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until meats are more than halfway cooked through, about 40 minutes.
Combine pumpkin, sweet potatoes, eddeos, yuca, potatoes, plantains, corn, celery, carrots, green pepper, cilantro, and adobo seasoning in the simmering pot. Return soup to a boil. Reduce heat to low and continue simmering until the sancocho is thick and the root vegetables are soft, 1 to 2 hours. Stir in the remaining half of the water by gradual increments to replace any evaporated liquid.

Description: 
My fiance is from the D.R. and his mother has made me some amazing food! The first time she made sancocho I fell in love with it. It is often made with 7 different meats for a special festivity or holiday. I have simplified the meats in my version, but don't be afraid to use many kinds; this is my mimicked recipe. Great by itself or served the traditional way over rice. Super filling and even better the next day.
