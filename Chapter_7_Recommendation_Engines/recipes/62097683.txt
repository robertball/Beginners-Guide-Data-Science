Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) cans cream of chicken soup
1/2 (5.37 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1/2  Cup unsweetened soy milk (or regular milk)
1 ½ tablespoon margarine or butter
1-1/2 onion, chopped
1-1/2 teaspoons chili powder
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans (3 cups)
1/3 Cup chopped Chicken breast (optional)
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chilies
12 (8 inch) flour tortillas
2 Cups Grated Cheddar Cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small bowl mix the soups, and the milk set aside.
Melt margarine or butter in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Add onion and chili powder, and sauté until tender. Stir in the chicken, diced tomatoes and green chilies, black beans, and 3 tablespoons of the soup mixture.
Cook and stir until heated through.
Spread 1/2 cup of the soup mixture in a 9x13 inch baking dish and 1/4 cup into a 8 x 8 inch baking dish. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the black bean mixture and about 1 tablespoon of cheddar cheese down the center of each tortilla.
Roll up tortillas, and place, seam-side-down, in the baking dishes. Spoon remaining soup mixture on top, and sprinkle with the remaining  cheese.
Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
