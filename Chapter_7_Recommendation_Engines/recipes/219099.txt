Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups frozen strawberries
2 tablespoons frozen raspberries, or to taste
1/2 cup orange juice, divided

Directions:
Place frozen strawberries and raspberries into a blender, and pulse several times to break up the berries. Pour in half the orange juice with the blender running, and allow to blend until smooth and thick, about 30 seconds. If smoothie is too thick, blend in remaining orange juice. Serve immediately.
