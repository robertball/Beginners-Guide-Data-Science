Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) pork tenderloin
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix (or sliced onion)
1 cup water (or beef stock)
3/4 cup red wine
3 tablespoons minced garlic
3 tablespoons soy sauce
freshly ground black pepper to taste
Rosemary, thyme, celery powder, Worcestershire, parsley

Directions:
Place pork tenderloin in a slow cooker with the contents of the soup packet. Pour water, wine, and soy sauce over the top, turning the pork to coat. Carefully spread garlic over the pork, leaving as much on top of the roast during cooking as possible. Sprinkle with pepper, cover, and cook on low setting for 4 hours. Serve with cooking liquid on the side as au jus.
If desired, sear the tenderloin first, then deglaze the pan with water & stock before adding to slow cooker.
After removing the tenderloin from the slow cooker, strain the liquid into a saucepan and add a mix of cornstarch and water to thicken to gravy consistency.
