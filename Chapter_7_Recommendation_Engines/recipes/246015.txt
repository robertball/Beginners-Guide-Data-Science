Ingredients:
3 cups rolled oats
1 1/2 cups toasted almonds, coarsely chopped
1 cup roasted macadamia nuts, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 cups flaked coconut
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3/4 cup honey
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup golden raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Combine oats, almonds, macadamia nuts, and coconut in a large bowl. Heat olive oil, honey, butter, and brown sugar together in a separate microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until butter is melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Whisk butter mixture until brown sugar is dissolved; stir in salt, turmeric, and cinnamon. Pour butter mixture over oat mixture; toss to coat thoroughly. Spread granola evenly on a baking sheet.
Bake granola in preheated oven until well-toasted and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet to set, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl; stir in raisins.
