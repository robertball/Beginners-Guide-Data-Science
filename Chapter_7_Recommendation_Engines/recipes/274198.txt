Ingredients:
Cake:
2 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick速)
2/3 cup milk
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 egg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Topping:
2/3 cup baking mix (such as Bisquick速)
2/3 cup brown sugar
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a deep 9-inch pie pan.
Combine baking mix, milk, sugar, egg, and cinnamon in bowl; mix well. Spread into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Mix baking mix, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl using a fork or pastry blender until crumbly. Spread topping mix over cake batter; drag a butter knife across the top as if making a tic-tac-toe board several times.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
This coffee cake that uses Bisquick速 is even better than if bought at the bakery. It took me a while to get this recipe just right.
