Ingredients:
12 fresh figs
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup honey
pinch of salt
1 1/2 cups port
2 cinnamon sticks
2 peppercorns
2 whole cloves
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 lemon, zested
1 orange, zested
fresh mint

Directions:
Trim a small piece from the bottom of each fig so they stand up straight. Remove stems, and score a 1/4 inch "X" into the top of each fig. Set aside.
In a bowl, beat whipping cream together with sour cream until stiff peaks form. (This can be done either by hand, or with an electric mixer.) Gently fold in 1/4 cup of honey and a pinch of salt. Cover, and refrigerate.
Pour port into a small saucepan over medium high heat. Add cinnamon sticks, peppercorns, cloves, 1 tablespoon honey, vanilla extract, balsamic vinegar, and lemon and orange zests. Stir to dissolve honey and blend flavors. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for up to 30 minutes, or as time allows, being careful not to reduce liquid too much. Place figs upright in pan, cover, and cook for 5 minutes.
To serve, place a spoonful of honey cream in the center of each plate. Arrange 3 figs around the cream, and drizzle with a small amount of poaching liquid. Tuck a sprig of mint into the slit on the top of each fig. Serve immediately.
