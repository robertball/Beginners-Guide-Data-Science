Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 large celery root, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
3 cloves garlic, peeled
1/2 cup almond milk, divided
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons minced fresh chives
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes and celery root in a large pot. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Cook over medium-high heat until dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
Pulse potatoes, celery root, and garlic in a food processor in batches, adding almond milk and olive oil as you pulse to reach desired consistency. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in chives, salt, and black pepper.

This has become our favorite side dish to go with soups and main dishes. Doesn't need much salt. Celery root is an awesome discovery for flavor - these are the best mashed potatoes I've ever tasted.
