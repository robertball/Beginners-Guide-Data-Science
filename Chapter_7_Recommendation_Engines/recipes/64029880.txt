1 pound ground beef

1 tsp of  dried garlic or 4 cloves of chopped fresh.
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 chopped onion
1 chopped carrot.
1 egg

Garlic Salt to taste
Ketchup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F . Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, mix together ground beef, rotel, carrot, onion, garlic cheese, egg, and cracker crumbs.  Form into a loaf, and place in prepared pan. Sprinkle top with garlic salt.
Bake for approximately 1 hour, or until done.  Internal temperature should measure at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), the meat should be browned through, and the juices clear. During the last 15 minutes cover top with Ketchup.
