Ingredients:
2 pounds cabbage(medium head)
2 large carrots
1 tablespoon salt
2 cups sugar
1/4 cup water
1 cup apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon celery seed
1 teaspoon powdered dry mustard

Directions:
Shred the cabbage and mix with the tablespoon of salt in a colander. Let drain for an hour. Shred the carrots and set aside. While the cabbage is draining make the dressing. Add the sugar, water, vinegar, celery seed, and mustard to a saucepan and boil for 1 minute. Set aside to cool. Squeeze the moisture from the cabbage, mix in the carrots and place in pint containers. Pour the liquid over the cabbage carrot mix, put the lids on and freeze for up to 2 months. Makes 3 pints. To serve, thaw in the refrigerator overnight or set on counter if needed sooner. Chopped onions and bell peppers are an option to add in if you like them.

Description: 
Coleslaw made up and put in the freezer. Easy to take out and thaw when you need it in a hurry. It does have a crunch to it and a sweet-sour vinegar based dressing.
