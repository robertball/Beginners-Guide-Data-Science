Ingredients:
2 pounds pork tenderloin or boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into 1 inch cubes
1/2 cup teriyaki sauce (such as KikkomanÂ® brand), plus additional for basting, optional
1 can (20 ounce) Pineapple chunks, drained, but reserving 2-3 tablespoons of juice
1 tablespoon vegetable or sesame oil
3 pinches dried ginger or 1-2 teaspoon fresh grated ginger
3 garlic cloves, smashed
3 green onions, cleaned and coarsely chopped
1/4-1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, optional
1 pint cherry tomatoes, optional
2 medium red or green bell peppers, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces, optional
1 large sweet onion, cut into wedges and separated into blossoms, optional

Directions:
Place pork or chicken cubes into gallon freezer bag; set aside.
In a small bowl, combine the teriyaki sauce, reserved pineapple juice, vegetable or sesame oil, ginger, garlic, green onions and red pepper flakes (if using); mix well to combine.
Pour over meat, seal up bag and smoosh around to coat evenly.
Refrigerate and marinate at least 8 hours or overnight, turning occasionally.
Thread meat onto skewers, alternating with pineapple and desired veggies. Discard any remaining marinade.
Grill, turning occasionally, about 15-20 minutes or until desired doneness, basting with reserved marinade, if desired.
Enjoy!
NOTE: Prep time does not include marinating time.
