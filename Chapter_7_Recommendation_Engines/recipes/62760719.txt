Ingredients:
1 cup shortening
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup Splenda (or regular sugar)
2 eggs
2 tablespoons plain greek yogurt
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
5 very ripe bananas, mashed
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 cup dark chocolate covered raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugars until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. Stir in the yogurt, bananas, cinammon and vanilla.  In another large bowl sift together the flours, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Blend the flour mixture into the banana mixture; stir just enough to evenly combine. Do not overmix!  Fold in the dark chocolate covered raisins.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in the middle of your oven, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 50 to 60 minutes. Cool loaves in the pan for 20 minutes.
