Ingredients:
15 corn tortillas
Red enchilada sauce (see recipe)
3/4 cup oil in a pan or cast iron skillet
1 1/2 cup shredded Queso Quesadilla cheese
1 1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese (mix the two cheeses so you have a 50/50 blend)

Directions:
Warm oil to the point that when you put a tortilla in the oil, the tortilla it bubbles.
Heat the tortilla for 10 seconds; stack tortillas on a plate
Put the chile or enchilada sauce in a shallow dish or bowl so that you can easily dip the tortillas in it. Take one tortilla and carefully dip it into the sauce until it is thoroughly coated.
Lay the sauce coated tortilla in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Place 2-3 tablespoons of filling down the middle. Fold one side over, then the other side. Turn it over seam side down so the tortilla stays closed.
Pour the remaining sauce evenly over all of the enchiladas.
Sprinkle remaining cheese over the top.
Cook in the oven at 350 for 10-15 minutes
