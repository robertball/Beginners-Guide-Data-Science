Ingredients:
30 oz bag frozen hashbrowns
1 lb lean ground beef, 15% fat
1 medium chopped onion
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese, reduced fat
2 TB minced garlic
ground black pepper and salt to taste
canola oil and unsalted butter to cook hashbrowns

Directions:
In one skillet, brown beef and sautee onions together until 3/4 done. Use as little oil as possible since beef will generate fat. Meanwhile,  in the microwave,  cut an opening in the hashbrown bag and microwave just long enough to mostly defrost potatoes.
once the beef is mostly browned, drain 90% of the fat from the pan. Set aside. Put bag of hashbrowns in a skillet that is big enough for them and the beef mixture. Use as little oil and butter as possible to get hashbrowns mostly cooked,
combine everything into the hashbrown skillet and finish cooking until hashbrowns are crispy, or your desired consistency.
Add cheese when mixture is hot ALL OVER so it covers most of the potatoes.  Let the cheese melt and enjoy.
