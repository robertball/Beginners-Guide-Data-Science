Ingredients:
1 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup seasoned tomato sauce
1/2 cup sliced onion
1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped black olives
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the pizza crust on a large cookie tray or pizza pan. Brush the crust evenly with olive oil. Spread tomato sauce over it with a spatula or back of a spoon. Sprinkle vegetables evenly over the sauce, and top with cheese.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cheese has melted and is bubbly. Let cool for 2 to 3 minutes before cutting.
