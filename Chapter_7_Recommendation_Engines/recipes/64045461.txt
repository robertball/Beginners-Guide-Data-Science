Ingredients:
1 pkg. dry yeast (2 1/2 tsp.)
1 cup warm water
3 Tbsp. sugar
2 Tbsp. butter
1 egg
1/2 tsp. salt
3 to 3-1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400Â°
In a large mixing bowl dissolve yeast in warm water; let stand 5 minutes.  Add sugar, butter, egg, salt and half of the flour and beat at low speed with electric mixer.  Gradually stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.
Place dough in a well-greased bowl, turning to grease the top.  Cover and let rise one hour or until doubled in bulk (or cover and refrigerate up to 5 days).
Punch dough down; knead 4 or 5 times.  Roll dough into two 12-inch circles on a lightly floured surface.  Brush each with 2 Tbsp. melted butter and sprinkle with parmesan cheese.  Cut each into 12 wedges; roll wedges tightly, beginning at the wide end.  Place on greased baking sheet.
Cover and let rise about 30 minutes or until doubled in bulk.  Bake for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.  Brush rolls with melted butter.
