Ingredients:
Wontons:
1 pound ground pork
1/4 cup grated carrot
1 egg
1/4 cup minced green onions
2 tablespoons grated ginger
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric
salt and ground black pepper to taste
50 wonton wrappers
Soup:
2 1/2 (32 fluid ounce) containers chicken broth
1/4 cup rice vinegar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon hot chile paste, or to taste
2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
2 carrots, sliced
3 cups chopped bok choy
1 cup bean sprouts
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 tablespoons minced green onions, or to taste

Directions:
Combine pork, 1/4 cup carrot, egg, 1/4 cup green onions, ginger, 2 teaspoons soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, red pepper flakes, turmeric, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix filling well.
Place about 1 teaspoon of the filling into the center of each wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wrapper; seal the edges.
Pour chicken broth into a pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; stir in rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, and chile paste. Add mushrooms and carrots; simmer until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add about 25 wontons, bok choy, and bean sprouts; simmer until wontons are no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes.
Freeze the remaining wontons in a resealable bag for later use. Drizzle 1 teaspoon sesame oil over the soup and garnish with 2 tablespoons green onions.
