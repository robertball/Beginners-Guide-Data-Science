Ingredients:
1 8 oz block of cream cheese
1 can chili beans, mild
1/2-1 cup of salsa
cheddar cheese

Directions:
Spread one block on cream cheese in the bottom of a pie dish, 9x9 or 9x13 dish. Take one can of chili beans (no meat) and as much salsa as you prefer and mix together. Spread on top of the cream cheese and top with cheddar cheese or a mexican blend. Bake at 350 for 15-20 min until bubbly. Corn chip scoops are the best, but can also eat with any type of scoop chip! Enjoy! You can add taco seasoned hamburger meat if you want to make this a meal!
