Ingredients:
3 c unbleached, all-purpose flour
2 tsp baking powder
1 c sugar
2 sticks (1 cup salted) butter, cold
1 egg
3/4 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/2 tsp pure almond extract
Preheat oven to 350.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Combine the flour and baking powder, set aside. Cream the sugar and butter. Add the egg and extracts and mix. Gradually add the flour mixture and beat just until combined, scraping down the bowl, especially the bottom.
The dough will be crumbly, so knead it together with your hands as you scoop it out of the bowl for rolling. Roll onto a floured surface and cut into shapes. Place on parchment lined baking sheets (I recommend freezing the cut out shape on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before baking) and bake for 10-12 minutes. Let sit a few minutes n the sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack.
