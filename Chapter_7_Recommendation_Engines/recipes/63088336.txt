Ingredients:
Filling
2 cups cubed (1/8 to 1/4 inch/3.17mm to 6.35mm) cooked chicken breast
1/2 cup, 2 oz, 56g shredded mozzarella cheese or Italian cheese blend
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon bacon flavor bits
2 tablespoons regular or reduced-fat Caesar dressing
1 tablespoon regular or reduced-fat mayonnaise
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 teaspoon lemon juice
Crust
1 can (8 oz, 226g) crescent dinner rolls
Garnish, if desired:
1/4 cup Caesar dressing
1 cup shredded romaine lettuce

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 375°F or 190°C.
Combine the chicken, cheeses, bacon bits, dressing, mayonnaise, garlic, and lemon juice in a medium bowl.
If you add hot chicken after the other ingredients, it'll easily melt the cheeses and create a better blended mixture.
Unravel the dough and form 4 rectangles from it (2 triangles put together each).
Add about 1/2 cup of the chicken mixture on the rectangle.
Fold the rectangle dough over the mixture. Seal the sides carefully.
Bake for about 16 to 21 minutes or until it turns golden brown.
Garnish with additional Caesar dressing and lettuce.
