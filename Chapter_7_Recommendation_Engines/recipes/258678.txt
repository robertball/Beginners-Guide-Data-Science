Ingredients:
1 egg
2 spring onions, finely chopped
5 slices fresh ginger
1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine (Chinese rice wine)
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into small pieces
1 cup sweet potato starch
3 tablespoons sweet potato starch
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
2 cups lettuce leaves
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground white pepper

Directions:
Whisk egg, spring onions, ginger, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, garlic, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon white pepper together in a bowl. Mix in chicken. Let marinate for 20 minutes.
Pour 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sweet potato starch into a shallow bowl.
Heat oil to 340 degrees F (170 degrees C) in a large saucepan. Dredge chicken pieces in sweet potato starch; drop gently into the hot oil in batches. Cook until golden on the outside and no longer pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.
Arrange lettuce leaves on a large serving plate. Place fried chicken on the lettuce leaves. Mix 1 tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon white pepper together in a small bowl; sprinkle over chicken.
