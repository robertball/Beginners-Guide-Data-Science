Description: 
My kids like hot dogs.  Other than being fast and easy, I don't get too excited about them.  The other day I noticed I had two Anaheim chilies that I needed to use up, and thinking of pepper poppers, this recipe was born.  We used turkey hot dogs. It was my husband's idea to put the whole thing in a bun.
