Pizza-Gina Recipe

Ingredients:
Fresh pizza dough, enough for two large pizzas
Corn oil, about 2/3 C.
1 C. ricotta cheese
1 egg
2 C. mozzarella or provolone
1 C. shredded parmesan
2 C. sliced Italian ham, like capicola, prosciutto or salami, cut into 1" pieces

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Spray a cookie sheet with 1" sides with PAM. Pour half of the corn oil in the pan, set aside. Divide the dough into two pieces and roll each into rectangles slightly larger than the pan.  Lay the first piece of dough in the cookie sheet spreading the dough up all of the sides of the pan.  Mix the ricotta and the egg and sprinkle the mixture evenly over the bottom layer of dough.  Add the remaining ingredients in order listed.  Place the second piece of dough over the cheeses and meat. Crimp the sides of the dough together completely on all sides.  Pour the remaining oil over the top of the dough and spread evenly with your fingers.  The dough should be shiny--if the oil soaks in, add a little more until some of the oil is sitting on top of the dough and glistens. Pierce the top dough with a fork. Bake at 425 degrees for about 25 minutes.  Baking time may vary.  The pie is done when it is browned and crisp on top.  Allow the pie to rest for 20 to 30 minutes before slicing.  May be served hot or at room temperature.
