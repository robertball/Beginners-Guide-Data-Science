Description: 
I got this recipe from my sister, who searches for delicious and unusual dishes. This one lit up the family, and everyone loved it. As it got passed around to family and friends, slight changes occurred. For instance, you can omit the cilantro if you don't care for it or use less nutmeg and more cloves; the possibilities are endless. Just be sure you use caution when working with habaneros. Rubber gloves would be ideal.
