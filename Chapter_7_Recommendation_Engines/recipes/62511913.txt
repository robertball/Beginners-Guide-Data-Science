Ingredients:
5 pounds lean turkey
4 large onions, chopped
3 Tablespoons minced garlic
5 (10.75 ounce) cans Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup, or 2 family sized cans
1/3 cup ketchup
1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce
15 cups (or an 80 ounce bag) frozen Tater Tots (I get Walmart's large bag)
Cheddar cheese for topping

Directions:
Cook turkey, onion, and garlic in large skillet over medium-high heat until beef is well browned, stirring to break up meat. Pour off fat.
Stir soup, ketchup and Worcestershire into skillet. Layer tater tots on the bottom of 5 or 6 8x8 pans. Cover with meat mixture. Sprinkle with cheese. Cover and freeze, or bake at 425 degrees F for 25 minutes or until potatoes are done. If cooked from refrigerator or freezer, will take longer to cook.
