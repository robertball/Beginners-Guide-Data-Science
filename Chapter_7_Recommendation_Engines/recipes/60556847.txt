Ingredients:
6 pork chops
salt and pepper to taste
1 onion, halved and sliced
10 fresh sliced mushrooms (1 1/2 cups)
3 tablespoons all purpose flour
4 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons butter
2 cups chicken broth (from concentrated paste)

Directions:
Season both sides of pork chops with salt and pepper, set aside.
In a large skillet (not non-stick) heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter or margarine.  Add sliced onions and saute until translucent.  Add mushrooms and cook until onions and mushrooms are soft and caramelized.  Remove from pan, set aside in a bowl.  Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and place pan over medium high heat.  Cook pork chops 3 at a time until golden and cooked through, approximately 2 minutes per side.  Set aside and repeat with the remaining 3 chops, adding another 1 tablespoon of oil. Set Chops aside, and keep warm.
In the same pan as you cooked the chops and onions add 2 tablespoons of butter and the 3 tablespoons of all purpose flour.  Cook the flour for 2 minutes scraping any bits off of the pan left behind from the chops.  Slowly whisk in the chicken stock dissolving any lumps.  Continue to cook over medium high heat until thickened.  Add the mushrooms and onions back into the sauce and stir together until heated through.  Serve hot over pork chops.
