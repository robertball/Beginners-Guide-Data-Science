Ingredients:
Cinnamon Energy Bites:
1 cup raw cashews
6 dates, pitted
1 tablespoon flaxseed meal
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon coconut oil
Buddha Bowl:
1 cup water
1/2 cup brown rice
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup fresh fava beans, shelled
1/4 red bell pepper, diced
1/4 cup frozen peas
1/4 cup diced Swiss cheese
1/4 cup canned artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
1 hard-boiled egg
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/4 avocado, diced
2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds
1 teaspoon chia seeds
Blueberry Drink:
1/4 cup frozen blueberries
2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds
3 jasmine flower buds
2 cups water

Directions:
Combine cashews, dates, flaxseed meal, cinnamon, and 1 pinch salt in a food processor and blend until very well mixed. Add coconut oil and continue to blend until mixture sticks together. Roll into 20 gumball-sized bites and place on a baking tray. Freeze at least 30 minutes. Store cinnamon energy bites in freezer or refrigerator until ready to serve.
Bring water, brown rice, and 1 pinch salt to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 8 minutes. Add fava beans, red bell pepper, and peas. Cook until rice is tender, about 6 minutes more. Drain if necessary, but do not rinse. Allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Combine cooled cooked rice, Swiss cheese, and artichoke hearts in a bowl. Mix olive oil, mustard, and white wine vinegar together in a small bowl; pour dressing over rice mixture and toss. Transfer to a bento box with the hard-boiled egg.
Place yogurt in a separate compartment of the bento box and top with avocado, 2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds, and chia seeds. Add energy bites to another compartment of the bento box. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
Combine blueberries, 2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds, and jasmine buds in a portable drink container. Add water. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Serve with the bento box.
