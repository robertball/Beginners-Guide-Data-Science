Directions:
Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Strip the membrane from the back of the ribs, cut the ribs into 4 equal portions.
Combine brown sugar, white sugar, sweet paprika, smoked paprika, granulated garlic, pepper, cumin, onion, and Greek seasoning in a small bowl. Rub spice mixture all over the ribs and place in the air fryer basket.
Cook ribs in the air fryer for 30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes. Brush with barbeque sauce and air fry for 5 more minutes.

Description: 
These air-fried ribs are about as close to the low and slow as you can get without all the wait! The rub creates a great color and gives a nice bark.
