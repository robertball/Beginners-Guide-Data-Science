Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 pounds flounder fillets, rinsed and patted dry
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons lemon juice, divided
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup butter, melted
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
3 tablespoons chopped green onions (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
Season both sides of flounder fillets with salt. Place into the prepared baking dish. Brush 1 tablespoon lemon juice over fillets.
Mix remaining lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, melted butter, mayonnaise, and green onions in a bowl; spoon over the fillets.
Bake flounder in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Switch oven to broil; broil fillets until the tops are just browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
