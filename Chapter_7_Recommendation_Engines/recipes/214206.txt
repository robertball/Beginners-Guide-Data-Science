Ingredients:
6 (4 ounce) pork chops
12 slices bacon
1 (12 ounce) bottle tomato-based chili sauce
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Wrap each pork chop in  2 bacon slices to completely cover the pork chop, and secure with toothpicks. Place the wrapped chops onto a broiler pan, and broil until browned, about 5 minutes per side.
Mix together the chili sauce, brown sugar, and Dijon mustard in a bowl. Place the browned pork chops into the bottom of a slow cooker, and pour the chili sauce mixture over the chops. Spread pineapple chunks over the chops, set the cooker to Low, and cook until very tender, about 6 hours.

Description: 
These are so simple to make and so very good to eat! I'm a stay-at-home mom of two girls, and a full time student. I'm always trying new things especially for the slow cooker. This recipe is one of my favorites!
