Ingredients:
8 oz bacon, crumbled (about 8 slices)
1 onion, minced
4 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 tsp thyme
2 tbsp all-purpose flour
4 c chicken or ham broth
3 lbs golden potatoes, cut into 1/2" pieces (about 6 medium)
3 c cheddar cheese, shredded and divided
1/2 c heavy cream
3 scallions, sliced thin
Sour cream to taste (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook bacon over medium heat until crisp (5-7 minutes).  Use a paper towel to remove grease and refrigerate.
Pour off all but 2 tbsp of the bacon grease from the skillet.  Add onion, garlic, and thyme and saute until the onion is slightly browned (8-10 minutes).
Stir flour into onion mixture and cook for 1 minute.
Slowly whisk in 1 c broth, scraping up any browned bits, and transfer all to a crock pot.
Add remaining broth and potatoes to the crock pot.  Cover and cook on low until potatoes are tender (4-6 hours).
Transfer 2 cups of the cooked potatoes to a bowl and mash smooth with a handheld beater.  Stir 2 c cheddar into soup until evenly melted, and then return the potatoes and add the cream.  Let sit until heated through (about 5 minutes).
Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.  Crumble the saved bacon.
Ladle the soup into warmed bowls.  Top with bacon, scallions, remaining cheese, and sour cream.
