Ingredients:
1 pound spicy bulk pork sausage
1 (8 ounce) package reduced-fat cream cheese (Neufchatel), softened
3/4 (16 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
1 (8 ounce) can refrigerated crescent rolls

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Mix sausage, cream cheese, spinach, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a bowl.
Unroll and separate crescent roll dough into individual portions. Spread equal amounts of the sausage mixture into the middle of each dough portion. Roll and wrap dough around the filling to look like a baseball rather than a crescent roll; arrange onto a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
My daughter LOVES these for breakfast on school days, and I feel great knowing she devoured some spinach, a meat, and a carb before working hard all day long. I like to make lots of these and freeze them uncooked for quick meals in the future.
