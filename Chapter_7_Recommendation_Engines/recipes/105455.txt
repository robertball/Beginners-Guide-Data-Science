1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated whole milk
1 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup whole milk
1/2 cup instant nonfat dry milk
2 tablespoons honey
2 teaspoons vanilla
2/3 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated

Stir gelatin and cornstarch together in a small bowl.  Pour cold water into a microwaveable bowl.  Add gelatin and cornstarch mixture.  Stir well using a small whisk, until the mixture is very well blended and there are no visible lumps.
Microwave gelatin mixture on high about 2 minutes, stopping and stirring every 30 seconds, or until a thick clear gel forms. *  Remove cooked mixture from microwave.  Slowly add 3/4 cup of the ice cream base into the gelatin.  Stir well, making sure the gelatin and cornstarch are evenly distributed and there are no visible lumps.  Pour back into remaining ice cream base, stirring well.
