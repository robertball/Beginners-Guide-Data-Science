Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup water
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
1 (5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
2 1/2 cups cold milk
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons hot water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).  Grease a cookie sheet.
In a medium saucepan, combine 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup water.  Bring to a boil, stirring until butter melts completely.  Reduce heat to low, and add flour and salt.  Stir vigorously until mixture leaves the sides of the pan and begins to form a stiff ball.  Remove from heat.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well to incorporate completely after each addition.  With a spoon or a pastry bag fitted with a No. 10, or larger, tip, spoon or pipe dough onto cookie sheet in  1 1/2 x 4 inch strips.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, then reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and bake 20 minutes more, until hollow sounding when lightly tapped on the bottom.  Cool completely on a wire rack.
For the filling, combine pudding mix and milk in medium bowl according to package directions.  In a separate bowl, beat the cream with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.  Beat in 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Fold whipped cream into pudding.  Cut tops off of cooled pastry shells with a sharp knife.  Fill shells with pudding mixture and replace tops.
For the icing, melt the chocolate and 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over low heat.  Stir in 1 cup confectioners' sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Stir in hot water, one tablespoon  at a time, until icing is smooth and has reached desired consistency.  Remove from heat, cool slightly, and drizzle over filled eclairs.  Refrigerate until serving.
