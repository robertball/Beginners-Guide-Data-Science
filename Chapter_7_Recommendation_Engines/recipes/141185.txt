Ingredients:
1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon oregano, dried
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (6 ounce) fresh tuna steaks

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine orange juice, olive oil, oregano, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well. Place the tuna steaks in the bowl, turn to coat both sides with marinade; cover and refrigerate 30 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
Remove tuna from the marinade and shake off excess. Place tuna onto preheated grill and cook to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per inch for medium-rare or 10 minutes per inch for medium-well.

Description: 
This is a delicious and healthy meal. I serve it with mango salsa and rice. It is a great meal for the warm months, but it can also be broiled in the winter.
