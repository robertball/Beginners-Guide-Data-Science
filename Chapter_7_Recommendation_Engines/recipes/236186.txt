Ingredients:
2 cups boiling water
5 teaspoons baking soda

1 quart buttermilk
4 cups bran cereal (such as Kellogg's® All-Bran®)
2 cups bran flakes cereal
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup butter, melted
4 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg

Directions:
Combine boiling water and baking soda together in a large bowl. Let cool slightly.
Stir flour, buttermilk, bran cereal, bran flakes, walnuts, sugar, oil, butter, eggs, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and nutmeg into water-baking soda mixture until just combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate muffin batter for at least 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 60 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Pour batter into prepared muffin cups 1/2 full.
Bake muffins in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 minutes.
