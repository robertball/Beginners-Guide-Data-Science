Ingredients:
1/2 cup of milk (I used skim) 1/2 cup give or take to make thicker or thinner
2 Ice cubes
3 Whole Strawberries (Frozen or not)
3 Medium scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream (don't be skimpy, the more=thicker and sweeter!!)
4 Squirts of carmel sauce! (cold or warm)
Whip cream (if you want)

Directions:
Put in milk, strawberries, ice, ice cream and carmel sauce into blender.
Blend until all the chunks are crushed up. Then pour into a glass and put whip cream on top until it is and inch over the glass or however much you want, then for taste drizzle carmel sauce over the whip cream. If you don't want the dessert extra whip cream you don't need it, just put some carmel sauce on top of the shake. This is not supposed to be too sweet it is supposed to be sort of tart if you want to think of it like that, but if you want more sweetness for the deserty taste, just add more ice cream and then use the whip cream trick!!!
