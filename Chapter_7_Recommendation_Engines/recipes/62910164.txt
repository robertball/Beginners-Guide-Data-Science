Ingredients:
3/4 cup salted butter, melted
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
3 eggs
2 tsp vanilla
2 cups flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
4 oz cream cheese, softened
1 egg
3/4 cup pumpkin puree
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1/2 cup cinnamon chips, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Combine the melted butter and the brown sugar. When smooth, add two of the eggs and beat until combined. Add the third egg and the vanilla, beat until combined. Stir together the flour and baking powder, then stir into the wet mixture. Set aside.
Beat the softened cream cheese in a separate bowl until smooth. Add the egg and beat until just combined. Add the pumpkin and beat together. Stir in the pumpkin pie spice.
Line a 9x13 pan with foil (with some hanging over the ends for 'handles') and spray with cooking spray. Spread 2/3 of the blondie dough in the prepared pan. Drop spoonfuls of the pumpkin mixture over the base, then spoonfuls of the remaining blondie dough and swirl them together with a butter knife. If necessary, spread the top layer out to fully cover the base. Sprinkle liberally with cinnamon chips.
Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool completely before cutting into bars.

These yummy bars are a good way to use up any extra pumpkin you may have leftover from fall baking... or an excuse to open another can!
