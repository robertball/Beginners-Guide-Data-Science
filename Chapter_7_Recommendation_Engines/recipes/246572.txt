Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup butter, melted
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup lukewarm milk
1 egg
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
Filling:
1 cup molasses or black treacle
1 1/3 cups soft brown sugar
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Combine flour, 1 cup melted butter, white sugar, milk, egg, and yeast in a large bowl. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise, about 45 minutes.
Heat treacle, brown sugar, 1/4 cup butter, and cinnamon in a small saucepan over medium heat until melted together, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix well until filling is smooth.
Preheat a shallow waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Knead dough briefly and divide it into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, or as needed to fit your waffle iron.
Bake 1 ball of dough the preheated iron until golden brown and iron stops steaming, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove with a cake spatula. Press down with a round cutter to trim edges for a perfect circle. Carefully slice horizontally into 2 rounds while still hot. Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons of the filling on each round and sandwich together. Repeat with remaining dough.
