Ingredients:
Ingredients
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon of vanilla
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 egg
1 1/2 cups water or milk
1/4 cup molasses

Directions:
Stir together the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, soda, salt, ginger and cinnamon). In a small bowl.  In a larger bowl, put the egg and water (or milk) and the molasses,and beat.  Then, add the dry mixture until and gently mix (lumps are okay - do not overmix).
Pre-heat the grill or frying pan on low heat (2-4) (this is important -if the grill isn't hot enough, the pancakes will be kind of tough).  If you are using oil in the pan, then a drop of water in the oil should make the oil bubble - this indicates the pan is hot enough.
Cook on the first side until the batter if full of bubbles on the surface and then flip the pancake and cook until lightly browned.
Enjoy!

Description: 
My dear Grammie was making gingerbread one morning and my brother and I arrived, starving!  She altered the recipe slightly, put it on the grill and the result is this delicious recipe.  The smell of it cooking always takes me back to that morning- mmmmmm!
