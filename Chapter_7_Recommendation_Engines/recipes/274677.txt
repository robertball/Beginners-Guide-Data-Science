Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 pounds fresh Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Combine Brussels sprouts and olive oil in a large resealable plastic bag and shake to coat. Add Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the bag; shake to coat. Spread Brussels sprouts in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until Parmesan cheese is melted and the Brussels sprouts are lightly browned, 15 to 17 minutes.
