Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup shortening
1 egg yolk
1/2 cup milk
1 cup cornflakes cereal
8 cups tart apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 egg white
1/3 cup sifted confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl stir together the flour and the salt.  Cut in shortening till the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Lightly beat egg yolk in a glass measuring cup.  Add milk to make 2/3 cup liquid total; mix well.  Divide dough in half.
On a floured surface, roll half the dough to an 18 x 12 inch rectangle; fit into and up sides of a 15 x 10 x 1 inch  baking pan.
Sprinkle with corn flake cereal; top with apples.  Combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over apples.
Roll remaining dough to a 16 x 12 inch rectangle; place over apples.  Seal edges; cut slits in the top for steam to escape.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 50 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack.
