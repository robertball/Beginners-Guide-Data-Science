Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dry farfalle (bow tie) pasta
1 large fresh tomato, chopped
1 medium cucumber, peeled and chopped
4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
1/4 cup Italian salad dressing
1 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place the farfalle into the pot, cook 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
In a bowl, toss the cooked pasta with the tomato, cucumber, feta cheese, Italian dressing, and oregano.

Description: 
I made this up myself because I needed something that I could cook quickly, that was delicious, and doesn't break the bank. Everyone I know who I cook this for has fallen absolutely in love with it. You can eat it while it's still warm, that's how I like it best. Refrigerating it makes it more of a pasta salad.
