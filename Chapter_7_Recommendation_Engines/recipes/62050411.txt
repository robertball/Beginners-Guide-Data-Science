Ingredients:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts sliced
1 4oz can roasted diced green chilies
1/2 med onion diced
2 tablespoons cooking oil
salt
pepper
garlic powder
3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
8 flour tortillas
shredded lettuce
diced tomatoes
sour cream
salsa

Directions:
Heat the 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet.  Put the chicken and onions in the skillet, season with salt, pepper,and garlic powder to taste.  Cook for about 10-15 minutes.  Add the can of chilies and stir.  Remove from heat.  Heat up the tortillas(they will be easier to work with).  Place some chicken filling in the middle of the tortilla and top with cheese.  Roll up each tortilla, tucking in the ends to make a secure fat tube that resembles an overgrown Chinese egg roll. Secure the rolls with toothpicks.   Shortly before you plan to eat the chimichangas, warm at least 4 inches of oil in a Dutch oven or other large heavy pan to 375 degrees F. Fry the chimichangas one or two at a time until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Turn the chimichangas to fry them evenly. Drain them and arrange on serving plates. Top with cheese, sour cream, tomato, and salsa. Serve immediately.
