Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) whole pork tenderloin
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt, divided
Peach Chutney:
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1 garlic clove, crushed
1/2 red onion, diced
1 jalapeno chile, seeded and minced*
1 (15 ounce) can peach slices, drained
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
Cinnamon Couscous:
2 1/2 cups water
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 cups couscous

Directions:
In lightly oiled skillet, saute bell pepper, garlic, onion and jalapeno for 2 minutes, stirring, until vegetables are wilted. Stir in peaches, brown sugar and vinegar. Simmer briefly, until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and let stand at room temperature, up to 2 hours, until serving.
In large saucepan, bring water, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt and butter to a boil; stir in the couscous, cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut pork into medallions about 3/4-inch thick. In small bowl stir together remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, cumin and chili powder; rub this mixture over all surfaces of medallions. Broil medallions 4-5 inches from heat for 4 minutes; turn and broil 4 minutes more. Serve medallions with couscous and chutney.
