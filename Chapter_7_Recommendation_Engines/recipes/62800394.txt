Ingredients:
Pasta
1. 3.5 Cups all purpose flower
2. 4 large eggs
Ravioli Filling
1 lb ricotta cheese
l/2 lb frozen spinach (you could use fresh)
1 Cup Grated Parmesan and/or Romano cheese
1/2 Cup of sauteed onions
3-4 cloves Roasted/Fried Garlic
1 egg
salt and pepper to taste
(and 1 additional beaten egg, to seal ravioli edges)
Sauce
1-1.5 c Cream
2 cloves garlic (I also add a shallot too) (chopped/minced)
1\8th Cup Dry White Wine
Zest/rind of 1 lemon
Juice of 1 lemon
salt and pepper to taste
1 green onion

Directions:
Mix flower and eggs. Once ingredients are combined into a sticky mass, kneed for 6 minutes. Cover in plastic wrap and let it rest for a minimum of 20 minutes (it's not going to hurt if it sits a little longer, I've gone 3 hours before).
Mix Filling
Combine all ingredients.  Taste for seasoning (S&P), remember you're seasoning a whole lb. of Ricotta.
Once your pasta dough is ready,
fill with a tablespoon of filling per ravioli. (a tablespoon makes a huge ravioli. If smaller, then easier.)
Seal up the ravioli edges with your beat up egg, and your pastry/basting brush.
Start heating (heavily salted) water. (3-4 tablespoons at least.)
Once boiling, drop your raviolis in water, boil for 3-4 minutes. Remove and drain.
The sauce,
Cook garlic and Shallots with butter for 1 minute on high/med high.
Add splash of white wine (1/8 -to- 1/4 cup.)
Cook away 80% of the liquid...then immediately turn down heat to low -to- medium.
Add cream, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt and pepper.
Simmer for 1 additional minute.
Put your raviolis in a serving dish.  Apply your sauce.  Gently mix around, to coat all ravioli with sauce, and  serve!
