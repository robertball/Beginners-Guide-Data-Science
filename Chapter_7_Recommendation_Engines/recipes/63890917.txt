Ingredients:
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 clove garlic, minced
1 cup dry Italian bread crumbs
2/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon Adobo
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a bowl, blend the olive oil, garlic, Adobo, salt and pepper. In a separate bowl, mix the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Dip each chicken breast in the oil mixture, then in the bread crumb mixture. Arrange the coated chicken breasts in the prepared baking dish, and top with any remaining bread crumb mixture.
Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
