Easy Donair Sauce Recipe

Ingredients:
14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup vinegar
1/2 tsp garlic powder

Directions:
Put all the ingredients together in a bowl and stir until it is completely mixed.  I use a wire whisk.  Unlike most recipes for Donair sauce stirring will not make this sauce thin.  When it is completely combined and smooth put it in the fridge to keep it--it will keep for quite a while (if it lasts that long).  The sauce should be thick before you put it in the fridge and will thicken a little more once put in the fridge.

Description: 
My husband and I recently returned to Prince Edward Island after a prolonged absence and we went to one of the local pizza places that we used to go to all the time to have their Donair sauce and we both decided we like my donair sauce better!  I've never had a donair in my life, but I have had garlic fingers with Donair sauce and this recipe is so easy and NOT impossible to make (like most recipes).  Most recipes can't be stirred for very long or the sauce will be thin and most recipes can end up being gritty because of the sugar.  This recipe uses a secret ingredient which eliminates both!
