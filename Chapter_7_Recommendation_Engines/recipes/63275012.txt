California Casserole Recipe

Ingredients:
1 T oil
1lb ground beef
1 medium onion, chopped
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
2 15oz cans diced tomatoes with juice
1 6oz can tomato paste
2-3 t. Italian seasoning, optional
1 15oz can corn OR 1/2 bag frozen corn
3-4 cups macaroni, cooked
2-3 cups cheddar, grated

Directions:
In a large pan over medium heat, add oil and brown ground beef, onion, and garlic.  Add the tomatoes, paste, and italian seasoning and stir until paste is dispersed.  Add corn and macaroni and blend well.  Salt to taste.  Pour into a casserole dish and sprinkle a generous amount of grated cheddar on top (a thick layer is especially important in a deep casserole dish to ensure you get enough cheese with each serving - if using a 9" x 13" pan, you can go lighter on the cheese).  Bake at 350Â° for 20-30 mins or until cheese is melted and starting to brown.

Description: 
I'm not sure how this dish was initially created, but it's been a family favorite for nearly 40 years.  It always disappears quickly and leftovers reheat very well.
