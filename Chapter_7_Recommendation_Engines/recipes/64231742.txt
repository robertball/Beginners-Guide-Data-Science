Ingredients:
4 thick pieces of baccala'- about 2.5 to 3 inches long by about an inch thick (or as close to 1 inch as you can get)
flour for coating
3 tbs of Olive oil, or more as needed
1 cup italian oven-baked black olives
1 cup of chopped tomatoes (very ripe if using fresh)
1 or 2 chopped garlic cloves, (according to taste)
Chopped parsley
pinch of hot pepper
1 tsp capers
salt and pepper to taste (be aware you may not need any!)

Directions:
After baccala' has been soaked, rinsed and cut into the 4 pieces required for this recipe, it has to be patted down with paper towel to absorb extra moisture.
Roll baccala' pieces in flour and set aside.
In a saute' pan, heat olive oil.
Add baccala' and saute' until golden on both sides.
Remove from pan and add chopped garlic to the hot pan.
When garlic is golden, add chopped tomatoes and pinch of hot pepper.
Let it simmer for a few minutes only.
Add baccala' back to the pan plus the capers and olives.
Cover and let it simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, turning baccala' once.
Taste and adjust seasonings, if needed (salt and pepper)
Sprinkle fresh, chopped parsley over the baccala' before serving.

Description: 
This is a holiday tradition in Sicily. Baccalà is salt cured cod fillets. I remember my ex MIL would start soaking the fillets a week ahead of the festivities, changing the water every day. The aroma that would fill the house the day she'd start cooking this...yummm.
