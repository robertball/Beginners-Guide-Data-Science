Ingredients:
Lime Butter:
1/2 cup butter
1 lime, zested and juiced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
Salmon:
4 (4 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 shallot, thinly sliced
2 (15 ounce) cans white beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
3 tablespoons minced fresh chives
3 tablespoons minced fresh mint
3 tablespoons minced fresh basil
3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
3 tablespoons minced fresh tarragon

Directions:
Mix butter, lime zest, lime juice, garlic, and salt together in a bowl. Spoon butter onto a large piece of plastic wrap; roll up into a log. Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Season salmon with salt and pepper.
Heat 2 tablespoons lime butter and olive oil in a cast iron skillet set over a camping stove. Cook salmon fillets, skin-side down, until crisp, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until easily flaked with a fork, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer salmon fillets to a plate; top each fillet with 1 tablespoon lime butter.
Heat 1 teaspoon lime butter in the skillet. Cook and stir shallot in the hot butter until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in white beans and heavy cream; season with salt and pepper. Simmer until slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in chives, mint, basil, parsley, and tarragon.
Divide bean mixture among 4 serving plates; place 1 salmon fillet on top.
