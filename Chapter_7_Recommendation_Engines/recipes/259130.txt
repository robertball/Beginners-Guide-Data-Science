Ingredients:
1 egg
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
2 tablespoons water
1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin
1 (16 ounce) can pumpkin
1 cup vanilla ice cream, or as needed
1 prepared graham cracker crust

Directions:
Beat egg in a bowl. Stir in sweetened condensed milk, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and ginger.
Put water in a saucepan; sprinkle in gelatin, let stand 1 minute. Place saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until gelatin dissolves. Pour in milk mixture; increase heat to medium-low. Cook and stir until slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir pumpkin in gently until combined.
Spread 3/4-inch layer of ice cream into crust; cover with pumpkin mixture. Freeze until set, about 2 hours.

Description: 
Since the 60s, this has been one of my favorite Thanksgiving deserts. 
I share as a tribute to my mother, now in late-stage Alzheimer's disease. She worked very hard to make holiday meals special, and made this pie each year. I never knew where she got the recipe.
