Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 3/4 cups sugar
3/4 cup butter (original calls for spry!)
2 full cups black coffee
5 cups flour
2 1/2 tsp. baking powder
2 1/2 tsp. baking soda
2 cups almonds or walnuts
1 cup raisins
1 1/2 cups honey
1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp grated naval orange rind
1 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
Cream butter and sugar together until smooth.  Add eggs one at a time, then the honey.  In a separate bowl sift and mix all dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, baking soda).  Slowly add the dry ingredients into the batter alternating with the coffee.  Mix in the nuts and raisins, orange rind, vanilla and cinnamon last.  Pour into baking pans and bake at 350 for 1 hour or until a knife stuck into the center comes out clean.

Description: 
Honey cake is a traditional recipe for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. This recipe was found by my husband's aunt on a hand-written note - we think it belonged to his great-grandmother. I think the old recipes are the best!  Some measurements have been converted from pounds for more modern conventions. ;)
