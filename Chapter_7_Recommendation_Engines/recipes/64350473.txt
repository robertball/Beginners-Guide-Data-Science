Graham cracker crust:
Graham crackers, Crushed________¼ Cup
Butter, Melted__________________½ Cup
White sugar, Granulated_________3 Tablespoons
Flour, All Purpose______________¼ Cup

Heavy Cream_____________________1 ½ Cups

Directions:
Gather all ingredients and equipment.
Preheat the oven to 375F; Grease the inside of a cake pan with butter and set aside.
Crust: Combine the ground graham crackers, Butter, sugar, and flour, and mix until they’re fully incorporated together.
divide the graham cracker crust between the bases of two greased 9" spring form pans, level, and bake in the oven for 7 minutes; remove and allow the crust to cool for 15 minutes before filling.
Filling: In a large mixing bowl whip the heavy cream on medium-high speed until it reaches a medium peak; remove and set aside.
Place the cream cheese in a large mixing bowl with the sugar, salt, and vanilla extract; Beat the mixture smooth on medium speed, gradually adding the eggs in one at a time.
Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese base in three stages, divide the contents equally amongst the two spring form pans.
Cover both pans with a sheet of greased wax paper (to prevent sticking) and a sheet of Aluminum foil.
Place the cake pan into a large hotel pan and fill it up to ¾ of the pans height with lukewarm water and bake at 375F for 1 hour, or until the cake reaches 165F.
refrigerate both pans overnight before removing the cheese cakes.
Remove the pan from the water and refrigerate overnight; contents should still be somewhat fluid, but will solidify overnight.
