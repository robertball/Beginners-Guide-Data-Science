Ingredients:
1 can of Rotel - undrained
1 can of Roasted Garlic & Onion Petite Diced Tomatoes – drained 14.5 oz (if you can’t find the roasted garlic/onion ones,  just use regular
½ onion – optional – we like ours onion*y. If you use regular diced tomatoes use the onion
2 large*ish jalapenos – roasted for 15-20 minutes in a 400 degree oven, or until they are well roasted
Cumin, to taste
2 large cloves of fresh garlic
Juice from ½ a lime
Fresh cilantro, to taste
Kosher salt to taste

Directions:
I roast lots of jalapenos & keep in a baggie in the fridge for a couple of days. Use them in many dishes.
For this recipe, chop the stem off of 2 & throw them in the food processor or blender. Add the rest of the ingredients & blend until it’s the consistency you like.
