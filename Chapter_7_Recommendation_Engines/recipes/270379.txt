Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie shell
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach
1 (8 ounce) package Swiss cheese, diced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup nonfat milk
3 medium eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prick pie shell with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove and let cool. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add spinach and cook until heated through and dark green, about 5 minutes. Drain well and let cool.
Combine Swiss cheese and flour in a bag. Seal and shake until cheese is coated.
Whisk milk, eggs, salt, pepper, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Stir in spinach and flour-coated Swiss cheese. Pour into the cooled pie shell.
Bake in the preheated oven until middle is set, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool slightly before slicing and serving.
