Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, divided
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 dash paprika
1 dash ground black pepper
2 cups milk
4 cups pearl onions
1/2 cup coarsely chopped dry roasted peanuts
1/4 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter, and stir in the flour, salt, paprika, and pepper until smooth. Gradually blend the milk into the saucepan until thickened. Place the onions and nuts in a medium casserole dish. Pour the sauce over the onions and nuts, and toss to coat.
In a separate saucepan, melt the remaining butter, and toss with the bread crumbs to coat. Sprinkle over the casserole.
Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned.

Description: 
A traditional holiday favorite in my family, this creamed pearl onion recipe is a surprising treat to the palate. Chopped dry roasted peanuts mingle with the cream sauce and onions, while the bread crumb topping gives it a nice bit of added texture. My sister used to bake this at every holiday meal she hosted, and since we've lost her, it has a special meaning :).
