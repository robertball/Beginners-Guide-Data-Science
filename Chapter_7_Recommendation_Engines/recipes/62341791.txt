Ingredients:
3 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1/4 inch slices
4 Tablespoons Country Dijon mustard
4 Tablespoons honey
salt and pepper to taste
butter to taste
brown sugar to taste

Directions:
Boil potatoes in low-sodium chicken broth with mustard and honey until tender.
Transfer cooked potatoes into mixing bowl, reserving some of the cooking broth.
Whip the potatoes until smooth.
If you prefer your potatoes a little more moist, add some of the cooking liquid, a little at a time, until you reach your desired consistency.
Whip in butter and brown sugar to your taste.

Description: 
Not a marshmallow in sight in these potatoes!  The tang of the mustard offsets the sweetness nicely.  Even with the tang, my friends say these still taste like dessert.
