Ingredients:
1 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup natural peanut butter
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1 tablespoon cocoa powder
1 teaspoon liquid stevia
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 ounce chopped roasted salted peanuts

Directions:
Melt coconut oil in a saucepan over low heat, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in peanut butter until smooth. Whisk in heavy cream, cocoa powder, liquid stevia, vanilla extract, and salt.
Pour chocolate-peanut butter mixture into 12 silicone muffin molds. Sprinkle peanuts evenly on top. Place molds on a baking sheet.
Freeze chocolate-peanut butter mixture until firm, at least 1 hour. Unmold chocolate-peanut cups and transfer to a resealable plastic bag or airtight container.

This is a modification of a recipe for a peanut butter cup-style fat-bomb I found online. Store in the fridge or freezer. When hungry or needing a fat bomb (if you are on keto), eat one.
