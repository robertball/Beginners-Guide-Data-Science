Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 lb jumbo shrimp, peeled and de-veined
1 green onion, chopped
1 tablespoon amaretto liqueur
1/2 cup coconut milk
1/4 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons sugar (or to your desired sweetness)
1 teaspoon coconut extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. Saute the shrimp for 2-3 minutes.
Add green onion and CAREFULLY add the amaretto. Cook 1-2 minutes more until shrimp begins to caramelize.
Remove the shrimp from the pan and set aside. Add heavy cream, coconut milk, and sugar to the pan. Simmer on medium, stirring occasionally, until it begins to thicken and is reduced by half (about 5-8 minutes).
Add shrimp back into pan along with the coconut and vanilla extracts. Simmer 1-2 more minutes and serve.
