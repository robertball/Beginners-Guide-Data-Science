Ingredients:
1  spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (12 ounce) package bulk Italian pork sausage
3 cups broccoli florets
2 cups sliced baby bella mushrooms
Â½  onion, diced
5 cloves garlic, diced
2 leaves sage, minced
2 teaspoons garlic salt
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 ounces Pecorino Romano cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush olive oil over spaghetti squash halves; place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until skin is easily pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes.
Start frying sausage in a large skillet when squash has 5 minutes left to bake. Remove squash from the oven and let cool. Add broccoli, mushrooms, onion, garlic, and sage to the skillet with the sausage; cook and stir until onion softens, 5 to 10 minutes.
Scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands with a fork. Stir into the sausage mixture until well combined. Season with garlic salt, salt, and pepper. Shave Pecorino Romano cheese on top.
