Description: 
Shirley also shares this update of an old-time favorite--comforting tuna casserole. 'This may be the easiest tuna macaroni casserole ever,' she informs. 'I prepare it the night before, and then just pop in the microwave. There's no need to precook the macaroni, so there's really no fuss.'
