Ingredients:
2 cups cold fat-free half-and-half
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 (11.5 ounce) package Ghirardelli 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate chips
3 fluid ounces Amaretto liqueur (or rum)

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, stir together 1 cup half and half and the cornstarch until smooth. Add remaining half and half. Over low heat, bring mixture to a simmer, stirring constantly to prevent sticking. Remove from heat.
Put chocolate and Amaretto in a small bowl; microwave on high 20 seconds. Stir until chips are mostly melted.
Return milk to low heat. Add chocolate; stir continuously, scraping pan, until thick.
Cool. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
