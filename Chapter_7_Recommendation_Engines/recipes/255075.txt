2 tablespoons garlic-infused olive oil
1 Mexican squash, cut into noodle shapes
1 yellow squash, cut into noodle shapes

1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
2 Fresno chile peppers, sliced into rounds

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; add Mexican squash, yellow squash, broccoli stems, garlic salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until vegetables are tender but still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes.
Mix in Cheddar cheese; cook and stir until melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate; garnish with Fresno chile peppers.

Description: 
Don't throw those broccoli stems away! Broccoli stems have plenty of flavor and spiralize easily along with other vegetables. With the addition of cheese this makes for the perfect side dish.
