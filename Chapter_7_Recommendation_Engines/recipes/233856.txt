Ingredients:
30 pods fresh snow peas, trimmed
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 ounce smoked salmon, flaked
1/8 teaspoon garlic salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch dried dill weed, or to taste

Directions:
Split each snow pea down one seam.
Mix cream cheese, smoked salmon, garlic salt, and pepper in a bowl until smooth. Spoon salmon mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe mixture into the center of each snow pea pod, creating a scalloped edge. Sprinkle dill weed over cream cheese filling.

Description: 
These are a cute and fresh idea for an appetizer or as a pretty addition to a festive vegetable tray. I used to steam the pea pods, but this uncooked method yields a nicer look without all the fuss.
