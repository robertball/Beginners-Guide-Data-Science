Description: 
Save calories, while keeping a hearty portion, by using apple butter and chai tea to flavor the oats, without added sugars. If you need a little something extra on top, try adding toasted pecans, a chopped banana, or fresh blueberries. Serve chilled or microwave for 1 minute for a hot dish.
