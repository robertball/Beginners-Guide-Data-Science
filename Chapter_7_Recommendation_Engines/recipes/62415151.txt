Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup Splenda
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup apricot-pineapple jam
1 cup raspberry jam
1/2 cup Splenda
1 egg
1 1/2 cups flaked coconut
1 cup heavy whipping cream, whipped with no sugar added

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray regular muffin tins with Pam for Baking.
In a large bowl, mix together the butter, vanilla  and Splenda until smooth.
Sift the flour and corn starch together.
Add the flour mixture to the bowl and stir by hand until a dough forms.
Roll dough into 2 inch balls and press into sprayed muffin cups, molding it up the sides to form shells.
Put 1 to 2 tablespoons of whichever jam you like into each cup.
In a small bowl, Mix Splenda and egg until well blended.
Stir in the flaked coconut.
Spread about 2 teaspoonfuls of the coconut mixture onto each of the preserve-filled tarts.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes. Cookie crusts should be lightly browned.
Cool the tarts in the pan for 5 minutes before attempting to remove them.
Lightly tap muffin pans on the counter to loosen the tarts.
Serve with whipped cream.
