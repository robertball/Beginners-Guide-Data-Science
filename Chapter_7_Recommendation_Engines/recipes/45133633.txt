Ingredients:
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried rosemary
salt and pepper to taste
2 pounds boneless pork loin roast
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup white wine

Directions:
Crush garlic with rosemary, salt and pepper, making a paste. Pierce meat with a sharp knife in several places and press the garlic paste into the openings. Rub the meat with the remaining garlic mixture and olive oil.
Place meat inside a Ziploc bag and place inside refrigerator to marinate for a few hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place pork loin into oven. Throw in some veggies with the meat (carrots, onions, potatoes and celery) and pour about 1/2 cup of wine in the bottom of the pan.  Roast for about 2 hours covered, turning and basting with pan liquids.
After 2 hours remove roast to a platter. Heat the wine in the pan and stir to loosen browned bits of food on the bottom. Use a can of chicken stock and some cornstarch to make a gravy out of the pan drippings. Goes well with buttered herb rice and the roasted vegetables
