Ingredients:
1.5 Tbs butter
1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 tsp lemon juice
salt and pepper
2 8oz halibut fillets
1 Tbs Dijon mustard
1/4 cup chicken stock

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Melt butter in a bowl in the microwave. Stir in the breadcrumbs.
Pour enough chicken stock into an oven safe skillet to cover the bottom and lay fillets in the pan.  Drizzle the lemon juice onto the fillets and then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread a thin layer of Dijon mustard on top of each fillet, then press the breadcrumb mixture on top.
Transfer the skillet to the oven until the fish is just cooked through (around 20 minutes).  If the breadcrumbs aren't brown at this point, place under the broiler for 1 minute.
