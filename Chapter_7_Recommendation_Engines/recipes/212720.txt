Description: 
This is a version of the popular 'Butter Chicken' recipe found in most Indian restaurants. I adapted it from a delicious sauce recipe in one of my cookbooks that always drives me wild, and streamlined it so it doesn't take half as long to make. Basically, it's chicken cooked in a spicy tomato cream sauce. Serve with naan and basmati rice.
