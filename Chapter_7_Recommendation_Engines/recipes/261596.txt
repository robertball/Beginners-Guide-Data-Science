Ingredients:
1 1/2 (12 ounce) packages gluten-free elbow pasta
1 pound butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces

1 cup vegetable broth
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons chopped parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gluten-free elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Combine butternut squash, soy milk, and vegetable broth in a pot; bring to a boil and cook until squash is tender, about 12 minutes. Puree with an immersion blender. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Stir in cooked macaroni and garnish with chopped parsley.

Description: 
Your family will be none the wiser when you offer up this vegan mac and 'cheese'. The pureed squash mimics the creamy texture a traditional cheese sauce would offer, and since it is made using gluten-free macaroni shells, you could confidently serve it to gluten-intolerant folks as well as those on a calorie-restricted diet. With a supper that will make everyone smile, you are certainly squashing the belief that cheese is necessary at allâ€¦
