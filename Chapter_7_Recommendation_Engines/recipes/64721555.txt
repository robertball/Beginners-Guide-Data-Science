Ingredients:
1 cup heavy cream
6 ounces 72% dark chocolate, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground coffee
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat the cream to boiling in a saucepan. Add chocolate. Let stand for 10 minutes. Add coffee, vanilla extract, and salt. Stir slowly in concentric circles until ganache is completely smooth and glossy.
Refrigerate until thick and chilled through, 1 to 2 hours.
Whip with an electric mixer until soft, fluffy, and slightly lightened in color.
Notes:
Substitute dark chocolate chips for the chopped chocolate, if desired.
Be careful not to overwhip, or you'll end up with stiff, grainy chocolate 'butter' that's hard to pipe.

Description: 
If you cool chocolate ganache and whip some air into it, you get a fluffy frosting that's easy to pipe and full of deep chocolate flavor. What's not to like?
