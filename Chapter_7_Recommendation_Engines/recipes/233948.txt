1 bunch kale, stems removed and leaves chopped
2 apples, diced

1/3 cup toasted unsalted sunflower seeds
2 tablespoons raw apple cider vinegar
1/3 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese

Massage salt into kale in a large bowl until kale is slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Gently stir apples, olive oil, cranberries, sunflower seeds, and vinegar into kale until salad is evenly mixed. Gently fold Gorgonzola cheese into salad.

Description: 
A favorite for potlucks, family gatherings, and hot summer nights at home.
 With a food processor to chop the kale, I can be done and out the door to a party within 25 minutes - and that includes 5 minutes to find my keys. 
My kids love this salad when I add lots of apples!
