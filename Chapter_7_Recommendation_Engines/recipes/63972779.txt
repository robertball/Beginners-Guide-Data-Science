Ingredients:
Patties:
1 packet or 1 can pink salmon
1 small potato (egg sized), peeled and boiled until soft
mustard to taste
1 c. Saltine crackers, crushed
2 eggs
vegetable oil for frying
Sauce:
1/4 c. margarine
1/4 c. flour
1/8 tsp. pepper
1 c. chicken broth
3/4 c. water
1 tsp. lemon juice

Directions:
Prepare patties:  Mash boiled potato.  Clean salmon and mix with mashed potato.  Add mustard to taste.  Beat one egg and combine with salmon mixture.  If mixture is too soft to handle, add breadcrumbs until it can be worked with.  Form mixture into serving sized patties.
Prepare sauce:  Melt butter in small saucepan and add flour and pepper.  Cook, stirring constantly, until bubbly (about 3 min. to cook off flour taste).  Slowly stir in chicken broth.  Add water until desired thickness.  Add 1 tsp. lemon juice.
Cook:  Heat about 1 inch of oil in a frying pan.  Beat second egg and place in a shallow dish.  Place crushed crackers in a second dish.  Dredge patties in egg, then cracker crumbs.  Brown patties on both sides in oil.  Serve with sauce.
