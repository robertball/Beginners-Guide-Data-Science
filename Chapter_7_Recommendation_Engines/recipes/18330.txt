Description: 
Sliced potatoes with seasonings to give it an excellent flavor. This is a great side dish for any main course meal. You can add more of the seasonings for your liking. I suggest a little more paprika, it gives it a great flavor. You can also put in bacon bits when cooking if you would like.
