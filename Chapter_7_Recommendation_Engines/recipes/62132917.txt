In a large bowl, whisk dry ingredients.  Make a small well in the center and add eggs through vanilla, whisking just until combined.  Fold in strawberries and bananas.
Heat griddle or frying pan to medium heat until drops of water dance on surface.

Description: 
These are SO good... so sweet, you almost don't need any toppings.  You can also make them vegan by mixing together 3 T. water, 3 T. oil, and 2 tsp. baking powder to substitute the eggs, and using soymilk instead of buttermilk, as well as replacing the melted butter with oil.
