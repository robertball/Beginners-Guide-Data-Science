Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/3 pounds lamb leg, cubed
2 large potatoes, cubed
1 pound tomatoes, diced
1 pound zucchini, chopped
2 onions, finely chopped
1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight and drained
2 carrots, cut into 1-inch strips
1 stalk celery, thinly sliced
1 bunch fresh mint, finely chopped
1 bunch fresh cilantro, finely chopped
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch saffron
cold water to cover
1 (7 ounce) can tomato puree

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over high heat. Add lamb; cook and stir until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; add potatoes, tomatoes, zucchini, onions, chickpeas, and carrots. Stir in celery, mint, cilantro, ginger, cinnamon, and saffron. Cover with water and simmer for 15 minutes.
Reduce heat to low. Stir in tomato puree and enough water to cover. Simmer, adding more water as it is absorbed, until chickpeas are tender, about 45 minutes. Transfer lamb to a plate using a slotted spoon.
Puree chickpea mixture with an immersion blender until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Season lamb with salt and pepper; stir back into the pot.
