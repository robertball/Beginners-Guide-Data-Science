Ingredients:
4 cups cooked rice (preferably 1-3 days old)
8-12 medium raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
3-4 tbs white cooking wine
1/4 onion, minced
3-4 cloves garlic, minced
2 eggs, beaten
STIR FRY SAUCE
1/2 tsp shrimp paste
2 tbs fish sauce
1 tsp sugar
2 tbs soy sauce
pinch white or black pepper
1-2 tsp chili sauce - omit for milder rice

Directions:
Mix the stir fry sauce ingredients together in a cup.  Set aside.
Place a wok or large frying pan over medium high heat.  When the pan is hot, add 2 tbs oil plus the garlic and onions.  Stir fry 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant.  Add the cooking wine and continue stir frying another 2 minutes, or until onions begin to soften.
Add the shrimp.  Stir fry another 2-3 minutes, or until the shrimp have turned pink and are nicely plump.
Push shrimp to the side of the wok and add 2 tsp or oil then the beaten eggs.  Quickly fry the eggs about 1 minute.
Keep the wok hot for these last few steps.  Add the rice, and pour the stir fry sauce over top.  Quickly begin tossing the rice in the wok, using 2 utensils and a tossing like motion (lifting from the bottom of the pan).  Continue stir frying in this way for about 3 minutes or until rice is hot.
Remove from heat and taste test for salt.  Add a little more fish sauce (1/2 tbs at a time) until desired taste is achieved.  If it is too salty, add a few squeezes of lime juice.
