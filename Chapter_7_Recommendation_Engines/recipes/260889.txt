Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon baking powder
1 cup softened butter
1 (7.4 ounce) box apple cider drink mix (such as Alpine® Spiced Apple Cider)
1 cup white sugar
½ teaspoon salt
2  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (14 ounce) package caramel bits (such as Kraft®)

Directions:
Whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and baking powder together in a bowl.
Combine butter, apple cider drink mix, sugar, and salt together in another bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Add vanilla extract and mix well. Add the flour mixture gradually; mix until just combined. Refrigerate dough for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Microwave caramels in a microwave-safe bowl until softened, about 20 seconds. Flatten caramels using the bottom of a glass.
Scoop cookie dough into balls about 1 tablespoon each. Flatten each ball slightly in your palm. Sandwich a caramel between 2 pieces of dough; pinch closed. Repeat with the remaining cookie dough and caramels. Place cookies 2 inches apart on the prepared sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until very lightly browned around the edges, 12 to 14 minutes. Slide parchment off of the baking sheet, onto your counter. Let cookies cool on the parchment.
