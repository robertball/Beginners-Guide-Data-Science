Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package turkey bacon
3 tablespoons reduced-fat mayonnaise
5 green onions, minced
2 pints cherry tomatoes, halved

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and chop into little bits.
Mix bacon with mayonnaise and green onions. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Slice about Â¼ inch off the top of tomatoes. Scoop out insides with a small metal spoon such as a melon baller or metal measuring spoon. Discard the tops and insides. Stuff each tomato with some of the bacon mixture.
Place tomatoes on a plate, cover, with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until chilled, 1 hour to overnight.
