Ingredients:
Soy-Ginger Dressing:
3 medium garlic cloves, minced
6 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1/4 cup vegetable oil
Pasta Salad:
2 tablespoons salt
1 pound penne pasta
8 ounces broccoli florets
1 pound rare deli roast beef, sliced 1/8 inch thick and cut into bite-size strips
3 medium carrots, peeled and coarsely grated
1 medium red bell pepper, cut into bite-size strips
2 cups bean sprouts
3 green onions, thinly sliced
1/2 cup chopped roasted (or honey-roasted) peanuts
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Mix garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, sesame oil, ginger, and pepper flakes in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup. Whisk in mayonnaise until smooth, then in a slow steady stream, whisk in  oil to make an emulsified dressing; keep chilled until ready to toss with salad. Store in a clean jar with lid.
Bring 1 gallon of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to boil in a large soup kettle. Add pasta and, using package times as a guide, boil, stirring frequently and adding broccoli the last 1 minute, until just tender. Drain thoroughly (do not rinse) and dump onto a large, lipped cookie sheet. Set aside while preparing remaining salad ingredients.
Place all salad ingredients (except soy-ginger dressing) in a large bowl or transfer to a gallon-size zipper bag. (Can be covered and refrigerated several hours at this point). When ready to serve, add dressing; toss to coat and serve.
