Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta (such as Barilla® Plus)
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 yellow squash, sliced and quartered
1 zucchini, sliced and quartered
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 (16 ounce) bottle light Parmesan-peppercorn dressing (such as Cains®)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl.
Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil and heat for about 30 seconds. Add yellow squash, zucchini, and garlic and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Add to cooked pasta, pour in dressing, and toss to combine. Serve hot or cold.
