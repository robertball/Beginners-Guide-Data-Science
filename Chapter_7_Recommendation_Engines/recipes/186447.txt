Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
2 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
4 eggs
1 1/4 pounds fresh strawberries, sliced
1/4 cup rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 7x3 inch loaf pans.
Stir together the flour, 1 1/2 cups rolled oats, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. In another bowl, whisk together the vegetable oil and eggs; stir into flour mixture until just moistened. Fold in strawberries. Pour into the prepared loaf pans, and sprinkle the tops with the remaining 1/4 cup of rolled oats.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool the strawberry bread in the pans for 5 minutes before cooling completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
I came up with this bread late one night because I had too many strawberry that were about to go bad. I love it. This works equally well with fresh or frozen strawberries.
