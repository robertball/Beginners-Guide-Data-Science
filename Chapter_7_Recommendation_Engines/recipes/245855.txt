Heat olive oil in a pressure cooker over medium heat. Stir in turkey bacon, onion, celery, and red pepper flakes; cook until turkey bacon is browned and onion is translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes more. Add kale gradually; cook and stir until just wilted, about 1 minute. Stir in chicken broth, balsamic vinegar, bouillon cubes, sugar, and pepper.
Cover pressure cooker with lid and cook kale according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and release pressure through natural release method. Open the pressure cooker carefully; stir in salt and hot pepper sauce.

Description: 
This is a recipe for kale greens made in a pressure cooker with turkey bacon. I make this with a 6-quart electric pressure cooker. If you eat red meat, feel free to substitute the turkey bacon with the real thing. If you want less salt, cut back on the bouillon.
