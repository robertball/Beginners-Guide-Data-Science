Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup water
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup flaxseed meal
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 cup brewers' yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3 cups quick-cooking oats
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat sugar, butter, and shortening together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add water, egg, and vanilla extract and mix well. Add flour, flaxseed meal, cocoa powder, yeast, salt, and baking soda. Mix well. Fold oats, chocolate chips, and walnuts into the dough.
Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 12 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This is the best lactation cookie recipe that I've tried. It's chewy and chocolaty, and it doesn't skimp on the key lactation ingredients: oatmeal, brewer's yeast, flax, and walnuts.
