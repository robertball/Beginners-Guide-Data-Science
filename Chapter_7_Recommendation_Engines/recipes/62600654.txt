Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil, divided
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, warmed
1 pkg Chorizo (about 12 oz)- cut into 1/2 inch rounds
3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1.5 lbs)
- cut into 1 inch chunks
1 onion, chopped fine
1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped fine
2 celery ribs, chopped fine
2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried)
1-2 teaspoons cajun seasoning - to your taste
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Heat 1/4 cup oil in saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add flour and stir until mixture is dark brown, about 15 minutes. Gradually stir in broth and bring to boil. Cover and keep warm.
2. Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook chorizo until browned, about 3 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon to a bowl. Cook chicken in remaining oil until cooked through - about 5 minutes. With slotted spoon remove to bowl with sausage. Add onion, bell pepper and celery to oil in pot and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
3. Add hot broth to pot, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in sausage, chicken, thyme & cajun seasoning and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt & pepper.
Serve with a crusty loaf of bread to mop up all the sauce!
