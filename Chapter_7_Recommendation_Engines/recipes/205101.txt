Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) wheel Brie cheese
1/2 cup Ocean Spray® Whole Berry Cranberry Sauce
1/2 cup apricot preserves
Sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Slice off the top 1/4-inch of the Brie wheel; set aside. Hollow out the center of the cheese, leaving a 1-inch shell all around. Place in an ovenproof serving container slightly larger than cheese. Save left over cheese for another use.
Break up cranberry sauce with a fork and place in center of cheese. Cover with top of cheese. Spoon apricot preserves over top; sprinkle with almonds.
Bake for 8-10 minutes or until soft and slightly melted. Serve with crackers.
