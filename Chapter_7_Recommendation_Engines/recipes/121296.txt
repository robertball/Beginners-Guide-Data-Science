Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (8 ounce) container vanilla yogurt
1 egg
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons milk
1 small tart apple - peeled and chopped
1/3 cup raisins
TOPPING:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon cold butter or margarine

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Combine the yogurt, egg, oil and milk; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Stir in apple and raisins if desired (batter will be thick). Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full.
For topping, combine flour, sugar and cinnamon in a bowl; cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over batter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-24 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
