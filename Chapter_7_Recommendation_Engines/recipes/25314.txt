Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon ground cumin, or to taste
1 tablespoon ground curry powder, or to taste
1 tablespoon chili powder, or to taste
1 cube vegetable bouillon
1 cup water
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 cup uncooked white rice

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over low heat.  Sweat the garlic; when the garlic becomes aromatic, slowly stir in pepper, cumin, curry powder and chili powder.  When spices begin to fry and become fragrant, stir in the bouillon cube and a little water.
Increase heat to high and add the rest of the water and the soy sauce.  Just before the mixture comes to a boil, stir in rice.  Bring to a rolling boil; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed.
Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes.
