Ingredients:
3-4 medium russet potatoes or other "starchy" type
2 - 4 Tbsp butter
1/8 salt

Directions:
Using a box grater with large holes, grate the raw potatoes into a bowl.
Melt butter in 8 to 10 inch cast iron skillet. Add grated potatoes about 1 inch deep and salt. Cook over medium heat several minutes, stirring two or three times to coat the potatoes evenly with butter. Then pat the potatoes into a cake with the spatula and let cook for 10 minutes. Cover and cook for another 5-10 minutes.
When the bottom of the potato cake is golden brown, place a plate, slightly smaller than the skillet, on the potatoes and invert the pan, holding onto the plate. Remove the pan and set it back on the stove. Add another tablespoon or so of butter and let it melt.
Slide the Rösti back into the pan, golden side up, and cook for about 15 minutes, pressing down once or twice to make the pancake stick together a little more. You can cover it to get the potatoes cooked in the middle, but remove the cover at least 5 minutes before the end, so that your pancake is crispy on the outside.
Slide Rösti onto plate and serve by cutting into wedges. Salt to taste.
Other add-ins: Parsley, onions, nutmeg, pepper or ground paprika.
You may also make Rösti with parboiled potatoes. Cook them al-dente one day in advance and peel. Grate just before you fry them and proceed as above.
