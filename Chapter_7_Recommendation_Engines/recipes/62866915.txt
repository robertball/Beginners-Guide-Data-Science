Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 'nuggets'
2 c. Corn Chex
2 eggs, beaten.
1/3 c. rice flour
cooking oil

Directions:
Over medium heat, pour cooking oil in skillet, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Place Chex in a food processor to get it to bread crumb consistancy. Dredge nuggets through rice flour, eggs, then Chex and place in skillet. Cook for approximately 1 minute on each side or until golden brown.
