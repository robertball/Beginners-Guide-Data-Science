Ingredients:
1 package active dry yeast (2¼ tsp. if measuring from bulk yeast)
2 cups lukewarm water
1/2 TBSP kosher salt
4 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
olive oil
rosemary

Directions:
Combine yeast and warm water in a large bowl or pitcher.
Using a wooden spoon add in 1 cup of the flour and then the salt and mix until combined. Stir in the rest of the flour, one cup at a time, until completely incorporated.
Cover with plastic wrap or a lid that is not shut completely. Allow to rise for 1 hour.
Do not punch down the dough. Lightly oil the bottom of a cast iron skillet (a 10" or 12" skillet works well). Sprinkle a good amount of flour on top of the dough and then cover hands with flour. Take all of the dough and shape into a disk. (it will be sticky)
Place in the skillet, cover loosely with a towel, and allow to rise for another 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400ºF.
Drizzle a little more oil over the top of the bread, and slash the dough with a knife creating an X. Sprinkle with coarse salt and rosemary leaves.
Bake for 35-40 minutes until the top is a deep brown color.

Description: 
I love this bread. I’m not sure where  the idea came from but the thought of cooking some rustic bread in the skillet with very little work is a big help in meal prep. Bread doesn’t have to be so intimidating. It puffs up and crusted up just beautifully and can be adapted to fit whatever main course it is supposed to accompany.
