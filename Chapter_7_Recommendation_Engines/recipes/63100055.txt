Ingredients:
5 boneless center cut pork loin chops
1/2 cup Hoisin sauce
1/2 cup Less Sodium Soy Sauce
1/2 cup honey
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon garlic chili sauce (or adjust to your taste)
Cooking Spray

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients, except the pork chops, in a small bowl.  Place the pork chops in a zip lock bag.  Pour half the sauce over the chops in the bag and close the bag.  Marinate overnight in the refrigerator.  Place the remaining marinade in an air tight container and refrigerate overnight also.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the pork chops from the zip lock bag, and shake excess marinade from the chops. Discard the marinade in the plastic bag.
Grill the pork chops on the preheated grill, basting with the reserved marinade until meat is browned, no longer pink inside, 8 to 10 minutes per side.
Pour remaining reserved marinade into a saucepan over medium heat, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook the marinade about 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
