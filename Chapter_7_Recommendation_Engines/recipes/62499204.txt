Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
2 cups finely chopped onion
4 cups beef stock (can use bouillon cubes)
2 8-oz cans tomato sauce
2 to 3 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 teaspoons worcestershire sauce
1/2 oz unsweetened chocolate, grated
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 bay leaf
1 can black beans
1 can kidney beans
12 oz spaghetti, cooked and drained

Directions:
In a large pot sautee the onions in a bit of olive oil.
Add the beef and cook for 10 minutes or until the meat is browned, stirring often. Add the beef stock and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
Stir the tomato sauce into the beef mixture. Then add the rest of the ingredients (except the spaghetti and the beans). Simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the beans and cook for an additional 30 minutes. Serve the chili over the hot cooked spaghetti (start the spaghetti with enough time to finish it when the chili is done).
You can also add shredded sharp cheddar cheese and oyster crackers on top if you like.
