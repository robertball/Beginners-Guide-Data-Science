Ingredients:
3 peaches, or more to taste
1/2 cup Chardonnay
1/4 cup Full Circle™ 100% Pure Honey
1/4 cup Food Club® Light Brown Sugar
1 tablespoon Food Club® Pure Vanilla Extract
1/2 teaspoon Food Club® Cinnamon
1/4 cup Food Club® Pecan Halves
Salt to taste
1 pint Kay's® Classic Vanilla Bean Ice Cream
4 leaves fresh mint

Directions:
Halve peaches and remove pits.
In a large bowl, stir Chardonnay, honey, brown sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon together.
Add peaches, ensuring they are liberally coated by marinade. Allow to marinate for 1 to 2 hours.
Preheat grill to hot.
Lay peaches face-down over the grill for 4 to 6 minutes, or until exterior is seared and fruit is tender, basting with the wine-honey marinade. Remove peaches from heat.
Coarsely chop pecans and lightly salt.
Scoop vanilla bean ice cream into bowls. Immediately top with warm grilled peaches, a drizzling of the wine-honey marinade, chopped pecans, a dusting of cinnamon, and mint garnish.
