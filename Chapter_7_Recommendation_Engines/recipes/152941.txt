Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 large red onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup cubed pancetta
1 (10 ounce) box frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained and squeezed dry
3 tablespoons feta cheese
4 (1 ounce) slices Provolone cheese
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 egg white

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8 inch pie plate.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the red onions; cook and stir until tender and transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and pancetta, cook until the pancetta is crispy, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Mix in the spinach and feta cheese. Remove skillet from the heat.
Arrange the Provolone cheese to completely cover the bottom of the prepared pie plate. Spoon the spinach mixture over the cheese. Cover with the puff pastry sheet, trimming the edges to fit the pie plate. Brush top of pastry with the egg white.
Bake pie in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
This is my version of the classic Greek spinach pie called spanakopita. The flavors tend to be a little bolder than you'll find in the traditional version.
