Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
12 ounces elbow macaroni
2 cups grated Kasseri cheese

Directions:
Bring 5-6 quarts of salted (at your discretion) water to a roiling boil, then add the macaroni.
While macaroni is cooking, melt the butter until just golden/light brown.
Cook the macaroni as directed and drain.
In a small casserole dish, layer 1/3 of the cheese to the bottom of the dish.
Follow with 1/2 of the drained macaroni.
Top the macaroni with another layer of cheese (1/3).
Layer the rest of the macaroni over the second layer of cheese.
Pour the browned butter over the top, then stir to mix.
Top the casserole with the remaining cheese.
Bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees or until cheese is nicely melted and just starting to brown.
