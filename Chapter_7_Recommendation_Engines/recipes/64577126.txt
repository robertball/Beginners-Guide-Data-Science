Description: 
This curry powder was created for a friend who wanted a flavorful curry that is not hot. It has taken some time and tinkering but I think I've found the perfect blend. It's worth taking the time to locate fenugreek and cardamom. It is what sets it apart from the rest. They can be found at many bulk and health food stores. 
I also like to grind whole fenugreek and cardamom seeds in my spice grinder for maximum flavor. 
(P.S. My nickname Cari means curry in French!)
