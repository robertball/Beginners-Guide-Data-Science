Ingredients:
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 1/4 pounds ground lamb

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine flour, oregano, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Add ground lamb and thoroughly knead with the flour mixture until thoroughly mixed together, about 3 minutes.
Shape the seasoned ground lamb and place into a loaf pan; set on top of a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning the loaf halfway to ensure even browning, about 1 hour and 20 minutes.
Wrap loaf in aluminum foil and let rest, about 10 minutes. Slice as thinly as possible to make the doner kebab pieces.

Description: 
A very popular take-out especially after a night out at the pub. This favorite is so, so tasty--I'm sure once you try it, you'll certainly want to make more! Serve with warmed (lightly toasted) pita bread, chili sauce, and a salad of shredded cabbage, carrot, onion, and sliced cucumber. Also great to add as a topping for pizzas. Great to make in advance, slice and freeze.
