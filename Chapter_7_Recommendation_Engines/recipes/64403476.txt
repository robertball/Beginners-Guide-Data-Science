Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower
1 shallot, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
Olive oil
1/4 cup low sodium chicken stock
1 tsp tamari (optional)

Directions:
Wash cauliflower.  Remove green parts and stem.  Roughly chop into 4-8 pieces.
Place cauliflower in blender or food processor.  Pour in water to cover cauliflower.  Blend on low setting until cauliflower pieces resemble rice.  NOTE: This happened in about a second on my blender, so be prepared to stop blending immediately! Pour cauliflower and water into a colander and let it drain well.  You can push down on the top of the cauliflower to try and press out more water.  NOTE: I did this step way ahead of time so it had a lot of time to dry, not sure how that impacted the final outcome, if at all.
Head tbsp of olive oil in large skillet on medium to medium-high heat.  Add shallot and cook for 30 seconds.  Add garlic and cauliflower and stir to coat.  Let it cook for another minute.  Add chicken stock and tamari (optional) and let it cook for another 6 minutes or until cauliflower is just starting to brown, stirring regularly.

Description: 
Really great rice substitute and a great way to add extra vegetables! Kids might not even realize it isn't really rice if it's mixed in with other stuff.  On its own, it has a slight cauliflower flavor, but when you mix it in with sauces and other stuff it really just has the same consistency as rice.  It is also really good when mixed in with brown rice.
