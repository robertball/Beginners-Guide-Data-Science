Ingredients:
15 cups plain popped popcorn
1 cup dried cranberries
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup candy-coated milk chocolate pieces (such as M&M's速)
Syrup:
1 1/3 cups white sugar
1 cup butter
1/2 cup light corn syrup (such as Crown速 Lily White)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon vinegar

Directions:
Line baking sheets with aluminum foil.
Combine popcorn, cranberries, pecans, and chocolate pieces together in a bowl.
Stir sugar, butter, corn syrup, and vanilla extract together in a heavy saucepan; cook and stir over medium-high heat until boiling, about 5 minutes. Boil mixture for 2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in vinegar.
Pour sugar mixture over popcorn mixture; mix until evenly coated. Spread coated popcorn mixture onto prepared baking sheets; cool. Break into pieces and store in an airtight container.

Description: 
Popcorn and candy in a candy sauce. Great for the holidays! Not too chewy and won't stick to your teeth (unless you overcook the sauce)! You can customize the candy, dried fruit, and nuts to what you like. Canadian Smarties速 can be used instead of M&M's速. I've known people to press the mixture into a cake pan and cut pieces, too.
