Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain and return to the pan. Mix in the cream of chicken soup until noodles are coated.
Crumble the ground beef and onion into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain the grease, and stir in the tomato soup,stewed tomatoes, corn, brown sugar, pepper and salt. Spread half of the beef in the bottom of a greased 2 1/2 quart casserole dish. Arrange 5 slices of cheese over the beef. Top with half of the noodles, then repeat layers ending with cheese on top.
Bake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is browned and sauce is bubbly.
