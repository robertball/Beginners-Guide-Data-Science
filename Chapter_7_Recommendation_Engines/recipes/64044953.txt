Ingredients:
3/4 of a 1 pound box of rotini pasta
12.6 ounce bag of frozen baby broccoli florets
1 pound (16 ounces) bag small cooked, frozen shrimp
6 ounces of Annie's Naturals Goddess dressing
1 tablespoon feta cheese
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 of a fresh lemon (optional)

Directions:
Fill one pot with water and bring to a boil, then add pasta and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. At the same time place broccoli into a separate pot and add water to completely cover the broccoli. Bring to a boil then turn the heat down to low and let simmer 5 minutes. Strain both when finished and add to a large serving bowl.
Place shrimp into a strainer and run cold water over it, moving them around with your hands to ensure they get completely thawed, which should take about 5 minutes. If needed, remove the tail during this process.
Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet on medium low heat and cook shrimp until warm, about 3-5 minutes, then add to the large serving bowl with pasta and broccoli.
Stir Annie's Naturals Goddess dressing and feta cheese into pasta, shrimp, and broccoli mixture.
Squeeze the fresh lemon over the top of the salad.
