Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups whole-grain bow-tie pasta
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 cups sliced cremini mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/3 cup chopped celery
1/3 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/3 cup chopped carrot
1 1/2 cups light Alfredo sauce (such as ClassicoÂ® Light Creamy Alfredo)
1/2 cup light sour cream
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons snipped fresh dill
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (5 ounce) can solid white tuna (water pack), drained and broken into chunks
1/3 cup whole wheat panko bread crumbs
4 wedges lemon wedges (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 2-quart baking dish with nonstick spray.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, celery, bell pepper, and carrot; cook until vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes.
Whisk together Alfredo sauce, sour cream, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, dill, and black pepper in a large bowl. Stir in cooked pasta, vegetables, and tuna until combined. Transfer to the prepared dish. In a small bowl, stir together panko and remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan; sprinkle over casserole. Lightly coat with nonstick spray.
Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until browned and bubbly, about 25 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.
