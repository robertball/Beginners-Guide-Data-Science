Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
3/4 cup chopped water chestnuts
3/4 cup cubed Cheddar cheese
1 onion, finely chopped
2 teaspoons chile sauce
2 teaspoons prepared mustard
3 teaspoons soy sauce

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, water chestnuts, cheese, onion, chile sauce, mustard and soy sauce. Mix together well and form into 6 patties.
Using a griddle or skillet, cook the patties over medium heat for about 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.

Submitter: 
sal
Description: 
These are great cheeseburgers with a Chinese flair. I use Chinese-style mustard and serve them on some lightly buttered and toasted hamburger buns.  Try substituting teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce, too!
