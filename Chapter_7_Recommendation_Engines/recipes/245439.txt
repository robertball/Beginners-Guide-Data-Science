Ingredients:
1 butternut squash
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 onion, chopped
1 shallot, minced
2 tablespoons curry powder, or more to taste
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 apple, cored and chopped
1 slice fresh ginger, minced
water to cover
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pierce butternut squash and place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 45 minutes. Allow squash to cool until easily handled; cut in half, scoop the seeds, peel, and chop the flesh.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and shallot until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add curry powder and turmeric and cook until evenly coated, about 2 minutes.
Mix squash, apple, and ginger into onion mixture; add enough water to cover. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until squash and apples are softened, about 15 minutes. Mash soup using a potato masher or blend with an immersion blender until squash is broken up.
Mix coconut milk and salt into soup and simmer until heated through, about 3 minutes more.

Description: 
So easy and so perfect for fall, this one's from the collection I created for my kiddo when she was a starving college student. I top it with toasted pumpkin seeds or curried almonds.
