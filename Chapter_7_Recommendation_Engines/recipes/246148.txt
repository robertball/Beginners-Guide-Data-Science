Description: 
Chicken breasts are sauteed to a golden brown then topped with a rich, savory Gorgonzola sauce. Serve with steamed green beans and fresh crusty bread if you are looking for a winner to impress your dinner guests. This dish is so decadent it tastes exactly as though you ordered it at a fine Italian restaurant, but the secret is how simple it actually is to make! This sauce is also a wonderful accompaniment to pork chops, ravioli, or whatever strikes your fancy!  It is very versatile, so the possibilities are endless!
