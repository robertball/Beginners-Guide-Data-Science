Ingredients:
1 pound Rudy's Farm Country sausage-flavored bulk sausage
12 large eggs (I prefer brown, myself)
1 1/3 cups whole milk
1/3 teaspoon salt
1 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese
1 cup garlic and onion flavored croutons
12 very thin slices of fresh tomato

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 325Â°F. Grease a 13" X 9" or 13" X 8 3/4" X 2" pan; set aside.
Brown and drain the sausage well. Place the sausage evenly across the bottom of the pan. Beat together the eggs, milk and salt; stir in cheese; pour over sausage and sprinkle with croutons. Bake for 45 minutes, uncovered. Garnish with very thin slices of tomato and bake for 5 minutes longer.  Let sit for 5 minutes before cutting.
This next version below, would use the 13" X 9" X 2" pan, plus a little 8" pan.
For a larger version, use:
1 1/2 lb. sage-flavored sausage
18 large eggs
2 cups whole milk
1 1/2 tsp salt
3 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese
3 cups garlic and onion flavored croutons
For the biggest version made, thus far, use:
2 lb. sage-flavored sausage
23 large eggs
2 2/3 cups milk
1 2/3 tsp salt
3 3/4 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese
3 3/4 cups garlic and onion flavored croutons
This recipe would use 2 13" X 9" X 2" baking pans.

Description: 
This is my mother's favorite brunch casserole recipe.  There are several versions of overnight breakfast casseroles, but this is one you can make and eat the same day that you start making it.  My mother and sister make this often for a variety of functions, and everyone asks for the recipe-and there are never any leftovers!
