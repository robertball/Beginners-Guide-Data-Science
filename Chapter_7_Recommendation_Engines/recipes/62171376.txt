Ingredients:
3 lbs. half runner beans
6 slices of uncooked bacon, diced
2 medium onions, quartered
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon salt (omit if bacon is salt cured)

Directions:
Wash, string, and snap beans.
Place in a large pot, and cover with water.  Stir in brown sugar until dissolved, then add remaining ingredients.
Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat.
Simmer beans 3-4 hours; the longer, the better!
Drain off remaining water to serve.

Description: 
My grandmother makes these greasy beans for every holiday family feast back home in West Virginia using green beans from her garden.  It's a recipe that dates back to several generations of my Appalachian ancestors.
