Ingredients:
6 Roma tomatoes
2 cans baby shrimp, drained and rinsed (or 1/2 pound cooked deveined)
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup Panko bread crumbs (approx)
1 tsp Old Bay seasoning
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Halve the tomatoes lengthwise and scoop out the pulp. Place the tomatoes upside down on paper towels to drain.
In a food processor, mix the shrimp, cream cheese, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, horseradish, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Blend until smooth.
With a pastry bag, pipe the shrimp mixture into the  tomatoes. Place panko and Old Bay in a dish or bowl and combine.  Dip filled tomatoes into panko mixture, so the filling is evenly coated.
Place under broiler for a minute or two, just until topping starts to brown slightly.
Garnish with parsley before serving.

Description: 
I came up with this when I had leftover filling from making the cherry tomatoes.  The Old Bay in the topping makes these wonderfully savory & delicious!  I also used canned baby shrimp, but you could use cooked shrimp.Modified from: Creamy Shrimp Stuffed Cherry Tomatoes
