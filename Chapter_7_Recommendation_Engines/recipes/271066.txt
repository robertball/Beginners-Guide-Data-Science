Ingredients:
2 cups coarsely chopped cooked chicken
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or more to taste
Â½ cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon taco seasoning mix
3  plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1  lime, juiced
1 cup crushed corn chips (such as Frito's(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), divided
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls
1 cup salsa
1 cup sour cream
1  avocado, diced
1 (16 ounce) package corn chips (such as Fritos(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place chicken in a mixing bowl. Add Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, and taco seasoning. Mix well. Place chopped tomatoes in a bowl and add lime juice; stir to combine and add to chicken mixture.
Reserve 2 tablespoons crushed chips and add remaining chips to chicken mixture. Stir to combine.
Sprinkle reserved crushed chips onto a cutting board. Unroll crescent roll dough and press into chips. Separate dough into triangles and arrange in a ring with points facing out on a baking sheet, leaving a 5-inch diameter open circle in the center. Scoop chicken mixture onto the wide end of each triangle. Fold edges of dough over to create a ring.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
Garnish with salsa, sour cream, and avocado. Serve with additional corn chips.
