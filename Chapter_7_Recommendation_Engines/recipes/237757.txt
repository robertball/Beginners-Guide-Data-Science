Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped bell pepper
1 clove minced garlic
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups water
3/4 cup uncooked white rice
1 (16 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
3/4 cup grated American cheese
1/3 cup chopped black olives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Stir onion, bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, and salt with the ground beef; cook and stir until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes.
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Stir kidney beans, tomatoes, and rice into the beef mixture; pour into a large casserole dish and top with American cheese and olives.
Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is beginning to brown around the edges, 45 to 50 minutes.

My mom used to make this when I was a child. It was a meal that was budget friendly for a family of six. Plus, it is full of protein!
