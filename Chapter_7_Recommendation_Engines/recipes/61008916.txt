Ingredients:
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
6 slices Swiss cheese
6 slices ham
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon paprika
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Pound chicken breasts if they are too thick. Place a cheese and ham slice on each breast within 1/2 inch of the edges.Roll the edges of the chicken over the filling, and secure with toothpicks. Mix the flour and paprika in a small bowl, and coat the chicken pieces.
Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the chicken until browned on all sides. Add the wine and bouillon. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
Remove the toothpicks, and transfer the breasts to a warm platter.Slice into pinwheels. Whisk cream  into the skillet. Cook, stirring until thickened, 3-4 minutes, and pour into small bowls for dipping. Serve warm.
