Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/4 cups white rice flour
1 cup confectioners' sugar
3/4 cup gluten-free oat flour (such as Bob's Red MillÂ®)
1 cup butter, softened
Filling:
4 eggs
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1/4 cup white rice flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon lemon zest (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Whisk 1 1/4 cup rice flour, confectioners' sugar, and oat flour together in a bowl. Mix butter into flour mixture until evenly combined; press into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Beat eggs together in a bowl until light and smooth. Combine white sugar, 1/4 cup rice flour, and baking powder together in a separate bowl; stir into beaten eggs until just combined. Stir lemon juice and lemon zest into egg mixture; pour over crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set, about 30 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into bars.
