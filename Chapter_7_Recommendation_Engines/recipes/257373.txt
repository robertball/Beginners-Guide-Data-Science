Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground pork
1/2 head napa cabbage, shredded
1 egg
3 green onions, thinly sliced
1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon sriracha sauce, or more to taste
1 small clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
30 gyoza wrappers, or as needed
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 cup water
Dipping Sauce:
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 dash sriracha sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Combine ground pork, napa cabbage, egg, green onions, ginger, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sriracha sauce, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil in a bowl.
Arrange gyoza wrappers on a flat work surface. Place 1 teaspoon of pork mixture in the middle of each wrapper. Wet edges with your finger or a brush. Fold up sides to form a semicircle; pinch edges to seal.
Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add 12 to 15 gyoza to the skillet. Cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Pour in 1/2 cup water; cover and cook until water is absorbed, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer gyoza to a plate. Repeat with remaining gyoza.
Mix 2 tablespoons soy sauce, rice vinegar, 1 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 dash sriracha sauce together to make dipping sauce. Serve dipping side alongside gyoza.
