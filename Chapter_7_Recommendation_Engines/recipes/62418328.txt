Ingredients:
1 tablespoon yellow curry paste
1/2 cup chicken broth, divided
1 teaspoon white sugar (splenda)
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 1/2 teaspoons light soy sauce
1 (5.6 ounce) can coconut milk
1 tablespoon canola oil
3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, sliced
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1 onion, sliced
2 potatoes - peeled, halved, and sliced
1 cup peas

Directions:
In a bowl, mash the yellow curry paste with about 2 tablespoons of chicken broth to help dissolve the paste; whisk in remaining chicken broth, sugar, curry powder, salt, light soy sauce, and coconut milk. Set aside.
Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat for about 30 seconds; pour in the oil. Let the oil heat until shimmering, about 30 more seconds. Stir the chicken, garlic, and ginger into the hot oil; cook and stir until the chicken has begun to brown and the garlic and ginger are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the onion, potatoes,and peas toss all ingredients in the hot oil, and pour in the sauce mixture. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce heat, and cover the wok. Simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
