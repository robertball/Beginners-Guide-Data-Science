Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups chopped onions
2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic
4 cups milk
6 cups chicken broth
4 cups cooked, boneless and skinless chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces or shredded
1-2 cups chopped green chiles (jarred or frozen), to taste
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add flour and stir the resulting paste until combined. Add onions and garlic and continue stirring until onions are translucent and mixture is a light tan color.
Add the milk and chicken broth and whisk to eliminate any lumps. Stir in the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste again and adjust seasoning if needed.
Serve with fresh flour tortillas and garnish with sour cream and grated Cheddar cheese if you'd like.
