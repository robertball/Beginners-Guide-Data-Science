Description: 
In my opinion......if you're gonna go to all the trouble to make it an awesome shape with incredible decoration on top......it better be the best sugar cookie you can possible make. Because if it doesn't taste out of this world...knock your socks off good......then what's the point???

I've been using the following recipe for many years. I think its secret ingredient is the sour cream. It holds its shape perfectly and tastes the best-est. :)
