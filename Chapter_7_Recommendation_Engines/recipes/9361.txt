Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
3/4 cup light corn syrup
1 cup water
2 egg whites, stiffly beaten

Directions:
Cook syrup, sugar, and water to soft ball stage (a small amount dropped into cold water forms a soft ball).
Pour half of this mixture over stiffly beaten egg whites. Stir.
Cook remaining sugar mixture to brittle stage (a small amount dropped into cold water turns immediately brittle).
Add to previous mixture and beat until candy will hold its shape. Beat again by hand to re-aerate it. Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper. Allow to harden as it cools. Store in refrigerator with waxed paper between layers.

Description: 
This was the only thing I remember Dad cooking around the holidays. And if HE could do it... Just remember my mom's tip: never, never, never try to make candy when it's raining. I don't know why, but it seems to be true!
