Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
2/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup cold butter, cubed
2 1/2 cups sugar
4 eggs
5 cups diced fresh or frozen rhubarb
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine 1 1/2  cup flour and confectioners' sugar. Cut in the butter until crumbly. Pat into a lightly greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking dish. Bake at 350Â° for 13-15 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.
In a large bowl, combine sugar and remaining flour. Add eggs. Stir in the rhubarb, walnuts and coconut; pour over crust. Bake 30-35 minutes longer or until set. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into bars.

I am always looking for a new way to use up all the rhubarb I keep getting out of the garden. This is a nice change of pace from the usual rhubarb pie or cake recipe.
