Description: 
A chili using no meat, eggs or dairy products.  Tastes great in a bread bowl and is easy to make!  This soup should never be made the same way twice!  Add red, green or yellow bell peppers in the first step, experiment with the beans, or add whatever your heart desires.  For a non-veggie dish, add 1 lb ground beef and some sour cream.
