Description: 
Our German host daughter is a lovely girl. Her parents sent this recipe to me along with several others when I felt she might be craving some foods from home. The entire family loves these. The best way I can describe them is like a baked pizza hush puppy. Just fabulous! You may need to adjust to your taste.
