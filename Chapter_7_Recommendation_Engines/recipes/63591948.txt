Once apples have softened and darkened and much of the liquid is reduced, use an immersion blender to process until smooth
let butter cool completely before pouring into a glass jar or airtight container

Description: 
Really simple and really delicious.  Because it doesn't have real butter in it, its still a healthy snack!  I ate it with cheese and crackers to add a little sweetness.  You can use it as a spread on waffles, grilled ham and cheese sandwiches or with peanut butter and it tastes delicious.  It basically tastes like a fancy baby food, but its delicious and versatile so who cares!  And it makes your house smell delicious!
