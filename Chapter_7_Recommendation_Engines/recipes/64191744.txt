Ingredients:
2 Pounds Ground beef or turkey
1 Cup Dry bread crumbs; Italian seasoned
1 Egg
1/2 Pack Dry onion soup mix
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
3/4 Cup Shredded cheese; Mild cheddar
1 Can Chili sauce
Salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients. Form mixture into a loaf, and place in a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Cover with foil.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 45 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking for another 10 to 15 minutes.
Let stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving for easier slicing.
I don't usually add a glaze to mine, but if you like it can be added.
