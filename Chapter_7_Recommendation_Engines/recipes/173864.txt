Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) can solid white tuna packed in water
1 tablespoon low fat mayonnaise
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 slices white or whole wheat bread
1 tablespoon coarsely shredded carrot

Directions:
Drain tuna and mash with a fork. Stir in mayonnaise and lemon juice. Trim crusts from bread and roll out bread using a rolling pin until it is flattened to about 1/16 inch. Spoon one half of the tuna in a log down the middle of each slice of bread, arrange a carrot stick or half of the shredded carrot in the middle of the tuna and roll up the bread tightly to enclose the filling. Cut each roll crosswise into 4 pieces and arrange cut side up in one layer in a container. Cover tightly.
