https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 Medium Collard Greens Leaves
1 7.5 oz can Wild Salmon, drained
2 tbs Red Onion, minced
1 tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1 Garlic clove, minced
1 tbs Capers
6 Cherry Tomatoes, sliced

Directions:
Bring 2 cups of water to boil in a large saute pan.  Place the greens in the water, cover and turn off the heat.  Allow to sit for 1 minute, then rinse the leaves under cold water then drain on paper towels.
Drain the juice from the canned salmon.  Place the salmon (skin and bones too) in a medium bowl and use a fork to flake the salmon.  Add the onion, garlic and capers and mix gently.
NOTE: If using the cooked wild rice add it now.
Lay out each leaf on a plate and divide the salmon mixture and sliced tomatoes among the four leaves.  Feel free to add a little of your favorite premade sugar free salad dressing or an extra splash of olive oil.  Toll the col1lard greens leaf as you would a tortilla and enjoy!
