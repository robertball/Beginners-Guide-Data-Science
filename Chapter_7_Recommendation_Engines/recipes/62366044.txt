4 Thick cut rib-eye steaks
For marinade:
4-5 stalks of lemongrass
4tbsp fish sauce
1tsp dark soy sauce
4tbsp rice wine vinegar
4tbsp vegetable oil
1tsp sugar

1/2 cup dark sesame seeds
1/2 cup chopped peanuts
1/4 cup sea salt

Directions:
Blend all of the marinade ingredients in a small food processor.
Coat both sides of the steaks with the marinade, and store in the refrigerator, covered, for 2-3 hours.
Remove the steaks from marinade, pat dry with paper towel (make sure the steaks are really dry, since that is essential for the beautiful charring).
Rub the steaks with some vegetable oil.
Mix all the crust ingredients in a bowl.
Sprinkle generously on both sides of the steaks.
Press down on the crust to make sure it sticks.
Use a charcoal grill for best flavor.
Grill for 4-5 minutes each side for a medium-rare to medium done steak.
Let the steaks rest for at least 5 minutes before serving/carving.
