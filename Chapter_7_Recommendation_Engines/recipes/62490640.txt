Ingredients:
1/2 cup of amaranth flour
1/2 cup of whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup of brown or muscovado sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder
1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt
1/2 stick of unsalted butted, cold and cut into small cubes
2 eggs, separated
1/2 cup of milk
2 tablespoons of apple butter
1 tablespoon of white sugar

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and butter a 9-inch round cake pan.
2. Sift together the flours, brown sugar, baking powder and salt. Add in the butter cubes and rub the dry mix with the butter using your fingers until it resembles coarse cornmeal.
3. Whisk the egg yolks with the milk and apple butter in a medium bowl.
4. Stir the egg mixture into the dry ingredients until well-incorporated.
5. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whip the egg whites until light and fluffy. Add a tablespoon of sugar and whip until the egg whites are glossy and hold peaks (though not stiff). Scrape in half of the egg whites into the batter, folding in gently. Add the rest of the egg whites until fully incorporated.
6. Transfer the batter into the pan, smoothing the top.
7. Bake for about 30- 35 minutes, rotating halfway through the baking time, until the edges of the cake start to pull away from the pan and the top springs back lightly when you gently press down on it.
8. Serve the cake, sliced into wedges, with a generous dollop of homemade whipped cream.
