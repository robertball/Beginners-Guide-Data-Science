Ingredients:
1 bag baby spinach, rinsed and patted dry
1 bag iceberg salad, also rinsed and patted dry.
1 pint strawberries, rinsed and quartered
1 small red onion, thinly sliced and separated into rings
1 1/2 cups *roasted walnut pieces
1 package crumbled Feta cheese.
Freshly ground pepper, to taste

Directions:
Toss all ingredients together and top with your favorite salad dressing. Look for my recipes for Balsamic Vinaigrette and Creamy Orange Soy Dressing, on this site. Both are excellent with this salad.)
*roasted walnuts: Place walnuts in a single layer on a cookie sheet. Roast in a 360 degree oven for 5-7 minutes. Allow to cool before use.

Description: 
I was asked to take a salad to a backyard get-together and didn't want to just take the same old thing, so I came up with this recipe, which combines features of several different salads I'v had in the past.
