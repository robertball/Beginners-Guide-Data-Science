Description: 
While not true ratatouille, my son jokingly calls it that. For those of us who planted too much, this dish is a fantastic way to use up those prolific zucchini. Serve sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Serve it with polenta for a filling meatless meal. It is great reheated for a quick lunch.
