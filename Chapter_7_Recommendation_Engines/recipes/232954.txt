Peach Curd Recipe

Ingredients:
3 fresh peaches, halved and pitted
4 cups white sugar
2 eggs
4 egg yolks
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon rose water (optional)
3/4 cup butter

Directions:
Blend peach halves in a blender until smooth; transfer to a large bowl.
Beat sugar, eggs, egg yolks, lemon juice, and rose water into peach puree until incorporated.
Melt butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water; stir peach mixture into melted butter, stirring constantly, until curd is thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack peach curd into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool dark area.

Description: 
This is a variation on lemon curd, but made with peaches. We love it with scones or spread on toast or pound cake.
