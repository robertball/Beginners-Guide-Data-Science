Ingredients:
15 apples, using a variety of sweet and tart
1 pear
5 cinnamon sticks
1 lemon (preferably Meyer)

Directions:
Peel apples and pear, chop into small pieces, and put into a large soup pot.
Slice the peel from the lemon and add to the apples.
Add cinnamon sticks to the pot.
Stir well, making sure lemon and cinnamon sticks are well distributed.
Cook over low heat, covered, stirring occasionally, until apples are soft, 1-2 hours depending on the apples and the size of the pieces.
When apples are soft, mash with a potato masher, to retain chunky texture.
Remove cinnamon sticks and lemon peel.
Serve warm or cold.
