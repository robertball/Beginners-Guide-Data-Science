Description: 
Melt in your mouth lemony-goodness!  These muffins are LEMONY, but delicious!  If you prefer, use less lemon juice for the glaze and substitute equal amount of milk for glaze. Or, simply forgo the glaze but this really adds to the overall taste. Also, you may use 24 mini-muffin tins, bake only 10-12 minutes.
