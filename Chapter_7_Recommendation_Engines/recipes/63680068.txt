Description: 
It doesn't take much to make rhubarb sing: some sugar, a bit of flour, and a pat or two of butter. When this lovely double-crust pie emerges from the oven, it's golden outside and sweet and luscious inside. It's especially nice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.Modified from: Fresh Rhubarb Pie
