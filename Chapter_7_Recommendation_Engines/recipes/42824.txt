Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup uncooked orzo pasta
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 potatoes, peeled and diced
1 carrot, sliced
1 onion, chopped
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
salt and pepper to taste
3 cups water
1 cube vegetable bouillon
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in orzo and garlic, and saute until lightly browned. Place potatoes, carrot, and onion in the saucepan. Continue to cook and stir until tender. Season with dried Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.
Mix water into the saucepan. Stir in vegetable bouillon until dissolved. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 12 minutes, or until orzo is tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
This is a great recipe for people on a budget or for picky eaters. It is also very easy to make. This recipe lists the basic ingredients, but you should try adding other vegetables or ingredients to suit your taste. I typically add carrots and onions. Just be sure to add a little extra water to compensate for additional ingredients. If you aren't a vegetarian you can use chicken bouillon.
