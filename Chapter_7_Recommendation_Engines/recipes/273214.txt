Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup coconut butter
1 extra large egg
1 1/2 cups unsweetened applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup crushed walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl.
Melt coconut butter in a small bowl. Beat egg into the butter and pour into the flour mixture. Mix in applesauce and vanilla extract. Fold in raisins and walnuts and mix into a doughy batter.
Scoop batter into the muffin liners using an ice cream scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Let muffins cool for about 5 minutes.
