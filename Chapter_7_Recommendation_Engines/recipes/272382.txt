Ingredients:
1 cup mature sourdough starter
1 egg
2 tablespoons margarine, softened
2 teaspoons margarine, softened
1 2/3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1/3 cup raisins
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
Filling:
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons milk

Directions:
Place sourdough starter, egg, 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons margarine, flour, raisins, 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sugar, and salt in a bread machine in that order. Run Dough cycle. Remove dough from the machine after the cycle is done, about 90 minutes.
Place dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover with a towel. Place in a draft-free place to rise until doubled, 8 hours to overnight.
Mix sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl.
Turn dough out on a floured surface. Roll into a 9-inch wide rectangle about 1/2-inch thick. Brush milk over dough; sprinkle cinnamon-sugar on top. Roll dough up tightly into a log and place in a greased 9x5-inch loaf pan. Let rise until at least 1 inch above the rim of the pan, about 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake loaf in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes.
