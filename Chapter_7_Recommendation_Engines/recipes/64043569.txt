Ingredients:
2 lbs Boneless/Skinless Chicken Breast
2 Cups Buttermilk
1 Cup Garbanzo Bean Flour (I use Bob's Red Mill Natural Foods brand)
1 Cup Gluten Free Cornbread Mix (again Bob's Red Mill is what I use)
Kosher Salt (seriously - KOSHER SALT - don't use table salt!)
Fresh Ground Pepper
Thyme
Seasonings of your choice (I like Jezebel Spicy Spice)

Directions:
Cut up your chicken into your preferred size and shape, be that strips or nuggets. Season your buttermilk with a pinch of kosher salt and some pepper. Soak your chicken in the buttermilk mixture for a minimum of half an hour. Meanwhile in a large bowl combine the garbanzo bean flour, cornbread mix, salt, pepper and seasonings. After the chicken has soaked heat the oil of your choice to hot (I use canola). Dredge your chicken in the dry mixture and then fry it in batches. Taste your chicken when it comes out to see if you want to add another pinch of kosher salt. Enjoy!
