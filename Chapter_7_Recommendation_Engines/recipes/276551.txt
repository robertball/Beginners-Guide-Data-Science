Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 pounds beef stew meat, cubed
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed
1/2 tablespoon white sugar
1 pound baby carrots
3 medium potatoes, cut into chunks
2 cups water
1/2 cup tomato sauce
1/4 cup red cooking wine
8 Manzanilla olives
2 tablespoons sofrito
1 (1.41 ounce) package sazon seasoning with achiote (such as GoyaÂ®)
1/2 tablespoon adobo seasoning
1/2 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Mix flour, salt, and pepper together in a freezer-size plastic bag. Add beef and shake, coating evenly.
Heat enough olive oil to cover the bottom of a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in sugar and cook until it turns golden, about 5 minutes. Add meat and cook until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer browned beef to the bottom of a slow cooker.
Stir carrots, potatoes, water, tomato sauce, wine, olives, sofrito, sazon, adobo seasoning, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce into the slow cooker.
Cover and cook until meat is no longer pink and vegetables are tender, on High 4 to 6 hours, or Low for 8 to 10 hours.
