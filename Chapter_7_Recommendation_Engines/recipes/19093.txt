Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
6 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup shortening
1/2 cup milk
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 cup brown sugar

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch square pan.
In a large bowl mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender to the size of small peas.
In a separate small bowl, beat the egg well, then stir in the milk and vanilla. Add the egg-milk mixture to the flour mixture all at once. Stir carefully until just blended.
Pour batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. Drizzle top with melted butter.
In a small bowl mix together brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Sprinkle on top of cake. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
