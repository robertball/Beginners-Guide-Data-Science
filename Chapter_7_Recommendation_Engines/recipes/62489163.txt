Description: 
It's taken me a year to develop this and everyone who has tried it loves it. It's easy to make by hand, but I assume it's just as easy in a bread machine: Add the milk (cold) first, then the butter and oils, then sugar, salt, flour and the yeast on top. Set the regular bread cycle and it should work out perfect. But personally, I prefer doing it by hand...
