Ingredients:
6 ounces uncooked linguine
1 small onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon olive or canola oil
2 teaspoons butter or stick margarine
1/2 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1/2 inch pieces
2 tablespoons white wine or chicken broth
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Cook linguine according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a nonstick skillet, saute the onion and garlic in oil and butter until tender. Add asparagus; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until crisp-tender. Add wine or broth; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until liquid is reduced. Remove from the heat.
Drain linguine; add to asparagus mixture. Add remaining ingredients; toss to coat. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Pasta and asparagus are tossed together in this mildly-seasoned side dish that makes any appealing partner to poultry or fish. 'I lightened up the original recipe by reducing the amount of butter and substituting olive oil,' informs Carolyn DiPasquale of Middletown, Rhode Island.
