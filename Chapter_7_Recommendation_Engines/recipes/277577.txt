Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix
4 egg whites
1/3 cup canola oil
2 1/2 tablespoons raspberry puree
1 teaspoon raspberry extract
2 drops red food coloring, or as desired
1/4 cup chocolate chips, or to taste
Raspberry Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon milk
2 teaspoons light corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon raspberry extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Mix cake mix, egg whites, oil, raspberry puree, raspberry extract, and red food coloring together in a bowl until well blended. Stir in chocolate chips.
Place dough by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, about 8 minutes. Let cool completely.
Combine powdered sugar, milk, corn syrup, and raspberry extract together for glaze in a bowl until smooth. If too thick, add milk sparingly until desired consistency is reached. Glaze cooled cookies as desired.

Description: 
I decided to get a little creative with a new flavor on cake mix cookies. The combination of raspberry and chocolate are delicious together. The cookie is very light and cake-like.
