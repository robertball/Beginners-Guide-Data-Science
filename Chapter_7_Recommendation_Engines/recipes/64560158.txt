Description: 
A healthy alternative to regular banana bread recipes.
* I use all organic ingredients. The millet is alkalizing and cinnamon helps to stabilize blood sugar. I use sucanat because it retains molasses which is high in potassium. I have been trying out a new spelt flour that is sprouted to help with the digestion thereof. 

Your food is your best medicine. Enjoy!
