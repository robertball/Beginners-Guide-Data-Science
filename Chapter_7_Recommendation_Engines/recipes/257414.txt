Ingredients:
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups chocolate chips, divided
1/4 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Place brown sugar and butter in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy, 4 to 5 minutes. Mix in milk, vanilla, and salt. Add flour; mix thoroughly by hand. Fold 1 cup chocolate chips into the dough. Cover and refrigerate for about 1 hour.
Scoop out tablespoonfuls of cookie dough and roll into round balls. Arrange them on a plate or baking sheet that will fit in the freezer. Freeze until hard, about 1 hour.
Place 1 1/2 cup chocolate chips and white chocolate chips in separate microwave-safe bowls. Microwave until soft, about 30 seconds. Stir. Continue to microwave in 10-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until completely melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Dip cookie dough balls in melted chocolate. Drizzle white chocolate on top. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
These truffles are made with edible cookie dough, so they don't contain eggs and are safe to eat! They are delicious and fairly easy to make! Keep them in the fridge to prevent the chocolate from melting.
