Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup powdered peanut butter (such as PB2Â®)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/3 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking dish.
Stir flour, powdered peanut butter, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat peanut butter and butter together in a bowl until creamy. Gradually add white sugar and brown sugar; beat until fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat until smooth. Stir in flour mixture and chocolate chips until incorporated into batter. Spread batter into prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
I loved peanut butter brownies as a kid but my adult taste buds now find the available recipes overly sweet with a mild peanut flavor. This updated recipe relies on powdered peanuts to boost peanut flavor. I've reduced the sugar by about 1/3 from the typical recipes. This recipe reflects the best of three alternate variations that I attempted.
