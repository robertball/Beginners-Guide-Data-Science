Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
1 1/4 cups cake flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/3 cup white sugar
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk
1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut
Icing:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons passion fruit nectar
1 teaspoon heavy whipping cream
24 edible flowers (such as violets or pansies)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 mini muffin tins with mini paper liners.
Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl. Beat butter, white sugar, egg, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until creamy, about 3 minutes. Beat flour mixture into creamed butter mixture, keeping mixer on low speed, until smooth. Add coconut milk and beat until batter is smooth; fold in shredded coconut.
Spoon rounded tablespoons batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to a rack to cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes.
Mix confectioners' sugar, passion fruit nectar, and cream together in a small bowl until smooth. Dip tops of cupcakes into icing, letting excess drip off. Let icing set for 2 minutes; garnish with flowers.
