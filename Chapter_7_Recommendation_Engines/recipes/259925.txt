Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter, or more to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  butternut squash, peeled and cubed
2  potatoes, peeled and cubed
1  onion, diced
1  carrot, peeled and chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 quart chicken broth, or more as needed
1  pear - peeled, cored, and sliced
¼ teaspoon ground ginger
⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
⅛ teaspoon ground allspice
⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
salt and ground black pepper to taste
¼ cup heavy cream

Directions:
Heat butter and olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add butternut squash, potatoes, onion, carrot, celery, and garlic; cook and stir until evenly coated and warmed through, about 10 minutes.
Pour enough chicken broth into the pot to cover the butternut squash mixture. Cook for 10 minutes. Add pear; simmer until potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes. Season with ginger, cayenne pepper, allspice, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
Fill a blender halfway with soup. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour into a pot. Repeat with remaining soup.
Stir heavy cream into the blended soup. Cook until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe hits the spot for me any cold night. It makes a lot, so I pull it out for dinner parties too and it's yet to go over poorly. Feel free to experiment. I go by my mother's philosophy of using what's in your pantry, so throw some different stuff in there if you want!
