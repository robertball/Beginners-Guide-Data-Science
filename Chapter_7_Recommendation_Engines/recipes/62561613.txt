2 cups homemade bread crumbs
1 egg
1/4 cup 2% milk
1/4 well chopped onions (optional)
1 tablespoon canola oil

Directions:
NOTE: You can use store bought bread crumbs if you want. I use my own homemade bread crumbs.
Put egg in a large bowl and slightly beat it. Add Milk and then bread crumbs, onions and lastly add the ground turkey and mix well with hands.
Heat about 1 tablesppon canola oil in fry pan on med high heat. Made mixture into small balls and cook covered for about 4-5 minutes. Take pancake turner and scrap bottom of pan to loosen the meatballs and gently turn them. Recover another 4 minutes, watching closely or they will get too brown. Meatballs should be cooked thru in about 10 minutes total. You can now add them to what ever recipe you wish.
