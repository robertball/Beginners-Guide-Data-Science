Description: 
Chase and I were in a hurry tonight because we need to go on a 6 mile walk after dinner. So I need to do something very FAST and that would fuel us enough for the walk ahead. And this is what I knew could do the job, and fill all my health goals at the same time. By the way this one is really half way home made.
