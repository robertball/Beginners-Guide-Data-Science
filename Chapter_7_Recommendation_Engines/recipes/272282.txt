No mayonnaise in this potato-corn salad. 
This different presentation is pretty with small skin-on whole potatoes that you smash. If desired, cover and chill up to 24 hours. Bring to room temperature at least 1 hour before serving. If needed, toss with additional olive oil and vinegar before serving.
