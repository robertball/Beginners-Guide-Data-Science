Ingredients:
1 pastry for 9-inch double crust pie
2 (4 ounce) packages marzipan, crumbled
1 stick salted butter, softened
2 eggs, slightly beaten
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 large Bartlett pears - peeled, cored, and sliced lengthwise into 1/4 inch strips
1 pinch confectioners' sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with the bottom crust.
Blend marzipan and butter together in a food processor until smooth. Add eggs and flour and continue mixing until very smooth. Pour into the pie crust. Mount sliced pears over the marzipan cream. Cover with the top crust and flute the edges. Make a few slices in the top crust to vent.
Bake in the preheated oven, covering loosely with foil if crust gets too dark, until golden brown and heated through, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle sugar on top. Let cool completely to give filling a chance to set.

Description: 
A different take on a pear pie, using sweet almond paste (marzipan) in the cream filling. The almond flavor delicately compliments the pears, without too much sweetness. Select pears that are 'just' ripe, not too firm or too soft.
