Ingredients:
All Purpose Flour
Corn Starch

Directions:
If your recipe calls for 1 cup of cake flour, you will measure out 1 cup of all purpose flour into a sifter.
Using your measuring spoon, remove 2 T of all purpose flour, and replace those 2 T with 2 T of cornstarch.
Sift the all purpose flour with the cornstarch at least 4 times, and store in an airtight container.
You will now have 1 c of cake flour, measured.
Ratios:
For every 1 cup of flour remove 2 Tbsp of flour.
Replace missing flour with 2 Tbsp of cornstarch.
Be sure to sift well.
