Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups regular or quick-cooking oats
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala (store-bought or homemade)
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup golden raisins

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease two cookie sheets.
Combine the oats, flour, garam masala, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.
Beat the butter and sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until thoroughly mixed and creamy. (If you're impatient like me and don't let the butter get warm enough before starting, use a fork to mash it together with the sugars, then finish up with the mixer.)
Add the eggs one at a time, and beat until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla. Stir in the flour mixture until just combined. I usually add it about a third at a time to avoid overwhelming the egg mixture. Stir in raisins.
Using a tablespoon measuring spoon, scoop rounded balls of dough onto the cookie sheets. Flatten slightly. Bake until golden, 12 to 14 minutes (depending on your oven). Cool on wire racks

I loved the surprising spicy flavors in the cookie. Think of this as a cinnamon-flavored cookie on steroids!
