Ingredients:
12 slices bread, made into 24,  2 inch rounds
2 tablespoons melted butter.
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups milk
6 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons heavy cream
salt and pepper to taste
2 pounds sliced roasted turkey
4 roma tomatos, thinly sliced
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
8 slices crispy bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F.  Brush both sides of bread rounds with melted buyer.  Place on a baking sheet.  Bake for 4-6 minutes, or until lightly golden.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
Stir in flour with a whisk or fork, and continue to cook and stir until it begins to brown slightly.
Gradually whisk in the milk so that no lumps form, then bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
Mix in 6 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese and then stir in the beaten egg to thicken. Do not allow the sauce to boil once the egg has been mixed in.
Remove from the heat and stir in the cream.
Preheat the oven's broiler.
Cover each round with a bite size piece of turkey.
Place tomato slice
Spoon sauce over each round.
Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese.
Place the dishes under the broiler and cook until the top is speckled brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from the broiler and arrange two slices of bacon in a cross shape on top of each bite.
Serve immediately.
