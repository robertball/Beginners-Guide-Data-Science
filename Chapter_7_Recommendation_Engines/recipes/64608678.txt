Add mix-ins (such as chocolate chips, sprinkles, nuts dried fruit, etc.) into the dough until every spoonful of dough has mix-in.
Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets 3 inches apart.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes until are slightly golden.  Cool 1 minute on wire rack; remove from baking sheets and cool completely.
