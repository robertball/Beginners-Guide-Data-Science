Ingredients:
1 cup MUSSELMAN'S® Apple Butter
1/4 small onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, smashed
2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon five-spice seasoning
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
8 slider rolls or small dinner rolls
Pickled jalapenos
Green onions, chopped

Directions:
Combine first six ingredients (through the five-spice seasoning) in your slow cooker. Mix well. Add the chicken breasts, turning so they are coated with the sauce.
Cover and cook on high for 4 hours. Use the back of a wooden spoon to gently shred the chicken. Stir so that the shredded chicken is evenly coated with the sauce. Set slow cooker to warm and let chicken stand for 15 minutes to soak up the sauce.
Serve the pulled chicken on rolls. Top with pickled jalapenos and chopped green onions.
