Ingredients:
1/2 a roasted butternut squash, pureed with a little water
olive oil
salt
1 onion, diced
2 carrots, diced
1 bunch scallions, chopped
1 tsp Spike no-salt seasoning
1 tsp dried thyme
3 medium-sized Idaho potatoes, cut in smallish pieces
1 quart chicken broth or stock
water to thin soup if too thick
black pepper
lemon juice
hot sauce of choice

Directions:
To roast the squash, cut it in half and remove seeds.Roast flesh-side down on a cookie sheet at 400 for 45-50 minutes.(Rub flesh-side with olive oil to prevent sticking.) This may be done a day or two ahead of time.
Sweat onion,carrots, and all but a couple of the green onions and seasonings over medium heat in a good-sized stock pot till just tender. Add potato pieces and then broth/stock to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer till potatoes are tender.  Whiz with a hand blender or purée in food processor till smooth.  Add puréed squash and heat through.  Taste for seasoning, (I add Tabasco, lemon juice and black pepper here) and serve in warmed bowls, garnished with remaining scallions and grated cheese of your choice.
