Ingredients:
¼ cup lemon juice
¼ cup wok oil
⅛ cup red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon onion flakes
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1  lemon, zested
1 teaspoon Greek seasoning
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon dried thyme
3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, or as needed, cut into 1-inch pieces
8  bamboo skewers, or as needed, soaked in water for 30 minutes

Directions:
Whisk lemon juice, oil, vinegar, onion flakes, garlic, lemon zest, Greek seasoning, poultry seasoning, oregano, pepper, and thyme together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag.
Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess; thread onto skewers. Discard the remaining marinade. Place the skewers on a baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
