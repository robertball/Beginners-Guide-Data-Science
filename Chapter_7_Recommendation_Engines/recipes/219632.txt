Ingredients:
1 pound 95% lean ground beef
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped bell peppers (orange, red, yellow, or green)
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper
2 (15 ounce) cans light kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup water
1 cup Daisy Brand Light Sour Cream

Directions:
In a Dutch oven, over medium heat, cook and stir the ground beef, onion, pepper, and garlic until beef is no longer pink and the vegetables are crisp tender (8 to 9 minutes). Add the chili powder, cumin and pepper to the Dutch oven. Continue cooking for 1 minute. Add the kidney beans, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, and water to the Dutch oven. Cook and stir until the chili comes to a boil (5 to 6 minutes). Reduce the heat to medium low. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for 25 to 30 minutes. Serve individual bowls of chili with a dollop of Daisy Sour Cream. Garnish with shredded cheese, avocado slices, and a few dashes of hot pepper sauce if desired.
