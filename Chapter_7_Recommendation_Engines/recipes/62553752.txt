Ingredients:
1 c. sugar
1 c. water
1 c. seeded raisins
1 c. seedless raisins
1/2 c. butter or margarine
1 t. cinnamon
1 t. ground cloves
1/2 t. nutmeg
1/4 t. salt
1/4 c. boiling water
1 t. baking soda
2 c. flour
1 c. chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, mix together sugar, 1 c. water, raisins, butter, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and salt.  Bring to a full boil over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally.  Boil 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and let cool.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees when raisin mixture is cool.  Put baking soda in a mug and add 1/4 c. boiling water, mix and then add to raisin mixture.  Stir well (it will foam up).  Add flour and mix well.  Stir in walnuts.
Spray mini muffin pans with non-stick spray (or grease each one).  Fill pans 2/3 full and bake for approximately 12 minutes.  Test with a toothpick.  Let cool in pans for 15 minutes. Remove, using a thin sharp knife to loosen edges, and place on a rack to cool completely.  Store tightly covered.
