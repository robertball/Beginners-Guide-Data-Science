Title:
Caramel Fudge Brownies Recipe

Ingredients:
14 oz individually wrapped caramels (I think I used about 20)
1 can sweetened condensed milk
2 cups sugar
4 eggs
3/4 cup cocoa
1/3 cup milk
1 cup butter
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Melt the caramels with sweetened condensed milk over low heat, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside.
Preheat oven to 350F. Melt the butter in a Pyrex cup or microwave safe bowl. Set aside
Combine the sugar and eggs using an electric mixer. Add the cocoa, milk and melted butter, and mix well (by hand). Stir the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, then stir in the chocolate chips.
Prepare a 13x9 pan - I lined with foil sprayed well with cooking spray; you can just grease the pan itself very well, but it might get messy cutting and removing the brownies later. As it was, I had to spend some time peeling the foil off the brownies.
Pour 1/2 to 2/3 of the batter into the prepared pan, and bake for 15-17 minutes. Remove from the oven, and drop spoonfuls of the caramel mixture over top of the brownie base - cover as much of the base as possible with caramel (my caramel came out kind of thick and wouldn't pour well - don't try to spread it too much though). Drop spoonfuls of the remaining brownie batter over top of the caramel, again trying to cover it as best as possible; gently use a wooden spoon to spread it a bit or swirl with a knife. Bake for approx. 30 minutes more. Let cool in pan for awhile, then refrigerate until well chilled (I chilled them about 4 hours).
