Ingredients:
1 cup corn oil for frying
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 (3/4 inch) thick pork chops
1 cup pepper sauce (such as Frank's Red HotÂ®)

Directions:
Heat corn oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, or until a pinch of flour sizzles in it.
In a shallow dish, stir together the flour, garlic salt, pepper, and cayenne. Dredge pork chops in this mixture, then place in the hot oil. Cook for about 5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. Remove from the pan, and drain on paper towels.
Pour the hot sauce into a shallow dish. Dip pork chops one at a time into the hot sauce, so they are nicely coated. You will have teary-eyed pork chops at your fingertips.
