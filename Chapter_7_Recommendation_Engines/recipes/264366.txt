Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 fresh mushrooms, or more to taste, sliced
salt to taste
20 sugar snap peas, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat a saute pan over medium heat. Add olive oil. Season mushrooms with salt and saute in olive oil until soft, about 5 minutes.
While mushrooms are cooking, bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add sugar snap peas; cook until bright green, 1 to 2 minutes. Take sugar snap peas out of the water with a slotted spoon and toss them with the mushrooms in the pan, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and serve immediately.
