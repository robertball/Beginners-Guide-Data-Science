Ingredients:
3-4 chicken breasts, cubed (we usually do half a breast per person)
¼ cup red onion, cut in thin slices (about half an onion) (You can mince it if you have picky eaters who would be suspicious of the strips)
2 T Olive Oil
1 red pepper, sliced in quarter inch strips and then halved
1-2 green zucchini, sliced in thin half rounds
1-2 yellow zucchini squash, cut the same way
6-8 brown mushrooms, cut in half slices
3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
1 can tomato paste (you may need to add 2 t sugar to this if your paste is too acidic)
8 ounces water or chicken stock (or broth)
1 T herbes de provences (or you can substitute 1 T Italian seasoning or 2-3 T of fresh herbs on handparsley and/or rosemary and basil are good.)
2 t cumin (this gives it an “earthy” taste)
2 t celery salt (or seasoning salt or season all)
2 t oregano
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Saute chicken and onion in olive oil until chicken is mostly cooked through. Add peppers, green and yellow zucchini, mushrooms and garlic. (You could add 2 cups cubed eggplant and/or two diced tomatoes here—my family will not allow me to do this, but it would be delicieux!) Cook for about 4-5 minutes and then add garlic. Cook for 3-4 more minutes, stir often to avoid burning the garlic. Add tomato paste and liquid of your choice. Add herbs, cumin, celery salt, and oregano and stir well. If the mixture gets too thick, simply add more of the liquid (it really also depends on how “saucy” you like it). When vegetables are just about completely cooked through (about 4-5 more minutes), you’re ready to dig in. (Unless you’re more like my husband and like them to be softer. . . in this case, you can cook for 4-5 more minutes. We try and compromise on this.) Add salt and pepper to taste before serving.

Description: 
This French dish uses loads of Mediterranean vegetables and is a perfect way to use up the zucchini flooding your garden! We like to add chicken to ours to make it a whole meal and we usually serve it over rice. This is our family’s version, so it doesn’t have the eggplant or the fresh tomatoes that you see in most traditional ratatouille recipes (maybe when the kids grow up a little?). . . but this recipe did get the kids to start eating zucchini and mushrooms, which we never thought would happen!
