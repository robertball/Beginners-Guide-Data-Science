Description: 
This is my vegetarian version of a Mexican breakfast casserole based on items I usually have in my fridge. Since I rarely keep cream or half-and-half, I decided to try cream cheese and was pleased with how it worked out. 
I think this recipe would lend itself well to different vegetables or adding meat.
