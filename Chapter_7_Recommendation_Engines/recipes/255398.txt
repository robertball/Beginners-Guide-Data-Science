Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon peanut butter
2 tablespoons finely chopped spring onion
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/8 teaspoon red chile powder, or to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 pounds pork tenderloin, cut into cubes
1 onion, cut into chunks, or to taste
1 (8 ounce) package fresh mushrooms, or to taste
1 large red bell pepper, cut into chunks, or to taste
1 zucchini, cut into chunks, or to taste

Directions:
Mix oil, soy sauce, and peanut butter together in a bowl until blended and creamy. Stir in spring onion, sesame seeds, garlic, red chile powder, salt, and pepper. Add pork to marinade; turn to coat.
Marinate pork in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Thread pork, onion, mushrooms, red bell pepper, and zucchini onto skewers. Transfer to the baking sheet. Pour marinade on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until pork is tender and browned, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a juicy dish and really easy to prepare. I have made these for years and they're still a huge favorite with family and friends. I serve them with mushroom rice and garlic bread. This is a sauceless recipe but the meat is so succulent you don't need it.
