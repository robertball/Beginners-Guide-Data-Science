Ingredients:
3 Tablespoons Butter
1 Cup Finely Diced Celery
2 Shallots Finely Diced
2 Large Cloves Garlic Finely Diced
2 Teaspoons Old Bay Seasoning
1 Teaspoon Black Pepper
1/2 Teaspoon Salt
1 Tablespoon Tomato Paste
1 1/2 to 2 Tablespoons Flour
1/2 Cup Dry Sherry
1 16 ounce Container of Lump Crab (or Claw Meat or Fresh Crab)
1 16 ounce Can of Chicken Broth
2 Cups Heavy Cream

Directions:
Combine the crab meat with the sherry. Cover and refrigerate.
Over medium heat melt the butter, do not burn it
Add the shallots, celery, garlic, salt, pepper and Old Bay. Stir and let cook until the vegetables are translucent and are getting soft.
Add the tomato paste and cook for another couple of minutes.
Add the flour and cook for two to three minutes, stirring all the time.
While whisking, add the heavy cream and chicken broth and bring to a low boil. Let low boil for about 1 minute, still whisking constantly. Turn the heat down and let simmer until slightly reduced and thickening.
If you like at this point you can use an immersion blender to smooth the creamed broth out.
Taste, and add more salt, pepper or Old Bay, if you think it needs it.
Add the crab and sherry mixture to the pot and simmer for 15 minutes, so the crab is heated through and flavors have blended.
Again if you do not like the consistency you can use and immersion blender.
This soup does taste better the second day after the flavors have really blended.
