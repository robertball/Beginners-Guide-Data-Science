Ingredients:
2 cups yellow cornmeal
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup corn oil
2 tablespoons honey
1 cup pumpkin puree
1 cup buttermilk

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, baking powder and baking soda. Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs, oil, honey, pumpkin puree and buttermilk. Let the batter stand while you preheat the oven.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Heat an 8 or 9 inch cast-iron skillet on the stovetop until hot. Coat with cooking spray, then pour in the cornbread batter.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until cornbread starts to pull away from the sides of the pan.

Description: 
I was wondering what to do with the last cup of pumpkin puree that wouldn't fit into my freezer container, and a voice in my head said 'put it in cornbread!' I must have a Muse because this is better than my cornbread has ever been.  If your pumpkin is on the wet side, reduce the buttermilk a bit. It's a good idea to let the batter sit 10 to 20 minutes before baking to soften the cornmeal. This can also be baked in a greased cake pan (9-inch square) at 400 degrees F.
