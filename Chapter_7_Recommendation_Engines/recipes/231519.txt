Ingredients:
1 cup rice flour
1 cup cooked rice
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup applesauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup shredded zucchini

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin or line with paper liners.
Beat rice flour, rice, sugar, applesauce, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl with an electric mixer for 2 minutes. Add zucchini and blend for 1 minute. Fill muffin cups about 2/3 full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
I created this for my son who has many food allergies and doesn't like vegetables. This moist zucchini muffin is so tasty that he wanted seconds! The recipe has no wheat, no eggs, and no dairy in it. What a nice surprise to sink your teeth into.
