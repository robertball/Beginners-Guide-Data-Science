Ingredients:
4 baking potatoes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Scrub the potato and prick it with a fork to prevent steam from building up and causing the potato to explode in your oven. Bake in microwave for 10 minutes (4 potatoes or 7 for 2). Wrap in foil or vegetable oil (keeps skin soft). Bake for 20 minutes. Then squish before cutting into potato to make it fluffy on the inside.
