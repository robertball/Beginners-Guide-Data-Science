Ingredients:
8 dried New Mexico chiles, stems removed and broken into small pieces
2 cups low sodium chicken broth
4 pounds pork shoulder, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch cubes
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon canola oil
6 garlic cloves
1 cup onion, diced
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon kosher salt (optional)
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce (optional)

Directions:
Place chiles in a heat proof bowl. Bring chicken broth to a boil on stove top and pour over the chiles and let soften, about 30 minutes.
While the chiles are soaking mix flour with pork pieces add oil to the pot and set the saute function. Saute the pork pieces in small batches until golden brown.
Place the chiles, garlic, chipotles and broth in a blender and blend until smooth.
Combine blended sauce, vinegar, onions, salt, oregano and cumin. Pour This mix over pork pieces in the IP.
Set IP on manual high pressure and cook for 20 minutes. Quick release pressure when done.
The sauce thickens as it cools a bit but if your sauce is too thin set your pot on saute for 5-10 minutes to let some of it evaporate, or make a slurry by mixing 1 tablespoon of corn starch and 3 tablespoons of water and pour into the pot. Let it boil on saute until thickened.
