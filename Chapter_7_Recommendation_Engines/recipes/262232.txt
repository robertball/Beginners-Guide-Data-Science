Ingredients:
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon milk, or more as needed (optional)
1 cup slivered almonds, or to taste
1/2 cup chopped candied orange peel

Directions:
Place chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and thin slightly with milk.
Mix almonds and candied orange peel together in the bowl. Add chocolate and toss with a spatula until evenly coated.
Spoon mixture into 1 1/2-inch mounds on a sheet of waxed or parchment paper. Chill for at least 4 hours before serving.

Description: 
Candied orange peel and slivered almonds covered with chocolate and made into clusters. You can also do this with candied lime, lemon, or grapefruit and any kind of slivered nut. Orange and almond are my favorite.
