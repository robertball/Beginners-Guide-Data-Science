Description: 
Growing up my mother always made egg custard for a treat. I came across this high-protein, healthier version (her version used white sugar) years ago and I've been making it ever since. You can add a variety of things, such as shredded coconut or chopped nuts, to give it a different flavor. I also change extracts, such as almond or maple, for even more options.
