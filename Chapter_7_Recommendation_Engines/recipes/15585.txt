1 cup light corn syrup
1 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups peanut butter
6 cups crisp rice cereal

1/2 cup butterscotch chips

Directions:
Generously butter a 9x13 inch baking pan. Set aside.
In a large pot, mix together corn syrup, sugar, and peanut butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring until peanut butter melts. Bring mixture to a boil. Remove from heat, and stir in crisp rice cereal.
Transfer mixture into a well buttered 9x13 inch pan.  With your hands well buttered, pat it down into pan.
In a medium saucepan, over medium low heat, melt chocolate chips and butterscotch chips until smooth. Spread over top of bars and let bars cool. Cut into squares.
