Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Smucker's® Apricot Preserves
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut lengthwise into eight wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a heavy saucepan, combine SMUCKER'S(R) preserves and water. Over medium high heat, bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove mixture from heat and stir in lemon juice, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon.
Arrange sweet potatoes in a baking pan. Using a pastry brush, baste potatoes thoroughly with sauce, using about half the sauce. Bake about 40 minutes, or until tender, basting with remaining sauce about halfway through cooking time.
