Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef, up to 1.5 lbs
1 teaspoon garlic powder (or 1 large garlic clove, minced)
1 16-ounce can refried beans
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 tablespoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 14-ounce can diced tomatoes, with juice
1 4-ounce can chopped green chiles
10 6-inch corn tortillas
1-1/2 cups your favorite salsa, divided
1-1/2 cups sour cream
1/2 cup chopped green onions
2 cups grated sharp cheddar, longhorn or colby cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
In a large skillet, brown the ground beef. Add the garlic and stir-fry for a few minutes. In a large bowl, combine the cooked ground beef and garlic with the refried beans, oregano, chili powder, cumin, tomatoes and chiles.
Line the baking dish with half of the tortillas. Spoon half of the ground beef mixture evenly over the tortillas. Then top with the remaining 5 tortillas. Spread 1 cup of the salsa in an even layer over the tortillas followed by the remaining one-half of the ground beef mixture.
Bake at 350°F for 25 minutes. Remove from oven.
Combine the remaining 1/2 cup salsa, sour cream, and green onions. Spread evenly over casserole, and top with shredded cheese. Return to the oven and bake an additional 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
