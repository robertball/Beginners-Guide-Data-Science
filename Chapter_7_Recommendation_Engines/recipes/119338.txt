Ingredients:
1/2 cup cold butter (no substitutes)
1 (3 ounce) package cold cream cheese
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup ground walnuts
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla or almond extract
1 egg, lightly beaten
confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, cut butter and cream cheese into flour until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Using your hands, blend mixture together until  smooth dough forms, about 3 minutes. Pat into a rectangle; wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour or until firm.  For filling, combine the walnuts, sugar, milk and vanilla.
Unwrap dough and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 17-1/2-in. x 10-in. rectangle; cut into 2-1/2-in. squares. Place a level teaspoonful of filling in the center of each square. Moisten edges with water; fold in half and seal with a fork. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Brush with egg. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
