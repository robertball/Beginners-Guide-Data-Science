Title:
Mike's Eggs (Eggs in a Nest) Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 packages puff pastry
3 Tablespoons butter
6 eggs
6 oz. cream cheese
1/4 cup milk
2 Tablespoons fresh chopped chives, plus some for garnish
salt and pepper to taste ( I always use sea salt and freshly grated pepper)

Directions:
Bake the puff pastry shells according to directions.
While pastries are in the oven, beat eggs together with milk, chives, salt, and pepper.
Melt butter in non-stick pan and add egg mixture.
Cut cream cheese into fairly small cubes and add it to eggs as you are scrambling them.
Be careful not to over scramble or over cook.
When pastries are baked, remove tops and spoon egg mixture into each "nest".
Put it back in the oven for 5 minutes or so until eggs are reheated.
Garnish with fresh chives.

Description: 
My husband's Uncle Mike used to run a B&B in Boca Raton, and he gave us this recipe.  Now we make it every year for our Christmas Jammy Brunch!  We serve this with Cheese Blintzes and Applewood Smoked Bacon.  Then we roll away from the table :-)
Enjoy...
