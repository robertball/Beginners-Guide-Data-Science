Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups pancake mix
2 2/3 cups skim milk, or as needed
2 cups part-skim ricotta cheese

Directions:
Whisk together the pancake mix, skim milk, and ricotta in a bowl until smooth. Batter should be thick; add more milk if necessary to get desired consistency.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
These are quick and easy using a pancake mix as a base or the dry ingredients from your favorite pancake recipe.  They are a nice change from traditional pancakes and a great way to use up leftover ricotta cheese. Serve with maple or fruit syrup.
