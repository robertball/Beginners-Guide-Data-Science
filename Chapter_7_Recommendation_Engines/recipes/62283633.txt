Ingredients:
1 lb box whole grain short pasta(w/flax if u like)
10oz block of extra sharp cheddar
4 slices of american cheese
1/2c. parm cheese
1/2c water
1 1/2c milk(skim)
2 1/2c butternut squash soup(trader joes)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Pour dry pasta into a 9x11 baking dish. Add 1/2c water to the pasta.
In a large saucepan, melt the butter. Stir in flour until smooth; gradually add milk.(I like a whisk here) Bring to a low boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.Now begin adding the  cheeses and stir until melted and silky smooth. Now slowly add the butternut squash soup. Taste and decide if it needs the salt(some cheeses are very salty)  Add salt and pepper. Pour over pasta and mix.  Put into a 350 degree oven for 50 min or until the top begins to brown... remove and let rest for 10 min.  Serve HOT!!
