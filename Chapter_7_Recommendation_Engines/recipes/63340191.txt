Ingredients:
Vegetable oil cooking spray
1 (15 oz) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 c. vegetable broth
2 garlic cloves
1 tsp. dried oregano
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
1 large red onion, chopped
2 c chopped zucchini
1 c frozen corn, thawed
1 tsp. ground cumin
2 Tbsp minced fresh cilantro
Kosher or sea salt to taste
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 (8-inch) whole wheat tortillas
3/4 c prepared chunky salsa

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Coat a 10-inch pie plate with cooking spray and set aside.
2. Add the beans, 1/4 c broth, garlic, oregano, and cayenne to a food processor or blender and blend until smooth but thick, set aside.
3. Heat the remaining 1/4 c broth in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and saute for 5 minutes. Put in the zucchini and corn and saute for 3 minutes. Add the cumin and cilantro and saute for 1 minute. Season with salt and black pepper.
4. Place one tortilla in the prepared pie plate. Spread about one-third of the bean mixture over the tortilla. Using a slotted spoon, add one-third of the vegetable mixture on top of the beans. Add one-third of the salsa over the vegetables and top with another tortilla. Make two more layers in the same fashion, to make a total of three layers.
5. Bake uncovered for about 30 minutes. Cut into wedges to serve.
