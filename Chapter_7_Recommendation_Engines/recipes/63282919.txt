Ingredients:
1/2 C milk
2 T melted butter
1 egg
1 cup flour
2 t baking powder
2 T sugar
1/2 t salt

Directions:
Beat the milk, butter and egg lightly in a large bowl.
Add the sifted dry ingredients. Stir just enough to dampen the flour. If necessary, add more milk to make the batter as thick as heavy cream.
Lightly grease griddle or skillet. Heat. When water drops sprinkled on the pan "dance" around, the pan is hot enough to fry the pancakes.
