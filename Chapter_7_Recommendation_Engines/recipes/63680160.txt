Ingredients:
3 slabs of baby back ribs, silver skin removed
2 tablespoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon brown sugar

Directions:
1. Cut each rack of ribs in half to make them easier to handle, and lay them on a baking sheet or tray.
2. Mix dry ingredients in a small bowl and rub into the ribs, front and back. Really massaging it in, and use all the rub. Cover the sheet and place in the fridge for at least an hour, and up to 10 hours.
3. Light your grill and set the heat to medium low, with evenly distributed heat. When the grill is heated, add the ribs bone-side down, and close the lid.
4. Let them go for about 20 minutes, then flip them. Close the lid and reduce heat to low. Let the ribs cook another 15 minutes, then check them. Move them around a little, keeping them meat-side down, so that they get even color on the meat side. Close the lid again.
5. The ribs will need to cook for about 10 minutes more, for a total of about 45 minutes, but every grill is different. When the meat is receding from the bone and the meat is really dark and caramelized, pull them off.
6. Let the ribs rest for about 15 minutes before carving and serving.
