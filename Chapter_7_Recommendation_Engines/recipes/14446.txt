Description: 
This is a very quick and easy salad to make. The name is Swedish; it literally means 'Grandmother's Striped Salad.' It's 'striped' because the ingredients are colorful and julienned.  My grandmother and I created this salad about 15 years ago so the measurements are estimated. Just use as much as you need or want.
