Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon roasted garlic
6 small potatoes (such as Klondike GourmetÂ® red skin potatoes), cut into bite-size pieces, or more to taste
1 bunch kale, stems removed and discarded, leaves torn into bite-size pieces
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 (14 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
4 drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
1 (32 ounce) carton chicken broth

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir potatoes into onion mixture and cook until potatoes are lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir kale into potato mixture and drizzle in sesame oil. Cook and stir until kale is wilted, about 2 minutes. Stir black beans and sun-dried tomatoes into kale-potato mixture; pour in chicken broth. Simmer soup until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Unable to find a recipe for kale using what ingredients I had on hand, I decided to be creative. Amazingly, it was delicious! I didn't use any salt or pepper and yet the taste was not at all bland. The kale was very tender but not soupy. This will definitely be a go-to recipe for kale.
