Ingredients:
3 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
3 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced
3 ripe plums, peeled, pitted and sliced
4 large strawberries, sliced
1 tablespoon white sugar (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup melted butter
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup apricot nectar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup quick-cooking rolled oats
1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Scatter the apples, peaches, plums, and strawberries into the bottom of the prepared baking dish, mixing the fruit well. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon if desired. Pour the water over the fruit.
Mix together the butter, 1 cup of sugar, the apricot nectar, flour, rolled oats, graham cracker crumbs, and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon in a bowl until the mixture is crumbly and well combined. Sprinkle the crumbly mixture over the pan of fruit.
Bake in the preheated oven until the topping is lightly browned and the fruit is tender, about 45 minutes.
