Ingredients:
8 apples, quartered
1 cup brown sugar
3 cinnamon sticks
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Place apples in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Spread brown sugar, cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, and cloves on top. Fill the rest of the pot up with water, up to the maximum line.
Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 60 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Remove cinnamon sticks. Mash apples with a potato masher or spoon. Return cinnamon sticks to the pot.
Continue cooking on high pressure for another 60 minutes, allowing 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Repeat quick-release, about 5 minutes. Strain out cider using a strainer or cheesecloth; discard solids. Serve hot or cold.
