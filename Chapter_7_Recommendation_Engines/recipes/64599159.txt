Ingredients:
1 cucumber (Japanese, English, Persian, Pickling are all good) Â– about 1 1/2 cup sliced
1 Tbs soy sauce
2 Tbs rice vinegar
1 Tbs sugar
1/2 tsp or more red chili powder
1/4 tsp sesame seeds
2 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Slice cucumbers into thin slices. Around 1/8 inch (3 mm).
Mix soy sauce, vinegar and sugar in a bowl. Pour soy vinegar into the bowl with cucumbers.
Then, add 1/2 tsp chili powder and sesame seeds. Mix and taste. Add more chili powder if you want. Doing it in this order allows you to taste and control the amount of chili powder based on how spicy you want it.
Add chopped green onions and mix again.
Serve immediately for the most fresh and crunchy cucumber flavor. You can also let it sit for 10-15 minutes for the cucumbers to absorb the dressing before serving.
Notes: You can refrigerate for few days and can be served cold. Just freshen it up with some fresh green onions and sesame seeds.
