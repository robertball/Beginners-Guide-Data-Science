Description: 
This is a vegetarian tomato soup and you can add more basil if you like.  I make it a lot at the restaurant I work in, and it is a favorite of customers and staff.  If you want a more intense basil flavor, try adding some fresh chopped basil to the soup just before serving. The longer you cook basil the more the flavor mellows.
