Ingredients:
2 cups cake flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
2 cups fresh raspberries
1/2 cup miniature white chocolate chips
3 tablespoons seedless raspberry jam
Topping:
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 cup miniature white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12-cup muffin tin or use paper liners.
Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda together in a large bowl.
Combine buttermilk, egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl and whisk together.
Add buttermilk mixture and melted butter to flour mixture, whisking until just moistened; batter will be lumpy. Fold in raspberries, miniature white chocolate chips, and raspberry jam. Fill muffin cups with batter.
Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle topping on muffins. Top with white chocolate chips.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.
Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes more.
