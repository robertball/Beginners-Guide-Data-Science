Ingredients:
1 cup peeled, chopped zucchini
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut, divided
2/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 cups milk
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Heat 1 inch of water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add zucchini, cover, and steam until softened, about 5 minutes.
In a blender or food processor, blend the cooked zucchini, 3/4 cup coconut, sugar, milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt until smooth. Pour into the pie crust, and sprinkle with remaining coconut and nutmeg.
Bake 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
