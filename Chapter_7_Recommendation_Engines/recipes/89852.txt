Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package firm tofu, cut into 6 slices
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 boneless pork loin chops, cut into bite sized pieces

1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 cups cooked brown rice
1/3 cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Place tofu slices on several layers of paper towels, cover with additional paper towels, and place a dinner plate on top. Let stand 30 minutes. Then cut tofu into 1/2 inch cubes.
In a small bowl, whisk together broth, cornstarch, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and chili garlic sauce.
Warm oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in pork, and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in ginger and garlic. Then stir in tofu, and cook until golden, about 4 minutes.
Stir in broth mixture, bring to a boil; simmer until mixture thickens, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Serve over cooked rice garnished with green onions and cashews.
