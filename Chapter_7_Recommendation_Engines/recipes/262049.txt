Ingredients:
1 cup pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.Â®)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon white sugar (optional)
1 cup hot water
vegetable oil for frying
4 medium eggs

Directions:
Mix corn meal, salt, and sugar together in a bowl. Add hot water and mix with your hands until a dough forms. Roll into a ball and let rest, 5 to 10 minutes.
Fill a pot with about 4 inches of oil and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Divide dough into 4 equal-sized balls. Set aside a small amount of dough for repairing holes after cooking. Place a dough ball onto a sheet of plastic wrap and place a second sheet of plastic wrap on top. Use a pan or plate to flatten the dough into a 1/4-inch thick round. Smooth edges of area with your fingers. Repeat with remaining dough.
Place the arepas carefully into the hot oil and fry until puffed, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Remove arepas from the oil and drain on paper towels until cool until safe to handle.
Cut a 3-inch hole near the edge of an arepa. Crack an egg into a small glass and carefully pour it into the hole in the arepa. Repair the hole quickly using reserved dough. Return the arepa to the oil and fry until egg is no longer runny, 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining arepas. Let cool briefly.

During a visit to Barranquilla, Colombia, I got the chance to taste an arepa de huevo. My friend got the recipe for me and now it's a special treat.
 The fried dough coupled with the egg is beyond words. Such a tasty dish!
