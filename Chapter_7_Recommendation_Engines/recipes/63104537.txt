Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 med onion chopped
2 cloves garlic chopped
4 cups veg broth
3 carrots peeled and chopped in coins
1 can chopped stewed tomatos.
1 small cabbage chopped (small/med chunks)
1 bunch of kale chopped
1 can chick peas (optional)
2 teaspoon paprika
Salt and pepper to taste
I change up the spices everytime, tiny bit of cayenne adds a nice punch too.

Directions:
On medium heat, sautee onion and garlic with olive oil in large pot until onion is translucent. Add broth, carrots cabbage, tomato and paprika until cabbage softens ( usually about 10-15 mins). Once cabbage is soft add kale. I recommend throwing a lid on top to trap some steam and let the kale soften. Once kale is soft, add can of chick peas. Serve hot.

Description: 
Many credit soup for being their weight loss secret. I intended to make a soup that could aid by filling me up so I would eat less of my main course. Well, this soup has evolved so much, I don’t even eat the main course. So incredibly hearty, healthy and filling! It’s a beautiful soup with many colors and also freezes well. I hope you enjoy. I would love to know of any modifications so I can try that next time.
