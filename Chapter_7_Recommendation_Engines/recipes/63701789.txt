I have been looking for a standard meatball recipe that tastes homemade! I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I modified with what I had. I am sure the exact ingredients would produce a great meatball too! Thank you for the original which I tried to adhere to!Modified from: Chef John's Italian Meatballs
