Ingredients:
1/2 c chana dal
1/2 c toor dal
1/2 c urad dal
1/2 c mung dal
1/2 c masoor dal
4 1/2 c water
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp salt
8 T vegetable oil
2 med onions, thinly sliced
2 to 4 green chilis, minced
2 tsp minced garlic
1 T ginger paste
1/2 T cumin seed
2 dry red chilies, crumbled
1/4 c chopped cilantro

Directions:
Measure all ingredients and set aside
Soak chana dal and urad dal for 30 mins
Combine all dals and water.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, until cooked (45 mins to an hour).  Stir to make sure it doesn't boil dry and to keep it from sticking and burning.
Heat 4 T of the ghee over med high heat - add cumin seed.  When it starts to brown, add the crumbled dry red peppers, then quickly add the minced chilis, onion, garlic and ginger.  Cook, stirring, till the onions soften and just start to brown.
Stir onion mixture into the fully cooked dals; fold in about half the cilantro.  Drizzle with the remaining ghee.
Serve with rice, garnished with the remaining coriander.
