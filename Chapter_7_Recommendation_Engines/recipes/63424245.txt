Ingredients:
3 T. of butter
2 cans of chicken broth (14 1/2 oz. size) = 3 and 5/8 cup-I usually add 4 cups of broth)
1/2 tsp. gravy starter (Kitchen Bouquet)
1/3 cup of flour plus  2 T. (The original recipe calls for Wondra Flour, but I don't usually have any)
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. dried poultry seasoning
1/8 tsp. black pepper

Directions:
Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat, about 1 minute. Add 1 can of broth; bring to a simmer.
In a large measuring bowl with a pouring spout, whisk remaining can of broth, gravy starter and flour.
Pour flour mixture into simmering broth while stirring. Add salt, poultry seasoning and pepper.
Increase heat to medium-high and bring mixture to a full boil. Once boiling, cook 3 minutes, until thickened.
Meanwhile-Boil pasta noodles-I make homemade egg noodles.
Add noodles to gravy.

Description: 
This gravy is from Family Circle. It is a tradition in our family to make Noodles and Gravy for Thanksgiving. I started making this when my husband would smoke the turkey and I didn't have any drippings to make a gravy. We add homemade egg noodles and 2 sliced hard boiled eggs. You can also buy Grandma's Noodles to make this gravy. I usually make 3 times the amount for Thanksgiving. The original recipe calls for canned chicken broth.
