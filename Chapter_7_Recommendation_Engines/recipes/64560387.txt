Ingredients:
1/2 cup white wheat flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
3 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
2 tsp sugar
2 tbsp coconut oil
3/4 cup mashed sweet potato
1/4-1/3 cup of cashew milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375
Add the dry ingredients to a bowl.
Using a pastry cutter, add in the coconut oil and blend in until small bits (less than pea size)
Add the mashed sweet potato and blend with the dry ingredients.
Add 1/4 cup of milk and mix.  You want the dough just to form - not be overly sticky.
Roll out onto a floured surface and knead 5-6 times.
Spread to 1/2 inch thickness and cut with a biscuit cutter.
Put on a baking stone or a parchment covered cookie sheet with the biscuits an inch or so apart.  They shouldn't be touching.
Bake for 12-16 minutes.
Drizzle with honey or pure maple syrup if desired.
