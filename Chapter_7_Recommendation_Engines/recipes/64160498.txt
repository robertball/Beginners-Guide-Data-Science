Directions
Brown hamburger meat in a large skillet over medium heat, breaking up any large clumps.  Drain off the oil.
To the meat add the green chilis, tomato paste, oregano, chilli powder, salt, and pepper.  Mix well, cover, and remove from heat.
Shred the cheese and chop the tomatoes, avocado, onion, and cilantro. Set out all of these in individual serving bowls with spoons, or in mounds on a large serving platter.
Heat the cup of frying oil in a small skillet until a wooden chopstick or skewer inserted creates bubbles. Now it is hot enough to fry the tortillas.
Return the ground beef mixture to a low heat. Meanwhile, fry the tortillas in the hot oil on each side, one by one, and drain on paper towels.
Serve buffet style with hot sauce and sour cream.
