Ingredients:
1/2 cup water (70° to 80°)
1 cup warm milk (70° to 80°)
2 tablespoons butter, softened
2 tablespoons sugar
1-1/2 teaspoons salt
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 packages (1/4 ounce each) active dry yeast
1 egg white, lightly beaten

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first seven ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed).
When the cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into six portions; shape into balls.
Place on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Brush with egg white.
Bake at 375° for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks.
To make bowl, cut the top fourth off of bread; carefully hollow out bottom of each, leaving a 1/4-in. shell (discard removed bread or save for another use).
