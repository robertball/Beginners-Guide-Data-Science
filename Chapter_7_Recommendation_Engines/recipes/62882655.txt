Ingredients:
4 fish fillets (red snapper, tilapia ...)
Kosher salt
ground black pepper
1 cup creme fraiche
3 Tbsp Dijon mustard
1 Tbsp whole grain mustard
2 Tbsp minced shallots
2 tsp drained capers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the fish fillets skin side down on the pan. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.
Combine the creme fraiche, both mustards, shallots, capers, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper in a small bowl. Spoon evenly over the fish fillets, making sure fish is completely covered. Bake for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish, until it's done.
Serve with the sauce spooned over the top.
