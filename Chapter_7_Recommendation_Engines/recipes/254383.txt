Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix (such as Betty Crocker®)
2 cups cold water, divided
1/2 cup oil
3 eggs
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 (8 ounce) package low-fat cream cheese
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) container whipped topping
1 cup boiling water
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored gelatin (such as Jell-O®)
1 cup sliced strawberries, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan with cooking spray.
Combine cake mix, 1 cup cold water, oil, and eggs in a large bowl. Beat together until batter is smooth. Spread the batter into the 9x13-inch pan.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 34 to 38 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven. Cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Press down on hot cake with a piece of waxed paper or clean towel to flatten. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; blend in whipped topping. Spread mixture evenly across the cake.
Stir boiling water and gelatin together in a bowl until gelatin is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes; add 1 cup cold water. Pour over the cream cheese mixture. Let the gelatin sit until it begins to set, 5 to 7 minutes. Spread sliced strawberries on top.
Refrigerate until gelatin is completely set, about 1 hour.

Cool, creamy strawberry cake. My sister brings this to family dinners and shared the recipe. Yummy! An extra container of whipped topping can be used on top of the sliced strawberries, if desired.
