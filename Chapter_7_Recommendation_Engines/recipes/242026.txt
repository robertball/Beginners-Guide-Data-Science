Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cold butter, cut into small pieces
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Process Cheddar cheese, flour, butter, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, cayenne pepper, and salt in a food processor until large crumbs form; transfer to a bowl. Stir milk into the cheese mixture until it forms a ball of dough.
Roll dough out onto a lightly floured work surface to about 1/8-inch thick. Use a pizza cutter or thin knife to trim the edges of the dough to leave a large square with sides measuring 7 to 8 inches. Cut dough into 1/3-inch strips and arrange onto a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until puffy, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese over the warm cheese straws.

Description: 
These are really delicious. Pastry-light and easy to make. Fun to make with kids. Great for parties, but make 5 times more than you think you'll need because your family will eat the first 2 batches.
