Ingredients:
2 split chicken breasts and 2 chicken thighs
28 oz. chicken broth
water
1 whole onion, peeled
1Â½ tbl salt
5-6 stalks celery, chopped, reserving the leaves and small stems
5 carrots, sliced
Fresh ground pepper to taste

Directions:
Place chicken in a large stockpot. Add broth and then fill with water almost to top.
Bring to boil, skimming fat floating on surface.
Add the onion, celery leaves with stems, and salt.
Parboil until chicken is completely done.
In another pot, cook noodles until al dente. Rinse and allow to cool and dry.
Remove celery leaves with stems and onion, and discard. Remove chicken and reserve. Add chopped celery and carrots. Bring back to a boil, then reduce to a hard simmer.
Shred as much of the chicken as you want with hands (3 of the 4), discarding the bones and skin. Put back into soup.
Simmer until veggies are cooked
Add noodles to each individual bowl and cover with soup. Add fresh ground pepper to each serving.
