Stir boiling water and salt together in a bowl until salt dissolves; cool completely.

Description: 
The quick and easy way to some really great, spicy pickles! I was amazed how much I enjoyed these! If you like it spicier you can add more ground cayenne pepper or Jalapenos or any other favorite spicy pepper. If made correctly, the pickle will bubble in your mouth! You can leave the cucumbers whole or quartered. You can substitute sea salt for the pickling salt.
