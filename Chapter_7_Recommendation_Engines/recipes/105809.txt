Ingredients:
Ceviche:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen Market Pantry™ easy-peel shrimp, thawed and peeled
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
1/4 cup white onion, chopped
1/3 cup cilantro, chopped
1/2 cup Market Pantry ketchup
1 tablespoon Mexican-style hot sauce
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 cucumber, diced
1 small avocado, peeled, pitted, diced
Crostini:
6 (1 inch thick) slices Archer Farms French bread, from whole loaf
3 tablespoons Market Pantry™ butter, softened
2 garlic cloves, minced

Directions:
In large skillet over medium heat, cook and stir shrimp in 1/4 cup lime juice, until shrimp are pink. Remove from pan, discard liquid. Cut each shrimp in half widthwise.
In a medium bowl, combine onion, cilantro, ketchup, hot sauce, oil and cucumber. Stir in shrimp, then refrigerate.
In small bowl, combine butter and garlic, and spread over both sides of bread. Place bread on a cookie sheet. Broil on high for 4 minutes or until bread is toasted, turning once.
Combine shrimp and avocado with ketchup mixture. Serve over toasted crostini.

Description: 
In traditional ceviche, there's no cooking - just pickling of fish by marinating it in citrus juice. This recipe is decidedly quicker.
