Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups diced carrots
2 cups diced celery
1 medium onion, diced
10 slices bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 tablespoons minced garlic
10 medium red potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 cups chicken broth
2 cups water
2 cups unsweetened almond milk
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add carrots, celery, onion, bacon, and garlic. Cook until bacon is browned and crispy, about 10 minutes.
Combine potatoes, broth, and water in a large pot. Bring to a boil; cook until potatoes can be easily pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes. Use an immersion blender to blend the mixture until nearly smooth.
Add the bacon mixture, almond milk, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning to the pot. Cook until heated through, about 10 minutes.
