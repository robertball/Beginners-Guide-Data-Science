Ingredients:
Tortillas
BBQ sauce
Chicken breasts, cooked and cut into small pieces
Cheese
Olives
Other toppings

Directions:
Each person prepares their own pizza.  Take a tortilla (big or small size) and spread BBQ sauce on half of it.
Sprinkle cheese over it, then place some chicken pieces on it.
Put as many other toppings on it as desired, then fold in half.
If you have a sandwich maker, this is a great time to use it.  Just place each tortilla in, one at a time, and cook for 3 or 4 minutes or until cheese is melted.  Without a sandwich maker, you can place the individual pizzas on a cookie sheet.  Put in the oven for 10 minutes or so at 375 degrees fahrenheit.
