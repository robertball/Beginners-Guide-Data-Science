1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup milk
2 cups fresh blackberries
1/2 cup blackberry juice

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking dish.
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; set aside. Beat 1/2 cup white sugar and butter in another bowl until smooth. Stir flour mixture alternately with milk, into butter mixture until well mixed. Pour batter into prepared baking dish. Spoon blackberries and blackberry juice on top and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
