Ingredients:
6-9 whole wheat lasagna noodles
1 lb extra firm tofu, drained and pressed
1/2c  garlic hummus (heaping ½ cup)
¼ cup nutritional yeast
½ cup chopped swiss chard (I used frozen that I thawed in the microwave)
½ - 1 tsp garlic powder
½ tsp salt (or to taste)
½ tsp dried basil
26 oz of homemade spaghetti sauce

Directions:
1 Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Cook your lasagna noodles according to package directions until they're a bit underdone (mine took about 6-8 minutes).
3 Meanwhile, in a large bowl, crumble drained tofu with your hands until it resembles the texture of ricotta cheese.
4 Add in hummus, nutritional yeast, swiss chard (squeeze water out if using thawed from frozen), garlic, salt and basil. Using your hands, mix ingredients together until a creamy, ricotta-like texture is achieved.
In a baking dish (I used a 7" by 11" but 8" by 8" would work too), pour in enough sauce to cover the bottom.
5 Layer 3 lasagna noodles on top, breaking them if necessary to fit the pan. Top the noodles with enough cheese to cover evenly. If you made 9 noodles, you can make three noodle layers with less cheese. I used 6 noodles and only made 2 layers with more cheese.
6 Top cheese mixture with more sauce, then noodles again, then more cheese. Top cheese with the rest of the sauce. It's ok if it looks like a lot of sauce!
Bake for 30 minutes and enjoy!
