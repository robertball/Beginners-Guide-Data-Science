Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup cold butter
3/4 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
3 egg yolks
FILLING:
1/2 cup almond paste
1 egg white
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
EGG WASH:
1 egg white
1 tablespoon water
1/4 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
In a bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Cut in butter until crumbly. Add milk and egg yolks to yeast mixture; mix well. Stir into flour mixture; mix well.  Do not knead. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
In a mixing bowl, beat filling ingredients until smooth. Punch dough down. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Roll each piece into a 12-in. circle; cut each circle into eight wedges. Spread filling over wedges; roll up from wide end. Place with point side down 3 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets.  Curve ends to form a crescent shape. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour (dough will not double).
Beat egg white and water; brush over croissants. Sprinkle with almonds. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
These tender croissants are a little lighter than others I've tried. A close friend of mine serves these every Christmas and Easter.
