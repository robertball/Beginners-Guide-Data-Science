Ingredients:
12 eggs
1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar
20 fluid ounces brandy
24 cups milk
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Separate the eggs. In a large bowl beat the egg whites until frothy. Whisk in 3/4 cup of the confectioners' sugar and beat until stiff peaks are formed.
Beat the egg yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup of confectioners' sugar and about 4 to 5 tablespoons of the brandy until light and lemon colored. Fold the egg whites into the egg yolks and refrigerate.
In a large stock pot heat the milk until hot but do not boil. Reduce heat and keep milk hot.
To each mug add 2 tablespoons brandy (or more to taste) and 1 large heaping tablespoon of egg mixture. Stir and fill mug with hot milk. Place another tablespoon of egg mixture on top and sprinkle with nutmeg.
