Ingredients:
frozen uncooked bacon, frozem non shelled large uncooked  shrimp, oil, skewer sticks (optional)

Directions:
Unthaw shrimp and bacon before starting microwave works or put it in the refrigerator to unthaw instead of freezer. After shrimp and bacon have been unthawed wrap bacon around shrimp sometimes the bacon may come off of the shrimp so if you want to buy skewer sticks to keep it together that also may help. After all shrimp have been wrapped with bacon heat oil and add shrimp to oil once heated. Shrimp will be ready once bacon is browned and somewhat crispy Enjoy!
