4 slices sourdough bread
2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup drained crushed pineapple
2 slices provolone or Swiss cheese
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Spread cream cheese on two slices of bread. Layer 2 slices of ham, 2 tablespoons of pineapple, and one slice of cheese over the cream cheese.  Then top each sandwich with one more slice of bread.  Cut off crusts.
In a shallow bowl, whisk together eggs, milk and sugar.  Briefly dip both sides of sandwiches in egg mixture.
Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Place sandwiches in skillet, and fry on each side until golden brown and cheese is melted, about 5 minutes per side.  Drain on paper towels and cool for 3 minutes before serving.
