Ingredients:
1 turkey carcass
2 carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, cut into 2 inch pieces
1 onions, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 sprigs fresh parsley
12 black peppercorns
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
8 cups water
water to cover
1 turnip, peeled and cubed
2 parsnips, peeled and sliced
3 carrots, chopped
1/2 cup frozen green beans
1/2 cup frozen green peas
1 (15 ounce) can red beans, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Place turkey carcass in a large pot over high heat. Add the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, parsley sprigs, peppercorns, bay leaves, thyme, chicken bouillon granules, water and enough water to cover all. Bring to a boil, uncovered, then reduce heat to medium low and let simmer for 1 1/2 hours.
Remove the turkey carcass and allow it to cool. Remove any meat from the carcass, cut into bite-sized pieces and set aside. Strain the stock through a sieve OR a colander covered with cheesecloth into another large pot. Discard the unstrained ingredients. Place the turkey meat into the pot, cover and refrigerate overnight.
The next day, use a slotted spoon to remove the fat that has solidified on top of the stock. Return the stock to a large pot over high heat, add the turnip, parsnips and carrots and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for one hour, or until vegetables are tender.
Add the green beans, peas and beans and allow to heat through, about 15 minutes. Finally add the chopped parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
Turkey frame soup with vegetables and beans is a complete meal that's extremely low in fat and a great way to use up that turkey carcass hanging around after Thanksgiving, or you can use two fresh turkey legs instead!
