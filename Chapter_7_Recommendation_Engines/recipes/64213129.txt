Ingredients:
3 Large Vine-Ripened Tomatoes, Chopped
1/4 cup Diced Onion
1 teaspoon Sugar
1/2 teaspoon Salt
1/4 teaspoon Black Pepper
6 oz Tomato Paste
3 tablespoon Butter
3 tablespoon Flour
2 cups Milk

Directions:
Add chopped tomatoes, diced onions, sugar, salt and pepper to a large sauce pan on medium heat. Heat for about 5 - 7 minutes or until onions are soft. Remove from heat.
Puree all ingredients from sauce pan and strain. Then return strained liquid back to pan. Add tomato paste and continue to heat on medium-low heat.
Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with a fork, and cook, stirring constantly until thick for about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk until all of the milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat for 4 to 5 or until thick. (If lumps form, use strainer to remove)
Add the milk mixture into the tomato mixture and allow to simmer for 5 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
I love cooking from scratch and found this recipe has a very similar flavor as the brand name soup, but uses mostly fresh ingredients. It's quick and easy and makes a nice weeknight meal.
