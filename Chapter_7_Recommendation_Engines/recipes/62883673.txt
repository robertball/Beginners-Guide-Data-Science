Ingredients:
4 pieces skinless chicken breast
1 box Ireali couscous (Trader Joe brand is best)
1 1/4 cup chicken broth
8 mushrooms, sliced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 sweet yellow onion, diced
3/4 cup pine nuts
1 TBL olive oil
1 TBL cinnamon
salt
pepper
1/2 tsp paprika
dash of cumin

Directions:
Cook the chicken in a broiler or oven for 15 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and cayenne pepper, then set aside.
Cook couscous according to directions, except omit 1 cup of water with 1 cup of chicken broth. Set aside when done.
In a skillet, brown the onion, mushrooms and peppers in olive oil. Add cooked chicken breasts and remaining 1/4 cup broth, let simmer for 10 minutes on medium-high.
Remove the chicken from the skillet with about 1/4 cup of the 'sauce' created in the skillet and add the cooked couscous to the skillet along with the cinnamon, paprika, cumin and pine nuts. Mix well.
Plate the couscous mixture, place a piece of chicken on top and pour the collected sauce on top of chicken, evenly over all four plated servings and serve.
