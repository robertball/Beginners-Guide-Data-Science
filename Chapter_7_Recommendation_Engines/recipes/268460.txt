Ingredients:
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
1 (32 fluid ounce) container vegetable stock
2 cups Pinot Grigio wine
2 Fuji apples, sliced
2 medium oranges, sliced
3 small lemons, sliced
1 Anjou pear, sliced
1 head garlic, cloves peeled and crushed
1/2 yellow onion, sliced
1/2 bunch fresh rosemary, or to taste
1/2 bunch fresh thyme, or to taste
1/2 bunch fresh sage, or to taste
kitchen twine
1 cup water
3/4 cup sea salt
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons dried bell peppers
2 tablespoons dried vegetable flakes
2 tablespoons multi-colored whole peppercorns
4 bay leaves
1 gallon iced water
1 (11 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed
1 extra-large turkey bag

Directions:
Combine chicken stock, vegetable stock, and with wine in a large pot. Toss in apples, oranges, lemons, pear, garlic, and onion. Tie rosemary, thyme, and sage together with kitchen twine; add to the pot. Stir in 1 cup water, salt, sugar, dried peppers, vegetable flakes, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil; stir to dissolve salt and sugar.
Remove brine from heat and let cool to room temperature. Store in the refrigerator.
Combine brine with 1 gallon of heavily iced water 1 to 2 days before serving the turkey. Place thawed turkey in an extra-large turkey bag and pour in enough brine to cover completely. Refrigerate.
Remove turkey from the brine and rinse inside and out with cold water. Discard brine and start cooking.
