1/2 cup Hellmann’s Lite mayonnaise
1/4 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons sour cream
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons finely diced red onion
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Club Hoagie
8 slices pork or turkey bacon, cooked until crisp
1/2 pound thinly sliced turkey breast
1/4 pound thinly sliced Cheddar or Swiss cheese (or a combination of the two)
1/4 pound thinly sliced deli ham
2 ripe beefsteak tomatoes, thinly sliced
1/2 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced
1 long loaf of French bread, sliced in half crosswise

Directions:
Whisk together ingredients in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper.
Spread some of the buttermilk dressing on the bottom half of the bread. Place the turkey on top, overlapping the slices.  Add the cheese, then the ham, the tomatoes, the bacon and the red onion.
