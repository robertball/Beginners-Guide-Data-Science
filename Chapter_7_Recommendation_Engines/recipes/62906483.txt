Ingredients:
1/2 cup almond meal
1/2 cup ground flax seed
1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup water
1 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together in a bowl and let sit for a few minutes to absorb the water.
Line a baking tray with parchment paper.
Put the mixture onto the paper and cover with wax paper or cling wrap.
Roll with a rolling pin, or flatten with your hands to 1/8 of an inch thick.  Make sure the edges don't get thinner than the rest of it.
Using a knife or similar utensil, score lines where you want to break the crackers apart.
Bake in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes or until the top turns a golden brown color.
Remove from oven and let sit to cool.  The crackers will continue to harden as they cool.
