Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/4 inch thickness
1/3 cup Hawaiian style marinade (or try teriyaki)
2 pineapple rings
2 slices Swiss cheese
2 onion rolls, split... or thick slices of bread dusted with onion powder
4 tablespoons mayo (w/chipotle seasoning added)...  or try other seasonings
2 leaves romaine lettuce
2-4 slices tomato

Directions:
Place the chicken pieces into a large resealable bag and pour in the marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
Preheat a grill for medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade.
Grill the chicken pieces until cooked through, about 10 minutes. 5 minutes before they are done, place the pineapple rings on the grill and cook for a couple of minutes. Place the pineapple slices on top of the pieces of chicken and top with a slice of cheese. Adjust the lid to the grill to allow the cheese to melt for a minute.  Remove from grill.
Very lightly brush both sides of bread slices with olive oil and toast briefly on the grill.
To assemble the sandwiches, place the chicken, pineapple and cheese onto the bottom buns. Top with lettuce and tomato. Spread the dressing onto the top buns and place onto the sandwiches.
