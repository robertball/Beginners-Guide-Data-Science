Ingredients:

Directions:
6-8 pieces of chicken, skin removed
oil
1 large onion
3-4 cloves garlic
2 inch piece of fresh ginger
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
3-4 cardamom pods (or 1/2 tsp ground       cardamom)
1 inch cinnamon stick
4 whole cloves or 1/4 tsp ground cloves
2 bay leaves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed
Remove the skin from the chicken.  You can use thighs, legs and/or breast.  Cut the thighs and breasts in half, as this flavors these large pieces to the bone.
Put the onion, ginger and garlic in a food processor and process into a paste.  Heat some oil in a heavy pot.  Put the onion mixture in and fry it, stirring continuously for about 10 minutes.  Add all of the spices and fry them 1-2 minutes.  Put the chicken pieces in and stir them around the onion spice mixture until they are well coated.  Fry them for about 4 minutes.  Pour the tomatoes over and stir.  Simmer on low for 1-2 hours until the oil separates from the liquid.  Stir occasionnally. If you simmer this uncovered, the sauce thickens.  You can add water, if you like, or keep the lid on while simmering.
Add salt to taste at the end of cooking.
Serve with cooked basmati rice.
If you want to cook it in a crockpot, prepare the dish as written, but let it simmer all day, covered in a crock pot on low.  It is excellent!!!

This dish is a family favorite.  I have also taken it to pot-lucks and served to guests in my home.  Everyone asks for the recipe.  It is a great crock-pot meal, too.
