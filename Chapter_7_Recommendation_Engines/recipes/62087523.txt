Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raspberries, washed and well-dried
1 1/2 cups blueberries, washed and well-dried
1 1/2 cups blackberries, washed and well-dried
1 1/2 cups strawberries, quartered; washed and well-dried
1 cup sugar
3 Tbsp cornstarch
2 Tbsp quick-cooking tapioca
1/4 tsp. salt
1 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1 package refrigerated Pillsbury double pie dough crust

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Follow instructions on pie dough crust box to prepare for filling.
In a large bowl mix together the sugar, cornstarch, tapioca, and salt.  Add the berries and toss with your hands until the berries are evenly coated.
Pile the berries into the dough-lined pie pan, sprinkling any remaining dry ingredients on top.  Dot the surface with the unsalted butter pieces and cover the berries with the top crust and seal the edges by fluting.
Cut 5 or 6 slits in the top crust to let steam escape and place on a baking pan to catch drips. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.
Reduce oven temp to 350 degrees and remove pie from oven and line the edges of your crust with foil to keep from getting to brown.  Place pie back in oven and continue baking for another 50-60 minutes or until top is golden brown and the juices bubbling through the slits look thick , glossy and slow.
For the best serving texture, allow the pie to cool completely before serving so filling juices are firmed up, otherwise your filling will be slightly liquid.
