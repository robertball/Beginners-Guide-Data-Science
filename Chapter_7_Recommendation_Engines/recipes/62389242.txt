Description: 
My Mother first started making this when I was very young.  It turned into a weekly request. When we found out she was making it for dinner, everyone made sure they were home on time for dinner.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we do. We think it's better than anything you can get at the chinese restaurant. This fed a family of 6.  If you want left-overs, double the recipe, you won't regret it.
