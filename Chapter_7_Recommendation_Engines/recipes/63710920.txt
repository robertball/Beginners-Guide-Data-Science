Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups milk
3 Tbl unsalted butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp kosher salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1/8 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp dijon mustard
1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce
2 cups (about 8 oz) shredded sharp cheddar, divided
1 cup (about 4 oz) diced swiss and havarti
8 ounces elbow macaroni

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish; set aside.
Heat milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat (or in a microwave safe, large measure on 50 power for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally).
Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a high-sided skillet over medium heat. When butter bubbles, add flour. Cook, stirring, 1 minute.
Slowly pour hot milk into flour-butter mixture while whisking. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture bubbles and becomes thick.
Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in salt, nutmeg, black pepper, cayenne pepper, dijon mustard, Worcestershire, 1 1/2 cups cheddar, and 3/4 cup Gruyere/Havarti. When cheese is incorporated, set cheese sauce aside.
Fill a large saucepan with water. Bring to a boil. Add macaroni; cook 2 to 3 fewer minutes than manufacturer's directions, until outside of pasta is cooked and inside is underdone. Transfer the macaroni to a colander, rinse under cold running water, and drain well. Stir macaroni into the reserved cheese sauce.
Pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle with remaining cheeses. Bake until browned on top, about 20-30 minutes. If desired, broil for a few minutes at the end for more browning. Transfer dish to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes; serve.
