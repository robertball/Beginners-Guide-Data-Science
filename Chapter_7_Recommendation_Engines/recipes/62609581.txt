Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
(sub in half wheat flour)
1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 cups sugar (or other diet sugar)
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup cold butter
(I used light butter - room temp is easier to cut with flour and worked fine)
2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup sugar (or other diet sugar)

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour, oats, 1 cup sugar, cinammon and baking soda. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Reserve 2 cups for topping. Press remaining crumb mixture into a greased 8-in. x 8-in. x 2-in. baking pan; set aside.
In a saucepan, combine blueberries, cornstarch, lemon juice and remaining sugar. Bring to a boil; boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Spread evenly over the crust. Sprinkle with the reserved crumb mixture. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool before cutting.
