Jalapeno Popper Spread Recipe

Ingredients:
2 (8 oz.) packages cream cheese, softened
1 c. mayonnaise
1 (4 oz.) can chopped green chilies, drained
4  6 oz. chopped jalapenos
*Do not buy the pickled kind; if you have to, buy the slices and chop yourself! I buy the 7.75 oz. jar of jalapeno slices for nachos and chop ¾ of the jar for this dip.  I figure I use 6 oz. for my dip.
1 c. real shredded parmesan cheese (not the grated kind!)
½ c. Panko bread crumbs
Olive Oil Pam

Directions:
Blend with an electric mixer the cream cheese, mayonnaise, green chilies and jalapeno peppers. Pour mixture into an oven safe dish (i.e. Corning ware).
In a medium bowl combine the parmesan cheese and bread crumbs. Sprinkle bread crumb cheese mixture over top of cream cheese mixture. Generously spray layered bread crumb cheese topping evenly with Olive Oil Pam.
Bake at 375 F for about 30 minutes or until the internal temperature of the dip comes to 165 F.
Turn on broiler and crisp up for 2 - 3 minutes.
Serve dip hot with toasted French or Italian bread slices. (Slice bread loaf and brush each slice with olive oil.  Broil in oven for a couple minutes.  Watch carefully!)
