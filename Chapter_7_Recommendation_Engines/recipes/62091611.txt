Ingredients:
6 large meaty lamb shanks
kosher salt or sea salt and fresh gound pepper to taste
2 large onions cut in half and each half cut into 4-5 wedges
2 dozen baby carrots
5 small heads of garlic, 4 heads with outer skin remioved abd 1 head seperated into peeled cloves and lightly smashed
Olive oile to taste (use really good, cold pressed, virgin olive oil)
4 large fresh rosemary sprigs
about 1.5 cups chicken broth, plus more if needed
3/4 cup white wine (I like Pino Grigio)
water if needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 475 degrees
Rub lamb generously with salt and pepper
Choose a heavy flameproof baking dish (I use a 10qt. cast iron dutch oven) that can hold lamb shanks and vegetable in on snug layer and be tightly covered
Scatter the onions, carrots and smashed garlic cloves on bottom of dish
Season with salt and pepper and toss with olive oil.
Brush lamb with olive oil and place the shanks on top of the vegetables
Tuck the heads of garlic between th shanks along with rosemary sprigs and brush or spary with a little more olive oil
Bake lamb shanks for about 25 minutes and if vegetables start to burn add a little water
and reduce oven temperature to 425.  Continue to cook 20 minutes (45 minutes) total at either temperature
Add wine and enough broth to come up halfway up the meat (garlic heads should stick out from liquid)
Cover with the baking dish or oven tightly (no lid use a double alyer of aluminum foil
Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees and bake  the lamb 2 hours until extremely tender and beginning to pull away from bone
Turn shanks once or twice as they bake and add more broth and/or wine to maintain level of liquid
Transfer the lamb, vegetables and garlic heads to serving platter
Skim the fat off the pan juices and transfer juices to sauceboast or small dish
If you desire a thicker sauce place baking dish on medium high heat and reduce to desired consistency.
