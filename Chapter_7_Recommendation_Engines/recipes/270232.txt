Description: 
Bread pudding has a sweet image, but you gotta try the savory version! It's amazing. Savory bread puddings are so easy to make and they're inexpensive, tasty, and comforting. I hope you like this one -- you can leave the bacon out if you just want a veggie version and/or add other veggies, too.
