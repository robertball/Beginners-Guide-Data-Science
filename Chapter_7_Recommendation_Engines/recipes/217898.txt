Ingredients:
Spicy Sweet Mayo
1 cup light mayonnaise
1/4 cup coarse-grain mustard
1/4 cup honey
1 tablespoon prepared horseradish
hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢) to taste
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
Burgers
1 1/4 pounds ground turkey breast
1/2 large onion, grated
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 tablespoons barbeque sauce
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
1 tablespoon steak seasoning
1 teaspoon dry mesquite flavored seasoning mix
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 large onion, sliced
5 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Combine mayonnaise, mustard, honey, horseradish, hot pepper sauce, and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate.
Mix ground turkey, grated onion, jalapeno, barbeque sauce, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, steak seasoning, and mesquite seasoning in a large bowl. Form into 5 patties.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.
Cook the patties in a medium skillet over medium heat, turning once, to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (85 degrees C), about 6 minutes per side. Serve on buns topped with spicy sweet mayo and caramelized onions.

Description: 
A spicy, flavorful, and moist turkey burger.  This is my husband's favorite.  It tastes delicious and I make it with extra lean ground turkey breast. The grated onion adds moisture as well as flavor to the turkey.
