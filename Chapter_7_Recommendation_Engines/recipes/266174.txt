Ingredients:
5 ounces boneless pork loin roast
2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon wine
1 tablespoon water
2 cups shredded cabbage
1 cup shredded carrot
1 cup bean sprouts
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
3 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Cut pork into 1/4-inch-thin strips and mix with 1 tablespoon soy sauce, cornstarch, wine, and water.
Mix remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce with cabbage, carrot, bean sprouts, and hoisin sauce in a separate bowl.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Pour in eggs. Cook and scramble until set, about 3 minutes. Remove from wok and set aside.
Heat another tablespoon of oil in the same wok; cook pork mixture until meat is no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Remove mixture and set aside.
Heat remaining tablespoon of oil in the wok. Add cabbage mixture; stir-fry until softened but still crunchy, about 3 minutes. Add the pork mixture and eggs; stir evenly and drain.

Description: 
Put this filling in moo shu shells or flour tortillas. It tastes just as good as your favorite Chinese restaurant. If you have an Asian market nearby, you can buy the moo shu shells and the thinly sliced meats from there. Otherwise just ask your butcher to slice it very thin.
