Ingredients:
3 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/4 cups raisins
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup light brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 cups quick-cooking oats

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract and raisins. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in the raisin mixture until well blended. Stir in oats. Roll into 1 inch balls and place them 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
