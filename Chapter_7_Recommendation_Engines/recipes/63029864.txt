Ingredients:
6 oranges
3 cups cooked, mashed sweet potatoes
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup orange juice
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 tablespoon grated orange peel

1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Prepare oranges by cutting tops off, 1/4 to 1/2 inch down.  Spoon out the flesh, leaving a shell.
In a large bowl combine sweet potatoes, sugar, orange juice, eggs, vanilla extract, 1/2 cup butter and grated orange peel.  Spoon mixture into orange shells.  Place in a deep casserole dish.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine remaining 1/2 cup butter, brown sugar, flour and pecans.  Cook until sugar dissolves in melted butter.  Spoon over oranges.  Fill casserole dish with water to reach 1/2 inch in depth.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
