1 head cauliflower, chopped
1 cup almond flour
3 eggs
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon rosemary
1 dash salt
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place cauliflower in a food processor or blender; pulse until broken down into grains the size of rice. Spread on a baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until soft, about 10 minutes.
Transfer softened cauliflower to a large bowl; add almond flour, eggs, oregano, thyme, and rosemary. Stir well until dough pulls into a ball.
Dust a pizza pan with flour; spread dough on the pan with a spatula to form the crust.
Bake crust in the preheated oven until golden brown and edges are crispy, about 20 minutes.
