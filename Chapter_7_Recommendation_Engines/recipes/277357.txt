Description: 
In looking for some good fall/winter truffle recipes, I decided a gingerbread truffle recipe would be wonderful, so I took my knowledge of truffle recipes and put it to use. The following is my own simple recipe for a nice fall/winter treat--not too sweet, and not loaded with chocolate like many other truffle recipes.
