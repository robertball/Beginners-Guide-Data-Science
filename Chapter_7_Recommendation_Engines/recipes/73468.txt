Ingredients:
4 cups water, divided
1 1/2 tablespoons plain yogurt with active cultures
1 3/4 cups dry milk powder

Directions:
Pour 2 cups of water into a sealable 1 quart container, and stir in the yogurt until dissolved. Whisk in powdered milk until completely blended. Fill with remaining water, and stir. Close the lid, and set in a warm place for 12 to 15 hours. I use a gas oven (turned off), or even a heating pad. Refrigerate, until chilled before serving.

Description: 
This is a really inexpensive way to make lots of yogurt, and it's kind of cool to boot!  It also offers and endless amount of possibilities of flavors for those watching sugars. After the first batch, you can use a tablespoon of your own homemade yogurt instead of store-bought.
