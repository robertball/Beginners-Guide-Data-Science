Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup chopped onion
6 tablespoons ketchup, divided
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, divided
1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

1 large egg, lightly beaten
1/2 pound lean ground beef
1/2 pound lean ground pork
1/2 pound lean ground veal

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Place a medium nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion, and saute for 3 minutes. Combine the onion, 1/4 cup ketchup, 1 tablespoon mustard, mozzarella, and next 6 ingredients (mozzarella through egg) in a large bowl. Crumble ground meats over cheese mixture; stir just until blended.
Pack mixture into an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray. Combine 2 tablespoons ketchup and 1 tablespoon mustard; spread over top of loaf. Bake at 375 degrees for 1 hour or until meat thermometer registers 160 degrees. Let meat loaf stand in pan 10 minutes.
Remove meat loaf from pan, and cut into 12 slices.
