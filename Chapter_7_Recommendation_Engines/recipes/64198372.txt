Ingredients:
1 cup Greek yogurt
1–1 ½ cups self-rising flour

Directions:
Mix ingredients in a bowl until it starts to come together, then knead it on a well-floured surface for about 8–10 minutes. Add in a little bit of flour at a time if the dough is too sticky. Form it into the pizza shape and size you want.
Brush with olive oil, add toppings, and put straight into a 450°F oven for 10–12 minutes.
