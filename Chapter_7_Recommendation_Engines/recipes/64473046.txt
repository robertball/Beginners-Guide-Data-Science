coarse salt & ground pepper
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1/3 cup fresh basil leaves, torn
1 1/2 tsp oregano
5 cups Bechamel sauce (ingredients below)
8 lasagna noodles
1 1/4 cups grated Parmesan cheese
Bechamel Sauce
5 tbs butter
1 small onion, diced small
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/3 cup all purpose flour
coarse salt
4 1/2 cups whole milk

Preheat oven to 400.Toss eggplant and mushrooms in
2 tbsp oil,  and season with salt & pepper. Spread on 2 baking sheets and bake until tender, about 20 minutes. Keep in the center to top of the oven, rotating sheets halfway through.
Meanwhile, in large skillet, add 1 tbsp oil over medium heat. Add chicken and cook through. Add cayenne, basil and oregano, cook another 3 minutes.Set aside.
For sauce, in a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, cook until onion is soft, about 4 minutes. Add flour and salt, stir constantly until mixture is pale golden with a nutty aroma, about 4 minutes. Add 2 1/4 cups milk, whisking constantly. Add the other 2 1/4 cups milk and whisk until smooth. Cook, whisking constantly, until sauce comes to a boil and thickens, about 10 minutes.
Prepare noodles according to box directions and rinse in cool water.
Spread 1 cup sauce in an 8 inch square baking dish. Top with 2 noodles. Layer half the chicken, then 1 cup sauce and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Top with 2 noodles, half the vegetables, 1 cup sauce and 1/4 cup cheese. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, reserving 1/4 cup cheese. Cover loosely with foil and bake on top rack until sauce is bubbly, about 40 minutes. Remove lasagna and turn on broiler. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and broil until cheese is browned.Let cool 20 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
For vegetarian, replace ground chicken with more mushrooms and cook mushrooms as if it were the chicken in the saucepan. Also switch out for other veggies, squash, spinach or artichokes. So rich and yummy it could be one serving!
