Ingredients:
6 boneless, skinless, chicken breast (not too thin)
1 pkg taco seasoning
6 oz shreeded mozzerella cheese
small can of sliced jalapeno's

Directions:
Rinse chicken off with cold running water.
Put taco seasoning on plate, and lightly season both sides of each piece of chicken.
Butterfly chicken (Cut so you can stuff).
Stuff each chicken breast with about 2 oz cheese.
Drizzel 1 tsp jalapeno juice on cheese.
Fold chicken closed and add 2-3 slices of jalapeno's on top of each pease of chicken. (to be safe skip this step on some, if you have people like me, that don't do heat at all)
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees
Line pan with foil and lightly coat foil with no stick cooking spray.
Bake uncovered for about 30 min or until chicken is no-longer pink and juice runs clear. Careful not to over cook as it will cause chicken to be to dry.
