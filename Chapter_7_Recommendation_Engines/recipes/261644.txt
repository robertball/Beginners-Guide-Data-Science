Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat while Brussels sprouts are cooking and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in white wine and bring to a boil. Stir in cream, nutmeg, and pepper. Add Edam cheese and stir until melted. Add drained Brussels sprouts and heat in cheese sauce over low heat, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.

Description: 
Brussels sprouts are delicious when cooked in this creamy cheese sauce. If your Brussels sprouts are very small, cook them less, so they don't get too mushy. You want them to be soft, but not too soft.
