Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 cup water
1 cup milk*
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon parsley (optional)
Splash of milk, if desired
*If you use 2% fat or lower milk, use recipe as stated. If you use whole milk add 2 tablespoons water.

Directions:
Sauté garlic in butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat until fragrant (about 3-4 minutes).
Add rice and stir to coat in butter.
Add water, milk and salt then bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to low (to keep it at a slight simmer), cover and cook for 20 minutes or until rice is tender, stirring occasionally. Don’t mess around with your rice too much – just stir occasionally to make sure it’s not sticking to the bottom.
Stir in parmesan cheese and parsley. If you would like yours to be creamier, add a splash of milk.
Taste for salt and add more if necessary.
Cover, turn off heat and let rest for 5 minutes.
