Ingredients:
2  trout, cleaned and head removed
Â¼ cup dry white wine
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.
On a flat surface, lay out two sheets of aluminum foil about 18 inches long so that they overlap to make one long wide sheet. Rinse the trout and pat dry. Lay the fish in the center of the foil about 2 inches apart. Sprinkle with white wine, melted butter and lemon juice. Season with parsley, salt and pepper. Fold the foil up loosely around the fish and crimp the seams to seal.
Place the packet on the grill and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until fish is cooked through.
