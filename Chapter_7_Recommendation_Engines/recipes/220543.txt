Ingredients:
cooking spray
16 ounces shredded frozen potatoes, thawed
1 large onion, grated
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 large egg, beaten
2 2/3 tablespoons canola oil, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Coat baking sheet with cooking spray.
Put potatoes and onion on a clean towel. Roll up towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.
Stir flour, salt, and black pepper into potato mixture; mix well.
Stir egg and 2 teaspoons canola oil into potato mixture until combined.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
Scoop up potato mixture with a 1/4-cup measuring cup and drop into hot oil. Flatten into patties with a spatula. Cook patties until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes on each side.
Transfer cakes to prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until cakes are browned and crisp, 12 to 15 minutes.
