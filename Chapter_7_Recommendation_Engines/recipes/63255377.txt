Ingredients:
2 cups sliced scallions
3 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
1 scotch bonnet or habanero pepper, quartered and seeded
1/3 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons peanut oil , or canola oil
2 teaspoons ground allspice
2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 teaspoons dried thyme
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 3-pound center-cut pork loin, trimmed

Directions:
Puree scallions, garlic, chile pepper, vinegar, brown sugar, oil, allspice, coriander, thyme, salt, cinnamon and pepper in a food processor.
Pour the spice mixture into a large, sealable plastic bag. Add pork and turn the bag to coat the pork with the marinade. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.
About 20 minutes before you are ready to grill, preheat a gas grill (with all burners lit) to 500°F or build a fire in a charcoal grill and let it burn down to high heat (about 500°F).
If using a gas grill, turn off one burner (leaving 1 to 2 burners lit, depending on your grill). If using a charcoal grill, move the coals to one side. Remove the pork from the marinade (discard marinade). Place the pork on the unheated side of the grill rack. Close the lid and roast undisturbed for 45 minutes.
Rotate the pork 180 degrees, cover and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 145°F, 20 to 30 minutes more. Transfer to a clean cutting board and let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
