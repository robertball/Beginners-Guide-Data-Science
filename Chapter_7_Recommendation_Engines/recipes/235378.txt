Ingredients:
3 tablespoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons paprika
1 1/2 tablespoons garlic powder (such as McCormick® California Style)
1 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup Dijon mustard (such as Hellmann's®)
8 pounds pork shoulder roast (butt roast), rind removed
1/2 cup barbeque sauce, or to taste
18 large hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Mix brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, and salt in a bowl. Spread mustard over pork roast and sprinkle with brown sugar mixture, using the entire amount. Line a shallow baking dish with aluminum foil. Place a rack in the prepared baking dish and arrange pork roast on rack.
Bake in the preheated oven until very tender, 9 to 11 hours. Let pork cool, then shred into bite-size pieces. Stir barbeque sauce into pork to moisten; serve with hamburger buns.

Description: 
I use this hearty recipe for my Super Bowl® parties. It's super easy and feeds a lot of hungry football fans. Serve on a large bun with some baked beans, coleslaw, and chips.
