Ingredients:
1 lb Ground Sausage
1 Med Onion, cubed
2-3 stalks of celery, diced
1 Tbsp Minced Garlic
1 Tbsp Sage
1 Tbsp Thyme
Basil to taste
1/4 cup Beer
1 loaf white bread, cubed and dried
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
2 1/2 cups Low Sodium chicken broth, heated
3 eggs
1/4 cup melted butter

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, brown sausage with onions and celery.  Add all of the seasonings; there will be a coating on the bottom of the pan, so be careful not to cook on too high of heat and burn this layer.
Once Sausage is browned add 1/4 cup of beer and deglaze pan.  In large bowl pour the chicken broth over the bread cubes, mix until evenly coated.
In a separate dish beat three eggs and add to bread cube mixture with bread crumbs, fold in until mixed well.  Be careful not to over mix the bread cubes so that they still have some consistency.
Fold in Sausage mixture, adding the melted butter at the same time. If the bowl you've used is oven safe you can go directly into the oven at 375 F for 45-50 minutes, until top is browned and the inside temperature reaches 160 F or transfer the mixture into a 9" X 13" pan.  In the rectangle pan you may need to cook less, 375 F for 30-40 min.  No need to grease the pan before hand.

Description: 
This is a very easy recipe to make on a fall afternoon and smells delicious in the oven.  When making be careful of the ingredients you use as it may get very salty very quickly! All of the seasonings I've used in the recipe are dried. For healthier version you can omit the butter all together, or I've used flaxseed oil and that captures the flavor well.
