Ingredients:
1 lb. thick ham slices, cubed
1 loaf italian bread (1 pound), cubed
1 jar (4-1/2 ounces) sliced mushrooms, drained
1 cup broccoli, chopped
1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions
10 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup sour cream
1 pkg (8 oz.) cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pkg (8 oz.) shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Place bread cubes in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking dish. Layer with mushrooms, broccoli, onions and ham.
In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, cream cheese, sour cream, mustard and salt. Pour over top; sprinkle with cheese. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 350° for 30 minutes, cover loosely with foil and bake for another 30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
