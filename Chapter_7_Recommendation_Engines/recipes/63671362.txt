Ingredients:
1 tube of crescent roll dough
2 green onions, chopped fine
1/4 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
Butter (amount can vary)
Garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 365. Spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray.  Unroll the crescent dough onto the baking sheet. Spread on butter (how much is up to you or you can skip this step altogether). Sprinkle cheese and onion on top of dough. Season with desired amount of garlic powder.  Re-roll dough back up. Using a sharp knife, cut rolled dough into eight slices and keep them on baking sheet about an inch apart. Bake slices for 9-12 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
A quick appetizer using prepared dough and melted cheese. This would be equally good with a little crisp bacon inside!
