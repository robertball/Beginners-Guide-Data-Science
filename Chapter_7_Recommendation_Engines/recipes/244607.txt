Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable stock
2 teaspoons liquid amino acids (such as Bragg®)
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon vegetable stock
2 teaspoons peanut oil
1 cup canned large lima beans
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 pound sweet onions (such as Vidalia®), sliced
1 rib celery, sliced diagonally
1 cup cooked brown rice

Directions:
Combine 1/4 cup vegetable stock, liquid amino acids, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a cup. Whisk cornstarch and 1 tablespoon vegetable stock together in a separate cup until smooth.
Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat; add lima beans and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook and stir beans until partially warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. Add onions and celery, lower heat to medium, and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are heated through and coated in oil, 2 to 3 minutes.
Pour vegetable stock-liquid amino mixture over bean mixture and turn heat to high. Cover wok and cook over medium heat for 4 minutes. Stir cornstarch mixture into bean mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened, about 1 minute. Serve with brown rice.

I love Chinese food. When I make it myself, I can control the ingredients. This way I know it is truly healthy.
