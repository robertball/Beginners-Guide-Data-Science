Ingredients:
PIZZA DOUGH:
1/4 cup warm water (100 to 110 degrees)
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
4 cups bread flour
2 tablespoons Italian-style seasoning
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1 1/4 cups flat beer
1 tablespoon olive oil
PIZZA SAUCE:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/3 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
1 (28 ounce) can roma tomatoes, with juice
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano

In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
In a food processor, combine flour, Italian seasoning and salt. Pulse until mixed. Add yeast mixture, flat beer and oil. Pulse until a ball is formed. Scrape dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead for several minutes until dough is smooth and elastic. Allow dough to rest for 2 to 3 minutes. Divide dough in half, and shape into balls. Place dough balls in separate bowls, and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise at room temperature for about 1 hour, then store in the refrigerate overnight.
To make the sauce:  Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute onions until tender. Stir in garlic, and cook for 1 minute. Crush tomatoes into saucepan. Add tomato paste, basil, parsley and oregano. Simmer for 10 minutes.
