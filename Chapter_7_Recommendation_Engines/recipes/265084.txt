Ingredients:
1 pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed
1 large slice of onion
4  green serrano chiles, or to taste
1 clove garlic
½ cup water
1 cup heavy cream
½ cup shredded Chihuahua cheese
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules, or to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
12  corn tortillas
1  cooked chicken breast, shredded
1 cup shredded Chihuahua cheese

Directions:
Line a griddle or large frying pan with aluminum foil. Heat over medium-high heat. Add tomatillos, onion, chiles, and garlic. Grill until charred, 7 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally to cook evenly. Allow vegetables to cool slightly.
Transfer grilled vegetables to a blender with water, cream and 1/2 cup Chihuahua cheese; blend until smooth. Season with chicken bouillon granules; add additional water to thin sauce, if necessary,
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a small drizzle of oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Fry tortillas in hot oil for a few seconds, one by one, until soft but not crispy. Add more oil as needed. Place cooked tortillas on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.
Pour 1/3 the sauce into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Fill tortillas with equal amounts of shredded chicken, roll up, and arrange in a single layer over the sauce. Pour remaining sauce on top and cover with remaining 1 cup mild Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until melted, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
Corn tortillas are filled with shredded chicken and baked in a creamy green tomatillo sauce. The 'suizas' sauce is Spanish for 'Swiss,' a nod to its creaminess.
