Ingredients:
6 T butter
1 medium sweet onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups chicken stock
1 cup heavy cream
2 cups milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoons white pepper
1/8 tsp nutmeg
4 cups fresh broccoli florets
1 tsp chicken boullion granules
1/4 cup water
1 cup matchstick carrots
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Melt the butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add onions and saute for a minute.  Then mix in the flour. Reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes. Mix in the chicken stock and cream and milk, and season with salt, white pepper, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a microwave-safe dish (preferably with a lid), combine broccoli, chicken boullion granules, and water.  Microwave on high for 6 minutes.  Remove, stir, and add the carrots.  Microwave for another 6 minutes, or until veggies are tender.  Drain.
Put 1/3 of vegetable mixture into a food processor (set for chopping) with approximately 2 cups of soup base.  Puree, and add back to the soup.
Gradually mix the Cheddar cheese into the Dutch oven until melted. Mix in the remaining broccoli and carrots. Continue cooking about 5 minutes.
