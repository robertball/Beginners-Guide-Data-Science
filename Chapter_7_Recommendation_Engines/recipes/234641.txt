Ingredients:
2 cups wheat berries
6 cups water
1 teaspoon olive oil
salt to taste
1/3 cup olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), rinsed and drained
1 cup unsalted sunflower seeds
1 1/4 cups raisins

Directions:
Place wheat berries in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain.
Bring 6 cups water and wheat berries to a boil in a saucepan; add 1 teaspoon olive oil and salt. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the wheat berries are tender and have split open, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Drain and rinse wheat berries with cold water.
Whisk 1/3 cup olive oil, curry powder, parsley, red pepper flakes together in a bowl until dressing is evenly mixed.
Combine wheat berries, chickpeas, sunflower seeds, and raisins in a bowl. Drizzle dressing over wheat berry mixture; toss to coat and season with salt.

Description: 
Delicious, Mediterranean-influenced salad. It's a healthy whole food salad that can be eaten as a main dish or side dish. Eat immediately or chill for several hours.  I think it gets better after sitting for a few hours, as the raisins soften up and the wheat berries absorb some spice.  Eat up!
