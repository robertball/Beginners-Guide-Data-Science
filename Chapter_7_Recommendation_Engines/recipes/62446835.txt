Description: 
This came about when the house suddenly filled with visiting family.At the time,the 2 boxes were Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Dinner.I knew my family would not enjoy the powdered cheese.But did not have everything to bake a traditional dish.The Extra Sharp Grated Cheddar Cheese was a suggestion of,Julia Child?I just know it was a famous Chef and they stated that cheese loses its flavor as it cooks.
