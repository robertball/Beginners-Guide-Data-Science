Description: 
This is my favorite summertime drink, sitting on the patio enjoying life. Given to me by my college friend's Mom. Very enjoyable and thirst-quenching without being overpowering. They are the perfect light cocktail. When ready to serve, scoop out enough frozen mixture to fill your glass 1/2- to 3/4-full and top off with 7UpÂ®, gingerale, lemon-lime, or grapefruit soda.
