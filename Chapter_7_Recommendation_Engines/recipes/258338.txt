Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
1 (9 inch) shortcrust pastry crust
1 tablespoon mustard
2 (6 ounce) cans tuna in water, drained and flaked
2 large tomatoes, sliced
2 cups light cream
3 eggs
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup grated Gruyere cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch pie plate with butter.
Unroll pastry crust and press against the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Pierce all over with a fork. Cover with a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil; fill with ceramic pie weights.
Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove pie weights.
Spread mustard over cooled crust. Cover mustard with flaked tuna. Arrange tomato slices over tuna.
Whisk cream, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until smooth. Pour evenly over the tomato slices. Sprinkle Gruyere cheese over the egg mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Who doesn't have tuna in the cupboard and tomatoes in the fridge? This recipe does not need to be planned in advance, and if I do not have enough cream, I do half cream and half milk.
