Ingredients:
1 pound Bob EvansÂ® Original Recipe Sausage Roll (or can use 1 lb hot and 1 lb mild for a spicier  and meatier sausage gravy)
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
Salt and black pepper to taste( do not add if you are using spicier version,I prefer not to use alltogether for most packaged foods already have salt and the spicier hot sausage will be plenty warm without adding the pepper.)
8 prepared biscuits

Directions:
Crumble and cook sausage in large skillet over medium heat until browned. Stir in flour until dissolved. Gradually stir in milk. Cook gravy until thick and bubbly. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot over biscuits. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
Vivian's version using your favorite hot and mild sausage in gravy over piping hot biscuits fresh from the oven are a very satisfying meal just by themselves.
This is a hearty breakfast favorite. Biscuits served with hot sausage gravy are a sure way to stay satisfied until your next meal.Modified from: Super Sausage Gravy
