Ingredients:
½ pound ground turkey
½ pound ground chicken breast
½ pound bulk pork sausage
1  egg, beaten
1 (4 ounce) packet crushed saltine crackers
½ cup sweet barbeque sauce
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
1 teaspoon hickory-flavored liquid smoke
2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried minced onion
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons sweet barbeque sauce
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9 inch baking pan.
Combine the turkey, chicken, sausage, and egg in a large bowl. Stir in the saltine crackers, 1/2 cup barbeque sauce, 1 tablespoon of mustard, liquid smoke, parsley, dried onion, onion powder, garlic salt, and seasoned salt; mix well.  Press into the prepared pan.
Bake meatloaf in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Combine the brown sugar with the remaining 2 tablespoons of barbeque sauce, and 1 tablespoon of mustard to make a glaze.  Remove meatloaf from oven; brush with glaze. Return the meatloaf to the oven, and bake until no longer pink in the center, about 25 additional minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
