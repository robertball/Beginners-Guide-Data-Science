Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
3 ounces diced pancetta or bacon
1/3 cup white wine (optional)
12 ounces spaghetti or bucatini
1 cup 15% or 18% cream
2 large eggs
1 cup finely grated Canadian Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
Canadian Parmesan cheese for sprinkling over top

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Heat butter in a large wide saucepan over medium heat. Add pancetta; cook 7 minutes stirring frequently until crisp. Drain all but 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of fat from the pan. Add wine to the pan, if using; stir until wine is nearly evaporated. Turn heat to low.
Add pasta to boiling water; cook according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk cream with eggs, Parmesan, cornstarch, salt and pepper. Drain pasta; add to the pan with the pancetta. Increase heat to medium. Add cream mixture; stir 2 to 3 minutes until sauce thickens and pasta is coated in sauce. Stir in parsley. Serve immediately with Parmesan.
