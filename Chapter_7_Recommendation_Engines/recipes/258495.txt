Ingredients:
12 frozen dinner rolls (such as RhodesÂ®)
cooking spray
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
1/4 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons heavy whipping cream, or more as needed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Put frozen rolls on a baking sheet, spray a piece of plastic wrap with cooking spray and place over rolls. Let rise until doubled in size, about 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Mix white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Place melted butter in a small bowl.
Grab approximately 1 tablespoon of thawed and risen dough and roll into a ball. Dip the ball in the melted butter and roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Repeat to fill each muffin liner with 3 buttered and sugared dough balls.
Combine apples and raisins in a bowl. Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon apple-raisin mixture over each muffin.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.
Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, whipping cream, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until glaze is smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Drizzle glaze over muffins.
