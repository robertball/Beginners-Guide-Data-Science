Ingredients:
1.5 lbs Beef Stew Meat
1 cup flour (for dredging)
salt and pepper
2 Tabls oil
1 lge onion peeled and diced
6 carrots peeled and sliced 1/2 inch thick
4 ribs of celery sliced 1/2 inch thick
5 potatoes peeled and diced (If you want to do this step ahead of time keep potatoes submerged in water until ready to use so they don't turn brown)
Water to cover
seasoning to taste

Directions:
Combine flour salt and peper till well blended in a shallow bowl.
In a large dutch oven(big heavy pot with a lid)heat oil till hot.
Dredge stew meat in flour, shake off excess flour and place in hot oil.
Saute for several minutes on each side of the meat till you have a crusty brown surface. Place on a plate untill all the meat has been prepared this way.
Place the browned meat back in the dutch oven and pour in enough water to cover. Place lid on the pot!
Simmer on the stove top on low heat 1-2 hours till meat is fork tender.(Keep an eye on the water level and stir occasionally to pevent meat getting dry and/or sticking to pot. Add enough water as needed to keep the water level covering meat.)
When the meat is fork tender you can then add all the prepared vegetables.
Add enough water to almost cover the vegetables.
Place lid back on pot and simmer about another 1/2 hour till vegetables are fork tender.
Season to taste and enjoy!

Description: 
The recipe for this delicious traditional favorite came from my Mom and Grandmother. It does require some braising time but well worth it! If anyone in the family knew this was on the stove they would make a Beeline(mom use to say this) to Moms to have some! Served up with warm corn bread Mmmmmmm...
