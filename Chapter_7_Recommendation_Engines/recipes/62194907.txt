Using fork or your fingers, mix the butter with flour, sugar and salt until it looks like peas and crumbles.  Drizzle the milk in bit by bit, using the fork or a spoon to blend the crust until it just sticks together.  Divide the dough in two pieces, one bigger than the other - roughly 2/3 and 1/3.  The larger piece will be the bottom.  Pat the pieces into disc shapes and cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate at least 20 minutes.

Positon the oven rack in the lowest third rack of the oven and preheat to 400.  In a large bowl otss teh apples with sugars, flour and spices.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll out on a lightly floured surface.  The larger round will be the the 9 inch pie plate and trim the overhang to 1/2 inch.  Bursh the edge lightly with water.  Transfer the apple mixture to the crust, mounding in the center.  Top with the second crust.  Trim the overhange to 1 inch, fold the top curst edge under the the bottom crust edge and press and seal.  Cut several slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.  For the topping, brush the crust with milk and sprinkle with sugar.  Bake at 400 for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375.  Cook until crust is is brown and the juice bubbles, about an hour.  Cover the edges.
