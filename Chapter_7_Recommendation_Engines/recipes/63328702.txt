Ingredients:
2 cups fresh strawberries (or fresh blueberries)
1/4 cup sugar

Directions:
Rinse, drain and remove stems from berries. Cut strawberries into 1/2 inch pieces (or if using blueberries, leave whole). Place berries in extra large microwave-safe glass bowl (I use a 2 quart batter bowl with handle).  Add sugar and stir. Microwave for 2 minutes, stir carefully, then microwave and stir in 2 minute increments until jam is thick and glossy â€“ 6 to 10 minutes total cooking time, depending on your microwave and the size of the berries. Refrigerate until chilled.

Description: 
This quick & easy recipe makes a small batch of jam, not too sweet with fantastically bright berry flavor. When I couldn't find the original recipe from 20+ years ago, I created this simple one with just 2 ingredients.
