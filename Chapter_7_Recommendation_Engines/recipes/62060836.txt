Ingredients:
1 prepared graham cracker pie crust (8 or 9 inch)
1 box instant Coconut pudding mix
1 1/2 c milk
1/2 to 1 cup flaked coconut
1 small tub Cool Whip
1 1/2 cups vanilla ice cream

Directions:
Prepare the coconut pudding with 1 1/2 cups milk. While the pudding thickens, thaw the ice cream until it is soft and you can mix it with the pudding.  Using 2/3 of the pudding, add the thawed ice cream and 1/2 cup of coconut, blending well.  Pour the pudding ice cream mixture into the pie crust.  Blend the remaining 1/3 of the pudding with 2 cups Cool Whip.  Add 1/2 cup of coconut if desired.  Blend well and pour on top of the ice cream mixture.  Place in the freezer for at least 12 hours or overnight.  Let stand outside of the freezer about 20 minutes to thaw slighty before cutting.

This is an easy-to-prepare luscious dessert that will be a hit at any occasion.  My family and friends devour it every time.  You can use 1% milk, low-fat ice cream and non-fat Cool Whip for a lighter version.
