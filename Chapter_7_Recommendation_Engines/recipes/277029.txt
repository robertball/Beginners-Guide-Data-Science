Ingredients:
For the Pie Crust:
1 1/2 cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs
1/3 cup packed light brown sugar
6 tablespoons butter, melted
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
For the Pie:
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup whole milk
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
For the Meringue:
3 large egg whites, at room temperature
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/3 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, melted butter, flour, and cinnamon together for crust until mixture is binding together. Press into a 9-inch pie plate.
Line the crust with aluminum foil, gently pressing into place. Pour 1 inch of dry rice or dried beans onto the foil.
Bake in the center rack of the preheated oven until golden, about 7 minutes. Transfer the crust to a wire rack to cool.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Whisk pumpkin, heavy cream, brown sugar, milk, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and sea salt together in a bowl until well blended. Remove foil and rice or beans from crust and set on a baking sheet; pour in the filling.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 C). Continue to bake until set, about 40 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Raise the oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 C).
While the pie cools, make the meringue. Beat egg whites in a medium bowl using an electric mixer at medium speed until frothy, about 2 minutes. Add cream of tartar and continue to beat until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes more. Blend in sugar slowly; increase the mixer's speed to medium-high and beat until egg whites are stiff and glossy, about 2 minutes more.
Spoon meringue onto the pie, using the back of a spoon to form small peaks.
Return the pie to the oven and bake until meringue is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer the pie to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
