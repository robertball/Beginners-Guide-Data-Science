Ingredients:
1 pound thick spaghetti
8 ounces guanciale, cut into thin strips
3 ounces finely grated pecorino romano, divided
Black pepper to taste

Directions:
1.	Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the spaghetti to the boiling water.
2.	Immediately heat a non stick pan over medium heat. Add the sliced guanciale. Cook until tender. Add one ladle of pasta water, stir and cover. This will help create a sauce and keep the guanciale from crisping. As the pasta cooks, add another ladle of pasta water to the guanciale to maintain a sauce.
3.	When the pasta is two minutes from being done, reserve some of the water then drain the pasta. Add it to the guanciale sauce and toss adding more water if necessary. Turn off the heat. Add one third of the cheese to the pasta and toss, creating creaminess to the sauce.
4.	Divide into four plates. Top with the remaining cheese and fresh ground black pepper. Serve immediately.
Notes/Footnotes:
If you can’t find guanciale (pork jowl) then use pancetta.

Description: 
One of the four quintessential “primi” from the Lazio region in Italy, this pasta is beautiful in its simplicity with soft guanciale and tangy pecorino cheese. No onion, no garlic, no oil, this flavorful dish gets its character from slowly sautéing the guanciale and then creating a creamy sauce with the pasta water and a bit of pecorino romano before tossing with thick spaghetti. With only four ingredients, this is also a quick meal when you’re in a rush.
