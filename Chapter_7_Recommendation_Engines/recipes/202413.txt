Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into small chunks
flour for dusting
1 (13.4 ounce) package room-temperature fresh pizza dough
1 cup tomato sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 link Portuguese hot chourico sausage - halved lengthwise and sliced into thin half moons
1/4 red onion, sliced thin
1/4 cup banana pepper rings
1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella & cheddar pizza cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prepare a pizza pan with olive oil and flour.
Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the chicken in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes. Set aside.
Dust a flat working surface with flour. Roll the pizza dough out to the size of your pizza pan. Place dough on the prepared pan.
Stir the tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl; spread evenly over the surface of the dough. Scatter, in order, the chicken, chourico, red onion, banana peppers, pizza cheese, and Parmesan over the tomato sauce mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven on the middle rack until the cheese is lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Switch the oven setting to broil and cook another 5 minutes.

Description: 
My mom always made pizza with chourico growing up and I loved it. I have redone it and added more protein - chicken! I love homemade pizza.
