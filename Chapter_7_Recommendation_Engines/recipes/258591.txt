Ingredients:
Seasoning Mix:
2 tablespoons chili powder, or more to taste
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1/2 (1 ounce) square unsweetened chocolate, grated
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 bay leaf
Lentil Chili:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
2 cups diced onions
2 cups diced green bell pepper
6 cups vegetable broth
2 cups dry lentils
2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup water, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Mix chili powder, garlic powder, unsweetened chocolate, cinnamon, cumin, salt, cayenne pepper, allspice, cloves, and bay leaf together in a bowl until seasoning mix is well combined.
Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir onions and green bell pepper until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add vegetable broth and lentils; simmer for 20 minutes. Stir in seasoning mix, tomato sauce, apple cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce; simmer for 1 hour more, adding water if chili gets too thick.
Remove bay leaf from chili. Blend chili using an immersion blender until desired consistency is reached.

Description: 
Serve chili over spaghetti and top with chopped onion, finely shredded Cheddar cheese, kidney beans, and TabascoÂ® sauce. I used to love Skyline Cincinnati-style chili. When I went vegetarian I came up with this Skyline lentil chili to give me that Skyline taste. I use green or black lentils as the protein where standard Cincinnati-style would use ground meat. Even though I've gone back to eating meat this is still my preferred way to get my Skyline fix.
