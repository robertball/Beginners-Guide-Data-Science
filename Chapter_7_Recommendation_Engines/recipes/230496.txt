Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans yams, drained and cut into chunks
2 cups fresh cranberries
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup oatmeal
1/3 cup margarine, softened
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Toss yams and cranberries together in a bowl. Mix flour, brown sugar, oatmeal, margarine, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl. Add about half the oat mixture to the yam mixture; toss to combine and spread into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Sprinkle remaining oat mixture over the casserole.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 35 minutes.
