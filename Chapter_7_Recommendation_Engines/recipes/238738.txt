Description: 
I created this drink on Saint Patrick's Day. It is very potent, but the sweetness of the Kahlua® cuts the punch of the tequila. However, I still highly recommend that you sip it very slowly. 
I named it 'Dr. Horrible' because mixing those things together was a horrible idea, but it ended up being so very, very good.
