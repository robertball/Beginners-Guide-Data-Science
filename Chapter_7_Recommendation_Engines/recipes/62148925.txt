Ingredients:
2 T. olive oil
2 or 3 T. minced garlic (adjust according to your preference)
1 tsp. red pepper flakes (if desired)
1 lb. boneless skinless chicken tenders, cut into 1" pieces
1/2 c. Diced (1/4" pcs) onion
1/2 c. Diced (1/4" pcs) red bell pepper
salt to taste
1 1/2 c. white wine (I used a Chardonnay)
1/2 c. marinara sauce
1 bag fresh spinach
1 lb. frozen gnocchi
grated Parmesan cheese to taste

Directions:
Put salted water for gnocchi on to boil before starting to prep the ingredients below.
In a large pan, sautee the garlic and red pepper flakes in the olive oil over medium high heat until the garlic starts to turn golden brown.  Add in the chicken, salt, onions and peppers; sautee until chicken is cooked through.  Add in the wine and marinara sauce and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the liquid is reduced.
The water for the gnocchi should be boiling at this point, so add gnocchi to water.  Add spinach to chicken pan and cover.  The gnocchi only take a few minutes to cook if you are using frozen gnocchi.  As they begin to float in the water, use a slotted spoon to drain them and add them to the chicken and spinach (spinach will be steamed and reduced in size significantly).  After all gnocchi are added to chicken/spinach, stir in and then let simmer for a minute or two.   Serve with grated cheese.
