Ingredients:
20 oz. pkg. Hurst's Hambeens 15 Bean Soup Dry Beans , rinsed (any brand will do, but where I live this is the only brand available and it's delicious)
1 c. chopped onion
1/4 c. finely diced celery
1 - 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes (substituting half with diced tomatoes adds a little more texture)
2 - 32 oz. cartons or 8 cups chicken stock
1 tsp. chili powder
Juice of 1 lemon
4-5 cloves of garlic minced
1 ham bone
1 lb. diced ham (I used a glazed spiral ham which adds a little sweetness)
1 tbsp. agave nectar (if you aren't using a sweet ham)
chicken bouillon
Fresh cracked black pepper
diced jalapeno and/or chow chow (optional)

Directions:
Place rinsed beans, onions, garlic, celery and chicken stock in a slower cooker on low heat overnight.
A few hours before serving remove the ham bone and add the tomatoes,  lemon juice, chili powder, agave nectar (if needed) and ham packet from the beans package.
Add cracked pepper and bouillon to taste (I use bouillon in place of salt in slow cooker recipes)
serve topped with diced jalapenos and chow chow.

Description: 
My adaptation to the recipe on the back of the package of dry beans, because I felt like it needed a little more depth in flavor.
