Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups self-rising flour
1 stick very cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon lemon zest, or more to taste
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/3 cup whole milk, or more as needed
For the Strawberry Glaze:
3 strawberries, or more to taste
1 cup powdered sugar, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place self-rising flour in a large bowl. Cut in butter using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add poppy seeds, sugar, and lemon zest; mix to combine. Make a well in the center and pour in egg, lemon juice, and milk. Mix with a fork until dough starts to come together. Scoop up with one hand until a shaggy dough forms.
Pour dough out onto your work surface. Use your hands and a bench scraper to gather and press dough into a neat rectangle about 1- to 1-1/2-inches tall. Cut into 4 squares and then diagonally into 8 triangles. Space scones evenly onto a silicone-lined baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes, then transfer onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Mash strawberries finely to resemble a puree. Whisk in powdered sugar in batches to make a thick, spreadable glaze. Spread glaze over the cooled scones. Let scones cool on the rack until glaze hardens, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
The method for making these scones is very simple but can be a little scary for a novice baker, since the dough starts off in such rough shape. If you're able to wrestle it all together on the table, verses mixing into a dough ball in the bowl, you'll be rewarded with a much tenderer scone. But even a slightly tough one, painted with a fruity fresh strawberry glaze, will be a winner at any special-occasion brunch or teatime.
