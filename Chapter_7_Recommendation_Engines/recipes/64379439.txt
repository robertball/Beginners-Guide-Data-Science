Ingredients:
1 lb. crab meat, cooked
1 cup cauliflower florets, steamed well
2 pastured eggs
3 Tbsp. coconut flour
3 Tbsp. Paleo mayonnaise (homemade or Primal Kitchen)
2 Tbsp. fresh parsley, chopped
½ tsp. sea salt
½ tsp. Old Bay seasoning
2 Tbsp. avocado oil or coconut oil

Directions:
1. In a medium bowl, add the steamed cauliflower. Gently break up into small pieces, mashing some. Leave some pieces intact for texture.
2. Add the crab meat and parsley. Gently fold the mixture to distribute the ingredients evenly without breaking up the crab too much.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise, Old Bay and salt. Pour over the crab meat mixture and gently fold.
4. Now sift the coconut flour over the crab and gently fold the mixture until everything is uniform. The coconut flour is what helps give these cakes that crispy-golden crust.
5. Transfer to the fridge to chill and firm up - about 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 F.
6. Remove crab mixture from fridge and form into patties. I made mine about 2 inches thick and 3 inches in diameter.
7. Heat oil in a cast iron pan over medium-high heat. When oil is shimmering, add the crab cakes, being careful to not overcrowd the pan (this will cause steaming, not searing). Cook about 3 minutes to golden brown, then flip and cook another 3 minutes.
8. Place pan-fried crab cakes on a baking sheet and transfer to the preheated oven to cook through (12 to 15 minutes)
9. Serve with fresh lemon wedges and Paleo mayo
