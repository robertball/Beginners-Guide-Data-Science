Description: 
The key word in this recipe is ZESTY! Serves well with any kind of meal, or by itself as a salad for lunch. I add cottage cheese on the side of the dish. Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top is a nice addition, as well. Add zesty Italian salad dressing to taste. For large amounts, don't be surprised if you use an entire large bottle!
