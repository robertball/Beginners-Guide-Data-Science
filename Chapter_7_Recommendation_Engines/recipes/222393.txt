8 ounces assorted mushrooms, sliced
salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
Â¼ cup Pinot Noir or other dry red wine

Description: 
The key here is to brown whatever fungi you happen to choose in a good amount of brown butter. Then, when you add the pinot noir, the wine will glaze the surface rather than soak into the mushrooms. The fat sort of makes the flesh wine-proof, and everybody wins.
