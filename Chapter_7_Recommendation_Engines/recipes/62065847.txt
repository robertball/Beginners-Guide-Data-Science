Description: 
How can a cookie be so easy and have such a wonderful taste and texture! I made this at Christmas and it was devoured in a flash! Fortunately it was so easy to do, I ended up making several batches to keep up with demand.  Great for holiday parties or anytime. A great and easy mint and chocolate cookie recipe is hard to find, but here is a definate keeper.
