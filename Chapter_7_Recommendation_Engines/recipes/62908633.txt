Cook until herbs & spices are fragrant.  About 1 minute.

Off heat, coat surface of same skillet with cooking spray; set pan over medium-high heat.  Wipe salt from eggplant slices with paper towel and add eggplant to hot skillet.  Cook, until golden brown; about 2 minutes per side.
Arrange half of eggplant slices on bottom of prepared baking pan, slightly overlapping pieces to cover entire surface of pan.  Top eggplant with chicken mixture; top with 1/4 cup of grated topping.
Bake until top is golden brown and filling is hot, about 45 minutes.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Slice into 8 pieces and serve.

Description: 
This recipe is slimmed down by substituting the high-fat Greek Moussaka by using chicken instead of lamb or beef and replacing the bechamel sauce with a zesty tomato-based one.  So good.
