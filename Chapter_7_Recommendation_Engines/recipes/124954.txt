Description: 
With four sons in service during World War II, my mother sent these favorite cookies as a taste from home to 'her boys' in different parts of the world. These days, my 11 grandchildren are enjoying them as we did, along with my stories of long ago.                 -- Pearl Cochenour, Williamsport, Ohio
