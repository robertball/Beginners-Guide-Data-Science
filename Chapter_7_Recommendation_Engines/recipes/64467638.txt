Ingredients:
1 Bunch Kale - chopped
1 Apple - diced
1 Bulb Fennel - diced
2 tps. Olive Oil
16 Oz. Goat Cheese
2 Cups Breadcrumbs
Fresh Ground Peppercorns
Salt & Pepper
1 1/2 cups oil for frying

Directions:
Remove the ribs from the kale, and chop into a small dice.  Small dice the apple and fennel.
Heat 2 tsp. olive oil on medium-high until hot.  Add apple and fennel and saute until translucent, 1-2 minutes.
Add kale, season with salt and pepper, and saute until the kale has wilted, another 2 minutes.
Remove from heat and transfer into a large mixing bowl.  Stir in goat cheese and 1 cup of the breadcrumbs.
Form 1 in. balls from the goat cheese mixture.
Cover a plate with the remaining breadcrumbs and grind fresh pepper on top for "spots".
Roll each goat cheese ball in the breadcrumbs, making a "dinosaur egg".
Heat 2 cups of frying oil on high in a high sided saute pan.  When oil is hot, add enough balls to fill the pan without overcrowding.  Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown.
Transfer to a plate and enjoy!
