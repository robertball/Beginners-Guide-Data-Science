Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
10 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup currants

Directions:
Pulse flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a food processor. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles oatmeal. Transfer to a bowl.
Stir cream into flour mixture until just combined. Fold currants into dough. Transfer dough to a sheet of plastic wrap; fold to completely cover dough. Shape dough into a 1-inch thick disk and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon mat.
Unwrap dough and cut into 8 wedges. Arrange wedges on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
