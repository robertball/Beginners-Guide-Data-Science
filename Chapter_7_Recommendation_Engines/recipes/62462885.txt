Ingredients:
3 sticks of butter, softened
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
3 c. sugar
6 large eggs
3 c. plain flour
2 t. vanilla
OPTIONAL: Blueberries (1 to 2 cups)

Directions:
Cream butter and cream cheese until fluffy. Add sugar about a quarter cup at a time, beating well. Add one egg at a time, beating well. Add vanilla. Add flour a heaping tablespoon at a time, beating well. If you want to add blueberries, make sure the blueberries are damp, floured, and then gently fold those into the batter....don't stir too much.
Bake in a greased 10" tube pan (I use PAM spray for baking) at 350 for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Cool in pan on wire rack for 10 minutes.
