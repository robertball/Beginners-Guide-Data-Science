Description: 
Just Like Mom used to make except better, because this is like Dad makes. This is great for picnics, family reunions, feeding a FAMILY of 7 at HOME or a FAMILY of 8 at the FIRE STATION. Nothing beats a great traditional potato salad and this is just that...A GREAT TRADITIONAL POTATO SALAD!
