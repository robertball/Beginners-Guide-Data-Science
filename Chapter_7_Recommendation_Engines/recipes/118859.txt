Description: 
'I first prepared this pasta salad for a family picnic at a national park and everyone really enjoyed it. I'm sure Mother Nature helped make that meal so memorable, but I still find myself serving this often during the summer,' writes Pam Guerin of Skowhegan, Maine. A zippy dressing lightly coats the tossed mixture of pasta, chicken, tomato and onion.
