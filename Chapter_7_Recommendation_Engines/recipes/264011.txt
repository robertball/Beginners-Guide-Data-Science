Ingredients:
1 teaspoon whole white peppercorns
2 tablespoons peeled and chopped cilantro root
2 tablespoons garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 pound ground pork
2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons palm sugar
2 tablespoons ground peanuts
1 fresh pineapple
10 sprigs fresh cilantro
2 Thai red chile peppers (prik chee fah), cut into tiny slivers

Directions:
Place peppercorns in a mortar and pound with a pestle until finely ground. Add cilantro root and garlic; pound until everything is mashed together well. Set aside.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook garlic paste until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add pork and cook, stirring often, until pork is cooked through and mixed well with garlic paste, about 5 minutes. Season with fish sauce and palm sugar and stir until well combined. Mix in peanuts. Taste pork; it should taste savory with a hint of sweetness. Adjust seasonings if necessary.
Peel, core, and slice pineapple into 1-inch slices. Cut slices into bite-sized pieces and lay onto a serving dish. Top pineapple pieces with pork mixture. Garnish each pineapple piece with a cilantro leaf and a sliver of red chile pepper.

Pineapple and pork just love one another! This savory-sweet-tart appetizer is so delicious that I have been known to clear half a plate and call it dinner...
