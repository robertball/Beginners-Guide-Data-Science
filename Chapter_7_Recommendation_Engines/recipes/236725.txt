Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup kamut flour
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom (optional)
4 apples, peeled and diced
2 cups buttermilk
1/2 cup canola oil
2 large eggs
1/3 cup honey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Stir oats, whole wheat flour, kamut flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom together in a bowl. Add apples and toss to coat.
Beat buttermilk, canola oil, eggs, and honey together in a separate bowl.
Make a well in the center of oat mixture; pour buttermilk mixture into the well. Mix until batter is just moistened. Set aside to soften oats, about 5 minutes. Generously fill muffin cups with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are golden brown and spring back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
This is a tasty, moist muffin that's good for you too. I named this 'apple crisp' because it has the same ingredients as warm apple crisp except in a muffin. It is delicious with a streusel topping!
