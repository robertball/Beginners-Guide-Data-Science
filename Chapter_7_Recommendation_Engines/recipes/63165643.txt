Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
1 1/2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup
6 slices bread, crusts removed
6 eggs
salt and black pepper to taste
6 tablespoons heavy cream
6 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese, or as desired

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble and set aside.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin cups.
Combine the melted butter and maple syrup in a small bowl. Flatten a piece of bread with a rolling pin. Brush the bread with the butter mixture. Line the muffin cup with the flattened bread. Repeat with the remaining bread slices. Bake in a preheated oven until the bread crisps, about 3 to 5 minutes.
Sprinkle crumbled bacon into the bottom of the toast cups. Crack an egg into each cup. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Top each egg with 1 tablespoon of heavy cream and 1 tablespoon cheese. Bake until the whites are just set, about 10 to 14 minutes or until the eggs are cooked to your taste.
