Ingredients:
3/4 stick of butter
60 marshmellows
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
12 cups cereal

Directions:
In a dutch oven, melt the butter over low heat, add the marshmellows, stirring till melted. Take off the heat and stir in the vanilla. Try not to let the vanilla hit the bottom of the pan because it will evaporate off - stir as you're adding it. Add roughly 12 cups of cereal and stir all of it together.
Butter an oblong cake pan. Dump the cereal mixture into it and pat it down into the pan making it sort of level - no need to crush it down. Use cold water on your palm (not WET, just lightly damp) to keep it from sticking to your hands. Let it set and cut it into bars.

Description: 
This is truly no big deal and for whatever reason, my kids think I do something different for this but I don't. I just add more cereal than it calls for.
