Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups sweet potatoes, baked, cooled and pureed
1/2 cup butter, softened
8 oz Neufchatel cheese, softened (low fat cream cheese)
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1 1/2 cups sugar
4 eggs at room temperature
3 cups cake flour
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp ginger
1/4 tsp salt
2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Poke several holes in sweet potatoes and bake on a parchment lined cookie sheet for 45-60 minutes or until done. Once cooled, peel and puree sweet potatoes in food processor or powerful blender.
Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees.
Cream butter and cream cheese in a stand mixer until creamy. Add sugars and continue to beat until fluffy.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add sweet potato puree and mix until well incorporated.
Mix all dry ingredients in a medium size bowl. Slowly add to sweet potato mixture. Add vanilla.
Bake for 75-85 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
Cool on wire rack.
Note: Regular cream cheese can be used in place of Neufchatel cheese.

Description: 
Sweet Potatoes during the holidays is a must in our household. This time I decided to do something different other than a casserole or a pie. I used white sweet potatoes but any sweet potatoes will do. You can eat this cake plain, topped with whip cream or topped with a glaze. Either way this pound cake is delicious!
