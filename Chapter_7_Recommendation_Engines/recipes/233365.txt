Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
1 1/3 cups water
2/3 cup quinoa
1 (16 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained and rinsed
1 (16 ounce) can stewed tomatoes (such as Del MonteÂ® Stewed Tomatoes with Onions, Celery, and Green Peppers)
1/4 cup walnut pieces
1/2 cup golden raisins
1 bunch green onions, sliced, white parts and tops separated
1/2 lemon, juiced
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried mint leaves
1 pinch ground cinnamon
2 large red bell peppers, halved lengthwise, seeds and membrane removed
1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil.
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix garbanzo beans, stewed tomatoes, walnuts, raisins, white parts of green onions, lemon juice, chili powder, garlic powder, mint, and cinnamon together in a bowl; stir in cooked quinoa.
Arrange red bell pepper halves, hollow-side facing upwards, in the prepared baking sheet. Spoon quinoa mixture into each red bell pepper half.
Bake in the preheated oven until bell peppers are tender, about 30 minutes. Spoon a few teaspoons of drippings from the bottom of the baking dish over each stuffed pepper; top each with 1 tablespoon goat cheese and green parts of green onions.

Description: 
This is a very healthy, vegetarian main course with lots of protein from the chickpeas and quinoa. The flavors in this recipe are a blend of Persian and Mediterranean. Very easy to make and super satisfying! This freezes really well for a dinner or lunch later on (goat cheese and all!)
