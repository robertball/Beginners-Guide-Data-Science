Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinles chicken breasts
1/4 c yellow mustard
2 tsp soy sauce
1 TBSP worcestershire sauce
2 large garlic cloves, pressed
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
sprinkles of weber's grill creations roasted garlic & herb to taste.

Directions:
Mix the marinade, pour it over the chicken. I only marinated the chicken for about 35 minutes and it actually came out awesome. Then, sprinkle the seasoning mix over top. Grill as usual.

Description: 
Didn't have all the ingredients I usually use to marinate chicken, but threw some stuff together. My husband was freaking out and told me I had to write this down. And we grill a lot of tasty food. For some reason, it was just the right combo of things. This would probably be pretty delicious on grilled pork chops or grilled pork roast as well.
