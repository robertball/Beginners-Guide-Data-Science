Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 leek - trimmed, halved, and sliced, or more to taste
1 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, divided
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 flounder fillets

Directions:
Heat olive oil and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes; do not allow garlic to color. Add leek and broth; bring to a simmer, 1 to 2 minutes. Add lemon juice, 1 tablespoon cilantro, cumin, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Simmer until flavors combine, about 1 minute.
Add flounder fillets to the skillet. Spoon some of the liquid over the fillets, cover, and remove from heat. Let stand until flounder is opaque throughout, 4 to 5 minutes. Uncover and garnish with remaining cilantro.

Description: 
This is a variation on a simpler dinner I wanted to add some more flavor to. The added flavor comes from North African spices. The broth used to poach the fish can be easily multiplied to create a wonderful soup to which you can add tomatoes, beans, green peppers, and any other veggies you would like. Serve with any green veggie and either noodles, rice, or potatoes to make a full meal. Enjoy!
