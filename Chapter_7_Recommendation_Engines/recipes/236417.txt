Description: 
What makes a burger Seattle-style? Flannel bun? Uh, no. Micro-brew on the side? Well, okay, probably. Espresso in the aioli? Yes! Don't knock it, it totally works! Just be careful the sauce doesn't get into your hipster beard. For best results, use Beecher's® cheese, Walla Walla onions, Chateau Ste. Michelle® red wine, and Starbucks® espresso. Cook the burgers in a skillet or outside on the grill, preferably in the rain. You hungry, bro?
