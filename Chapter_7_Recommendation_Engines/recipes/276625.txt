Ingredients:
12 3/4 ounces fresh mung bean sprouts
6 cups water
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup finely shredded sui choy (Napa cabbage)
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon sesame oil, or more to taste
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
1 teaspoon fish sauce (optional)
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons grated carrot
1 green onion, finely chopped, or more to taste

Directions:
Rinse bean sprouts in cold water and discard any bad sprouts.
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Plunge bean sprouts and cabbage into the pot and let boil for 3 to 4 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk rice vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, sesame seeds, fish sauce, and garlic together in a bowl for dressing.
Drain water from the pot and run cold water on the sprouts for 1 to 2 minutes. Squeeze bean sprouts with your hands to remove excess water. Place sprouts and cabbage into a mixing bowl and add carrot, green onion, and dressing; mix well.
