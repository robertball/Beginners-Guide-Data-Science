Ingredients:
1 pound rigatoni pasta
4 tablespoons Filippo BerioÂ® Olive Oil
4 garlic cloves, sliced
3 sweet Italian sausages
3 hot Italian sausages
1 pound broccoli rabe, stems removed
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 cup chicken stock
Kosher salt and red pepper flakes, to taste
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Prepare rigatoni pasta according to package directions. Drain, set aside and keep warm.
In a large, heavy skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic. Brown slightly. Then add sausages; brown well and remove them from the skillet. Next add the broccoli rabe. Stir in white wine, loosening any browned bits of sausage and garlic on the bottom of the skillet (deglaze). Pour in chicken stock and cover. Cook until the broccoli rabe is tender (about 10 minutes).
Return the sausages to the skillet and remove from heat. Season with kosher salt and red pepper flakes. Add rigatoni to the skillet; toss well. Top with grated Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
