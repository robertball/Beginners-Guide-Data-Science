Ingredients:
6 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
2 eggs
1 c. milk
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
2 heaping Tbsp applesauce
2 c. flour
2/3 c. sugar
1 Tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 c. shredded carrot
Vanilla Glaze

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and position rack in center of oven.  Butter or line 12 muffin cups.
In a large measuring cup, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla, and applesauce.  In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon.  Stir in the shredded carrot.  With a rubber spatula, fold in the wet ingredients and the melted butter just until combined.
Fill the muffin cups (cups should be nearly full) and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18-20 minutes.
Transfer to a wire rack and let cool 5 minutes before removing from pan.  Top with a vanilla glaze when slightly cooled.
