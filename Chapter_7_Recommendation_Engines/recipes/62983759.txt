Ingredients:
1 cup canned pumpkin
2 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons grated fresh gingerroot
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon Spice Islands® pure vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
48 wonton wrappers
Oil for frying
SAUCE:
1 cup packed brown sugar
2/3 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup butter, cubed
2/3 cup evaporated milk
1 teaspoon Spice Islands® pure vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
For filling, in a large bowl, beat the first seven ingredients until blended. Place a tablespoon of filling in the center of each wonton wrapper. (Keep remaining wrappers covered with a damp paper towel until ready to use.) Moisten edges with water; top with another wonton wrapper. Pinch edges with a fork to seal. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
In an electric skillet, heat 1 in. of oil to 375°. Fry wontons, a few at a time, for 30-60 seconds on each side or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
For sauce, in a small saucepan, combine the brown sugar, corn syrup and butter. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; boil for 1 minute, without stirring. Remove from the heat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in remaining ingredients. Serve with wontons. Yield: 12 servings (2 cups sauce).
