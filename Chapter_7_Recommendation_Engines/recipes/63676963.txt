Ingredients:
6 chicken breasts
8 cups mixed greens (we like spinach, red leaf, green leaf, and romaine)
four fresh peaches
4 to 6 dried orange slices (recommend Simple & Crisp); optional
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
two avocados, sliced
olive oil, sea salt, and cracked black pepper for cooking
Dressing:
1 cup fresh-squeezed orange juice
1/2 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon orange or cider vinegar
2 tomatillos, quartered
1 shallot, peeled and quartered
1 or 2  jalapenos, seeded
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Rinse and pat dry chicken breasts and drizzle with olive oil; season with sea salt and pepper.  Grill over medium-high heat until just done but still moist.  Slice crosswise into strips.
Meanwhile, make dressing by blending ingredients together using a stick blender or high-powered blender.
Finally, build salad:
Create a bed of salad greens.  (May be lightly dressed with salad dressing just before serving.)  Top with chicken breast, sliced peaches, sliced avocado, and chopped fresh mint.  Garnish with crumbled dried orange slices.
