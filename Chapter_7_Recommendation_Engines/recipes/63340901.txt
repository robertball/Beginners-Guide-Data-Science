Ingredients:
3 Tbsp flour
3 Tbsp unsalted butter
3 cups milk
2 cups diced potatoes
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper
pinch of celery salt, if desired
1/3 cup water
1/3 cup finely diced white onion

Directions:
Place the potatoes in a heavy pot and cover with water.
Boil until just tender. Do not over cook.
Place the onions and water in a small pan and cook until the water evaporates. Set aside.
Meanwhile, make a roux by melting the butter in a large pan. Once melted, remove from heat and stir in flour to make a paste.
Very slowly, add 1 cup of milk, whisking constantly until lumps are gone.
Add in remaining milk.
Stir mixture constantly until it thickens and boils. Boil one minute to get rid of starchy taste.
Add in onions, potatoes, and salt & pepper.
Simmer for 20 minutes. Stir occasionally to reduce the "skin" from forming on top.
Serve hot.
