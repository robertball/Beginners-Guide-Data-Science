Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool completely.
Make Filling:  In a large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar, alternating with milk. Beat in cinnamon and vanilla until light and fluffy.
