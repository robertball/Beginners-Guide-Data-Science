Ingredients:
1 pound asparagus
kosher salt
pepper
olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Break off the tough ends of the asparagus and, if they're thick, peel them.
Place the asparagus on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, then toss to coat the asparagus completely. Spread the asparagus in a single layer and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Roast the asparagus for 15 to 25 minutes, depending on thickness, until tender but still crisp.
