Ingredients:
1 c	crisco
1 c	lightly salted butter (regular salted butter will work too)
2 Tbsp	meringue powder
1 tsp	pure vanilla extract (may want to use a clear vanilla for a pure white frosting)
1 tsp	butter flavoring
1/2 tsp	almond extract
1/4 tsp	orange extract
1/4 tsp	lemon extract
2 lb	powdered sugar (must be brand name - store brand will not work)
5-6 Tbsp	warm water
1/4 tsp	salt

Directions:
In a small cup, measure out water and salt. Set aside and let the salt dissolve.
2 If you have a standing mixer it is highly recommended. But a hand held mixer with a very large bowl will work also.
Cream together the crisco and butter until well combined
3 Add meringue powder and all the extracts and flavorings. Mix well.
4 On low speed, gradually add the powdered sugar until well combined.
It will get clumpy after the whole 2lbs. has been distributed.
5 Continue on low speed and gradually add salt/water mix.
Add more water to frosting if necessary.
