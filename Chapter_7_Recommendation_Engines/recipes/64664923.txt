1-2 tbsp. Sesame Seeds (for garnish)
1-2 Green Onions, cut into 1" pieces (for garnish)

2. In a medium skillet, heat remaining 1 tbsp. Oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic, ginger and onions. Saute until onions are translucent. Add carrots and bell peppers and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add bean sprouts and cabbage and cook for another 1-2 minutes
3. Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine soy sauce, water, red pepper, black pepper, brown sugar, honey and cornstarch and mix well. Set aside.
