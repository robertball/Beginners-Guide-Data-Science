Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground chicken
1/4 cup Frank's Sweet Heat hot sauce
1/2 teaspoon steak seasoning
1/2 teaspoon paprika
4 Kaiser rolls, split
4 leaves iceberg lettuce
4 slices Havarti cheese
Ranch dressing, optional

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Mix the ground chicken, 1/4 cup hot sauce and seasonings together in a mixing bowl until evenly blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. Sprinkle steak seasoning on top.
Cook the chicken burgers on the preheated grill 6 to 7 minutes on each side, or until done.
Butter & grill the Kaiser rolls, if desired, until toasted.
To assemble the burgers, place a lettuce leaf on each roll bottom. Top with a burger patty, then spoon on 2 tablespoons of blue cheese sauce, and 2 tablespoons celery. Place the top of the roll on top to finish the sandwich.
