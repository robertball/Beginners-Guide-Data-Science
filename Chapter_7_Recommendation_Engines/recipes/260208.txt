Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
4 cloves garlic, peeled and halved
4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced
Balsamic vinegar (optional)
Fresh basil leaves (optional)
Toasted slices French bread (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.
In a greased 15x10x1-inch baking pan, place chicken breasts. Season chicken with the salt and pepper. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Bake 10 minutes.
Remove from oven and add the cherry tomatoes, cannellini beans, and garlic cloves. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Top chicken breasts with the sliced mozzarella.
Bake 15 to 18 minutes more or until tomatoes burst and chicken is done (165 degrees F). Using a slotted spoon, divide mixture among four shallow bowls. Drizzle with pan juices as desired.
Before serving, drizzle with balsamic vinegar and top with fresh basil leaves, if desired. Serve with toasted slices of French bread, if desired.
