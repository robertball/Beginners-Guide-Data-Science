1 Tablespoon butter/margarine
2 Tablespoons olive oil/vegetable oil

1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese (2oz)

In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat butter and oil over medium-high heat until butter is melted. Cook onion and garlic in butter mixture 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently, until onion is tender.
