Ingredients:
1 cup dried chickpeas/garbanzo beans, soaked in cold water overnight
1 small onion, diced
2 cloves garlic
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
1/4 cup parsley, chopped
1 teaspoon coriander seeds, toasted and ground
1 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted and ground
1 lemon, zest
2 tablespoons whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
cayenne to taste
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Pulse the drained chickpeas, onion, garlic, cilantro, parsley, coriander, cumin and lemon zest until it forms a coarse meal.
Sprinkle in the flour and baking soda and pulse a few times to combine, then test the mixture to make sure that it holds together adding more flour until it does.
Refrigerate the mixture in a covered container for a few hours.
Form the mixture into balls or patties.
Heat oil in pan to 350F, fry the balls in small batches until golden brown, about 4-6 minutes and set aside on paper towels to drain.
