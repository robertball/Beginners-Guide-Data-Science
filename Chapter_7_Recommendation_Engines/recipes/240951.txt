Description: 
This is a favorite in my house when tomatoes are in bloom. It does come with a lot of prep work but the end result is amazing. Forgive me if its not to your liking, this is the first time I am posting a recipe. I love garlic and this hits the spot. If you like it spicy add some chiles. Serve with crusty bread!
