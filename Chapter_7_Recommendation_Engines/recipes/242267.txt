Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package rotini pasta
1 cup frozen petite peas, or more to taste
1 (8 ounce) package imitation crabmeat, flaked
2/3 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste
2/3 (8 ounce) bottle bottled oil and vinegar salad dressing (such as Newman's OwnÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
Put frozen peas into a large colander. Drain rotini over the peas. Fill the now-empty pot with cold water. Plunge pasta and peas into the cold water to chill completely; drain.
Mix imitation crabmeat, Swiss cheese, and parmesan cheese in a large bowl; add pasta mixture and toss to mix. Pour dressing over the salad and toss to lightly coat.

Description: 
I invented this simple pasta salad about ten years ago, and my son requests it as his birthday meal ever since. It's always a hit at potluck dinners and tailgate parties. The trick to make it taste fresh is to dress shortly before serving. The extra dressing in the bottle can be used the next day if there are leftovers to freshen the taste. My son likes the leftovers, but I think it tastes best the day it is made.
