Description: 
There's nothing wrong with giving homemade holiday gifts, just as long as they're something somebody would actually want and use. Thanks to things like fruitcakes so dense they have their own gravitational fields, making edible gifts has gotten a bad name, but that's not an issue with this chipotle oil, especially if that certain someone on your gift list likes the spicy stuff!
