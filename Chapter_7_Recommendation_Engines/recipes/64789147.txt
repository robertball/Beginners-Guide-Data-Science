Ingredients:
2 tbs extra-virgin olive oil
1 tbs dairy free butter (I use coconut oil flavored butter)
1 medium white onion, finely chopped
1 large clove garlic, smashed and peeled
2 corn starch
3 cups lower-salt chicken broth (for vegan option use vegetable stock)
28-oz can crushed tomatoes
14-oz can diced tomatoes (including juice)
1-1/2 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1 tsp dried basal
1 tsp dried dill
1 tsp dried thyme
13 oz can coconut cream (I poured out the coconut water and drank it)

Directions:
In a large soup pot, heat the oil and dairy free butter over medium-low heat until the butter melts. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the corn starch and stir to coat the onion and garlic. Add the broth, tomatoes, sugar, herbs, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then add coconut cream. Let cool briefly and then use an immersion blender to blend (you can also use a blender or food processor but will probably take a few batches).
