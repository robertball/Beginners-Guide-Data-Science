Ingredients:
Boneless sirloin pork roast
1 can cranberry sauce with whole berries
1 envelope instant onion soup mix

Directions:
Remove the net of strings from the roast (if any).  (It's easier than trying to remove them after it's cooked!)
Rub roast all over with onion soup mix.
Place roast in slow-cooker.
Pour cranberry sauce all over.
Cook on LOW for 8 to 10 hours.
After removing roast from pot, melt some butter in a pan over very low heat and whisk in flour to make a paste. Add some juice from the crock pot and a little milk if you like a lighter-color gravy.  Taste gravy before seasoning -- it's already pretty flavorful!

Description: 
I tried this cut of meat when it was on sale, and for lack of any other ideas I took suggestions from the back of the label, with a few tweaks like making gravy.  This is a very popular dish at our house, and it could not be easier!
