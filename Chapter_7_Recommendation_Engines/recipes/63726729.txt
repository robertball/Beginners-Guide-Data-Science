Ingredients:
1 cup rice
2 cups water
2 chicken bouillon cubes
1 pound ground beef
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 cup chopped onion
6 bell peppers, sliced
8 ounces tomato sauce
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Boil water, dissolve bouillon cubes and add rice. Cover, reduce heat to low and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 1/2 hour.
In a large frying pan fry beef, garlic and onions over medium heat until onions are translucent and meat is no longer pink, about 10 minutes.
Combine rice, meat and sliced peppers in a large casserole dish. Pour the tomato sauce over the mixture.
Bake for approximately 1 hour, or until peppers are tender.
Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
