Title:
Easy Ranch-Parmesan Chicken Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
½ sleeve buttery round crackers, crushed
1 cup dry bread crumbs
¼ cup Parmesan cheese
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2  eggs, beaten
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons butter, cut into 4 pats, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.
Mix crushed crackers, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, ranch dressing, salt, and pepper in a resealable 1-quart storage bag.
Dip a chicken breast into the beaten eggs. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Add chicken to the bag with the breading and shake until completely covered. Place in the prepared baking dish. Dredge remaining chicken breasts. Top each breast with a pat of butter.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is golden brown on the outside and no longer pink on the inside, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
