Ingredients:
3 Tbl butter
3 Tbl olive oil
5 - 7 white onions
1 clove garlic finely diced
pinch salt
1 1/2 Tsp black pepper
1 Tbl brown sugar
1 Tbl dried thyme
1/3 cup port wine
large box of good quality beef stock
sliced loaf french bread
5 slices of swiss cheese
1/4 cup shredded parmesan reggiano

Directions:
Add butter and oil to a large soup pot and turn on med-low. Slice onions into thin rings and add to pot. (TIP: If onions are refrigerated they will be easier to cut - less tears.)
Add garlic, salt and pepper to pot. Stir every 10 minutes to check that onions are not browning on the outside - if they are, reduce heat. Onions take about an hour to fully caramelize so be patient!
Once caramelized, add sugar and thyme and let melt in for 2 minutes. Next add wine to deglaze bottom of pan. Let wine simmer for 5 minutes then add beef stock. Let simmer for 10 minutes - taste and add salt or pepper if needed.
Ladle into oven safe crocks. Float sliced french bread on top, cover with slice of swiss and then sprinkle with shredded parm. Set on cookie sheet and place under broiler until cheese is melted and browned (2-3 minutes).

Description: 
This soup is delicious and rich - we like it best on cold days. You can use more or less broth depending on how thick you like your French Onion Soup - also try making with a Chardonnay as a delicious variation
