Ingredients:
3 whole vanilla beans
1 cup vodka

Directions:
Cut each vanilla bean lengthwise with a sharp knife or scissors, leaving 1 inch uncut at each end of the bean. Place split beans into the bottom of a glass jar or bottle. Pour vodka over the beans to cover completely. Screw or fasten the lid on the jar and shake. Store, shaking the jar occasionally, in a cool, dark place for at least 2 months.

Description: 
This lasts for years. You can keep topping it off with vodka once in a while as you use it; just remember to give it a good shake. You can also make vanilla sugar by putting a split vanilla bean into a jar of white sugar.
