Ingredients:
1/2 cup coconut milk
1/3 cup lime juice
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3 tablespoons coconut oil, or more to taste
2 tablespoons shredded coconut
4 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1/2 tablespoon garam masala
1/4 teaspoon curry powder
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 package wooden skewers
1 1/2 cups pineapple chunks
1 (8 ounce) package baby bella mushrooms

Directions:
Mix coconut milk, lime juice, cilantro, coconut oil, shredded coconut, garlic, garam masala, and curry powder together in a large bowl. Add shrimp. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
While shrimp marinates, fill a pan with water. Soak skewers in water so they will not burn during grilling.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Thread shrimp, pineapple, and mushrooms onto 2 skewers at a time, placed about 1/2-inch apart, so you can turn skewers easily while grilling. Brush with marinade.
Grill skewers on the preheated grill until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
