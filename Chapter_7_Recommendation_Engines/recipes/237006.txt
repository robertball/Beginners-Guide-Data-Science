Ingredients:
8 MissionÂ® Small/Fajita Super Soft Flour Tortillas
1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup diced fresh mango
1/2 cup diced red onion
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce
1/2 cup Ranch dressing
Fresh lime wedges, as needed

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl, combine the ranch dressing and Sriracha. Reserve refrigerated.
In a separate mixing bowl, combine shrimp, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and lime juice. Toss to combine.
Heat a saute pan over medium high heat until hot. Add olive oil, then the shrimp, and saute until pink and cooked through (about 2 to 3 minutes), turning often to cook evenly.
To assemble tacos, place about 4 warm shrimp into each tortilla and top with 1 tbsp. diced mango and 1 tbsp. diced onions. Drizzle with Sriracha ranch dressing and sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Serve with lime wedges to be squeezed over top.
