Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup granular sucrolose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
2 eggs
1/2 cup applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
2 pinches ground allspice
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup buttermilk
2 apples, peeled and chopped
1 apple, peeled and shredded
1/3 cup chopped walnuts
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons rolled oats
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons cold butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Beat 1/2 cup softened butter with 1/2 cup white sugar and sucralose sweetener in a bowl until creamy. Beat in eggs, applesauce, vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice until smooth.
Mix 2 cups flour, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into butter mixture, alternating with buttermilk until just combined. Fold in chopped and shredded apples and walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Mix 1/3 cup flour, rolled oats, 2 tablespoons white sugar, brown sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl; cut in 3 tablespoons cold butter until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle topping over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Soooo yummy! Everyone will beg for seconds. This bread makes your entire house smell like heaven, so bake it right before you have guests over. Sometimes I like to double the topping and push some into the bread batter. Also, I use Rome apples when I make this. Splat!
