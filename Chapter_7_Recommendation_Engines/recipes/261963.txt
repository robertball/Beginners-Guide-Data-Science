Ingredients:
5 cups low-sodium chicken broth
3 cups water
1 cup chopped zucchini
1/2 cup frozen corn
3 carrots, sliced
3 red potatoes, cubed
2 stalks celery, diced
1/2 cup frozen peas
1/2 cup frozen green beans
1/4 cup olive oil
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 large yellow onion, diced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon tomato paste
2 bay leaves
1/2 cup uncooked white rice
1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, water, zucchini, corn, carrots, potatoes, celery, peas, and green beans in a large pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are slightly tender, about 10 minutes.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add turkey; cook and stir, breaking it up into small pieces, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and garlic. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt, cumin, coriander, and turmeric. Pour mixture into the pot with the vegetables. Add the remaining salt, tomato paste, and bay leaves. Reduce heat to low and simmer soup until vegetables are soft, about 1 hour.
Stir rice into the soup; simmer until tender, about 15 minutes more. Portion soup into bowls and top each with cilantro.
