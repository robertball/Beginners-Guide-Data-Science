Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm water (110-115F)
1 package rapid-rise yeast
2/3 cup butter -- softened
1/2 cup milk (at room temperature)
2 eggs (at room temperature)
3 cups bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup crumbled Blue cheese
1/2 teaspoon coarse ground or freshly cracked pepper
Butter -- melted

Directions:
Proof the yeast in the warm water until a creamy head forms.
Stir in the milk, eggs, softened butter and 1 cup of flour.  Continue on low speed until smooth.
Add the salt, cheese, pepper and 1 more cup of flour.
Continue on low speed until smooth, scrape down the sides frequently.
Add the remaining flour and continue beating on low until a smooth batter has formed.
Cover and allow to rest for 10-15 minutes.
Pre-heat oven to 375.  Grease a 2 qt casserole or 5x9 loaf pan.
Stir down the batter by beating, by hand, about 25 strokes then spread batter evenly in prepared pan.  Cover and let rise until double, about 45-60 minutes.
Bake at 375 until top is golden brown, 40-45 minutes.
Immediately turn out from pan to a cooling rack and brush the top with melted butter.
Bread is best when served warm.
