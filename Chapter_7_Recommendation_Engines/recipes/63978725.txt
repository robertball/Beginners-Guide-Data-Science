Ingredients:
1 c white flour
1/2 c spelt flour (or add another 1/2 cup white)
1 c whole wheat flour
1 c oats
1 t baking powder
1 t baking soda
1/2 t sea salt
1 c honey (or raw sugar)
1 1/2 c plain yogurt
1 6-oz container raspberry or blueberry yogurt

1 cup each fresh blueberries and raspberries
STREUSEL
1/4 c flour
3 T brown sugar
1/4 c chopped, lightly toasted walnuts, pecans or almonds
1 1/2 T butter, melted

Directions:
Prepare muffin tins with paper or oil.  Prepare streusel first and set aside.
For muffins:  Mix dry ingredients well.  In a separate bowl, mix all wet ingredients except berries, and beat together well.  Pour the wet ingredients into the dry mix and beat firmly and quickly just until thoroughly moistened.  Add berries and fold in gently.  Divide batter into greasted or paper-lined muffin tins and bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.  Cool for 15 minutes in the pan to set the berries, remove from pan, and cool on wire rack.

Description: 
Original recipe from Barbara O'Neals novel How to Bake A Perfect Life.  This is a muffin for those crazy mornings when you need calories in a hurry.  The yogurt and nuts add protein, the whole grains add fiber, and the fruit adds nutrients as well as general seduction for picky children.  The streusel can be left off to save calories but trust me you're better off with one good one.  Serve with boiled eggs for a super-fast breakfast.
