Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups bow-tie pasta (farfalle)
1 pound ground beef
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the bow-tie pasta and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes; drain off excess fat. Stir in garlic and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are soft, about 5 minutes.
Place the bow-tie pasta into a large serving dish, and pour the ground beef mixture over the pasta. Sprinkle on the chopped basil. Toss lightly to combine, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese before serving.
