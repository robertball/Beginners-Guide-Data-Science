Ingredients:
2/3 pound ground beef
1/3 pound ground pork
2 tablespoons minced green onion
2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano
1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 clove garlic, minced
2 dashes Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 1/2 ounces fresh white bread crumbs
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 1/2 ounces pancetta, chopped
3 tablespoons minced onion
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons minced carrot
2 tablespoons minced celery
2 tablespoons minced red bell pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
2 grinds ground black pepper
1 cup white wine
2 tablespoons tomato puree
1 (28 ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes, chopped
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Mix ground beef, ground pork, green onion, oregano, parsley, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Slowly add and mix breadcrumbs into meat mixture to desired consistency. Form mixture into balls, roll them in remaining bread crumbs to coat, and arrange onto a shallow tray. Cover meatballs with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir pancetta in the hot oil until browned, about 4 minutes. Add onion and garlic to the pancetta; continue to cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir carrot, celery, and red bell pepper into the pancetta mixture; cook until the carrot softens slightly, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle basil, oregano, coriander, and black pepper over pancetta mixture; stir to season evenly.
Pour wine over the pancetta mixture. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until the liquid reduces by about half.
Quickly stir tomato puree into pancetta mixture; add chopped tomatoes. Cook and stir the mixture until the tomatoes begin to break down into a sauce, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer until the sauce thickens, 60 to 90 minutes.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over low heat. Cook and stir meatballs in batches in hot oil until evenly browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes; drain on a plate lined with paper towel.
Gently drop meatballs into the simmering sauce; cook together until meatballs are heated through, about 10 minutes.
