Avocado and Chilli soup Recipe

Ingredients:
- Shallot; 1, finely chopped
- Chillies; 2 (or to taste), deseeded and finely chopped
- Olive Oil; 1 Tablespoon
- Tomato; 1 medium, peeled, de-seeded, diced
- Avocados; 2, medium, ripe, halved, stone removed, flesh scraped out and roughly chopped
- Vegetable Stock; 1 litre (4 1/4 cups)
- Flat-leaf parsley; small bunch, finely chopped, retain some leaves for garnish
- White Balsamic Vinegar; 1 Tablespoon
- Cream; 3 Tablespoons in total, 1/2 per serving

Directions:
In a pan large enough to hold everything, sweat the shallot and chillies in the hot oil for 5 minutes (do not let them brown)
Add the Tomato and Avocado chunks, stir thoroughly and sweat for another 2 minutes.
Add the stock, increase the heat and bring to the boil before reducing the heat and simmering, covered, for 20 minutes.
Blitz the soup, either in the pan with a hand-blitzer, or in a food processor until all large lumps are gone.
Pass the soup through a sieve, and keep to one side until ready to serve.
10 minutes before serving, add the Balsamic and reheat the soup gently but do NOT bring it to a simmer, far less to a boil, just to eating temperature.
To serve, stir in the parsley and add a few drops of Tabasco.
Add a decorative swish of cream and partly stir it in, or otherwise create a nice white contrast.
Finally, garnish with a parsley leaf or two.
