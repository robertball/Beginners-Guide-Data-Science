Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) jars prepared salsa
1 large can enchilada sauce
2 pounds ground beef
1 (15.5 ounce) jar prepared salsa con queso
20 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend (or you can use the four cheese mexican shredded blend)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish, and pour half the salsa and half the enchilada sauce into the bottom of the dish. Set aside.
Cook and stir the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat for about 10 minutes, until meat is browned and crumbly.  Drain the grease from the beef, and add the salsa con queso to the skillet, stirring to mix well.  Place about 2 tablespoons of the beef mixture down the center of each tortilla, roll the tortillas, and place them seam side down on top of the salsa in the baking dish.  Pour the rest of the salsa and enchilada sauce over the tortillas.  Then sprinkle the shredded cheese on top of the enchiladas.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cheese is browned and the enchiladas are hot and bubbling.
