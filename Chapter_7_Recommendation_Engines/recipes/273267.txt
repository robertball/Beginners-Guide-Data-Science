Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds cheese tortellini
1 (16 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 cup chopped fresh parsley, divided
5 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 1/2 tablespoons dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cube chicken bouillon
1/4 cup olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in tortellini and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
Blend tomatoes, 1/4 cup parsley, 4 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, basil, pepper, and bouillon in a food processor until smooth. Set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in tomato-basil blend. Add salt; reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer 5 minutes. Pour in heavy cream; bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and let sauce simmer until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.
Pour sauce blend over cooked tortellini. Top with remaining 3/4 cup parsley and 1 tablespoon Parmesan.
