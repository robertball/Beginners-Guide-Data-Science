Ingredients:
3 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken stock
1  sweet potato, peeled and cubed
3 cups fresh baby spinach leaves
1 cup cooked roast chicken meat
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat chicken stock and sweet potato in a stockpot over high heat. Cook until sweet potato is soft enough to pierce with a fork, about 10 minutes. Stir in spinach, chicken, and garlic; simmer until spinach is wilted and broth is reduced slightly, 10 to 15 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
My mom made this for me every time I was sick; it was the only thing I could keep down. It was mild but I love it even when I'm not under the weather. She would use her own roasted chickens, but when I'm not feeling well I don't feel like roasting my own chicken, and the store-bought ones work in a pinch. Serve with crusty bread.
