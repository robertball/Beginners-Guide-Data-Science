Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups warm water - 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 45 degrees C)
3 tablespoons honey
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 1/2 cups bread flour
1/3 cup whole wheat bread flour
3/4 cup amaranth flour
1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten flour
3 tablespoons grated orange zest
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Stir water, honey, and yeast together in a large bowl. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 10 minutes.
Whisk bread flour, whole wheat bread flour, amaranth flour, and vital wheat gluten flour together in a bowl.
Stir orange zest, vegetable oil, and salt into yeast mixture. Gradually add flour mixture to yeast mixture to form a sturdy dough. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
Place dough in a large, lightly-oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Lightly grease a loaf pan.
Punch down dough, turn onto a lightly floured surface, and knead 5 to 6 times. Form dough into loaf and place into prepared pan. Let rise until doubled in volume, 30 to 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven until the top is golden brown and the bottom of loaf sounds hollow when tapped, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
Made with a mix of white and wheat bread flours, amaranth flour, orange zest, and honey, this bread has a unique slightly sweet flavor and wonderful aroma. Suitable to make by hand or in your bread machine. I adapted this recipe from one I found online, while looking for bread recipes that use amaranth flour. Very good with butter and honey. Amaranth flour is available from Bob's Red MillÂ®. Stores that have a decent selection of natural foods or natural markets should stock it.
