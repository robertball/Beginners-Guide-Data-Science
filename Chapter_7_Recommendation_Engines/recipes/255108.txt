Description: 
Ever heard of baked taro fries? To all the AIP-eaters, nightshade-intolerants, and healthy fries-lovers, this recipe is a total game changer!

 Yams are great to replace normal potatoes, but when you get tired of that sweet taste and want something a bit more starchy, taro is a great, more exotic alternative. Taro is a delicious root vegetable I learned to love while I was living in Macau. One of my favorite things to do when I was there was to go to the Chinese supermarket and try to understand what all those weird fruits and vegetables were (yes, the labels were only in Chinese!).

 Serve as a delicious snack or a salad accompaniment.
