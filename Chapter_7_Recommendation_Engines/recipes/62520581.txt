1.5 oz. Small jar anchovie filets in olive oil
Approx 1 cup Good olive oil
1/3 lbs Prawns  shelled, tail-on, deveined
1/3 lbs Scallops
1/2 lbs Squid  tubes and tentacles, clean and cut tubes into rings, remove beak
1.5 lbs Clams  live

Cheese  I prefer manchego but you can use parmigiano reggiano or something similar

Directions:
In a large sauce pan, cover the bottom with olive oil, should be about 1/4” of oil or so. Cook the chopped garlic, half the italian seasoning, and anchovies on LOW  to med low until anchovies are completely melted, stirring occasionally. Start cooking linguine til al dente in pot of salted water, then drain and leave on side. Once anchovies are completely melted dump can of crushed tomatoes in and bump heat to medium til it starts to bubbles a little, stir. Drop clams in to let them start cooking first, keep it on medium. Once they start to open a little, put the prawns in on their side. As soon as one side is cooked, flip and then drop in the scallops and squid, make sure they get covered by a little sauce. Cook for about another minute or 2. Stir in the rest of the italian seasoning, salt and pepper to taste. Toss with pasta, squeeze lemon, grate cheese with microplane, garnish with basil.
