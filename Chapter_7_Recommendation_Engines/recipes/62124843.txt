Ingredients:
1 med. head cabbage
1 med. carrot, shredded
1/3 c. sugar
1/2 t. salt
1/2 t. pepper
1/2 c. mayo
1/4 c. buttermilk
1 1/2 T. white vinegar
2 1/2 T. lemon juice

Directions:
In a food processor, pulse the cabbage until it resembles rice-sized pieces.  Do the same with the carrot.  You may have to do this in batches to get all the cabbage a uniform size.
In a medium bowl, whisk all other ingredients until smooth.  Pour over the cabbage and carrot.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
This slaw is better the next day so make ahead of time if possible.

Description: 
If you love Kentucky Fried Chicken coleslaw, this is the slaw for you!  As good as KFC's is, this one is even better because it's fresh.  It's a creamy, non-tangy slaw that gets better with age.
