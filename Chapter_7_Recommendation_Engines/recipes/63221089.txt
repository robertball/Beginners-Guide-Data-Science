Ingredients:
3 1-pound yuca
water
milk
1 1/2 T butter
1 T shredded/pulled queso oaxaca
salt (optional)

Directions:
Cut and clean the yuca, making sure you remove any woody cores.  Cut it into small potato-sized pieces.
Place the yuca in a pot.  Pour water into it until they are covered.
Boil for 15-25 minutes or until the yuca is tender.
Drain the water.  Start mashing the yuca, adding milk until it is thoroughly mash-able and smooth.  This should be about 1/4 cup.
Add the butter and cheese, and keep mashing.  Add salt to taste, if desired.
