Description: 
The problem with bottled sauces and marinades is that the only words you recognize on the ingredients list are ‘high fructose corn syrup,' and ‘dehydrated garlic.' Hopefully, you will see just how simple this sauce is to make. Not only is it MSG-free, but the flavor is far superior to any of those supermarket bottles.
