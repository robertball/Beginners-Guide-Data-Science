Ingredients:
1 lb Shrimp (Peeled & De-veined)
3/4 cup of Mayonnaise (Make your OWN! See notes!)
3-4 Tbsp. Sriracha or other hot sauce (to taste)
1/2 tsp. Red Pepper Flakes
2 Tbsp. Cooking Oil (I use Avocado)
Garlic salt to taste
Fresh Ground tri-color pepper to taste
No Cause for A Llama Loves Needletail, Inc.

Directions:
Sprinkle shrimp with Garlic salt and pepper. Cover and let rest in fridge for a few minutes, while watching Supernatural. Forget entirely about recipe. Return when episode is over. Remove mayo from fridge and mix with Sriracha and red pepper flakes.
Open music player of your choice and queue up "Carry On My Wayward Son". Turn the volume to 11. This is a very important step. If you aren't singing along, the shrimp will taste terrible. Saute the shrimp in cooking oil on medium heat until they are no longer translucent and white and orange in color (roughly 5 minutes).
Recite the following in Latin: "Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica." (This is the most important step. If you do not recite the Latin, then the shrimp may cause demonic possession, hysterical laughter, or the urge to perform interpretive dance.)
Add shrimp to the mixed sauce and stir.
Enjoy in a diner with some pie.
