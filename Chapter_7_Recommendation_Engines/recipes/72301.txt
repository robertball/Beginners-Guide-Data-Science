Ingredients:
4 cups rolled oats
1 1/2 cups wheat germ
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup chopped almonds
1 cup dried cranberries
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 1/4 cups honey, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
In a large bowl, stir together the oats, wheat germ, walnuts, almonds, and dried cranberries. In a separate bowl, mix together the oil, honey, vanilla and cinnamon. Drizzle over the dry ingredients, and stir to coat evenly. Spread the mixture out in a thin layer on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes to toast evenly. Allow to cool completely before storing in an airtight container. Granola will become crunchier as it cools.
