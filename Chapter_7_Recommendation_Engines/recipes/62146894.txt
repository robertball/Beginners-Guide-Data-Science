Ingredients:
1 medium cabbage
1 medium red beet
4-5 cloves garlic
1 horseradish root
100 g salt
100 g sugar

Directions:
1) Make the marinade: boil water, salt and sugar, cool to 90 F. Cut the head of cabbage into wedges (6 or 8, whichever way is more manageable for you), remove the pieced of the  core from each wedge; peel and slice the beet, slice the garlic cloves, grate the horseradish root. Layer the veggies in a glass jar, add the marinade, put a weight on top to keep the veggies submerged in the liquid. Keep at room temperature for 2 days to start the fermentation process; move to the refrigerator afterward. The cabbage is ready for consumption after 4-5 days of refrigeration.
