Ingredients:
3 Sprigs of Thyme, pulled off stems
5-6 leaves of Basil, sliced thinly
2 Cloves of Minced Garlic
1 Diced Shallot
1 Heaping Teaspoon of Mayonaise (I use Low Fat)
3 Tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar
1/3 Cup of Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1/3 Teaspoon of Sugar
Salt and Pepper

Directions:
1. Whisk mayonaise and vinegar until well blended
2. Add garlic, shallot, sugar, Thyme, and Basil.
3. Slowly whisk in Olive Oil,
4. Season and let sit for at least a few minutes before serving so the dressing gets infused with the herbs and garlic.
