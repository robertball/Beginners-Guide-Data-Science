Ingredients:
Cake:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup honey
3 large eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup brewed coffee
1 tablespoon jam (any flavor)
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
Chocolate Glaze:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3 1/2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
1/2 cup margarine
1 tablespoon brandy

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease two 8x3-inch loaf pans.
Mix 4 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups sugar, honey, eggs, oil, coffee, jam, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, and baking soda together in a bowl until smooth; spread evenly into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove cake from pans and cool on a wire rack.
Mix 1/2 cup sugar, cocoa powder, water, and 1 teaspoon flour together, stirring constantly, in a saucepan over low heat until mixture is smooth and thick, about 8 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and add margarine and brandy; whisk until glaze is thickened. Refrigerate glaze until cooled, at least 15 minutes.
Spread glaze over cooled cakes.

Description: 
This is my mother's traditional honey cake, made every year for the Jewish new year Rosh Hashanah. We eat honey cake in order to have a sweet new year. I love the glaze for this especially - the cake is a little dry. I could eat the glaze with a spoon! Best served with tea.
