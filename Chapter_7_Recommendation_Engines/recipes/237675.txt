Ingredients:
2 ripe Hass avocados - halved, pitted, and peeled
2 tomatillos, husked and chopped
1 ripe mango - peeled, seeded, and cut into cubes
1/2 small red onion, finely chopped
1 serrano chile pepper, finely chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
kosher salt to taste

Directions:
Mash avocados in a bowl with a fork until slightly chunky. Fold tomatillos, mango, onion, serrano chile pepper, cilantro, and mint through the avocado; add lemon juice and gently mix. Season the guacamole with salt.
Lay a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the guacamole so it doesn't discolor and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.
