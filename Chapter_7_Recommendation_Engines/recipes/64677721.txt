Description: 
My mother used to throw togetther lefovers from thanksgiving that combined to make a kind of wet stuffing with shredded turkey that she served over white toast. She would use leftover turkey bread stuffing but I've been know to use a leftover meat stuffing. I like to make my own turkey broth from the turkey carcass that can be used for more than one recipe.
