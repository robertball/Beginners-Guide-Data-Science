Ingredients:
1 head cabbage
4 medium carrots, diced
1 1/2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms (optional)
5 Mexican green onions, diced
1 bulb garlic, diced (optional)
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or to taste
6 grilled vegetarian burger patties
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce (optional)
2 teaspoons sesame oil (optional)

Directions:
Cut cabbage into thick slices. Cut each slice in half. Combine cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, green onions, and garlic in a large container.
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook burger patties, turning occasionally, until heated through, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and dice.
Heat remaining oil in a large skillet or wok until it shimmers. Add cabbage mixture; cook and stir over medium-high heat until cabbage begins to take on a transparent look, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in burger pieces. Cook until flavors combine, 7 to 8 minutes more. Stir in soy sauce and sesame oil for an Asian kick. Reduce heat and continue cooking, turning occasionally, until carrots are tender, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
My wife and I were doing a Daniel Fast and we were looking for meal options that fit within the Fast parameters. I remember my mother making this dish using ground beef or turkey, but we used veggie burgers. It turned out pretty good if I say so myself. I choose to serve this dish over brown rice to make the meal more filling. You can also use white rice or couscous. The choice is yours. Happy cooking.
