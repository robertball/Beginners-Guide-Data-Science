Ingredients:
2 pounds baby back pork ribs
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup light soy sauce
1/2 cup rice wine
1/2 onion, cut into quarters
1/4 cup orange juice
1 head garlic, chopped
1/4 cup minced fresh ginger root
1 jalapeno pepper, chopped (optional)
1 bunch scallions, trimmed and chopped

Directions:
Wash ribs and pat dry. Salt ribs liberally.
Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add ribs. Cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes.
Place browned ribs in a 3-quart slow cooker.
Place soy sauce, light soy sauce, rice wine, onion, orange juice, garlic, ginger, and jalapeno into a blender. Cover and blend until combined. Pour sauce over the the ribs in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on High until meat pulls away easily from the bone, 3 to 4 hours.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place ribs on a baking sheet or roasting pan.
Bake ribs under the preheated broiler until nicely charred but not burned, about 5 minutes. Garnish with scallions.

Description: 
Slow cooker ribs inspired by my favorite Korean chef in the LA area, Roy Choi, whose cooking will oversaturate your taste buds. Flavor profile of this recipe 12/10. These remind me of your typical pot roast prep that your mom may have made growing up...if your mom happened to be a Korean man who went on to create the first fusion taco truck. Enjoy over a bed of steamed rice and your favorite banchan!
