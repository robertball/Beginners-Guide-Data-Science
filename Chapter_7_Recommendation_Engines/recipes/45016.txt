Description: 
I grew up with this in the UK, and this is how everyone made it. I would be surprised if any pub had additional ingredients. Mint has a sweetness of its own, but a little sugar would be okay, if the diner had a desire for extra sweetness - no more that 1/2 teaspoon. Cider or malt vinegar can be used for the vinegar if you prefer. This sauce is traditionally served with lamb.
