Directions:
Defrost turkey completely. (E.g. Remove from freezer and defrost in the fridge for four days.) Clean and dry the turkey. Spread salt, pepper and brandy all over the turkey, including the inside, and marinate for 24 hours.
Boil the chestnuts for 5 to 10 mins until the skin can be peeled off easily. Boil the beef stock and add the chestnuts. Cook for 20 mins with low heat until the chestnut absorb all the stock. Minced the cooked chestnuts.
Fry chopped onion with butter. Remove heat and add the chopped green apple, apricot, hazelnut, bread crumbs, fresh parsley, orange zest and minced chestnuts. Seasoned with salt and pepper. Drain the stock.
Flip the turkey wings to face the back. Fill the stuffing into the neck and cavity of turkey. Tie and seal the neck and cavity.
Preheat oven to 180 degC / 360 degF. Place the rack on the tray. Put turkey on the rack. Brush the whole turkey with corn oil. Cover the chest, wings and thighs with aluminium foils.  Roast for 3 hours approximately.  Brush the turkey with oil every 30 mins. In the last 30 mins, remove the foil.  (Remark: Roasting time is approximately 12 mins per pound. It is recommended to weigh the tied turkey with stuffing and estimate the cooking time. )
Gravy :  Melt butter and fry garlic, bacon, turkey kidneys, onion, celery, and carrot for 3 to 5 mins. Add mixed herb and stirred fry for 30 seconds and remove from the heat.  Add flour and beef sock. Bring to boil with high heat and then simmer for 10 mins.  Sieve to collect the gravy. Add brandy. Season with salt and pepper.
