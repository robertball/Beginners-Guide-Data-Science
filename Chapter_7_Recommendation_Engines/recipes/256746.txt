Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
1 large clove garlic, minced
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup milk, or more as needed
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons minced fresh basil
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano (optional)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat butter and olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until tender and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add flour and whisk until flour is lightly browned and onion is translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
Mix milk, Parmesan cheese, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper into onion mixture. Cook, whisking continuously, until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
