Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
2 Italian sausage links, casings removed
1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce with meat
1/2 cup pizza sauce
4 ounces sliced pepperoni
1 (16 ounce) package shredded pizza cheese blend
1 (13.8 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef and Italian sausage. Cook and stir until the meat is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink; drain. Stir in the spaghetti sauce, pizza sauce, and pepperoni, and heat until bubbly. Transfer the mixture to an 11x13 inch baking dish.
Sprinkle evenly with the shredded pizza cheese. Top with the pizza dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
