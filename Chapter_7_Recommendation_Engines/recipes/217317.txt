Ingredients:
3 cups water
4 ounces dried red peppers
1/2 cup onion (1/4 inch dice)
3 tablespoons chopped cilantro
3 1/2 ounces Cheddar cheese (shredded)
3 1/2 ounces jack cheese (shredded)
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 cloves garlic
2 cups HERDEZÂ® Casera medium salsa
4 tablespoons grapeseed oil
12 corn tortillas (or flour if desired)
1 1/2 cups shredded crab or imitation crab
1/2 cup Mexican cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Heat water on stove at medium temperature, add red peppers.  Boil until peppers soften (about 7-10 minutes).   While red peppers soften, chop onion, cilantro and mix together.   Mix the two cheeses together in a bowl.
When red peppers soften, transfer them into blender.  Add 2 cups of the same boiled water, salt, and garlic to blender.  Blend for 2-3 minutes. Using a bowl and a strainer, strain this mixture to remove seeds and remaining skin. Add 1 cup of HERDEZ(R) Salsa Casera to mixture.  Mix well.
Add grapeseed oil to skillet and heat. Soften tortillas in grapeseed oil for 10-20 sec. Set on paper towel until all tortillas are done.
Dip tortillas into red sauce and lay on flat surface, add crab and roll.  Place rolled tortillas into a 9 x 13 pan.  Use remaining red sauce to cover rolled tortillas.  Pour 1/2 cup of remaining HERDEZ(R) salsa over mixture.  Sprinkle cheese over the salsa.  Pour remaining 1/2 cups of HERDEZ(R) salsa over cheese.
Bake for 25-30 minutes.  Remove from oven. Sprinkle the onion and cilantro mixture over the cheese.  Drizzle the Mexican cream over mixture.
Mix together mashed avocado, diced onions, diced tomatoes, lime juice and HERDEZ(R) salsa verde.  Serve with guacamole, if desired.
