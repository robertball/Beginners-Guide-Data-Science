Ingredients:
8 baking apples, peeled and sliced
3/4 cup apple cider
1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
15 individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped
Topping:
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup quick oats
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 cup butter, cubed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place apples in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Mix in apple cider and lemon juice.
Mix together sugar, brown sugar, graham cracker crumbs, and 1/2 cup flour in a bowl. Sprinkle sugar mixture over sliced apples and top with evenly spaced caramel squares.
Mix together brown sugar, oats, 1/2 cup flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin pie spice for the topping in a large bowl. Cut in butter cubes with 2 knives or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle topping over apples in the baking dish.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and topping is golden brown, about 50 minutes. Let cool before serving.
