1 peach, peeled and diced
1 cup red or green seedless grapes, rinsed and halved

1/2 teaspoon salt
Dash hot pepper sauce or cayenne pepper

Directions:
Cut avocado in half, remove pit, and peel. Put avocado into medium bowl. Add lime juice, salt and pepper and mash with fork until chunky. (Or spoon into zip top plastic bag, seal and mash with hands until chunky.) Stir in peaches, grapes and herb. Serve with toasted pita triangles or sweet potato chips.

Description: 
Take advantage of the winter bounty of fruits from Chile (it's summer down there) and combine Chilean Hass Avocados with peaches and grapes. Use firm-ripe avocados so you'll have individual avocado chunks for salsa, or select soft-ripe avocados and mash them a bit to create a fruited guacamole. Serve either version with fresh vegetable dippers, toasted pita chips, vegetable chips or over grilled fish, chicken or burgers. The salsa/guacamole also makes a nice centerpiece for a fruit plate.
