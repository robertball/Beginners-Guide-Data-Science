Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup chia seeds
1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 cup water
1 pinch seasoned salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix flour, chia seeds, 1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt, and sea salt in a bowl; stir in water until dough is completely combined. Form dough into thin bite-size rounds and arrange on a baking sheet. Sprinkle rounds with seasoned salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, about 15 minutes. Cool completely and store in an airtight container or resealable bag.

Description: 
While waiting for a batch of crackers to finish baking, I was playing with the remaining dough and forming bite-size rounds and though they would make great chips (and they do -- they're amazing!). These chips should keep for about a week if stored properly.
