3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 cups sliced fresh strawberries
3 cups diced rhubarb

1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup butter
1 cup rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix white sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, strawberries, and rhubarb. Place the mixture in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Mix 1 1/2 cups flour, brown sugar, butter, and oats until crumbly. You may want to use a pastry blender for this. Crumble on top of the rhubarb and strawberry mixture.
Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until crisp and lightly browned.
