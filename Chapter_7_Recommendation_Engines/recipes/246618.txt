Ingredients:
Salad:
2 cups water
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1 cup multi-colored quinoa
2 cups roughly chopped spinach
Dressing:
3 tablespoons almond oil
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons champagne vinegar
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
Salad Ingredients:
3 on-the-vine tomatoes (such as CampariÂ®), diced
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese, divided
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring water and bouillon to a boil in a saucepan. Add quinoa, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Transfer quinoa to a bowl and cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir spinach into quinoa and refrigerate until completely cooled, at least 30 minutes.
Whisk almond oil, olive oil, vinegar, thyme, basil, garlic, and salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth.
Stir tomatoes, 1/2 of the feta cheese, and dressing into cooled quinoa until evenly coated; top with remaining feta cheese and ground black pepper.
