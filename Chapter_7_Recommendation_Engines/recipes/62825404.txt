Ingredients:
1 stick butter melted
1 day old loaf French bread
4 eggs
8 oz heavy whipping cream
1 can condensed milk
1 can coconut milk
1 cup brown sugar
4 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon allspice
pinch salt
4 over ripe bananas
1 cup walnuts, chopped (divided)

Directions:
Smash the 4 bananas using a potato masher and set aside.
Coat a 9 x 13 baking pan using a tablespoon of the stick of butter.
Melt the remaining stick of butter in a sauce pan.
While butter is melting cut loaf of bread into 1 inch chunks. Transfer bread into baking pan, and pour melted butter over the bread.
Toast walnuts in a saute pan until fragrant and set aside.
In a mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs until just broken.
Mix together all of the ingredients through the mashed bananas.
Add 3/4 cup of the toasted walnuts to the custard mixture.
Pour the custard mixture over the bread. Make sure that every piece of bread is coated and submerged in the custard.
Top the bread with the remaining 1/4 cup of walnuts.
Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 8 to 12 hours to allow the bread to fully absorb the custard.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Bake at 350 degrees covered with foil for 15 minutes. Remove foil and cook for an additional 45 minutes or until top is brown and edges pull away from the pan.  Allow to cool about 10 minutes. Custard will completely set during cooling.
