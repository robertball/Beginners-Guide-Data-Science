Ingredients:
4 oz. whole milk (2% optional)
1 quart heavy cream
1/2 lb. unsalted butter
1 tablespoon flour
1/2 lb. freshly* grated parmesan cheese (important)
2 oz. fontina cheese
1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
On medium heat, add butter, garlic, and flour until butter is melted. Do not brown garlic.
Add the heavy cream and milk until hot.
SLOWLY sprinkle the freshly grated cheeses into the hot cream mixture. Finally add the salt and pepper. Stir often.
Simmer for 20-30 minutes or until sauce reaches desired thickness. Turn heat off or on low before serving.
**Do NOT let the sauce boil at any point or it will separate and become grainy!

Description: 
This is a rich, creamy, Italian style alfredo sauce perfect for chicken and seafood pastas! I discovered this recipe after relentless searching for an authentic alfredo sauce that doesn't use cream cheese.
