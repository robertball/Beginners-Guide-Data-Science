Ingredients:
2 lbs ground beef
2 eggs
4 slices bread (watered)
1 tsp salt (needs more than this, grandpa had a heart condition)
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1 small onion
1/4 tsp black pepper (I would add more)
2 tsp chili powder
1 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp Tabasco sauce or red pepper
1/2 pod garlic
1/4 tsp sage
1/4 tsp comino (cumin)
1/4 tsp oregano
1/4 tsp Accent (I'd skip this one)
1 tsp marjoram

Directions:
Remove the crusts from the bread slices (unless very soft) and soak in water but don't get them too soggy.
Finely chop onions and garlic.
Break eggs into a large-enough mixing bowl. Add all other ingredients and mix until bread is broken apart and mix is smooth.
Add meat and mix with hands until fully blended.
Shape into large, thick patties. Cook or freeze as desired.

Description: 
This was my favorite food growing up. My grandfather developed this recipe after much scientific experimentation (he was a chemist). I remember looking at some of his notes, where he had made multiple batches and adjusted the ingredients in each until he got it how he liked it. He would eat these for breakfast with a side of eggs.
