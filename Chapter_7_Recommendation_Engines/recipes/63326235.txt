Amazing Ground Beef Tacos Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2lbs lean ground beef
1/2 onion, diced
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1/2-1 C. chopped roasted red peppers
1 15oz can diced tomatoes(I prefer canned here for the juices)
4-6 cloves garlic minced
3 Tbsp grnd Cumin
3 Tbsp New Mexico Chili powder
2 Tbsp (or so) Cholula, or your favorite hot sauce
Salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
-Cook the beef on Med-high, sprinkling the spices evenly over while the meat is still raw.
-When meat is browned, but not fully cooked, add in onions,  peppers, and garlic. Cook a couple minutes, till onions are translucent, stirring often to break up the meat into small crumbles.  Lower heat to about Med here.
-Add in tomatoes and hot sauce, simmer on medium, stirring frequently.  Taste to make sure you have the spices and hot sauce where you want them.
-Simmer at low heat while you prepare any fresh veggies for toppings and maybe some refried beans for a side.  Make sure to stir before serving to get the juices nice and evenly distributed.

Description: 
My family's favorite night is always taco night. I make variations everytime, but this is an average of what I do, and I don't think the leftovers have ever gone to waste! I suggest using a good quality lean beef so you don't have to drain off the fat/spices.
