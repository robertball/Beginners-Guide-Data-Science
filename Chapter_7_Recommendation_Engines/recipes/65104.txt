Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups milk

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, salt and pepper until smooth. Cook and stir over medium heat until browned, about 10 minutes. Gradually stir in milk so that no lumps form, and continue cooking and stirring until thickened. If the gravy becomes too thick, you may thin it with a little more milk.
