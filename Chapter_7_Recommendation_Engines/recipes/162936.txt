Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) bottle ketchup
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 pounds ground beef
2 teaspoons minced onion
12 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Whisk together the ketchup, water, white sugar, brown sugar, vinegar, mustard, salt, pepper, and paprika in a large saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir the ground beef and onion in the hot skillet until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink; drain and discard any excess grease. Stir the beef into the simmering barbeque sauce. Simmer together for 10 minutes. Spoon into the buns to serve.

Description: 
BBQ is different in every home you go to.  I have never found another recipe that compares to my grandmother's.  It is a sweet-tasting recipe and goes great with a salad or french fries!
