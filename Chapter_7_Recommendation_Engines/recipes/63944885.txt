Ingredients:
coconut milk, AROY-D (box not can) (see notes 1, 2)
banana chunks, organic, ripe, frozen (see note 3)
fruit, organic, fresh or frozen (optional) (see note 4)
honey (optional) (see note 5)
natural flavors (optional) (see notes 6, 7)
water, filtered

Directions:
Chose an appropriate-sized glass from your cupboard for your coconut-milk smoothie. Use the glass for measuring: fill it with smoothie ingredients in proportions according to your own taste. Use your intuition to know which fruits and natural flavors go together well.
Transfer the ingredients to a blender with ice-crushing capacity (for crushing frozen banana chunks) and process until smooth.
Pour the smoothie back into the serving glass. Sprinkle with a sweet spice or garnish with fruit if desired and serve.

Description: 
I invented this coconut-milk smoothie for my breakfast because I have to live with severe food intolerances (dairy and grains). I am also a big fan of the potent immune-system-boosting properties of coconut oil.
