Ingredients:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup paprika
1 tablespoon black pepper
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon cayenne

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients together. Rub on ribs and let sit for about 20 minutes. Overnight would work also for deeper flavor but not needed.
Removing the silver skin membrane on back of ribs will also allow for more flavor to penetrate.

Description: 
A modification on the traditional KC Rib Rub. 

It is sweet and slightly spicy. I am not someone who likes very spicy dishes but this has enough to give it a good flavor This only takes a few minutes to mix and a few to prepare on the ribs. No need for overnight preparation but it will not hurt it either.
