Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
4 pork rib chops, approximately 1/2-inch thick
1 large yellow or sweet onion, cut into large wedges
1 teaspoon McCormick速 Gourmet Collection速 Chipotle Chile Pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, minced

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Lightly brown pork chops on each side. Transfer chops to a roasting pan or casserole dish just large enough to hold chops in a single layer.
Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same skillet. Add onions, chipotle chile pepper and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Saute until onions are lightly cooked. Distribute onions evenly over the pork chops. Set skillet aside for the sauce. Bake pork chops in a preheated 350 degrees F oven 20 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F.
Add cream to the skillet; slowly bring to a boil while scraping the pan to release the caramelized pan juices. Add remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and cilantro. When cream comes to a boil, immediately reduce the heat to as low as possible and keep warm.
Remove pork chops from the oven. Pour warm cream sauce over pork.
