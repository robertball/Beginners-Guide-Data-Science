Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
3 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
2 potatoes
3 eggs
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes in a saucepan covered by lightly salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium, and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.  Drain and allow to cool, then cut into 1/4-inch slices.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the bacon strips in the butter until browned, 5 to 7 minutes; remove bacon and set aside.  Add the potatoes to the bacon fat and cook over medium-high heat until browned, about 5 minutes.
Beat the eggs with the salt and pepper.  Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, and mix with the potatoes and bacon; allow to cook until eggs are set, 3 to 5 minutes, turning once.

In Germany, this simple dish is served at breakfast , lunch or dinner. It's also called  'Farmer's Omelet.' Serve with a dill pickle or a nice salad as a side. My kids prefer ketchup with the meal.
