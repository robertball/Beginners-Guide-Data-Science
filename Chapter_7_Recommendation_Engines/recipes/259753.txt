Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups rice flour
2 cups dark brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking soda
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2/3 cup olive oil
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, with liquid
1 3/4 cups water
2 tablespoons white vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking pan with cooking spray and dust with rice flour.
Combine rice flour, brown sugar, salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder in a food processor; pulse until well mixed. Mix in olive oil. Pour in garbanzo beans with liquid; puree until smooth. Blend in water gradually. Mix in vinegar; batter will be thin. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges pull away from the pan, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool for 1 hour before serving, otherwise it will be crumbly.

Description: 
Gluten-free and vegan chocolate cake. Ideally, let it sit a few hours before covering; cover well as it dries out more quickly than other traditional cakes. I don't know why, but it seems better a day or two after it's made, perhaps because it takes that long to set up.
