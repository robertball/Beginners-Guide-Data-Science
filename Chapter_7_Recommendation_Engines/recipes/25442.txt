Ingredients:
1 cup hickory flavored barbeque sauce

Description: 
Most folks think preparing barbeque means drenching some meat with some sauce out of a bottle while it's cooking, and squirting some more over it just before you serve it.  I'm not one of those!  This sauce is the result of quite a lot of experimentation over the years, and everyone who tries it seems to agree that it's great!  The combination of the mustard and molasses give it a great sweet-tart flavor, and the bourbon adds a finishing touch you can't get any other way!
