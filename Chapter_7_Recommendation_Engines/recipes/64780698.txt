Ingredients:
1 medium yellow onion, sliced
2 T canola oil
2.5 cups chicken stock
32 oz canned tomatoes, drained
4 cloves garlic, peeked & sliced
2 ancho chilis, stemmed & seeded
1 California chili, stemmed & seeded
1 puya chili, stemmed & seeded
1 arbol chili, stemmed & seeded
2 T smoked paprika
1 T cumin
1 t salt

Directions:
1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over med-hi heat. Sautee onions until well carmelized. Add a splash of chicken stock each time onions begin to lose moisture and stir brown  off of bottom of pan.
2. Add remaining ingredients and bring to a low boil. Turn heat down and simmer uncovered until sauce has a nice thick consistency and deep color, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours. This can also be done in the oven on 200.
3. Pour sauce into a blender, or use an immersion blender, and blend until completely smooth.
Tips:
-Omit the arbol chili for less heat.
-Onions carmelize best when not cooked in non-stick. Take the time to cook down to a rich brown.
-Carmelize other veggies with the onions such as carrots, celery or bell peppers, if on hand.
-Use tomatoes without added calcium chloride or sugar.
-Use a quality chicken stock for deeper flavor.
- Taste, taste, taste!! Is it bland? Add salt! Is it too spicy? Add a little more broth. Does it just taste like tomatoes? Add more cumin and paprika.
-Do not overfill a blender with the hot sauce. Blend in batches.
