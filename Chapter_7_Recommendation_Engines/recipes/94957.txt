Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, halved and sliced thin
12 garlic cloves, chopped
1 medium zucchini, cut into medium dice
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 tablespoon dried oregano leaves
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper
2/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
8 ounces feta cheese
1 cup pitted coarsely chopped black olives such as kalamatas
1 (13.8 ounce) package pizza crust dough
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees.
Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic and zucchini; saute until almost tender, about 3-5 minutes. Transfer to a lipped cookie sheet; Add ground beef to skillet; saute until beef loses it pink color, about 5 minutes. Add oregano, cumin, salt, pepper and parsley. Combine with vegetable mixture on sheet pan then toss with feta and olives; cool to room temperature.
Roll pizza dough out onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet; stretch to about a 16x11-inch rectangle. Spread 1/2 of the meat mixture over the dough leaving a 1 1/2 inch border all around. Reserve remaining meat mixture for a second meal.
With long edge facing you, roll dough into a log, making sure both ends are sealed. Brush with olive oil and bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool about 5 minutes then slice and serve.
