Ingredients:
1 can whole kernel corn (I use fresh corn from the garden)
1 can of cream style corn
1 egg
1 stick of oleo, melted
8 oz. carton sour cream
1 box of jiffy corn bread mix

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together.  Put in a 9X13 pan.  Bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes.  For a crispier crust, bake for 1 hour.
I have substitued non fat sour cream and light margarine for this recipe and it has turned out just fine!
