Description: 
I adapted this from a processed foods laden dessert recipe on another recipe site to a delicious all natural recipe. Using all natural ingredients, this recipe turned out equally as well as the original recipe. 

My DH was a skeptic and really thought I was going to ruin the original recipe by using organic cane sugar for the topping rather than moist brown sugar. However, he was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and couldn't wait for me to make it again without the processed brown sugar!
