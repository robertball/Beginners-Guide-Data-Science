1 teaspoon agave nectar
2 tablespoons coconut flour
1/4 cup coconut milk
3 tablespoons cocoa
1 teaspoon good quality vanilla
1/8 teaspoon sea salt
Chocolate sauce:
1 tablespoon arrow root
1 can coconut milk
1/2 cups cocoa powder, unsweetened
1/2 cup agave
1/2 teaspoon coffee granules, instant
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large bowl combine the ingredients for the crepes and whisk well.
Heat a non-stick 8? saut√© pan over medium heat.

Cook until the edges are dry and brown. Flip carefully and brown on the other side (about 3 minutes each side).
Put on a platter and continue with other crepes. You may also want to keep your oven on low to keep warm as you continue.
Chocolate sauce:
In a medium saucepan, whisk the arrow root flour into the coconut milk.
Place the pan over low heat and stir in the cocoa powder, agave, coffee, vanilla, and salt.
Cook, whisking constantly, until thoroughly combined and the liquid.
