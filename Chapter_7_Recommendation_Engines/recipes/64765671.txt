Ingredients:
4 cups sugar
2 cups water
1 1/2 cup instant coffee
2 1/2 cups vodka
1 vanilla bean

Directions:
In a large pot heat on low heat, mix water, sugar and coffee until blended into a thick syrup.  Pour into a glass gallon jar with tight fitting lid and allow to cool to room temperature.  Add vodka and vanilla bean split down longways to open to its pastry middle.  Store in a cool dark place for 60 days giving it a good shake up every week to allow the vanilla to incorporate itself to the liquor.  When time is up, pour into containers for gift giving or glasses for consumption.
