Ingredients:
1 serving nonstick cooking spray
1 (16 ounce) package frozen cauliflower tots (such as Green GiantÂ® Cauliflower Veggie Tots)

Directions:
Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray the air fryer basket with nonstick cooking spray.
Place as many cauliflower tots in the basket as you can, making sure they do not touch, cooking in batches if necessary.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 6 minutes. Pull the basket out, turn tots over, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 3 minutes more.
