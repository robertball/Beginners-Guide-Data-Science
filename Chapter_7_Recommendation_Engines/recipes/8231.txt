Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/2 cup lukewarm water
1 cup milk, scalded and slightly cooled
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup lukewarm water.
In a large bowl, slowly pour hot milk into the eggs, whisking constantly. Stir in 1/2 cup sugar and salt. Mix in 1/2 cup melted butter. When mixture is room temperature, pour in the dissolved yeast. Add the flour and mix well.
Turn dough out on floured board. Knead until smooth, about 10 to 15 minutes. Place in greased bowl, and cover. Let rise in warm place until double in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Punch dough down. Turn over, and let rise again for 45 minutes.
In a small bowl, combine 1 cup sugar and 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon. Form dough into walnut-sized balls. Dip each ball in melted butter and roll it in cinnamon sugar. Pile loosely into a 10-inch Bundt pan. Cover and let rise again until double in volume, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking until golden brown, about 30 minutes more.
