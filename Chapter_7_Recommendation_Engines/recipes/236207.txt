2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup sliced onion
1/4 cup chopped cooked ham
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper

1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
4 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1/4 cup salsa

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat; saute onion, ham, and green bell pepper until onion and bell pepper are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour eggs into ham-vegetable mixture; cook and stir until eggs are scrambled and cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Sprinkle Monterey Jack cheese over egg mixture; cook and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve egg mixture in tortillas; top with salsa.

Description: 
This is a great way to start the morning; quick and healthy alternative to an actual omelet when you don't have the time to make one. Colby Jack cheese or Cheddar cheese can be substituted for the Monterey Jack.
