Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 clove garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 carrots, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), chopped
1 cup cooked rice
1 tablespoon butter
1 egg

Directions:
Combine ground beef, soy sauce, garlic, black pepper, and salt in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove beef to a plate. Drain and discard grease from the skillet.
Heat vegetable oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add carrots, bell pepper, and onion; cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add cooked rice and beef to the skillet, toss to combine, and heat until warmed through.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Crack egg into pan. Cover with a tight fitting lid and cook 3 minutes, or until white is set. Place egg on top of beef fried rice.

Description: 
This fried rice with ground beef is great with red wine, candlelight, and jazz music. Ok, this is the recipe my father's second wife said captured my father ... who knows? But it is very delicious! You can vary this additional veggies, mushrooms, etc., but start here first.
