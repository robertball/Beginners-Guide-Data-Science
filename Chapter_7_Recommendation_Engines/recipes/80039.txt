Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) package fully-cooked boneless beef pot roast with gravy
1 (16 ounce) jar prepared taco sauce
1 (15 ounce) can red kidney beans, drained
1 1/2 cups frozen mixed red, yellow and green bell pepper strips, defrosted
6 packaged tortilla bowls

Fresh cilantro sprigs (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Remove beef pot roast from package; set aside.  Measure 3/4 cup of the gravy and place in Dutch oven; discard any remaining gravy or reserve for other use.  Stir in taco sauce; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-high; cook, uncovered, 5 minutes or until liquid is thickened.
Meanwhile cut pot roast into 1/2-inch pieces.  Add beef, beans and bell peppers to Dutch oven.  Cook over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes or until heated through, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile place tortilla bowls on baking sheet.  Bake in 350 degrees F oven 3 minutes or until heated through.  Add chopped cilantro to beef mixture; spoon into tortilla bowls.  Garnish with cilantro sprigs, if desired.  Serve immediately.
