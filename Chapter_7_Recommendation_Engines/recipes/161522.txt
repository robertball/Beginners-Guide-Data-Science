Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil; add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 5 minutes; drain.

Description: 
My mother used to make this for me when I was a kid and I couldn't get enough. It's just buttered egg noodles with parsley, parmesan cheese, and hot dogs. To this day I still eat it and I guarantee that your kids will love it too.
