Description: 
a good meal for a hot summer night. i serve this with watermelon slices and a bit of bread or crackers. can be made to suit your individual needs as its a forgiving recipe. its also good with tuna. for a party try adding colored bell pepper for a festive touch. best made the morning before and allowed to chill. bottled ranch works for this but making it with the envelope gives you a creamier thicker sauce.
