Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 cups ketchup
1/3 cup distilled white vinegar
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 pounds chipped chopped ham
8 kaiser rolls, split
1 cup pickle relish (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir the onions in the butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir the ketchup, vinegar, water, brown sugar, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce into the skillet with the onions; simmer about 10 minutes. Stir in the ham; cook until heated through and the sauce is bubbling, 5 to 7 minutes more.
While the ham simmers, heat the kaiser rolls in the preheated oven until toasted, 5 to 7 minutes.
Assemble the sandwiches by dividing the ham mixture among the toasted kaiser rolls, topping the ham with pickle relish. Serve hot.

Description: 
I grew up on these delicious, sweet, and tangy barbecue sandwiches made from chipped deli ham. This dish is a  staple in Western Pennsylvania, although each family seems to have its own way of making them! It's a terrific last-minute meal. Chipped chopped ham is a pressed ham loaf sold at deli counters in the Pittsburgh area which is always chipped. If you can get Islay's Chipped Ham, that is the original and still the best for these sandwiches. Otherwise, just get any deli ham and have it chipped or shaved paper thin. Enjoy!
