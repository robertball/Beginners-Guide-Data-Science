Ingredients:
1 cup Amish Friendship Bread Starter
1 egg
1/2 cup oil
1/2 cup natural applesauce
1/4 cup milk
6 tablespoons water
1 cup brown sugar
3 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups flour
2 tablespoons flax meal
1 1/2 cups dried apples
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325° F (165° C).
In a large mixing bowl, add ingredients as listed except the last 3 (apples, sugar, cinnamon).
In a small bowl, mix together the last 3 (apples, sugar, cinnamon).
Fold in half the apple mixture in to the batter and give it a gentle stir.
Grease the pans.
Dust the greased pans with some of the cinnamon-sugar from the apple mixture.
Pour the batter evenly into the cake pans.
Arrange rest of the apples on top of the cake batter and sprinkle with the remaining sugar-cinnamon mixture.
Bake for 45 minutes or until the bread loosens evenly from the sides and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.
ENJOY!
