Ingredients:
Cranberry sauce - canned or fresh, whichever you prepared at your holiday dinner (1 part)
Candied Yams/Sweet Potato Casserole (1 part)
Plain Yogurt (2 parts)

Directions:
Simply mix plain yogurt (I had maybe a 1/2 to 3/4-cup) w/ a few TBSPs each of the leftover cranberries and yams/sweet potatoes. (I had sweet potatoes & they were smashed smooth.)

Again, 1-part cranberry & 1-part yam/sweet potato to 2-parts plain yogurt seemed like a good balance. It could even be served as a dip w/ pretzels!
