Ingredients:
Egg Beater (egg substitute) – equivalent to 8 eggs (1/4 = 1 egg)
Mexican cheese (shredded) – to taste
Cilantro – a bunch; chopped
McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning – a pinch
Red onion – ¼ chopped
Olive oil
Frozen spinach (optional) - chopped
Pam Nonstick Cooking Spray

Directions:
Cook onions in a preheated pan with olive oil until translucent.  Preheat oven to 325°.  Cook spinach in microwave for 5 minutes.  Stir, then 2 additional minutes.  You won’t use the entire package…maybe only ¼.
Mix eggs, cheese, cilantro, seasoning and cooked onion in a bowl.  Spray 36 mini muffin tins with cooking spray.  Spray well.  They will stick a bit anyway, but the better you spray the better the cleanup.
Carefully ladle the egg mixture into the cups.  Fill about ¾ full as they will puff up and then sink back down.  Bake for 10 minutes at a time in a preheated oven (the higher in the oven the quicker they cook) checking on doneness.  They will brown when they are finished.
Eat and enjoy!
