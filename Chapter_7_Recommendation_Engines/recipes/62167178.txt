Description: 
My husband is from the midwest and had never really experienced Tex Mex food before he met me. We grill steak at least every other week so I started making these nachos with the left over steak and he loves them! I had always made them without the meat before as an appetizer, but they are a meal in themselves with the addition of the steak! (You can also use grilled chicken breast.)
