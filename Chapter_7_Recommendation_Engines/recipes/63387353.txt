Ingredients:
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
1/2 cup sour cream
1 recipe shortbread cookie crust
1 8-ounce can pumpkin puree
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar and vanilla. Beat until smooth. Blend in eggs one at a time.  Fold in sour cream. Remove 1 cup of batter and spread into bottom of cooked, cooled crust; set aside.
Add pumpkin, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg to the remaining batter and stir gently until well blended. Carefully spread over the batter in the crust.
Bake in preheated oven for 55 minutes to 1 hour 10 minutes, or until center is almost set.  Turn oven off and prop open oven door (2 or 3 inches) until oven is cool. I usually let it sit in the oven overnight. Refrigerate for 3 hours. Cover with whipped topping before serving.
