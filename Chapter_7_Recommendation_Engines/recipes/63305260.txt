Ingredients:
1 bone-in fully cooked ham, 5 to 7 lbs.
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1 tsp yellow mustard
3/4 cup orange juice
1/8 tsp ground cloves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Trim excess fat from ham.  Score the top using diagonal cuts about 1 inch into the meat.  Place in a roasting pan and set in the oven.  Stir together the brown sugar, mustard, and orange juice.  Brush all over top of ham.  Roast according to time indicated below, until the ham reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees, basting with pan juices and additional glaze every 20 minutes.  Remove from oven; let rest for at least 20 minutes before slicing.

This is a really good ham recipe.  You can use a whole or half smoked ham, picnic, or whatever smoked port cut you desire, as long as it's labeled fully cooked.
