Ingredients:
3 quarts water
3/4 cup tomato paste (or 1 cup tomato sauce)
1 1/2 lbs lean ground beef
1 cup carrots, peeled and sliced
1 1/2 cups potatoes, peeled and cut in 1-inch chunks
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
several dashes tobasco sauce
1 cup frozen corn

Directions:
Bring water and tomato paste to boil in 7 or 8 quart pot.  Add ground beef roughly shaping into medium sized balls as you go (about 1 inch).
Add remaining vegetables (except corn) along with salt, pepper, and tobasco.  Bring back to boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 1 1/2 hours.  Add corn in the last 15 minutes of cooking.
*Add extra tobasco individually if you want your soup a little hotter.  Also, much better the second day.
