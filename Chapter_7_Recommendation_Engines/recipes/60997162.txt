Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds salmon fillet
1 1/4 cup teriyaki marinade (such as Yoshidas original flavor)
1 small piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced

Directions:
Place fish in a large resealable plastic bag with the teriyaki sauce and sliced ginger, seal, and turn to coat. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Remove fish from bag and place onto a broiler pan.  Pre heat oven to broil on high.  Pour the remaining marinade into a small sauce pan and heat on medium low until reduced by half.  Remove ginger pieces.
Place fish in oven on the second spot down from the top.  Broil for approximately 10-12 minutes depending on the thickness of the salmon fillet. Do not flip the fish. Remove fish from oven and pour the reduced glaze over the top of the salmon.  Let fish rest for 5 minutes before serving.
