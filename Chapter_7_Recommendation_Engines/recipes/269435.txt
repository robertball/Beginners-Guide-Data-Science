Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 ounces leeks, chopped
1 bunch raw radish greens
8 large eggs
4 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
4 radishes, shredded

Directions:
Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir leeks until softened and separated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add radish tops and cook until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Whisk eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and heavy cream together in a bowl. Pour egg mixture into the skillet with the leek mixture and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and allow to cook until edges are firm and have begun to pull away from the sides of the skillet, 5 to 10 minutes.
Place skillet under the broiler and cook until cheese is browned on top, 3 to 5 minutes.
Remove skillet from the broiler. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving. Top with shredded radishes. Serve warm or cold.
