Ingredients:
1 10 oz. package vanilla wafers
1/2 C granulated sugar
6-8 Tbsp butter, melted
3-4 medium bananas
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2/3 cup milk
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
3 Tbsp cornstarch
1/4 cup white sugar
1 Tbsp lemon juice
1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple in its own juice
1/2 king size milk chocolate bar
1-2 Tbsp milk
whipped topping
24 maraschino cherries
chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a food processor, pulverize vanilla wafers and sugar.  Add melted butter; process until combined.  Mixture should be crumbly but hold its shape when pressed together.  Press into the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan and bake in preheated oven for about 10 minutes.
Lower oven temp to 350.
While the crust is baking, prepare the cream cheese layer. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time. Blend in 2/3 cup milk and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. Set aside.
Slice bananas about 1/8" thick and distribute evenly over crust.  Pour cream cheese mixture over bananas and bake for about 25 minutes more in 350 degree oven.  Allow to cool completely.
Make the topping: In a saucepan, combine 3 Tbsp cornstarch, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 Tbsp lemon juice, and 15 oz can crushed pineapple. Bring to a boil over medium-low heat and stir until thickened. Will be very thick.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Spread topping over cream cheese layer.
Refrigerate at least 1 hour, or until thoroughly chilled.
Melt 1/2 chocolate bar with 1-2 Tbsp milk in microwave or bowl over boiling water.  Drizzle in thin lines over pineapple (a parchment pastry bag works even better for this).
Cut into 24 squares.  On each square, decorate with a dollop (or pipe a rosette) of whipped topping, sprinkle with chopped pecans (optional), and add a cherry on top.
