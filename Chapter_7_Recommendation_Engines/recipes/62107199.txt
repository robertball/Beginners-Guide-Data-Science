Ingredients:
1 cup long-grain rice
4 cups milk
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 teaspoon ground cinammon

Directions:
Place rice in a bowl with enough boiling water to cover.
Cover and let the rice sit 5 hours.
Remove excess water.
In a food processor/blender, blend rice until finely chopped (will look lumpy).
Place rice into boiling water, boil for 5-10 minutes.
Drain rice.
Place 1/2 cup of rice and 2 cups of milk in a blender.
Blend on high for 15 seconds.
Mix in 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 tsp. cinammon.
Do the same with the other half of the ingredients.
Mix both of your mixtures together, and strain through cheesecloth, coffee filter, or a strainer.
Serve with ice, and enjoy!
