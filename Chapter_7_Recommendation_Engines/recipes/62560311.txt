Ingredients:
1 Devils Food cake mix
Eggs, Oil and Water called for on cake mix box
5 Oz Spiced Rum
4 Tbsp Light Corn Syrup
>1/4 Cup Confectioners Sugar

Directions:
Bake Devils Food cake according to package instructions. Cool slightly in pan, then turn out on bakers rack to cool completely.
Once completely cooled, using a food processor or blender, process into crumbs.
Pour crumbs into a large bowl. Slowly pour rum over mix, one ounce at a time, stirring between. Cake will begin clumping together. Slowly add corn syrup, continuing to stir. Cake will become sticky but remain a little crumbly.
Using a melon baller or cookie scoop, form into balls and place on parchment or waxed paper. Roll in powdered sugar.
Serve to anyone aged 21+.
