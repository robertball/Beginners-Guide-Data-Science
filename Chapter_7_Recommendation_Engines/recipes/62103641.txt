Ingredients:
4 flour tortillas
1 cup shredded cheese, any type of cheese can do but I like to use cheddar cheese
1 tbs of butter
sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Butter one side of the tortillas and place one on a frying pan place shredded cheese on top and place an other tortillas buttered side on top. When the tortilla is golden brown flip it over and cook the other side until golden brown. Repeat the operation for the two other tortillas. Cut quesadillas into 6 triangles.
Serve the quesadillas with sour cream to spread on top if you like.
