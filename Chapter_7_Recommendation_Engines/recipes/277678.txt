Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon ground marjoram
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1 pinch ground cloves
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Combine pork, maple syrup, salt, sage, onion powder, black pepper, red pepper flakes, marjoram, coriander, and cloves in a bowl; mix well. Form into 10 small patties.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add patties, and fry until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (73 degrees C).
