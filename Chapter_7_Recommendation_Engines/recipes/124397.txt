Description: 
MY SISTER introduced me to this recipe several years ago because she knows I love blue cheese.    This dish is a simple way to dress up asparagus, giving it a tangy taste altogether different from the usual cheese sauce. I make it every spring when we have fresh homegrown asparagus.                         --Leona Luecking                                                           West Burlington, Iowa
