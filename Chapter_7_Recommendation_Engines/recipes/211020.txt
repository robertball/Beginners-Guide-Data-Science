1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza dough
1/4 pound sliced provolone cheese
1 (26 ounce) jar RAGÚ® Old World Style® Traditional Sauce
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Roll pizza dough into 15 x 11-inch rectangle. Layer provolone cheese over dough, leaving 1-inch border around edges. Evenly spread 1 cup Pasta Sauce over cheese, then evenly sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.
Roll, starting at longest end, jelly-roll style. Fold in ends and pinch to seal. Arrange stromboli seam-side down on baking pan.
Bake 20 minutes or until bread is golden. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with remaining Pasta Sauce, heated.
