Ingredients:
1 8oz package room temperature cream cheese (or light cream cheese)
1 8oz container ricotta cheese (light may be subsituted)
1 (12oz) can evaporated milk (low fat may be substituted)
1 (14oz) can condensed milk
2 tablespoons vanilla
5 eggs
2 sticks cinammon
1 - 1 1/2 cups sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a blender, blend cream cheese, ricotta, evap. milk, condensed milk and vanilla on low or blend.  When the mixture becomes creamy (about 30 seconds or so), add eggs, blend and set aside.
In a small non-stick surface pot, melt sugar on low.  Sugar will become a bit lumpy, the lumps will eventually melt, but you need to keep stiring the sugar.  Once the sugar is a light brown color (or is completely melted) pour it into a 2qt. round baker or something of a similar size (9X9/8X8 pan).  Immediately pour milky mixture into the baker and add the cinammon sticks.  Bake in a water bath in the oven for 60 minutes.  When the flan is done baking, turn off the oven and leave the flan in the oven for about an hour to cool.  Remove from oven and place in refrigerator for 5 hours.  To serve, turn over onto a serving platter.  Be sure to use a plastic spatula to separate the flan from the baker.
