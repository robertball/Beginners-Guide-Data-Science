Ingredients:
2 tablespoons red wine
2 cloves garlic, chopped
5 whole allspice berries
4 juniper berries
3 whole cloves
1 1/2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
1/2 teaspoon whole white peppercorns
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 1/2 tablespoons salt
1/2 teaspoon Prague Powder #2
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
2 pounds pork belly

Directions:
Combine wine and garlic. Set aside.
Combine allspice berries, juniper berries, cloves, black peppercorns, fennel seeds, white peppercorns, and red pepper flakes in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Grind to a fine powder. Add salt, Prague powder, and nutmeg and stir well to combine.
Place pork belly in a glass or ceramic dish. Cover on all sides with the spice mixture. Pour wine mixture evenly on top. Cover with a wire rack and then with a large piece of muslin; the rack prevents the muslin from touching the pork.
Refrigerate for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, slice the pancetta and use in your favorite recipe, or pan fry as you would bacon.
