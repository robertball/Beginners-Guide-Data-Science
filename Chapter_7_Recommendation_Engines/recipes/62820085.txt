Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (3 pound) chicken, cut into pieces and skinned
1 1/2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 cup chicken broth
1/4 heaping cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken pieces in the hot oil until golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. Reduce heat to medium, and stir in the bay leaves, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, cloves, and cinnamon until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the tomatoes, brown sugar, salt and chicken broth, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Once simmering, stir in the chocolate chips until melted, then return the chicken pieces to the pot. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is tender and no longer pink at the bone, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in cilantro, and cook 3 minutes longer.
