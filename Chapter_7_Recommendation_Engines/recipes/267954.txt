Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
6 (1-inch thick) pork chops
1 1/2 cups uncooked long-grain rice
2 stalks celery, sliced
1 medium onion, sliced
3 cups water
4 teaspoons instant chicken bouillon
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 medium green bell pepper, cut into 6 rings

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Brown pork chops on both sides, about 5 minutes.
Stir rice and celery together in a baking dish. Place onion slices on top of rice and top with browned pork chops.
Bring water to a full boil in a saucepan. Add bouillon, Italian seasoning, and salt; stir to dissolve and pour mixture over pork chops. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until rice is cooked and pork chops are fork-tender, 60 to 70 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and top with sliced bell peppers. Return to the hot oven and bake until peppers are tender, 10 to 15 minutes more.

This dish is so easy to make! I have two picky eaters I have to feed, and this was an instant success. The rice is so flavorful from the pork chops and bouillon together. Enjoy!
