Ingredients:
cooking spray
2/3 pound ground beef
2/3 pound ground pork
2/3 pound ground veal
2 eggs
2/3 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup pale ale
1/2 cup chopped onion
3 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/3 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Combine ground beef, ground pork, ground veal, eggs, bread crumbs, pale ale, onion, 3 tablespoons ketchup, mustard, basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well. Transfer mixture to prepared baking sheet; shape into 10x5x2-inch loaf. Spread 1/3 cup ketchup on top of the loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 60 to 65 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Cool meatloaf 10 minutes before slicing.
