Ingredients:
6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed
3 cups mayonnaise
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 1/2 cups slivered almonds, toasted
1 pound seedless green grapes, halved
2 cups chopped celery
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks, thoroughly drained
paprika, for garnish

Directions:
Place chicken in a large pot of lightly salted water, and bring to a boil; simmer until tender and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Drain, set aside. When cool enough to handle, chop coarsely, and place into a large bowl.
In a separate bowl, stir together mayonnaise, curry powder, lemon juice, and soy sauce.
Stir into the chopped chicken 2 1/4 cups of the toasted almonds. Stir in grapes, celery, water chestnuts, and pineapple. Gently fold in all but 1/2 cup of the dressing. Cover, and refrigerate salad and reserved dressing for several hours (or overnight).
Before serving, adjust dressing to taste, and garnish with paprika and remaining 1/4 cup almonds.

Description: 
My mother Joyce, who my children call 'Mimi,' is a great Southern cook and has many legendary recipes. This is one of her crowd pleasers. She's been making this very traditional 'lady-like' chicken salad for as long as I can remember. It's best the day after making, and is colorful and fragrant and perfect for a summer supper -- or a ladies' luncheon!
