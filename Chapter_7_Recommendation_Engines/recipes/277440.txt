Ingredients:
baking spray
1 (8 ounce) package reduced-fat cream cheese, softened
1 cup peanut butter
1 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
3 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 6 ramekins with baking spray.
Combine cream cheese, peanut butter, and sweetener in a medium bowl; beat with an electric mixer until thoroughly combined. Add eggs and vanilla and beat until well blended. Use a spatula to divide batter evenly amongst the prepared ramekins.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature, about 1 hour. Refrigerate until completely chilled, 4 hours to overnight.
