Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) frozen whole ham
1 (16 ounce) can crushed pineapple
1/4 cup dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons water, or as needed

Directions:
Place ham on a trivet and set it inside a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Pour crushed pineapple over ham. Sprinkle brown sugar and drizzle maple syrup on top. Secure the lid with vent closed.
Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 35 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Remove ham and trivet. Cut ham into slices and place on a plate.
Select Saute setting on the pressure cooker. Mix cornstarch with water until smooth. Stir mixture into the pot, bring to a boil, and stir until thickened. Pour sauce over the ham.

This is one reason I love my Instant Pot®. I can pull a frozen ham from the freezer, put it in the Instant Pot® with just 3 ingredients and, with almost no effort, have dinner on the table.
