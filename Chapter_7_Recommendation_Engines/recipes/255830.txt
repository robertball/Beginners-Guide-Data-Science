Ingredients:
2 cups hot water
2 teaspoons chicken stock concentrate (such as Knorr® Homestyle)
3 (15 ounce) cans black beans, drained, divided
1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (such as Goya®)
4 teaspoons adobo sauce from chipotle peppers (such as Goya®)
8 ounces bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 yellow onion, diced
1/2 green bell pepper, seeded and diced
1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and diced
4 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 dash ground black pepper
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Mix hot water and chicken stock concentrate in a bowl until dissolved; pour into a blender. Add 1 can black beans, chipotle pepper, and adobo sauce; puree until smooth.
Place bacon in a large pot and cook over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer bacon to a plate lined with paper towels using a slotted spoon, reserving grease in the pot.
Stir onion, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper into the bacon grease in the pot; cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, and black pepper; cook until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds.
Stir black bean puree into the pot. Add remaining 2 cans black beans, bacon, diced tomatoes, and cilantro; bring to a boil. Simmer soup, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
Eating black bean soup all my life with my Guatemalan mother, this is the very best recipe that we have put together over the years. It cannot be beat! Serve with a dollop of sour cream and some fresh cilantro leaves, or for some crunch, some crumbled tortilla chips on top.
