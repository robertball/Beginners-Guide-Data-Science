Ingredients:
2 (5 ounce) red snapper fillets
1 teaspoon ground paprika
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 thin slices lemon, or more to taste
1 large tomato, seeded and finely chopped
3 shallots, chopped
3 cloves garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 lemon, zested
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Coat red snapper fillets with paprika, salt, and pepper.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add red snapper; cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a large baking dish; top with lemon slices.
Combine tomato, shallots, garlic, lemon zest, and ginger in the skillet; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in white wine. Season with salt and pepper. Add butter; reduce heat and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour mixture over red snapper.
Bake in the preheated oven until red snapper flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
I wanted to create a red snapper dish that uses strong Asian flavors made subtle using simple French techniques. This dish truly exemplifies the perfect fusion of East and West. I am proud of this dish and you will be as well! Serve with steamed jasmine rice.
