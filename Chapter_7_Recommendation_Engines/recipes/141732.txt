1 cup ruby red grapefruit juice
1/3 cup hoisin sauce
1/4 cup ketchup

1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 habanero pepper, halved and seeded
4 cloves garlic, smashed

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, grapefruit juice, hoisin sauce, ketchup, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, ginger, habanero pepper, and garlic in a saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 10 minutes, or until thick, stirring occasionally. Strain sauce to remove pepper and garlic. Refrigerate in a covered container until ready to use.

Description: 
This is great as a sauce, glaze or marinade, and everyone always raves about it. You can substitute any pepper in place of the habanero if you'd like, but it's not too spicy with it.  Enjoy!
