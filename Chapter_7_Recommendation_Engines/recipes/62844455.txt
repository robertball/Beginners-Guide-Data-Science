Ingredients:
8 6-inch corn tortillas
1 onion, finely chopped (1/2 cup)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
8-ounce carton dairy sour cream
14-ounce can chicken broth (2 cups)
4-ounce can diced green chili peppers, drained
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese (4 ounces)
2 cups chopped cooked chicken
sliced pitted ripe olives (optional)
chopped tomatoes (optional)
sliced green onions (optional)

Directions:
Wrap tortillas in foil; place in a 350 degree F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until softened.
Meanwhile, for sauce, in a medium saucepan cook onion, garlic, coriander, and black pepper in butter or margarine until onion is tender. In a medium bowl stir flour into sour cream. Add broth; stir until combined. Add sour cream mixture to onion mixture. Stir in chili peppers. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture is slightly thickened and bubbly. Remove from heat. Add half of the cheese; stir until melted.
For filling, stir 1/2 cup of the sauce into chicken. Place about 1/4 cup of the filling on each tortilla; roll up. Arrange rolled tortillas, seam sides down, in a lightly greased 2-quart rectangular baking dish. Top with remaining sauce. Bake, covered, in a 350 degree F. oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until heated through.
Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, about 5 minutes more or until cheese melts. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Makes 4 servings.
