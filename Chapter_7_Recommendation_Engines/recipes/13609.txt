Ingredients:
2 pounds crookneck yellow squash, sliced
1 small onion, chopped
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 1/2 cups bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the squash and onion in a large saucepan with just enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and cook until tender, about 10 minutes.
Transfer the squash, onion, and remaining liquid from the saucepan to a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish. Stir in chicken soup, sour cream, and melted butter. The liquid from the cooked squash should be enough so that mixture is slightly soupy. Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the top. The bread will absorb some of the liquid.
Bake, uncovered, for 30 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until browned and bubbly.

Description: 
This casserole makes a rich, creamy vegetable side dish. Stuffing mix may be used in place of the bread crumbs if you prefer. It tastes even better the next day for leftovers.
