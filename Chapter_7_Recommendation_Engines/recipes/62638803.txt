Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. ground beef
2 cloves Garlic, minced
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 med. onion, chopped
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 cup ketchup
1/4 cup barbecue sauce
1 1/2 tbsp. firmly packed brown sugar
1 tsp. dry mustard
salt and pepper to taste
1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 tbsp. vinegar

Directions:
Cook meat slowly in skillet with salt and onion. Meanwhile, make sauce by mixing together all other ingredients and cooking slowly over low heat for 15 minutes.
Drain (not much to drain if you use ground round) and add meat.
Let simmer for at least an hour, stirring from time to time, to let meat absorb the sauce.
Serve on toasted hamburger buns.

Description: 
My boys love Sloppy Joes and request this often.
Depending on wether you like your Sloppy Joes really sloppy or less sloppy, fiddle around with the ketchup and/or barbecue sauce amounts.
