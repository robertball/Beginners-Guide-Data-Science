1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cocoa
1 teaspoon baking powder

2 teaspoons vanilla
4 egg whites, beaten stiff
1/2 cup chopped nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare 8 inch square pan by spraying with canola cooking spray.
Combine sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Form a well in the centre of dry ingredients, stir in canola oil and vanilla. Fold in egg whites. Fold in nuts.
Pour batter in prepared pan. Bake until brownies are puffed in the centre and the edges are beginning to brown, about 30 minutes. The centre of the brownies will look quite soft.
