3/4 cup egg substitute
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix (pudding in the mix)
cooking spray
Coconut topping:
1/2 cup fat-free milk
1/2 cup granulated sugar
9 large marshmallows
2 cups flaked sweetened coconut

2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons fat-free milk
2 tablespoons stick margarine or butter

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
To prepare cake, combine first 4 ingredients in a large bowl, and beat at low speed of a mixer until moist.

Cool cake completely in pan on a wire rack.
To prepare topping, combine 1/2 cup milk, granulated sugar, and marshmallows in a medium saucepan; cook over medium heat 5 minutes or until marshmallows are melted. Stir in coconut and cornstarch; bring to a boil. Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly. Spread topping evenly over cake; cool.
To prepare frosting, combine powdered sugar, cocoa, 2 tablespoons milk, and margarine in a small saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove mixture from heat; add chocolate chips and corn syrup, stirring until chips melt. Spread frosting gently over coconut layer. Cool until set.
