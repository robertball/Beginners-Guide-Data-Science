Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon lemon zest
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon honey, or to taste
1 large egg
1/4 teaspoon fine salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup self-rising flour
1/4 cup melted butter

Directions:
Bring oats and heavy cream to a simmer in a pot over medium-high heat. Stir and cook for 1 minute and turn off the heat. Let cool down to room temperature, at least 10 minutes.
Transfer oat mixture into a bowl. Add lemon zest and lemon juice. Drizzle in honey and crack in an egg. Add salt and baking soda. Mix thoroughly with a spatula. Stir in flour until no dry spots remain. Cover and let rest for at least 1 hour.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Scoop spoonfuls of the oat mixture into the hot skillet and flatten to your desired thickness. Cook until browned and tops spring back when touched, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
