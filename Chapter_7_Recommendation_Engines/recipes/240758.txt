Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups milk
1/4 cup white vinegar
2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/4 teaspoons xanthan gum
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Stir milk and vinegar together in a bowl; let sit until the milk 'sours,' about 5 minutes.
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, xanthan gum, baking soda, and salt together in large mixing bowl.
Beat eggs and melted butter into soured milk; pour into the flour mixture and stir with a whisk until no lumps remain.
Pour batter by the 1/4 cup onto the hot griddle and cook until browned completely, about 3 minutes per side.
