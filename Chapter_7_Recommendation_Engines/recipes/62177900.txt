1/2 cup caramel topping
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
6 large baking apples (about 2 3/4 lb), peeled, cut into 1/2-inch slices (about 6 cups)
2/3 all-purpose flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup cold butter or margarine, cut into small pieces
2/3 cup quick-cooking oats

Directions:
Heart oven to 375 degrees.
In large bowl, stir together caramel topping and the cinnamon until blended.  Add apples; toss until evenly coated.  Spread in ungreased 8-inch square (2 quart) glass baking dish.
In same bowl, mix 2/3 cup flour and the brown sugar.  Cut in butter, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through mixture in opposite directions), until mixture looks like coarse crumbs.  Stir in oats.  Crumble mixture over apples in baking dish.
Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until apples are tender and topping is golden brown.  If desired, serve with whipped cream and additional caramel topping.
