1/2 medium lemon, grated peel (use 1/2 teaspoons of zest) plus cut 4 wedges

Lay asparagus in a single layer in a large baking pan (you may need to use 2 pans). Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with zest, salt, and pepper. Roll asparagus around pan to coat with oil and seasonings.
Roast until asparagus begins to brown and is easily pierced with a paring knife, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve warm with lemon wedges.
