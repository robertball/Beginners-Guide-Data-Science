Ingredients:
1-2 8oz boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips
1/4 cup flour
1 egg, beaten
1 cup of panko breadcrumbs(more if you need)
1 tbsp red pepper flakes
1/4 tsp chili powder
1/4 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp chives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350'F. Spray baking sheet with non-stick spray.
Cut chicken breast into 1"x1/2" strips. Put flour in a bowl.
Beat egg in a separate dish.
In a bowl or Tupperware that you can place a lid, pour in panko, red pepper flakes, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, and chives.
Dip chicken strips in flour so they are dusted, then dredge in the egg making sure to let excess egg drip off.
Place egg covered chicken strips in panko and cover with lid.
Shake until all are well coated with panko and place on baking sheet.
Bake for 10-12 minutes(depends on thickness and oven).
Serve with your favorite dipping sauce!

Description: 
Everyone loves chicken nuggets, but sometimes we don't want all the fat that comes with deep frying. This recipe will give you the crispy crunchiness you love about chicken nuggets without the oil. This is an easy recipe and can replace your pre-made(processed, yuck!) frozen chicken nuggets! For more heat just add some cayenne pepper to the breadcrumbs. Any dipping sauce will do!
