Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
1/4 cup unsalted peanuts
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1/4 cup cider vinegar
2 cups chicken stock
4 ounces NESTLE CHOCOLATIER™ 62% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar, finely chopped
1 dried ancho chile, cut in half widthwise
1 dried pasilla chile, cut in half widthwise
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper (optional)
Additional chicken stock or broth
5 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cooked and shredded
Additional sesame seeds

Directions:
Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrots, celery, onion, peanuts, garlic and sesame seeds; cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions are golden brown. Add vinegar, stir quickly to deglaze skillet. Add chicken stock, chocolate, chiles, cumin and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced slightly, about 20 minutes. Remove chile halves; discard. Carefully transfer mixture to blender container; cover. Blend until smooth. Makes about 2 cups. Mole sauce may be refrigerated for up to 7 days or frozen for later use.
To Use: Heat mole sauce in saucepan over medium heat. Additional chicken stock may be needed to dilute sauce to desired consistency. Typically, mole should just coat the back of a spoon. Add shredded chicken. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook until chicken is heated through. Season to taste.
Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with warm corn tortillas and/or hot cooked rice.
