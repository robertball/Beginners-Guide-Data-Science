Ingredients:
1 medium onion
15 ounce can of diced fire-roasted tomato
2 Tbsp annato powder (sub paprika if you can't find annato)
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp salt
Pinch of nutmeg
5 lb (~2.5 kg) pork shoulder roast (I bought two smaller roasts)
1 orange, juiced
Â¼ cup apple cider vinegar
2 tsp salt

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix the annato, cumin, black pepper, 1 tsp salt and pinch of nutmeg. Stir in a bit of water until the spices have a thick, paste-like consistency.
Slice the onion and add to a skillet with a spoonful of fat (coconut oil, etc) over medium heat. Cook for a few minutes until translucent, then add the can of tomatoes. Cook for a few more minutes until softened.
Prepare the pork by trimming off any large pieces of external fat (if there is fat on the inside of the meat, most of it will cook out). Slice each roast into long pieces about 1.5" wide. Season with salt.
In the crockpot, mix the juice of one orange with the cider vinegar. Add the annato / spice paste and stir until dissolved. Lay the pork into the liquid. Top with the tomato / onion mixture.
Cook on low for 6-8 hours (longer is okay, too). Skim the excess fat off the top while it's still warm or refrigerate and the fat will solidify on top and can be scooped off.
This was delicious with a couple of eggs for breakfast!
