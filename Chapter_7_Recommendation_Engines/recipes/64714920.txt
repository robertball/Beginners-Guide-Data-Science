Ingredients:
3 unbaked 9" pie crusts (either homemade or store-bought), refrigerated for several hoursc
10 Paula Red Apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/8" slices
2 small lemons, juiced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsps ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1/4 tsp ground allspice
1 tsp vanilla extract
3/4 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 large egg
1 tbsp water

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Toss apples and lemon juice together. Sprinkle all-purpose flour over apples, and gently toss to coat. Gently mix in dark brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, and vanilla until the apples are thoroughly coated. Fold in raisins and walnuts.
3. On a floured surface roll 2 of the 3 unbaked pie crusts together into a rectangle about 12" x 18" wide, and 1/4 inch thick. Gently place crust into a 10" x 15 " jelly roll pan, and press into the corners of the pan. Trim excess dough so that there is only 1" of overhang on all sides. Gently fold overhang underneath itself, and crimp along all edges of the pan. With a fork, poke small holes (not all the way through) sporadically in the bottom of the crust to prevent bubbling.
4. Pour apple filling into the prepared pan/crust. Spread out filling so it's even in the pan.
5. Roll out the remaining pie crust on a floured surface to a 1/4" thickness. Use decorative cookie cutters to cut out several pieces of pie dough. Place the pie crust cut-outs over the filling in desired pattern.
6. Beat together egg and water. Gently brush egg wash over the edge of the pie crust, and the pie-crust cut outs.
7. Bake pie in 350 degree preheated oven for 55-65 minutes, or until pie crust is golden brown and apples are soft when gently pierced with a knife.
8. Allow to cool completely before cutting and serving.
Note: I used 1 1/2 of the recipe from Chef John's "Easy Homemade Pie Crust" for my pie crust.  https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/220996/easy-homemade-pie-crust
Paula Red apples are a sweet-tart, semi-soft apple. Feel free to substitute another firm apple of your choice, but adjust the sugar according to the apple's tartness.
