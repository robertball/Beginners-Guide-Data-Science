Ingredients:
3 eggs
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 T vanilla (or orange or anise)
1 3/4 cup flour
2 tsp baking powder

Directions:
Begin by heating Pizzelle iron over fairly high heat.  Grease interior well with shortening.
Sift flour and baking powder.
Combine melted butter with sugar.
Beat in eggs one at a time.
Add vanilla, then stir in flour mix.
Have cannoli rings or wooden spoon ready for wrapping (may use wooden cone for ice cream cone shapes if desired).
Drop about a tablespoon of batter onto hot iron.  Be sure not to over fill and place batter in the middle, towards the back a bit.
Cooking time depends on how hot your iron is.  Once properly heated, I cook about 20 seconds on the first side, flip, and then cook for another 15 to 20 seconds.
Remove and immediately shape as they cook quickly.
