Ingredients:
2 pounds sliced zucchini
Â¼ cup chopped onion
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 cup sour cream
1 cup grated carrots
1 stick unsalted butter, melted
1 (6 ounce) package chicken-flavored dry bread stuffing mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Boil the zucchini and onion in water for 5 minutes; drain well. In a medium bowl, combine the soup, sour cream and carrots. Stir in the zucchini and onion and mix well.
In a separate medium bowl, combine the butter and stuffing mix. Spread half of this mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spoon the zucchini mixture over the stuffing, then top off with the other half of the stuffing.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes, or until stuffing is golden brown.

Description: 
If you have lots of zucchini in the garden, then this is a great way to use them. It's different, but very tasty. It's so good that even my picky children like to eat it.
