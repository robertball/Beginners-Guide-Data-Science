Ingredients:
4 large eggs
1 cup whole milk
1 cup whipping cream
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
Pinch of salt
4 cups cut or torn up day-old bread. I used Challah (1 16 oz. loaf is enough for 1-1/2 recipes)
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup pecans, toasted, chopped
For Bourbon sauce:
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons whipping cream (or more)
2 tablespoons bourbon (or more)
Pinch of salt

Directions:
Butter 8-inch square baking dish. Whisk first 7 ingredients in medium bowl. Place bread, raisins and pecans in prepared dish. Pour milk mixture over and let stand 5 minutes. Push down bread into custard. Refrigerate 2 hours, pushing bread into custard occasionally.
Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Place bread pudding dish in large metal baking pan. Add enough boiling water to baking pan to come 1 inch up sides of dish with bread pudding. Bake until pudding is puffed and golden brown on top, approximately 50 minutes. Remove dish with bread pudding from water and cool slightly. Cut into squares. Serve bread pudding warm with sauce.
Bourbon Sauce:  Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in remaining ingredients. Simmer until thickened, whisking often, about 3 minutes. Cool slightly.
