Description: 
This was made for our family's lunch at the pool! In the summer time we spend most of our time together at the pool and BBQing. But this was lunch so we wanted something, COLD, FAST, and of course TASTY! So, since I'm mostly European I thought my family would really enjoy something a little more NORMAL, to their palettes.
