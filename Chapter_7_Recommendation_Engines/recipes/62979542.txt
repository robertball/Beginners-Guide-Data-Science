Ingredients:
2 cups cubed Ciabatta bread
4 cups sour dough bread
1 pound Jimmy Dean sage or pork sausage
1 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup chopped celery
5 teaspoons fresh sage
3 teaspoons fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon fresh thyme
1 Granny Smith apple, cored and chopped
1 cup dried cranberries
2/3 cup minced fresh parsley
1 cooked turkey liver, finely chopped
1 cup turkey stock
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degree F (175 degree C). Spread the white and whole wheat bread cubes in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes in the preheated oven, or until evenly toasted. Transfer toasted bread cubes to a large bowl.
In a large skillet, cook the sausage and onions over medium heat, stirring and breaking up the lumps until evenly browned. Add the celery, sage, rosemary, and thyme; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes to blend flavors.
Pour sausage mixture over bread in bowl. Mix in chopped apples, dried cranberries, parsley, and liver. Drizzle with turkey stock and melted butter, and mix lightly.  Spoon into turkey to loosely fill.
