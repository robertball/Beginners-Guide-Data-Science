Ingredients:
1 whole pineapple
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger
1 cup brown sugar
2 habanero peppers, halved
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
8 cups water at room temperature

Directions:
Chop pineapple into small segments, including the rind. You can remove the woody core from the segments if you wish. Add to a large container, e.g. a Mason jar with only a flat lid. The container needs to be able to expel the gas that will build up during fermentation, but also needs to be somewhat airtight to prevent the formation of vinegar.
Crush ginger slightly with the side of a knife to open it up. Add ginger, brown sugar, habanero peppers, cinnamon, and water to the container. Stir to combine, cover, and let stand for 2 days in a warm place until mixture slightly fizzy and warm to the touch.
Strain mixture through a fine-meshed sieve into fermentation-grade bottles. Cover and store in your refrigerator. Enjoy for up to 1 week. Tepache may continue to carbonate in the bottles while stored and explode if left too long.
