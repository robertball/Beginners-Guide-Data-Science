Ingredients:
3 cooked skinless, boneless, chicken breasts-cut into spoon sized chunks
4 green onions, chopped
1 1/2c of your favorite salsa
2 TBSP minced garlic
14 oz can great Northern beans, undrained
14 oz can of corn, drained(No salt preferred)
8 oz Mexican processed cheese cut in blocks
4 large tortillas (optional)
oil
salt

Directions:
Saute the onions and garlic in a large pot with a little oil until the white part of the onion is clear. Add the cooked chicken, salsa, beans and corn and bring to a low boil. Add the cheese and stir until the cheese is melted and cook an additional 10 minutes.
For the "chips," preheat oven to 425. Brush both sides of a tortilla and cut into triangles. Bake on cookie sheet 5 minutes on each side or until browned. Repeat for the next three (you will have to do this individually or at most two at once) Add a little salt on finished chips. You can crush the chips in the chili, eat the chili like a dip, or simply enjoy on their own or with other toppings.

Description: 
I found the inspiration for this chili in the Playboy advisor. They call for some different ingredients (olives, cilantro and I think some jalapenos) and I changed a few things but it's delicious, especially served with home-made oven tortilla chips. (Recipe will follow) It's very flexible so you can make it as spicy or as mild as you like!
