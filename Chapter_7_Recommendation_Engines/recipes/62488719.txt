Ingredients:
4 TBS unsalted butter
2 TBS mixed dried or fresh herbs (like sage, thyme, and rosemary)
1 6-pound roasting chicken
Salt and pepper
2 onions (one slices 1/2-inch thick, one quartered)
1 bulb garlic
1/2 lemon
Sprigs of thyme
3/4 pound fingerling potatoes
1/2 pound baby carrots
2 TBS olive oil

Directions:
1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
2) In a bowl, mash together butter and herbs, and smear 3/4 of it all over under the chicken skin and the rest (1/4 extra) on top. Salt and pepper all over and in the cavity.
3) Arrange onion slices on the bottom of the roasting pan. Place chicken on top, and tuck the wings under the chicken. Slice the top of the garlic bulb to expose the cloves, then stuff the cavity with the garlic, lemon and thyme. Use twine to tie up the legs.
4) Toss potatoes, carrots, and quartered onions with olive oil, salt and pepper. Scatter around the chicken.
5) Bake for about 1 1/2 hours, until golden brown and the juices run clear. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and tent with foil. Let stand 10 minutes before carving.
