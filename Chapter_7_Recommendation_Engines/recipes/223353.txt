Ingredients:
1 pound zucchini, grated
salt to taste
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 eggs
2 green onions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
4 leaves basil, chopped
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch onion powder
ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Squeeze grated zucchini in paper towels to release as much water as possible. Spread zucchini on fresh paper towels and sprinkle with salt; let sit for 30 minutes to release additional water; squeeze again.
Mix Parmesan cheese, eggs, green onions, garlic, basil, nutmeg, onion powder, and black pepper in a bowl; add zucchini. Stir to combine.
Heat butter and olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Form golf ball-sized zucchini patties and place in hot frying pan. Fry until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
