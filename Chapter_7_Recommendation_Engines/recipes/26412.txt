Description: 
This is the recipe my grandmother used when she was growing up during the great depression. 70 years later, it's still a delicious, satisfying form of comfort food.  Serve immediately with saltine crackers. Tastes even better after sitting in the refrigerator over night. In my grandmother's day, they would have 'refrigerated' it on the back porch overnight!
