Ingredients:
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
2 tablespoons water
8 fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 large avocado - peeled, pitted, and cubed
1 zucchini, diced
1 large tomato, seeded and chopped
1 red onion, sliced
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place asparagus and water into a dish, cover, and microwave on high for 3 minutes; stir. Continue microwaving until asparagus are bright green and slightly tender, 2 to 3 more minutes. Drain and cool.
Toss asparagus, mushrooms, avocado, zucchini, tomato, and red onion gently in a large salad bowl. Combine lemon juice, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, basil, thyme, salt, and black pepper in a jar with a tight-fitting lid; cover and shake dressing to mix. Pour dressing over salad and toss again to coat. Cover salad and refrigerate until serving time.
