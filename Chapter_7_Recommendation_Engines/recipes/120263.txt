Description: 
'When I need to throw together something in a hurry, I turn to these no-bake squares,' says Kathy Steffen. 'And because the recipe doesn't include chocolate, you can pack them for long drives or vacations without worrying about melted-chocolate messes,' she writes from her Fond du Lac, Wisconsin home.
