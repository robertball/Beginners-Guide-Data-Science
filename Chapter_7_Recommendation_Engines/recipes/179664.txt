Ingredients:
1/2 cup finely chopped green onions
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 (250 g) tub PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese Spread
1 cup KRAFT Feta with Oregano, Sun Dried Tomatoes and Cracked Peppercorns
1 (300 g) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed, well drained
9 sheets frozen phyllo pastry, thawed, divided
1/3 cup butter, melted, divided

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except phyllo and butter; set aside. Place 1 of the phyllo sheets on clean work surface; brush lightly with butter. Top with 2 more phyllo sheets, brushing more of the remaining butter between each layer. Place remaining phyllo between sheets of plastic wrap; set aside.
Spread one-third of the spinach mixture along one short side of phyllo stack. Fold in ends; roll up to make log. Brush with some of the remaining butter. Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets, spinach mixture and butter. To prevent phyllo from cracking, score logs at 1 inch intervals.
Place in large freezer-weight resealable plastic bags or wrap tightly in plastic wrap until ready to bake. Remove from freezer 30 minutes before baking. Let stand at room temperature while preheating oven to 375 degrees F. Place on baking sheet.
Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 5 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. Use serrated knife to cut each log into 10 slices to serve.
