SALAD:
Rinse and drain all the beans and place in a large bowl. Cook edamame in a small amount of water just until it boils. Rinse in cold water; drain. Add edamame to beans. Add onions, tomatoes, basil, and cheese. Mix well. Add all the vinaigrette dressing. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper. Toss and refrigerate.

Description: 
This is a modified version of the Bean, Tomato, and Smoked Mozzarella Salad recipe found in the July/August 2007's issue of CountryHome Magazine.
The modification was made by my aunt and further revisions were made by my mom. My family of 4 goes through a double batch of this salad/vinaigrette in 2 days. We love it!
