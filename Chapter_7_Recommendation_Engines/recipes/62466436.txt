Ingredients:
5 1/2 pounds apples - peeled, cored and finely chopped
2 cups brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place apples in a slow cooker. Combine sugar, cinnamon, cloves and salt; pour over apples and mix well. Cover and cook on high for 1 hour. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook for 9-11 hours or until thickened and dark brown, stirring occasionally (stir more frequently as it thickens to prevent sticking). Uncover and cook on low 1 hour longer. If desired, stir with a wire whisk until smooth. Spoon into freezer containers, leaving 1/2-in. headspace. Cover and refrigerate or freeze.
