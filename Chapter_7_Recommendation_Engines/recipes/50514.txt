Ingredients:
1 cup red wine
1 teaspoon salt
1 sprig fresh rosemary
4 New York strip steaks, cut 1-inch thick

Directions:
Combine the red wine, salt and rosemary in a small bowl. Let stand at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours.
Heat a large griddle or cast-iron skillet over high heat. Place the steaks on the hot pan, and cook for about  8 minutes per side, or to desired degree of doneness. The internal temperature should be at least 145 degrees F (62 degrees C) for medium rare. Pour in the wine mixture, and allow it to boil for a minute. Serve steaks with sauce on a deep platter.
