Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls
1 (16 ounce) package mild breakfast sausage (such as Odom's Tennessee Pride)
1/2 large sweet onion, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
1/3 cup finely chopped fresh sage
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 egg, lightly beaten
3/4 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish with butter.
Cut crescent roll triangles into thirds and roll into balls. Place balls of dough in a large bowl.
Cook and stir sausage in a large skillet until crumbly, about 5 minutes. Add onion, carrot, and celery; cook and stir until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Season with sage, salt, and pepper.
Mix sausage mixture into the balls of dough. Mix in egg until evenly coated. Add chicken broth and mix well. Pour mixture into the greased casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until dough is golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil if the top starts to brown too much.
