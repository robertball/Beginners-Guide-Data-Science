Ingredients:
Filling:
8 ounces of cream cheese
8ounces of fresh crab meat or canned crab meat, drained and flaked.
1/2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon of light soy sauce
1/8-1/4 teaspoon of whet pepper, to taste
1 Cup chopped green onions, chopped
1 large clove garlic, finely minced
1 teaspoon red onion, chopped
1 package won to wrappers
1 small bowl filled with water for wetting wontons
canola oil for deep frying

Directions:
Combine the crab and the cream cheese. Mix in the remaining filling ingredients one at a time.
On a flat surface, lay out a wonton wrapper in front of you so that it forms a diamond shape. Wet the edges of the wonton.
Add a heaping teaspoon of filling to the middle, and spread it out toward the left and right points of the diamond so that it forms a log or rectangular shape (otherwise the wrapper may break in the middle of deep frying.)
Fold over the edges of the wrapper so that it forms a triangle shape. Seal the edges, adding more water if needed.
Cover the completed Crab Rangoon with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out while preparing the rest heat wok and add oil for deep frying. When oil is ready (the temperature should be between 360-375 degrees), carefully slide in the Crab Rangoon, taking care not to overcrowd the wok. Deep fry until they are golden brown, about 3 minutes, turning once. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Cool and serve.
