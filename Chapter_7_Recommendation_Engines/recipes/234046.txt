Ingredients:
cooking spray
3  green onions
1 (10 ounce) can mushroom pieces, drained
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons cornstarch
Â½ cup half-and-half
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
10 slices sandwich bread

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Chop green onions and mushrooms very finely, to a nearly paste-like consistency.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; stir in green onions and mushrooms and cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Whisk cornstarch into half-and-half; pour into mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, until thickened, about 3 minutes. Season mushroom mixture with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
Roll bread slices with a rolling pin until very flat and thin. Spread mushroom mixture evenly onto flattened bread; tightly roll up bread slices. Slice each bread tube into 1-inch thick rounds; place rounds onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until bread is browned, about 10 minutes.
