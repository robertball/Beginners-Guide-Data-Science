Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1 1/8 cup powdered milk
1/2 cup boiling water

Directions:
Mix the sugar and powdered milk together in a heavy one-quart sauce pan.
Add the boiling water and mix well.
Place pan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring constantly, for 20-30 minutes. Do not allow the mixture to boil. The milk will become darker in color. The finished product will be thick, smooth, and glossy.
Allow to cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, before using in a recipe.

Description: 
The ingredients here are nearly the same as those found in the Allrecipes replacement ingredients article. The directions are somewhat different. This takes careful attention, but yields great results. This recipe replaces one 14 oz can of store-bought sweetened condensed milk.
