Ingredients:
3 cups cooked long grain white rice, day old is best, as long as it is chilled or room temperature
12 oz of ham, sliced into thin strips
1 head of iceburg lettuce, julienne sliced
2 medium tomatoes, cut into eighths
For the vinaigrette:
1/4 cup of minced cilantro
1/4 cup sliced white onions, julienne sliced
2 tablespoons white vinegar or the juice of one lemon
1/2 cup of vegetable oil
1/2 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Begin with a large bowl, preferably the one you will serve the salad in, since the salad is not one you want to stir too much.
Add the rice, ham, lettuce, and tomatoes to the bowl. Mix the ingredients of the dressing with a whisk and drizzle over ingredients in the bowl. Do this only right before serving, as once the dressing goes down over the salad, it has to be eaten promptly. This salad is amazing, but does not keep well.
