Ingredients:
1 (10 pound) fully cooked whole ham
1 cup SMUCKER'S® Cherry Preserves
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/3 cup toasted slivered almonds
3 tablespoons water

Directions:
Heat oven to 325 degrees F. Place ham on a rack in a shallow baking pan. Bake, uncovered, in a 325 degrees F oven about 1-1/2 hours (or until thermometer registers 140 degrees F).
Meanwhile, in a saucepan combine the cherry preserves, vinegar, corn syrup, and spices. Cook and stir until boiling. Reduce heat; simmer two minutes.
Stir in almonds. Remove from heat. Put 3/4 cup of the glaze to the side.
About 15 minutes before the ham is done, spoon some of the remaining glaze over the ham, basting occasionally. Remove from oven; place on a heated serving platter.
Stir the water into the reserved 3/4-cup glaze; heat and serve along with the ham.
