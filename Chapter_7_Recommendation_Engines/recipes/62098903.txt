Ingredients:
1 can black eyed peas
1 can black beans
1 can corn
1 can tomatoes with chilis (like Ro-Tel)
1 LARGE can tomato sauce
1 can diced tomatoes (optional)
1 package dry Ranch dressing mix
1 package mild chili seasoning mix
1 can water

Directions:
Open tomato sauce (one BIG or two regular cans + same amount of water) into big soup pot or Dutch oven. Sprinkle ranch mix and chili mix, and stir to dissolve until no dry powder remains.
Open all the other cans and dump everything - liquid and all - into the pot; set to medium-high heat.
Heat through.  That's it!

Description: 
No kidding, the easiest thing you'll ever make.  Open the containers, put it in a pan and when it's hot, it's done! Serve with tortilla chips warmed in a 350 oven for 5 minutes. Other great garnishes are shredded cheese, sour cream, fresh cilantro, and a squeeze of lime. It even freezes well!
