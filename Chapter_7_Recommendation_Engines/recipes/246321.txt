1 pound prepared unbaked pizza dough
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour for rolling, or as needed
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Roll out dough on a lightly-floured work surface to 1/2-inch thickness. Transfer to a baking sheet. Pierce dough several times with a fork. Spread olive oil over dough evenly with a pastry brush or by hand. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand, 1 hour to overnight.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Sprinkle dough with thyme and salt.
