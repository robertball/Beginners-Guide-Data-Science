Description: 
This is my Aunt Evelyn's recipe. Serve these baked bone-in pork chops coated with a flavorful graham cracker coating with rice and, preferably tomato, gravy. Add a green vegetable, not only for it's nutritional value, but also to make the colors on the plate even more appealing. Southern style field peas (such as zipper creams) would be perfect,  pole beans would be great, but well-seasoned green beans will do.  Do this and you'll have a satisfying down-south country supper.Modified from: Graham Cracker Crumb Pork Chops
