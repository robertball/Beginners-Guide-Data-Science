Ingredients:
12 oz ground Turkey
1 1/2 Tbsp Chili Powder
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/4 tsp cayenne
1/2 cup water
1 1/2 tsp brown sugar
1 Tbsp cider vinegar

Directions:
Combine chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and cayenne in a small bowl and set aside.
Place ground turkey in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook, breaking apart to small chucks, until no longer pink, about 3-5 minutes.
Sprinkle with seasoning mix and a 1/2 cup of water.  Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally until most of the liquid is absorbed, around 10 minutes.
Stir in the brown sugar and cider vinegar.  Simmer for 3-4 minutes.   Transfer to a serving bowl.

Description: 
This recipe has fewer calories because of the ground turkey and amazing flavor!  It is a little spicy, but our family enjoys it this way.  Because it has so much flavor, you cannot even tell its not ground beef!  It tastes great as a topping on baked potatoes as well as tacos!  Enjoy!!
