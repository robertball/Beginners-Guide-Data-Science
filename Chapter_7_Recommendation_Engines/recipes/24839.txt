Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1 teaspoon oil for frying
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 (11 fluid ounce) bottle classic-style stir-fry sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to Grill/Broil.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken and garlic and saute until chicken juices run clear, about 7 to 10 minutes. Drain fat from skillet and stir in sauce.
Place chicken mixture on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes, or until browned. Let sit about 5 minutes to allow sauce to thicken.

Description: 
Cubed chicken sauteed with garlic and stir-fry sauce, then broiled to brown, for a simple, Asian-style dish. This is just something that I threw together one night, when I didn't have any bread crumbs for chicken cutlets, and it turned out to be something I make on a regular basis. I usually have egg noodles with this. If you like a lot of garlic, add more.
