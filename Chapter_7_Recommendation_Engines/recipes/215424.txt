Ingredients:
1 (3.3 ounce) pouch Betty Crocker® Cheddar and sour cream instant mashed potatoes
1 3/4 cups hot water
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup finely chopped fully cooked ham
2 medium green onions, chopped
1/4 cup Bac-Os® bacon flavor bits or chips
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (8 ounce) can Pillsbury® refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 teaspoon red pepper sauce

Directions:
In large bowl, mix the mashed potatoes and hot water. Add cream cheese; beat until blended. Stir in the ham, onions, bacon and Cheddar cheese.
Separate crescent dough into 8 triangles. Slightly stretch corners of short side of each triangle to make longer. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Spoon 1/3 cup potato mixture on center of each triangle. Bring corners to center over filling, overlapping ends; press gently to seal.
Mix butter and pepper sauce; brush over tops. Bake at 375 degrees F 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown.
