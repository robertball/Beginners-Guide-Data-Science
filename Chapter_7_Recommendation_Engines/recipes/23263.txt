Ingredients:
COOKIE
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups powdered sugar
1 cup LAND O LAKES® Butter, softened*
1 egg
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon almond extract
FROSTING
4 cups powdered sugar
1/2 cup LAND O LAKES® Butter, softened*
2 teaspoons vanilla
3 tablespoons milk
Food color, if desired
Decorator sprinkles or candies, if desired

Directions:
Combine all cookie ingredients in large bowl.  Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until well mixed (3 to 4 minutes).  Divide dough in half.  Wrap in plastic food wrap; refrigerate until firm (1to 2 hours).
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface, one-half at a time (keeping remaining dough refrigerated), to 1/8 to 1/4-inch thickness.  Cut with 2 to 3-inch cookie cutters.  Place 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 6 to 10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.  Let stand 1 minute; remove from cookie sheets.  Cool completely.
Combine 4 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup butter and vanilla in small bowl.  Beat at low speed, adding enough milk and scraping bowl often, for desired spreading consistency (1 to 2 minutes).  Tint frosting with food color, if desired.  Decorate cookies with frosting, sprinkles or candies, if desired.
