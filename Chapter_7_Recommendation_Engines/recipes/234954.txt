Ingredients:
3 Anaheim chile peppers
1 yellow bell pepper
1 red bell pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
2 cloves garlic, pressed
10 1/2 ounces goat cheese log

Directions:
Preheat grill to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Grill Anaheim chile peppers, yellow bell pepper, and red bell pepper on the preheated grill with the lid open, turning peppers often, until blistered and blackened, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer peppers to a resealable plastic freezer bag using tongs; seal and let steam loosen skins, about 10 minutes. Carefully open bag, peel peppers, remove and discard seeds, and chop peppers.
Combine peppers, olive oil, vinegar, and garlic in a bowl until evenly combined; cover with plastic wrap and chill, 8 hours to overnight.
Place goat cheese on a serving plate; spoon pepper mixture over goat cheese.

Description: 
This went fast! Used banana peppers instead of Anaheims. Store did not stock those. Great appetizer! Serve with French bread slices. The pepper mixture can also be served on the side with goat cheese if desired.
