Ingredients:
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate
2-1/4 cups flour, sifted
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoons salt
3/4 cup butter or margarine
1 cup sugar
1 cup light brown sugar, packed
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325F.  Butter the bottom only of a 9X9" square baking pan.  Chop and melt chocolate.  Cool.  Combine flour, baking powder, and salt.  Set aside.  In a large saucepan, melt butter over low heat.  Add both sugars and stir until melted and smooth.  Remove from heat and cool.  Stir in vanilla.  Stir in eggs, one at a time.  Add flour mixture gradually, stirring after each addition.  Divide batter in half and stir melted chocolate into one half.  Drop batter by large Tablespoonfuls alternately over bottom of pan.  With the tip of a warm knife, swirl together.  Bake until edges start to pull away, about 55 minutes.  Cool completely in pan on wire rack.  Cut and enjoy!
