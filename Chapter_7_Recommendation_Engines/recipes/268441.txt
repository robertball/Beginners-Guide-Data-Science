Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (14.1 ounce) package 9-inch pie crusts
3 pounds Fuyu persimmons - peeled, cored, and sliced
1 tablespoon cinnamon sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Melt butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add white sugar, brown sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sugar is dissolved.
Line a 9-inch pie plate with 1 crust. Fill with sliced persimmons, mounding them slightly in the center. Pour sugar-butter mixture over the persimmons.
Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the second pie crust. Cut into strips. Make an X with the 2 longest strips in the center of the pie. Alternate horizontal and vertical strips, weaving them in an over-and-under pattern. Use the shortest strips for the edges of the lattice.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes more. Cool pie completely on a wire rack, about 2 hours.

Description: 
Most persimmon pies are made as a custard pie with persimmon pulp. This one is made with sliced firm fruit and the delicious fall flavors of cinnamon and brown sugar. Make sure you are using Fuyu persimmons (short, squat-looking fruit--like an orange tomato) and not the astringent Hachiyas (large and acorn shaped).
