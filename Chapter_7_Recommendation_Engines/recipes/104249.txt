Ingredients:
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon dried Italian spice blend, crushed
1/2 teaspoon Morton® Sea Salt (Coarse)
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon hot paprika
4 rib or loin veal chops
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 whole fresh lemon, cut in half
Roasted red pepper strips

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the garlic, Italian spice blend, Morton(R) Sea Salt, black pepper and paprika. Rub the spice mixture all over the chops. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Let stand at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before cooking.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the chops to the skillet and sear over high heat until browned all over, about 3 minutes per side.
Transfer to the oven and roast for about 20 minutes or until the chops are lightly browned and are beginning to exude pink juices into the pan. Squeeze fresh lemon over chops. Garnish with roasted red pepper strips.
