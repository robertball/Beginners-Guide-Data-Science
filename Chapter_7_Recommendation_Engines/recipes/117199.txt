Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons instant coffee granules
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 cup milk
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
TOPPING:
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup cold butter

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugars, baking powder, coffee granules, cinnamon and salt. Whisk the egg, milk, butter and vanilla; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in chocolate chips. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups three-fourths full.
For topping, combine the flour, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over batter. Bake at 375 degrees F for 22-24 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
