Ingredients:
1 cup plain soy milk
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup canola oil
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8x8-inch baking dish.
Stir soy milk and vinegar together in a large glass measuring cup.
Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Briskly mix canola oil, water, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and almond extract into soy milk mixture using a fork. Stir soy milk mixture into flour mixture until batter is lump-free. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes.

Description: 
This is a dense, yet somewhat spongy basic vegan cake. It can be topped with a basic vegan chocolate or vegan vanilla buttercream frosting. A nice, easy, basic, homemade favorite that doesn't taste like a box mix AND can be used as a tasty vegan birthday cake! Cool completely before topping with your favorite vegan buttercream frosting.
