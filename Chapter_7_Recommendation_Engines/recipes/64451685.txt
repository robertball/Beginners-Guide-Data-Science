Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) boneless salmon fillets
2 tablespoon dried basil
Garlic Powder
Salt
Pepper
4 cloves chopped garlic
4 tablespoons grated Parmesan Cheese
thin slices of tomato
2 tablespoon olive oil
4 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a broiler pan with nonstick cooking spray. Place the salmon fillets onto the foil. Start with a VERY light sprinkle of garlic powder, salt and pepper. Sprinkle with garlic, Parmesan Cheese and basil, top with tomato slices, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle again with Parmesan cheese.
Let sit for about 30 to 45 minutes to soak up the flavors before baking it for 10 mins., followed by about 5 to 10 mins. under the broiler.
Salmon should be opaque in the center, and the Parmesan cheese lightly browned on top.
