Ingredients:
2 c. half and half
2 c. flour
3 eggs, separated
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. soda
2 tsp. sugar
1 tsp. cinnamon

Directions:
Beat egg yolks
Add sugar, salt and half and half.
Then add soda and baking powder.
Whip egg whites until firm and fold in.
Grease Ebelskiver iron and fill cups half full.
Cook 2 1/2 min. and turn.
I use a tooth pick poked into the side of Ebelskiver to turn. Should be golden brown when finished. Serve warm with butter. Can be rolled into powdered sugar or filled with a berrie filling.
