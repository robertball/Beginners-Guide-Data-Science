Ingredients:
2 cups old fashioned oats (or other whole grain)
1 1/4 cups fat-free milk
1 large ripe, banana or small baked sweet potato
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 heaping tablespoon honey
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 large egg
coconut oil or butter for cooking

Directions:
1.Place all ingredients, except egg and coconut oil in the base of a blender and blend until smooth. Add egg and pulse a few times until egg is fully incorporated.
2.Heat a griddle or large saute pan over medium heat and melt a teaspoon or two of coconut oil. When hot, pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides (about 2-3 minutes per side) and serve hot with maple syrup.
3.*If batter becomes too thick to pour easily, add a tablespoon or two of almond milk to thin.
