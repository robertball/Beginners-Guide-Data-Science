Ingredients:
1-3/4 lb  (2-3) long narrow eggplant, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 T. coarse (Kosher) salt
4 large cloves garlic, crushed in garlic press
3 T. red wine vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil, or as needed
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
Freshly ground black pepper
Salt to taste

Directions:
Place eggplant slices in colander and toss with salt. Let stand for 30 mintes. Rinse eggplant well under cold running water and pat dry with kitchen towel. In small bowl, combine the  garlic and vinegar and let stand while you cook the eggplant.
Cook eggplant in batches. Add eggplant slices to olive oil in heated skillet and fry until deep golden-brown on both sides, 12-15 minutes. Repeat with any remaining slices. Transfer the fried slices to large platter (may drain on paper towels to absorb excess oil) and let cool. Place the cooled eggplant slices in a serving dish in layers,
sprinkling each layer with vinegar-garlic mixture, pepper, salt if needed, and cilantro. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
(Consider topping w/toasted pine nuts and/or capers, Greek olives, and tomato for extra zing.)
