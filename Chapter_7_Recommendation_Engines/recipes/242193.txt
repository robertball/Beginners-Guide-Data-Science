Ingredients:
Filling:
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup oats
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
1 pinch ground cinnamon
1 cup chopped rhubarb
1 cup blueberries
Topping:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup oats
1 pinch ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1/2 cup melted butter, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk brown sugar, white sugar, 1/4 cup oats, 1 teaspoon flour, and a pinch of cinnamon together in a bowl. Add rhubarb and blueberries; stir to coat. Pour mixture into a small baking dish.
Stir 1/2 cup flour, 1/3 cup oats, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl; add enough butter to create a crumbly topping, about 1/2 of the butter. Sprinkle crumbly topping over rhubarb mixture, and drizzle remaining butter over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I created this dessert because I still had tons of rhubarb hanging around in my freezer and I was sick of the go-to strawberry/rhubarb combination. It turned out amazingly! The tart taste of rhubarb is, not surprisingly, complemented by blueberry. Delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
