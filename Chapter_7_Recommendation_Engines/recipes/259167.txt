Description: 
A fantastic margarita without a mix. The better the alcohol, the smoother the taste (that goes without saying), but these are pretty fabulous with even fairly cheap tequila and triple sec! Serve over ice for margaritas on the rocks or make several hours ahead and freeze for amazing margarita slushies!
