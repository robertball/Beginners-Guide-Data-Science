Ingredients:
1 large butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
2 tablespoons butter, or more to taste
3 large shallots, chopped
6 cups chicken stock, or more as desired, divided
3 Granny Smith apples, cored and chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour enough water into a baking dish to be about 3/4-inch deep. Lie squash halves into the water with the cut side facing up.
Roast in preheated oven until a fork easily pierces through the flesh, 45 to 50 minutes; Remove from oven and flip squash; let cool enough to handle.
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Saute shallots in hot butter until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour 3 to 5 cups chicken stock into the pot; stir. Add apples to the stock; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the apples are tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
Use a fork to scrape the flesh from the butternut squash, finishing with a spoon to get the last bits away from the skin; add to the simmering stock. Add remaining 3 cups stock to the pot, bring mixture to a simmer, and continue to cook until everything is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth.

Description: 
This soup is so easy to make and tastes so good. You can blend it smooth or leave it chunky. You can top with a dollop of sour cream or plain Greek yogurt if you wish. I created this recipe after my nephew's food service class served a very similar version at their 'Big Night' dinner.
