Ingredients:
3 small zucchini
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
2 teaspoons fresh oregano
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Slice zucchini into 1/4 inch rounds. Coat with the olive oil. Toss zucchini with bread crumbs until completely covered- the olive oil helps the bread crumbs stick. Spread out evenly on baking sheet, and sprinkle with oregano and cheese. Bake at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes, or until zucchini is soft and cheese begins to brown. Enjoy!
