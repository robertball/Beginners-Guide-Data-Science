Ingredients:
2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour or bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon active dry yeast (instant okay)
1 cup warm water (120F)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
TOPPING
1/4 cup prepared Italian salad dressing (liquid)
1/8 tsp salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp ground oregano
1/4 tsp dried thyme
Dash peper
1-2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first four ingredients.
Combine water and oil; add to flour mixture. Place onto a floured surface; knead for 1-2 minutes or until smooth and elastic.
Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 20 minutes. (if in a hurry, just skip this rise.)
Punch the dough down; place on a greased pizza pan and pat into a circle. Brush with Italian salad dressing
Combine the seasonings; sprinkle over top. Sprinkle with cheeses.
For a fluffier cheese bread, at this point allow the bread to rest for 15 minutes or so.
Pre-heat the oven to 450F. Bake for 11-15 minutes or until golden brown.
