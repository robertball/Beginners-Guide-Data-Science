Ingredients:
1 pound thinly sliced chicken breasts, cut into thin strips
3  limes, juiced, divided
2 teaspoons ground cumin, divided
2 teaspoons garlic powder, divided
2 teaspoons ground chipotle pepper, divided
2  red bell peppers, cut into thin strips
1  red onion, thinly sliced
2  jalapeno peppers - stemmed, seeded, and thinly sliced
4  multi-grain tortillas, or more to taste
1 bunch cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Combine chicken, juice of 1 lime, 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon chipotle pepper in a bowl; allow to marinate for 10 minutes.
Saute red bell peppers, onion, jalapeno peppers, juice of 1 lime, 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon chipotle pepper in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until vegetables are tender yet crisp, about 5 minutes.
Transfer chicken mixture to a separate non-stick skillet over medium-high heat; saute until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes.
Layer tortillas between paper towels on a microwave-safe plate; heat in microwave until warmed, 10 to 20 seconds.
Spoon vegetables and chicken onto tortillas; top with cilantro and lime juice.
