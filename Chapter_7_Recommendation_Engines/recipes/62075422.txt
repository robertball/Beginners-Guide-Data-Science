Ingredients:
2 lb ground round (or ground beef)
2 eggs (beaten)
1/2 cup bread crumbs (can use more/less if desired)
1/2 cup chopped onion (optional -can use more/less if desired)
1/4 cup milk
2 cans Cream of Mushroom Soup
2 cans Creamy Onion Soup
1 soup can of milk or water (optional)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
this is best cooked in a 9x13 or bigger baking dish.  You could also use slow cooker if desired.
Mix ground round, beaten eggs, bread crumbs, onion and 1/4 cup milk in a mixing bowl.  Mix together and form into meatballs.  Place meatballs in 9 x 13 greased baking dish and cook in the oven for about 1/2 hour until almost fully cooked.  I usually will turn them once halfway through cooking time.
In a mixing bowl combine the 2 cans of Mushroom soup and 2 cans of Creamy Onion soup.  If you would like the gravy a little thinner, feel free to add the soup can of milk or water.  Once that is mixed you can pour over the meatballs and put back in the oven for about 1/2 hour or until fully heated.  Serve over rice, mashed potatoes, or noodles.
