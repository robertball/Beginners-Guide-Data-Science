Ingredients:
1 medium eggplant
1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs

Directions:
Slice eggplant into 1/2-inch rounds, then cut each round into 1/4-inch sticks. Pat dry.
Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, salt, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper in a shallow bowl. Pour flour into a second shallow bowl. Beat eggs in a third bowl.
Dip eggplant sticks in flour, then in beaten eggs, and then coat with bread crumb mixture. Place on a plate and let rest for 5 minutes.
Preheat an air fryer to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C).
Place eggplant sticks in basket, making sure they are not touching; cook in batches if necessary.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 8 to 10 minutes. Shake basket and continue cooking to desired crispiness, an additional 4 to 6 minutes.
