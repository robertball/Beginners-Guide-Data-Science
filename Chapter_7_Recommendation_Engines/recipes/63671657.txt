Ingredients:
4-6 pound beef brisket
12 ounce can of Coca-Cola
1 envelope Lipton onion soup mix
1 cup bottled chili sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
Pat the brisket dry and place it in a glass baking dish just large enough to hold the meat and sauce.
Mix the coke, soup mix and chili sauce together in a bowl. Pour over the meat. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.
Bake for about 30 minutes per pound.
Skim the fat from the pan juices and reduce in a saucepan if desired. Slice the brisket thinly, across the grain. Serve with the sauce.
