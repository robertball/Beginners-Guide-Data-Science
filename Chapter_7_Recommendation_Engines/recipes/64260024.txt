Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1 cup cocoa powder
1 3/4 cups flour
1 1/2 t baking powder
1 1/2 t baking soda
1 t salt
2 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup buttermilk
3/4 cup boiling water
14 oz. bag sweetened, shredded coconut
1 can sweetened condensed milk
1 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup cream of coconut
1/4 cup heavy cream
3 cups powdered sugar
1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup light corn syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Grease and flour 3 9" round pans.
In a mixer bowl, combine sugar, cocoa powder, flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
Add eggs, oil and buttermilk and beat on medium speed for two minutes.  Scrape sides of bowl and stir in boiling water.  Batter will be thin.
Pour batter into prepared cake pans and bake for 30 minutes or until tops spring back when touched lightly.
Cook in pans for 5 minutes then remove to cooling racks to cool completely.
Prepare filling: In a large bowl, combine coconut and sweetened condensed milk.  Refrigerate until ready to use.
Prepare ganache:  In a microwave safe bowl, combine chocolate chips and heavy cream.  Microwave for about 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds until smooth.
Stir in corn syrup and refrigerate until slightly cooled and thickened.
Prepare frosting:  In mixer bowl, beat butter, cream of coconut and heavy cream on medium speed until smooth.
Turn to low speed and add powdered sugar.  Once all the sugar is barely mixed in, increase speed to high and beat for one minute until fluffy.
Assemble cake:  Spread filling between cake layers.
Frost with frosting.
Spoon ganache on top to the very edges of the cake, letting it drip down the sides.
Garnish with a scoop of coconut filling if desired.
