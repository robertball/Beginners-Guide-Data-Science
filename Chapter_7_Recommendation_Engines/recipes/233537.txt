Ingredients:
1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard
4 hot dogs, butterflied
2 ounces cheddar cheese, sliced into 8 matchsticks
4 strips thick-cut bacon
8 toothpicks
4 hot dog buns, split
1 large (5 inch) dill pickle, sliced into 8 long strips

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Smear 1/4 teaspoon mustard inside each butterflied hot dog. Put 2 Cheddar cheese matchsticks inside each hot dog.
Secure one end of a bacon strip to one end a hot dog using a toothpick. Wrap the bacon strip tightly around the entire hot dog, securing the far end with another toothpick; repeat for remaining hot dogs.
Cook on preheated grill until hot dogs are heated and bacon is cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
Place each cooked hot dog onto a bun and top with 2 pickle slices.
