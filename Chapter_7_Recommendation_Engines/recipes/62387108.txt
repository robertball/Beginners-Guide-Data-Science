Ingredients:
1/3 cup melted butter
1 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoons grated lemon zest
1/2 cup sliced raw almonds
3 tablespoons flour
1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan.
In a mixing bowl, beat together butter, 1 cup sugar, juice and eggs.  Combine flour, baking powder and salt; stir into egg mixture alternately with milk.  Fold in lemon zest, and nuts. Pour 1/3 batter into prepared pan.
In separate bowl, mix about 3 T flour with frozen blueberries  before adding blueberries to remaining batter and pour into pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool bread in pan for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine lemon juice and 1/4 cup sugar in a small bowl. Remove bread from pan and drizzle with glaze. Cool on a wire rack.
