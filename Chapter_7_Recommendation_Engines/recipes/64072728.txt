Ingredients:
2 Eggs
1 Tbs milk
pinch of salt
2 slices of bread (usually white)
2 Tbs Mayonnaise
1 tsp Yellow Mustard

Directions:
Heat a small non-stick skillet on medium heat.  Meanwhile, scramble 2 eggs with 1 tbs milk, and pinch of salt.
Cook eggs (without stirring) approx. 1.5 min, or until they have set enough to flip.  Then flip eggs, and finish cooking.  You want a single disk of cooked, scrambled eggs.
Toast bread to golden brown.  Spread 1 Tablespoon of Mayonnaise on each slice of toasted bread.  Then add 1/2 teaspoon of mustard over the mayo on each slice of bread.  Cut eggs as needed to fit on bread.

Description: 
My dad came up with this recipe years ago.  Over the years, everyone I have shared this with ALWAYS reacts the same way.  First, they tell me That sounds AWFUL.  After they make it, their story changes to That was AMAZING!

I know the idea of mayo and mustard on a scrambled egg disk sounds odd, but trust me, you'll love it.

Tip: I know the cooking method for the eggs may be sacrilege for some folks.  I just ask that you try it before changing it up.
