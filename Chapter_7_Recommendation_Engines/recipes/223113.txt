Ingredients:
2 cups chopped carrots
2 cups broccoli florets
½ cup breast milk
½ cup water

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add carrots and broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, about 20 minutes.
Place carrots, broccoli, breast milk, and water in a blender or food processor and blend until creamy. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps.
Spread carrot-broccoli mixture into an ice cube tray, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze until solid, 2 to 3 hours. Transfer frozen cubes to a resealable plastic bag and store in the freezer.
To serve, heat cubes in the microwave until warm but not hot, about 30 seconds. Stir thoroughly.

Description: 
This is a great combination for growing babies (6-9 months or older). You can mix up the veggies with what's in season or what you have around the house. I like to use green beans instead of broccoli sometimes. I make sure I label my zip-top bag with the date I made it! Make some on a free night to use for a few weeks!
