Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 onion, chopped
1 (32 ounce) can tomato juice
2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained (optional)
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained
1 (1 pound) loaf processed cheese food (such as VelveetaÂ®), cubed

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef and onion. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease.
Stir the tomato juice, pinto beans, diced tomatoes, and green chiles into the skillet. Bring to a simmer, then stir in the processed cheese food until melted, about 5 minutes.
