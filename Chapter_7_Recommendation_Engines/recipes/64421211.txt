Ingredients:
Salad
4 cups baby or full-grown kale (stalks removed & coarsely chopped), packed
14 oz can black beans, drained and rinsed (I used my cooked beans)
1 cup corn (thaw if using frozen)
2 large bell peppers (any colour), finely chopped
1 + 1/2 large avocado, finely chopped
1 large tomato, finely chopped
1/2 cup red onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup cilantro, finely chopped
1 tbsp jalape√±o peppers, seeded & minced
Dressing
1/2 large avocado
1/2 cup warm water
1/2 lime, juice of
1 tsp cumin
3/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Add Salad ingredients to a large bowl. In a food processor, blender or Magic Bullet, process Dressing ingredients until smooth. Pour over salad, toss and serve. P.S. You could prepare Salad and Dressing in advance and combine before serving. The Dressing does get brown a bit but once mixed with the Salad, it's not noticeable.
Have you ever tried making a creamy dressing with avocado? It is amazing! Just avocado, lime juice, warm water and cumin. Blend until smooth (I love using a small cup blender attachment that comes with my Ninja Ultima blender) and pour. No need for oil since avocado contains healthy fats. Yes, adding water to salad dressings is a new way to roll
Storage Instructions: Refrigerate tossed or separately for up to 24 hours
