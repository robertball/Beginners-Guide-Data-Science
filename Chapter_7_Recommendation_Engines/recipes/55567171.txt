Ingredients:
1/2 cup frozen blueberries
1 5/8 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup quick cooking oats
1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup applesauce
1 cup white sugar (or 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar)
2 eggs
1 cup mashed bananas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a medium bowl, dredge blueberries in 2 tablespoons flour.  Gently stir blueberries together with oats, nuts, 1  1/2 cups flour, soda, and salt.
Put applesauce in a large bowl.  Gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in mashed banana.  Add blueberry mixture to creamed mixture, and stir just until moistened.  Spoon batter into muffin tins or mini loaf pans (3).
Bake for 30 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the center of the loaf.  Cool in pan for 10 minutes.  Remove from pan, and cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
This is so good and reminds me of a real moist kind of a sweet quick bread.  Everybody asks for the recipe: this bread is moist, and easy to make too.  Note: If you are using frozen blueberries, you can thaw them in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  However, you need to increase the amount of blueberries to 3/4 cup.Modified from: Favorite Banana Blueberry Quick Bread
