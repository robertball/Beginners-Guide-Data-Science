Ingredients:
1 premade pie crust
1/4 cup butter (for sauteing)
1 small onion - chopped
3 cloves garlic - chopped
2 red or yellow mini bell peppers - chopped
5 large fresh mushrooms - sliced
1 10 oz package of fresh baby spinach
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese - divided
6 oz crumbled feta cheese
4 eggs - whisked
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tsp. nutmeg
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Pre heat oven to 350.  Line a pie plate with the pie crust.  Use the whisked egg to brush on the crust.  Bake for 5-7 minutes in a pre-heated oven (don't let it brown) or until it is stiff.
Melt butter in a large, deep non-stick skillet on medium heat.  Saute the onion, garlic, peppers, and mushrooms until soft.  Add the spinach stirring the mixture until the spinach is wilted.  Turn the heat off and add the feta cheese and 1/2 cup of the cheddar cheese.  Stir to melt the cheese.
Add cream and spices to the egg mixture and combine well.  Spoon the spinach mixture into the pie crust.  Carefully add the egg mixture on top.  Place in the fridge for 2-3 hours to set.
Cook in a 350 oven for 15 minutes.  Sprinkle the remaining cheddar cheese on top, then cook for an additional 30 minutes.  Let it set for 15 minutes prior to cutting.
