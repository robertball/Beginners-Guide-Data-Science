Ingredients:
2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon crumbled dried oregano
3/4 to 1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (4 pound) boneless pork shoulder roast
2 bay leaves
2 cups chicken broth, low sodium
Pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix together salt, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, coriander, and cinnamon in a bowl. Coat pork with the spice mixture. Place the bay leaves in the bottom of a slow cooker and place the pork on top. Pour the chicken broth around the sides of the pork, being careful not to rinse off the spice mixture.
Cover and cook on Low until the pork shreds easily with a fork, at least 10 hours. When the pork is tender (I do this after about 8 hours), remove from slow cooker, and shred with two forks. Return to crock pot and cook on HIGH for remaining 2 hours. Optional...prior to serving, spread in 9x13 coated with cooking spray and bake for 20 minutes at 400 degrees to crisp the meat. Use cooking liquid as needed to moisten the meat.
