Ingredients:
- 1 pound cake (homemade or store bought)
For the whipped cream:
- 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream
- a couple drops of vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar
- pinch of salt
- 1/2 tablespoon of honey
For the candied kale:
- 4 cups of kale, de-stemmed
- 1 tablespoon of honey
- 1 tablespoon orange juice
- 1/4 teaspoon of salt
- 1/8 cup of extra virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon of brown sugar
For the reduction:
- 1 cup of orange juice (store bought or fresh squeezed is fine)
- 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of white granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon of honey
- 4 tablespoons of confectioner's sugar or powdered sugar
- powdered sugar, for dusting (optional)

Directions:
1.) Prepare the kale first. Preheat your oven to 275 degrees F.
2.) Whisk the honey, orange juice, salt, and olive oil together in a bowl until emulsified. Pour over your de-stemmed kale. With your hands, gently work the mixture into the kale until all of it is completely coated.
3.)Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and arrange the individual leaves on it. Try to make sure that the leaves don't overlap each other. Sprinkle a dash of salt and the brown sugar over the leaves. Bake for 30 minutes, then allow to cool completely. Set aside.
4.)If you're making your own pound cake, bake according your recipe and allow to cool completely. If you're using a store bought frozen one, thaw it a bit before using.
5.) Next, get the reduction started. In a bowl, whisk together the orange juice, sugar, honey, and powdered sugar together until the dry ingredients are dissolved.
Stirring occasionally, bring to a boil in a small saucepan, then reduce heat to medium low and allow to simmer for about 10-20 minutes.
6.)Stir it occasionally. Do not cover while it is simmering. You're aiming for a honey or syrup-like consistency.
7.)With a sharp knife, cut the pound cake into uniform slices, about 1.5 inches thick. Lay these flat, and use a round cookie cutter to make circular pieces. Pop these in the freezer until you're ready to assemble your dessert.
8.)For the whipped cream, combine heavy cream, vanilla, sugar, salt, and honey in a bowl. Blend on high for about 1 minute, or until soft peaks form. Do not overbeat. Fill pastry bag, using a tip of your choice.
9.) Pipe the whipped cream on top of the cake circles, add 2 pieces of candied kale, drizzle a bit of the reduction over it, then finish with dusting of powdered sugar.
