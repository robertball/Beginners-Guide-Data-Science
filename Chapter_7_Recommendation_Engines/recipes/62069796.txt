Ingredients:
6 egg whites
pinch of salt
2 cups of caster sugar (very fine white sugar)
1 ½ tsp vinegar
1 ½ tsp vanilla
lots of FRESH FRUIT!  (kiwi, strawberries, peaches, blueberries, raspberries…)
1/2 cup of coconut *optional*

Directions:
1.  While you  are preparing the pavlova set the oven to 450.  Right before you put it in to bake you will turn it down to 300.
2.  Beat the egg whites with salt using an electric mixer at the highest speed.  (I recommend using a standing mixer since this part takes a long time.)  When the soft peaks form add the sugar 1 TBS at a time, beating well in between each addition. Stop beating after all the sugar has been added and fold in the vinegar and vanilla.  (This is where I put in ½ cup of dry coconut)
3.  Put the meringue onto a lightly greased 18-27 cm round glass dish.  (I use clear glass because it just looks so beautiful!)  Heap the Pavlova mixture into the dish and spread around with the back of a spoon making sure to come to the edges.
4.  Place the Pavlova into the oven (making sure that you bring the temperature down to 300 first) and bake for 40-50 minutes until crisp on top and a pale straw like color.  DO NOT TAKE OUT OF THE OVEN - TURN OFF THE HEAT AND ALLOW TO COOL IN THE OVEN.
5.  Once completely cooled, top generously with fresh whipped cream (not cool whip – use the real stuff!) and then place the fruit in beautiful concentric circles… it is a real showstopper!

Australians claim Pavlova and this recipe is so easy it feels like cheating!  It is especially striking when the fruits and berries are in season.  It's a real crowd pleaser.
