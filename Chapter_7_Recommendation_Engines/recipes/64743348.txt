Ingredients:
1 large Asian pear, peeled, cored and sliced
1/3 cup sherry wine
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup rice vinegar
1/8 cup brown sugar
3 cloves garlic, peeled
5 slices fresh ginger,
peeled and thinly sliced
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon hot chile paste (such as sambal oelek)
1 teaspoon sesame oil
4 pounds beef short ribs, trimmed (I used cross cut)
1 chopped green onion for garnish

Directions:
Soak ribs in large bowl in cold salted water
Combine the first 10 ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 4 minutes.
Brown the ribs in batches in a large oven safe Dutch oven
Remove ribs to plate as they brown
Pour off fat
Deglaze pot with a bit of water or broth
Return ribs to pot
Pour in the sauce
Bring to a boil
Cover with lid and place in 325 degree oven for 2 1/2 hours
Stir occasionally
Skim fat off of the sauce
I recommend making these the day before so that you can easily skim the fat off of the sauce.
