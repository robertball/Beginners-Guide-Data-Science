Salt, pepper, garlic powder to taste
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the artichoke hearts, Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream and garlic. Add half & half 1 tbsp. at a time to thin to desired consistency.  Place chicken in a greased baking dish, sprinkle with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Cover evenly with artichoke mixture.
Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear.
