Description: 
This soup tastes like autumn!This recipe is rather strange and surprisingly good! when someone requested this i thought it would be kind of hard to get the flavors to work, but they do!The bleu cheese lends itself well to the bacon, rosemary, and squash.the carrots add crunch and the onions also go well with the bacon.
