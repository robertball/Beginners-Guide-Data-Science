Description: 
Skinless, boneless chicken breasts are rolled up with prosciutto and provolone cheese and baked in a delicious sauce made with portabella mushrooms, wine and Dijon mustard.  Crushed up garlic and butter flavored croutons in the sauce gives it a great flavor.  I served this with orzo cooked in chicken broth and a nice green salad.
