Ingredients:
1 (10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets optional
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
Season turkey with salt and pepper and place, breast-side down, in a roaster; add neck and giblets. Pour water into pan.
Bake in the preheated oven, basting as needed, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 6 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Continue to roast until meat falls off the bone if desired.
