Ingredients:
2  cups baby carrots
1  tablespoon  vegetable oil, divided
2  teaspoons  grated peeled fresh ginger
3  garlic cloves, minced
1  cup  fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
1/2  cup  natural-style peanut butter
1/4  cup  low-sodium soy sauce
3  tablespoons  rice or white wine vinegar (I used white wine vinegar)
1  teaspoon  chili garlic sauce
1/4  teaspoon  salt
Cooking spray
1 cup bell pepper strips (I used an orange pepper)
1  pound  snow peas, trimmed
1 pound uncooked whole-wheat spaghetti
*2 chicken breasts, cooked & cubed (optional)

Directions:
Cut the baby carrots in half, and then in half again. Set aside.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the ginger and minced garlic; sauté 30 seconds. Add chicken broth and the next 5 ingredients (broth through salt); stir until well-blended. Reduce heat, and simmer 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, and keep warm.
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat. Add bell peppers and snow peas and carrots; sauté 5 minutes or until tender. Remove from heat. Combine  peanut butter mixture, bell pepper mixture, linguine (*and chicken) in a large bowl; toss well. Serve warm.
