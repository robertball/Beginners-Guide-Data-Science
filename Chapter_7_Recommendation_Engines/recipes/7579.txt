Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup cold water
1 1/2 cups dried apricots, chopped
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup heavy cream, whipped

Directions:
Heat apricots by placing them in a bowl, cover with water, and microwave on high for about 10 minutes or until the water is absorbed.  Soften gelatin in the cold water.  Blend apricots into the gelatin.  Add lemon juice, sugar and salt and mix.  Chill until slightly thickened (about 1 hour).
Whip the cooled apricot mixture until frothy. In a separate bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the apricot mixture.
Split cake into 2 or 3 layers. Fill between layers, and frost side and top. Chill overnight.
