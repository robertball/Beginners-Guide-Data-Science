Ingredients:
1/2 cup Earth Balance or Becel Vegan softened. (butter can be used)
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
2 tablespoons corn syrup
2 cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
Sea salt

Directions:
Cream Earth Balance with sugar together.
Beat in egg and corn syrup.
Stir the flour, salt and baking powder together and add to the creamed mixture.
Mix well.
Shape into 7 inch pencil sized ropes and form into a horseshoe.
Bring ends down to center of rope overlapping and pressing ends forming a pretzel shape.
Sprinkle a bit of sea salt on them if desired.
Arrange on a greased cookie or parchment lined cookie sheet.
These hold their shape much better if chilled in the fridge for 1/2 hour at this point.
Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven 10-12 minutes until nice and golden
These stay  fresh for a couple of days and freeze very well.
For a bit of a tang dip in yellow mustard.
I put that this recipe makes 1 dozen but it depends how big or small you make the pretzels.
