Ingredients:
2 pounds uncooked shrimp, rinsed and deveined with shells on
2 T butter
1 t oil
1/2 c mango puree
1 t garlic, chopped
1/4 c heavy cream
2 T fresh basil, chopped

Directions:
Heat oil and butter in a large frying pan over medium heat.
Place shrimp in the pan in a circular pattern. Cook 2 minutes total (including the time to place in the pan) or until edges start to curl. Flip from first in the pan to last.Cook 1 minute more.
Add 1/4 cup mango puree and braise for 2 minutes, or until liquid has reduced to half. Do NOT move the shrimp; it toughens them.
Remove to plate. Repeat with the rest of the shrimp, adding oil if necessary.
Add cream and garlic, scraping up bits. Return shrimp to pan to warm for one minute.
Pour shrimp into a dish. Sprinkle with basil. Serve with a "shell" bowl to catch the discarded shells and napkins.
