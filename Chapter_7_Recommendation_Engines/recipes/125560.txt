1 cup fresh blueberries
1 cup fresh raspberries

Beat whipping cream until soft peaks form; set aside.
Place saucepan containing gelatin mixture in a bowl of ice water; stir with a rubber spatula until gelatin mixture is the consistency of unbeaten egg white. Remove from ice water; quickly, stir in whipped cream. Spoon the cream mixture over berries, tossing gently to coat.
