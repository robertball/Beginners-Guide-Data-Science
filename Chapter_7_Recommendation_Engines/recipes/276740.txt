Ingredients:
1 cup butter, at room temperature
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 egg yolks
3 ounces cream cheese, cut into pieces
3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons colored decorating sugar, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Combine butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add egg yolks, 1 at a time, mixing for about 15 seconds after each yolk. Add cream cheese and mix until well combined. Mix in nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt; beat until completely mixed. Add flour and stir just until incorporated.
Fill a cookie press with dough and press out cookies, using your favorite shape, onto ungreased cookie sheets. Sprinkle with colored sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough.

Description: 
This is the best tasting spritz cookie ever! The addition of brown sugar to the dough gives them great flavor. Buttery, crispy, and the aroma of the spices while they're baking is just incredible. I hope you enjoy them as much as we have!
