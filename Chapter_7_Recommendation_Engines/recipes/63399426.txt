Ingredients:
4 Chicken breast halves, with skin and bone
1 teaspoon of salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup Italian or Caesar Salad dressing

Directions:
Place the 4 chicken breasts in a plastic bag or other container so they can marinade. Add the salt, pepper and salad dressing, (the cheaper the better).  Marinade for 1 to 3 hours.  Grill on each side on high heat for 5 minutes per side, then on medium to low heat for 10 minutes per side.  Yes the skin will char but we're not supposed to eat it anyway.  (Indirect heat or constant flipping during the first five minutes helps reduce charring.)  This recipe will yield a juicy and tasty chicken.  Yummy!!
