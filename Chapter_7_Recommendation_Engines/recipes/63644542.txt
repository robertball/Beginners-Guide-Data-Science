Ingredients:
1 cup oatmeal
1/2 cup ground flaxseed
1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter
1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup honey
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a bowl. 2. Form into balls with your hands. 3. Place in freezer until set, then enjoy! (I store them in the freezer because I think they taste best frozen, but not necessary)
