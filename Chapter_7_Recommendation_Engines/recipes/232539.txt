Ingredients:
9 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups hot water
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon dry yeast
1 tablespoon salt

Directions:
Mix flour, hot water, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl; transfer dough to a work surface and knead for 10 minutes. Place dough in a bowl and let rise for 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Form dough into 24 balls; punch a hole in the middle of each ball with a finger, creating a bagel shape. Place bagels on the prepared baking sheet; let rise for 20 minutes.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil; cook bagels, working in batches, in the boiling water, about 45 seconds per side. Place boiled bagels on a clean towel to drain. Return bagels to the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and lightly browned, 30 to 35 minutes.
