Ingredients:
4 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored quartered and thinly sliced
1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg
Pinch of kosher salt
3 large eggs
1/2 tsp. pure almond extract
Confectioners' sugar, for dusting

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan.
2.  In a large bowl, toss the apples with the lemon juice and 2 Tablespoons of the sugar and let stand for 15 minutes.
3.  Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the flour with the cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the eggs with the almond extract and the remaining 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar at medium-high speed until thick and pale yellow and a ribbon forms when the beaters are lifted, 8 to 10 minutes.  Gently fold in the dry ingredients just until incorporated.
4.  Spread the apples in the prepared pan in an even layer, then pour the batter evenly over them.  Let stand for 5 minutes to allow the batter to sink in a little.
5.  Bake the sharlotka for about 1 hour, until it is golden and crisp on to and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  Transfer to a rack and let rest for 15 minutes.  Unmold and transfer to a serving platter. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve warm.
