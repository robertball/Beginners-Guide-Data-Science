Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie
2 cups sour cream
2 cups white sugar
2 cups fresh elderberries, stemmed
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll 1 crust into a 12-inch circle; place in a 9-inch pie plate.
Mix sour cream, sugar, elderberries, flour, and salt together in a bowl. Spoon filling into the crust in the pie plate.
Roll second crust into a 10-inch circle; cut a few slits in the center to vent steam. Place crust over the filling. Press crusts together to seal; flute edges.
Bake in the preheated oven until top crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let cool to room temperature before slicing, about 1 hour.
