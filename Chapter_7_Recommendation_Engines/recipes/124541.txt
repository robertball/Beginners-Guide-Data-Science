Description: 
THIS RECIPE is my grandmother's. Originally Gram even made the tomato juice in it from scratch!    Every time I return to Massachusetts for a visit home, Gram has this soup simmering on the stove. She's always loved to cook, and at age 95, she still enjoys making tomato soup and other favorite dishes. -Gerri Sysun, Narragansett, Rhode Island
