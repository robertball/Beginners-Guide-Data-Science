Ingredients:
1 pound feta cheese, cubed
1 chile pepper
1 tablespoon herbes de Provence
1 pinch lemon zest
1 cup olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Place feta cheese in a glass jar. Add chile pepper, herbes de Provence, and lemon zest. Fill jar with olive oil so feta is completely covered and seal.
Marinate in a cool place, but not in the refrigerator, for 3 to 4 days. Remove chile pepper before serving.

Description: 
I always make my own marinated feta. If you like, you can also add garlic, but my family doesn't like garlic so we prefer this simple variation.
