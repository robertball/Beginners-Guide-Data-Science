Ingredients:
1 pound elbow macaroni
1 cup real mayonaise
1/2 small red onion (diced very small)
1/2 small green bell pepper (diced very small)
1 pkg dry ranch salad dressing mix
6 slices of cooked crumbled bacon
1/2 pound of sharp cheddar cheese diced into small cubes

Directions:
Prepare macaroni according to package directions and then  rinse with cold water and drain well. Add in the remaining 6 ingredients and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. This recipe is even better if served the next day so that all of the flavors are well incorporated. Enjoy!
