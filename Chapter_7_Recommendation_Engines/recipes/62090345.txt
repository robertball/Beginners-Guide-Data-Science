Ingredients:
24oz. package of Five Cheese Tortelloni (I use the Olivieri brand from Costco)
1 bag Suger Snap Peas
1 ctn. sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons butter
8oz. regular cream cheese
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 ounces fresh grated parmesan cheese
2 cups whole milk

Directions:
Saute mushrooms and peas in a medium frying pan with 2 tablespoons of butter over medium/low heat (for about 5 minutes).
At the same time, boil water and cook tortellini to package directions.
In a medium non-stick saucepan melt 1/2 cup of butter over medium heat.
Add the cream cheese and wisk to until smooth.
Add garlic powder.
Add milk, a little at a time, wisking to smooth out lumps.
Add parmesan and pepper.
Remove from heat when sauce reaches desired consistancy.
Sauce will thicken rapidly, thin with milk if needed.
Toss with pasta and sauteed veggies and serve.

Description: 
So delicious you'd think you were at a restaurant! The thick creamy alfredo sauce is extremely flavorful and super easy to make. The additions of snap-peas and sauteed mushrooms make this one of my favorites.
