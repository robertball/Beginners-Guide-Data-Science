Ingredients:
For the sauce:
2 tbsp. Braggs aminos
2 tsp. sugar
1 tsp. sesame oil
1 tsp. fresh ginger, grated
1/2 tsp. Sriracha or chili-garlic sauce (optional)
8 oz egg noodles
1 tbsp vegetable oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup beansprouts
1/2 red pepper
1 cup cabbage, shredded
1/2 cup snow peas, trimmed

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk together Braggs aminos, sugar, sesame oil, and ginger. Set aside.
In a large pot of boiling water, cook egg noodles according to package instructions. Drain, toss with a bit of oil to prevent sticking, and set aside.
Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add garlic and cook until just fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Stir in pepper, cabbage, and snow peas. Cook, tossing frequently, until the vegetable are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.
Add beansprouts
Add the cooked egg noodles and sauce to the skillet, then toss gently to combine. Serve immediately.
