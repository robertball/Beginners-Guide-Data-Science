Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup French fry-sized pieces of jicama

Directions:
Spray a microwave-safe plate with cooking spray. Arrange jicama pieces on plate.
Cook in the microwave on high until small brown stripes begin to form on the fries, 9 to 11 minutes. Check on the fries every few minutes to avoid burning. Remove plate from microwave with an oven mitt because plate will be hot.

Description: 
Ever wonder what to do when you have too much jicama? 

Here's a quick guide to making a quick snack. Best served with barbeque sauce. The stripes on the fries are caused by the moisture escaping the jicama and creating fissures where the starch from the jicama collects and browns.
