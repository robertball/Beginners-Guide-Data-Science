Ingredients:
1 pound of Haribo or other high quality Gummy Bears
Bottle of good Vodka, plain or flavored OR Rum
12 oz can of Minute Maid Premium Fruit Punch(defrosted)

Directions:
Put Gummy Bears in a large glass bowl. Do NOT use plastic.
Pour Vodka over the Gummy Bears until they are completely submerged.
Put plastic wrap tightly over the top of the bowl and put the bowl in the refrigerator.
Stir Gummy Bears once a day for 3-5 days. You can add more liquor as it absorbs. They'll soak up whatever you put in. The more liquid though, the longer it will take to make.
When Gummy Bears are nice and plump, drain excess vodka off. (note: liquid will be gummy bear color and thick with sugar. you can drink it if you dare.)
Add the 12 oz can of defrosted fruit punch
Stir Gummy Bears a couple of times a day for another 2 days (or so).
Taste test a Gummy Bear to see if they have achieved maximum plumpness and are soft in the center.
Drain off excess liquid and put Gummy Bears in shot glasses.
Important! Keep Vodka Gummy Bears cool. They dissolve if they get warm.

Description: 
These are for ADULTS ONLY. Making Vodka Gummy Bears takes patience, like 5-7 days worth of patience. You can make them with any gummy candy, not just bears. Worms are really fun. As are the cola flavored bottles, soaked in rum. Just make sure you use a high quality candy, or else they'll turn to mush.
The juice concentrate is completely optional. If you like your treats with an alcoholic kick, omit the juice.
