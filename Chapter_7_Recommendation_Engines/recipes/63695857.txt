Ingredients:
6 eggs
6 tbs milk
1 tbs butter
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Crack the eggs into a deep bowl. Add 6 tbs milk to the egg mixture with milk. Whisk the mixture until well combined.
Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat.  Melt 1 tbs butter in the skillet.
When the butter starts to bubble, reduce heat to medium-low and, pour in the egg mixture. Sprinkle the egg mixture with salt and pepper to taste (about ¼ tsp. salt to start).
Let the eggs set a bit before stirring.  Add any other herbs, shredded cheese, sautéed mushrooms, chopped tomato, avocado, or anything else you’d like.
With a wooden spoon, start to scrape the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center, forming large soft curds. Continue scraping your spoon along the bottom of the pan to stir the eggs as they cook.
When the eggs look wet but are no longer liquid, gently mound the eggs into the center of the pan. Turn off the heat but leave the skillet on the burner while you ready your plates.
Divide eggs between the two plates. Sneak a taste and add more salt or pepper before serving, or season the eggs at the table.
