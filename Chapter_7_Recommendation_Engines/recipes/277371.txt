Ingredients:
6 boneless chicken thighs, or more to taste
2 (15 ounce) cans chicken broth
2 (15 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 tablespoon shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon sour cream, or to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon crushed tortilla chips, or to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place chicken thighs in a large pot of water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-high and boil until no longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes. Remove from the pot and let cool until able to handle, about 10 minutes. Shred chicken.
Place chicken broth, tomatoes, black beans, corn, tomato sauce, chiles, and taco seasoning into the bottom of a slow cooker. Add shredded chicken. Cover and cook on Low, 6 to 8 hours.
Serve topped with Cheddar cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips, and cilantro.

Description: 
I always keep certain canned goods on hand to whip up standards. You can cook chicken thighs ahead of time and add to this slow cooker Mexican soup, or you can put boneless cuts of chicken in at the beginning of the cooking time. Slightly spicy, it's a terrific 'comfort' food!
