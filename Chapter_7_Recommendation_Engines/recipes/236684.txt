Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
3/4 cup quinoa
1 1/3 cups cubed seeded watermelon
1 cup sliced red bell pepper
1 cup sliced cucumber
3/4 cup sliced red onion
1 small mango - peeled, seeded, and chopped
1/4 cup drained pineapple tidbits, juice reserved
1 bunch cilantro leaves, chopped, a few leaves reserved for garnish
Dressing:
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons reserved pineapple juice from the can
2 tablespoons lime juice
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup canola oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 slices lime
1 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.
Stir cooled quinoa, watermelon, bell pepper, cucumber, red onion, mango, pineapple, and chopped cilantro leaves together in a large bowl.
Whisk wine vinegar, honey, pineapple juice, lime juice, and garlic together in a small bowl; drizzle in canola oil, whisking constantly. Pour dressing over quinoa mixture; toss gently to combine. Place salad in a serving bowl; garnish with lime slices, jalapeno slices, and reserved cilantro leaves.
