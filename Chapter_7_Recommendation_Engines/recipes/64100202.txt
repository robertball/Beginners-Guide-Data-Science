Ingredients:
1 C white whole wheat flour
2 T brown sugar
2 T baking powder
3/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 C quick cooking oats
2 C buttermilk
3 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 pint blueberries, rinsed and dried

Directions:
Optional: Process the oats in a blender or food processor until it resembles flour.
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the oats and buttermilk.
In a large bowl, mix whole wheat flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Into the buttermilk/oats mixture, whisk the eggs and oil. Pour into the flour mixture all at once. Continue mixing just until the ingredients are incorporated - don't over mix! Let the batter rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Prepare a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Pour batter about 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared griddle.  Drop the blueberries into the batter as soon as it is poured, spacing them out as desired. Cook until bubbly and somewhat dry in appearance (2 to 4 minutes). Flip, and continue cooking until lightly browned.
