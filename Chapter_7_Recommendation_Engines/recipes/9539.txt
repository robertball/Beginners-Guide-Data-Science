3 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup crushed pineapple, drained

Butter a 9-inch square pan. Set aside.
Combine milk, sugar, and butter.  Heat slowly to boiling point.
Stir in drained crushed pineapple and cook over medium heat to soft ball stage, 236 degrees (113 degrees C), stirring constantly to prevent burning, about 25 minutes.  Cool.  Stir in lemon juice.  Beat until mixture is smooth and has lost its sheen.
Turn into buttered pan. Let cool, then cut into squares.

My family really loves this fudge. I have to make it every Christmas and send it to the family. To make this dessert even more festive, decorate it with pecan halves!
