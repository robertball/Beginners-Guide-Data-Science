Ingredients:
1 pound dry pinto beans, 2 slices bacon, 2 T salt, 1/2 t pepper, 1 T cumin, 2 t oregano, 1 t red pepper, 1 t chile powder, cheese, chopped onion, cilantro, bagged lettuce, corn chips,salsa, sour cream and tomato.

Directions:
Soak pinto beans overnight in 3 times the water to cover.  Rinse and drain the beans in the morning and put in a crock pot or stock pot.  Add the bacon and oregano and cumin.  DO NOT add the salt yet!  Set your crock pot up to cook all day, the beans need 8 hrs plus.  If you're cooking the beans on the stove, bring them to a boil then simmer them for 2-3 hours.  Add the salt after they are almost cooked, within 1/2-1 hr of being done. Check the other seasonings after you add the salt, and add more if you need to. Serve the beans with the other toppings for people to assemble their beanstack how they like it.  I assemble mine like this:  corn chips, beans (1 c), cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, cilantro, salsa, sour cream.
Also, if you are already chopping tomato, onion and cilantro, try making my salsa recipe, Salsa Fresca.  It only takes a couple more steps, and since beanstacks are so easy, it's a really nice touch to have homemade salsa!
