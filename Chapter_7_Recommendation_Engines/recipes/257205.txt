Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey breakfast sausage
1 (8 ounce) can refrigerated reduced-fat crescent roll dough
5 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2/3 cup milk
2/3 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh spinach
1 scallion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Unroll crescent roll dough and spread evenly over the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.
Mix sausage and eggs together in a bowl. Add Cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese, milk, red bell pepper, spinach, scallion, parsley, salt, and pepper, stirring well after each addition. Pour egg mixture over the baked crescent rolls.
Bake in the oven until eggs are set, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
I'm always looking for ways to add (or sneak if need be!) vegetables into the meals I make for my family. I make this casserole for breakfast or dinner. Despite using reduced fat crescent rolls and turkey breakfast sausage, taste is definitely not compromised.
