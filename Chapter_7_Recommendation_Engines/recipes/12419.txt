Ingredients:
1/2 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 tablespoon butter, melted
3 apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
3/8 cup all-purpose flour
3/8 cup chopped blanched almonds
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons butter, chilled
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 egg yolks
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/3 cup dry Marsala wine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small bowl, mix flour, almonds, 1/2 cup sugar, and cinnamon together. Add chilled butter and vanilla extract.  Cut together with a pastry blender until small crumbs form. Set aside.
Unfold pastry and cut into a 10-inch circle. Place on a large, ungreased baking sheet. Brush with melted butter.  Arrange apples in the center of the pastry, leaving a 1/2 inch wide border of pastry. Spoon almond topping gently over the apples, being careful it doesn't spill over the edges of the pastry.
Bake in preheated oven until the pastry is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
To make the sabayon, whisk egg yolks and 3 tablespoons sugar in a heatproof bowl or the top of a double boiler. Heat over simmering water, beating mixture constantly with a handheld electric mixer.  When foamy, add the marsala; continue to beat until the mixture begins to thicken. Do not overcook, or the mixture will curdle. Remove from heat. Serve warm over the apple tart.
