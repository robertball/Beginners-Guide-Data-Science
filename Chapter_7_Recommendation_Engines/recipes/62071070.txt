Ingredients:
1 box of moist chocolate cake mix
1 c of chocolate chips
1/2 c of dark chocolate chunks
1 1/2 c of small white marshmellows
3/4 c of crown whiskey (no subs)
1 bunt pan well greased or no-stick sprayed
icing
chocolate syrup
carmel syrup

Directions:
Follow the instructions on the cake mix box. Then add the remaining ingredients. I tend to be generous with mine. Follow the baking instructions. When it get's close to being done, test the density. It should be gooey, but make sure the cake is baked. Remove from the oven. Slide a knife around the edge of the bunt pan place a plate on the top of the pan and flip it. Let the cake set and cool. When the cake is cooled please drizzle the top with the syrup in criss crossed fashion over the top. You don't have to drench it, it's for decoration. Quickly serve, it's best when it's just a little warm.

Description: 
I never thought this combination would work well. However, I had raves from people who don't drink alcohol. This is a good flavor in the chocolate.
