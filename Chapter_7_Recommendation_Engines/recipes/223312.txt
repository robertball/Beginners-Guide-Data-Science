Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, room temperature
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread, such as Nutella®
1/2 cup chopped toasted hazelnuts
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.
Combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Mix with a whisk to break up any lumps.
Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time until completely incorporated. Mix in vanilla and chocolate-hazelnut spread.
Slowly add in flour mixture and stir just until combined. Fold in chopped hazelnuts and chocolate chips. Drop the dough onto prepared baking sheet by tablespoons or with a cookie scoop.
Bake in preheated oven until edges look dry and cookies are fragrant, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool for 1 minute on baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack.
