Ingredients:
2 tablespoons barbeque seasoning (such as KC MasterpieceÂ®), or to taste
2 pounds beef tips, trimmed
1 pound bacon, strips cut in half
toothpicks

Directions:
Rub barbeque seasoning into beef tips until meat has an orange hue, 3 to 5 minutes. Cut beef into 1-inch cubes.
Wrap each beef cube in a bacon slice and secure bacon slice with a toothpick.
Heat a skillet over medium-heat. Working in batches, cook wrapped beef tips in hot skillet until beef is browned all over and bacon is crispy, 5 to 10 minutes.
