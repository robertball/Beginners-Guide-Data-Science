Ingredients:
1	cup Basmati or any other long grained rice
1	tablespoon butter or 1 teaspoon oil
½	to ¾ teaspoon lime zest
¼ 	to 1/3 cup fresh lime juice
¼ 	to ½ teaspoon sugar
3	tablespoons fresh chopped cilantro (I used 4)
¼ 	teaspoon salt

Directions:
1.	In a skillet, in low heat, add the butter/oil along with rice and sugar. Let the rice get coated with the oil. Once the rice gets aromatic add juice of 1 lime. Stir for a minute.
2.	Add 2 cups of water and 1/8 to ¼ cup lime juice - cover and cook for about 10-15 minutes
3.	Check to see if the rice has absorbed all the water. ( Note: Some people like to cook Basmati with 1 cup water. For me 2 cups works well since I find that 1 cup gives a crunchy grain and is not completely cooked.)
.
4.	Stir it lightly and add chopped cilantro. You can add more if you like. Taste and add more lime juice if required. Remove from flame, fluff the rice lightly and let it sit for 1-2 minutes with the lid on.
