1/3 cup bouillon granules

Description: 
Many recipes here call for a packet of dry onion soup mix.  Due to MSG allergies, I cannot use commercially available mixes.  So here is a homemade version.  One third of a cup is equivalent to one commercial packet.  Make sure that the bouillon used is MSG free if you have allergies.
