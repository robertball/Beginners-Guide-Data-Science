Description: 
This salad is so easy to make you won't believe how good it tastes! I usually serve it with sandwiches and an ice-cold drink for a light, warm-weather meal. The soft, crisp green of the cucumber complements the brilliant whites and reds of the radishes, making a very pretty, creamy salad.
