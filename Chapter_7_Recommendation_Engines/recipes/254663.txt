Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups chopped Swiss chard
1 cup bread crumbs, or more as needed
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons canola oil, or as needed

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add Swiss chard; cook and stir until wilted, about 5 minutes. Transfer chard to a colander and let cool, about 5 minutes. Press out as much moisture as possible.
Mix chard, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Stir in beaten egg until combined. Shape into 1/2-inch thick patties.
Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in hot oil until browned, about 3 minutes per side.
