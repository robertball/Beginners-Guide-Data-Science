Ingredients:
1/2 medium sweet potato
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 flour tortilla
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Poke holes into the sweet potato and microwave on high until soft throughout when poked with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool before peeling, at least 10 minutes.
Peel sweet potato and mash flesh in a bowl. Stir in pecans and nutmeg. Spread mixture over half of the tortilla. Sprinkle onion and feta cheese over the filling.
Fold tortilla in half and press edges together to prevent filling from spilling out.
Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook quesadilla until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and cut into wedges.
