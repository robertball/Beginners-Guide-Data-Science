Ingredients:
4 1/2 sheets of salted matzo
1 cup margarine
1 cup dark brown sugar
8 ounces chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9-inch baking dish.
Cover the bottom of the prepared dish with matzohs, breaking and fitting pieces into spaces as needed.
Cook the margarine and brown sugar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat until the mixture is well combined and bubbling, about 3 minutes; pour over the matzohs in the baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the syrup is thickened and bubbling, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle evenly with chocolate chips. Let the candy stand for 5 minutes to melt the chocolate, then spread the melted chocolate evenly over the candy with a spatula. Cool completely and break into pieces to serve.
