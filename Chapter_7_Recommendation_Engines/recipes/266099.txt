Ingredients:
2 cups mango chunks
3 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon lime zest
2 large eggs
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Combine mango, lime juice, and lime zest in the bowl of a food processor. Process until pureed. Add eggs, salt, and nutmeg; process 15 seconds longer.
Combine sugar and butter in a bowl. Add to mango mixture in the food processor. Process until smooth.
Transfer mixture to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave at 50% power for 2 minutes; stir with a whisk. Heat in the microwave for 2 minutes more; whisk again. Continue heating and whisking until the mixture achieves a pudding-like consistency, 6 to 10 minutes total. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a super-easy curd recipe that doesn't require straining, thermometers, boiling water, or anything else difficult. The food processor step and the low microwave settings do this for you! I use this as a filling in coconut-lime cupcakes with coconut-cream cheese frosting. Also fabulous by itself!
