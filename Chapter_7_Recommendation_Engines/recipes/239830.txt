Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 white onion, halved and sliced into 1/2-inch rings
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup lentils
1/2 cup water
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 bay leaf
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Heat oil in a heavy pan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until beginning to turn golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add minced garlic to onion; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
Mix chicken broth, lentils, 1/2 cup water, crushed garlic, coriander, salt, cumin, chili powder, ginger, cinnamon, turmeric, cinnamon, cloves, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Cover pan, lower heat to medium-low, and simmer until lentils are soft, about 35 minutes.
Place spinach in a microwave-safe bowl and add 1/4 cup water; heat in microwave for 5 minutes. Stir spinach and continue cooking in microwave until heated through, about 5 minutes more. Let spinach cool, about 5 minutes; drain water and squeeze excess water from spinach.
Mix spinach into lentils; cover pan and simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes.
