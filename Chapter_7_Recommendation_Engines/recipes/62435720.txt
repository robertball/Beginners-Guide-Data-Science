Ingredients:
2 (29oz.) cans of peaches, juice reserved.
1 cup juice from canned peaches
1/3 cup white sugar
1 Tbsp. molasses
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 tsp allspice
1 (18.25 ounce) package pineapple cake mix
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread peach slices evenly into a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a small bowl combine the cup of peach juice, sugar and molasses ( I warm it in the microwave to melt the sugar a bit).
Pour this over the peaches.
Sprinkle cinnamon and allspice over peach slices.
In a large bowl cut the cream cheese into the dry cake mix with a pastry cutter (a knife and fork will work, too) until it resembles little crumbles.
Sprinkle evenly over top of the peaches.
Tap the bottom of the pan on the counter to help the mix to "settle in"
Bake in preheated oven for one hour,until golden.

Description: 
This is my variation of this recipe. I wanted to make/review it but made so many changes that I decided to make my own custom recipe. The cream cheese really puts this over the top!Modified from: Easy Peach Cobbler with Cake Mix
