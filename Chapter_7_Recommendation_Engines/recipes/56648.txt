Ingredients:
4 baking potatoes, scrubbed
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, diced
1 cup condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place potatoes directly on the oven rack, and bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until tender.
While the potatoes are baking, place ground beef and onion in a large skillet, and cook over medium-high heat until evenly browned. Drain grease, then stir in the soup and garlic powder. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat through until bubbly, then set aside and wait for the potatoes.
When the potatoes are ready, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the potatoes into a 9x13 inch baking dish, and split them in half lengthwise. Break up the centers of the potatoes with a fork, then pour the ground beef mixture over the top. Sprinkle with shredded cheese.
Bake for 10  to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted.

Description: 
These baked potatoes are covered in a hamburger gravy, and topped with shredded cheese. Use your favorite kind of cheese if you do not care for Cheddar. You can reduce cooking time by baking potatoes in the microwave, but it just isn't the same.
