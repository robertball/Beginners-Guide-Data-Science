Ingredients:
1/3 cup of unpopped popcorn
3 tablespoons of oil
3 tablespoons of melted butter.
1/8 teaspoons of GOYA Adobo seasoning, HOT Con Pique/Picante

Directions:
Put 3 tablespoons of oil in a 3 quart sauce pan, On med-high.
add 1/3 cup of unpopped corn, and cover
if you keep the lid slightly ajar this allows the moisture to excape when the corn is popping, and makes for a fluffy popcorn, and not chewy.
shake pan from time to time.
when popping of the popcorn starts to slow down, take pan off the heat.
pour popcorn into a 4 quart bowl, pour butter over popcorn, and toss, sprinkle Adobo spice on popcorn, toss popcorn to mix seasoning.
Add more seasoning if desired.

Description: 
Popcorn A family snack favorite, I remember mom popping some popcorn on a night the whole family was crowded around the radio, and later the black and white TV. We did not have microwaves at the time and yes we used the stove and a steal sauce pot. This is a take on buttered popcorn, but with a touch of spice. enjoy.
