Heat the oil in a large pot or a karahi.
Add the chicken pieces and cook on a high flame until the chicken is slightly browned.
Add the salt, cumin, red chilli, turmeric, ginger and garlic paste and water and cook for half a minute.
Quickly add the tomatoes and green chillies and mix ingredients together.
Cover the pot or karahi and cook on a low flame for half an hour or until the chicken is completely cooked.

Description: 
This dish gets its name from a 'karahi', which is a flat open pot used in a lot of Pakistani and Indian cooking. In spite of its name, this recipe can be made in any pot. My mom came up with this recipe; it's a little spicy (by Pakistani standards), but simple and foolproof.
