Ingredients:
1 lb. your favorite sausage
1 cup diced fresh pumpkin
1 small onion chopped
¼ cup diced sundried tomatoes
3 cups diced artisan bread
2 cups shredded sharp cheddar
1 cup shredded gruyere
3 cups diced artisan bread
1 tsp cracked pepper
1 tsp. kosher salt
1 cup whole milk
2 cups cream
5 eggs
soft butter for pans

Directions:
In a large sauté pan, brown sausage, onion, pumpkin, and sundried tomatoes, then set aside.  Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees.  In a large mixing bowl, combine sausage and pumpkin mixture, bread, milk, cream, seasonings, cheese, and eggs.  Butter either a 9 x 13 baking dish or 2 large muffin tins (6 each) to make 12 large muffin sized bread puddings.  Spread pudding into your pan of choice and bake uncovered for 30-45 minutes until the pudding is puffed and golden.  Reduce cooking time by half, if using muffin tins.  Enjoy hot!
