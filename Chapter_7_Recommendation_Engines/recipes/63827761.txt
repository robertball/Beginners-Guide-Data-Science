Ingredients:
2 delicata squashes adding up to 1.75lbs
.75lbs radicchio, chopped
.5lbs Belgian endive, chopped
16oz can chickpeas, drained
12 dry-roasted cloves garlic, peeled
3c cooked wheatberries
olive oil
garlic mill
salt
savory
thyme
marjoram
parsley
rosemary

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Quarter the delicata squashes longways.  Scoop out the seeds.  Slice the squashes wide-ways very thinly: 1/8" or (preferably) less.
Place the squash in a large casserole pan.  Toss with just enough olive oil to coat the pan and the squash but leave little excess.  Place in the oven for ten minutes.
Remove from oven and add in endive and radicchio, adding extra olive oil if needed.  Season with garlic, salt, and all herbs to taste.  Stir.  Replace in oven for about 20 minutes or until all is well-cooked.
Remove from oven and pour into a large bowl.  Mix in wheatberries, chickpeas, and garlic.  Re-season to taste.
