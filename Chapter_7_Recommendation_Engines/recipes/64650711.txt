Ingredients:
3 or 4 ripe tomatoes, any variety
A handful of fresh herbs: I use a combination of basil, tarragon, rosemary, flat-leaf parsley, chives, thyme, oregano and sage
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt and freshly ground black pepper
Extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Slice the tomatoes as thinly as possible using a good serrated knife.
Chop the herbs as finely as you like and mix in the garlic to combine.
Drizzle olive oil generously on the surface of the plate you'll be serving this on, then scatter half of the herbs and garlic evenly over it. Arrange the slices of tomato however you like in one layer, overlapping if you like. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then sprinkle on the rest of the fresh herb and garlic mixture then drizzle once again with olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let the flavors marry at room temperature for several hours, even overnight. Serve as an appetizer on slices of Everyday White Bread (recipe available here on Allrecipes.com) or your favorite hearty loaf.
