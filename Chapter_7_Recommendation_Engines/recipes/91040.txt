1 teaspoon Gebhardt速 Chili Powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper
2 tablespoons honey

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Mix chili powder, garlic powder, allspice, cumin, salt, red pepper, honey and water in small bowl until well blended; set aside.
Remove neck and giblets from body and neck cavities of turkey; discard or refrigerate for another use.  Drain juices from turkey; dry turkey with paper towels.  Turn wings back to hold neck skin against back of turkey.
Place turkey, breast up, on flat roasting rack in roasting pan about 3 inches deep.  Brush turkey with oil.  Roast turkey 3 to 3-1/2 hours, covering breast and top of drumsticks loosely with foil after 2 hours to prevent overcooking of breast.
Uncover turkey breast and brush turkey with honey-spice mixture when about 45 minutes of cook time remains.  Return foil to top of turkey and continue roasting until meat thermometer inserted deep in thigh reaches 180 degrees F.   Let turkey stand 15 minutes before carving.
