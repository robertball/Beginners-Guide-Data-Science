Ingredients:
2/3 cup chopped fresh pineapple
1/2 cup sliced carrot
1 teaspoon water
2/3 cup almond milk
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon chopped walnuts

Directions:
Combine pineapple, carrot, and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in the microwave until carrots and pineapple are partially softened, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir almond milk, oats, cinnamon, and ginger into the bowl. Cook in the microwave for 1 minute. Stir. Continue microwaving in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until oats are tender, 1 to 2 minutes more. Top with walnuts.

Description: 
This idea came to me one morning as I had steamed carrots followed by a bowl of oats topped with pineapple and walnuts... I immediately wished I had combined the two and added a few more spices from some delicious desserts. Thus, this oatmeal was born.
