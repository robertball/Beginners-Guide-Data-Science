Description: 
As a Canadian, growing up in Toronto's Little Italy, this soup was always on someones stovetop somewhere in the fall and winter months. Pasta, beans, and a thick broth, sprinkled with parm or romano, and served with fresh crusty italian bread, what's not to love. i spent a lot of time, back in the day, in the cucina with my friends and their mothers learning the basics of good italian food! mmm mmmmmm mm......:)
