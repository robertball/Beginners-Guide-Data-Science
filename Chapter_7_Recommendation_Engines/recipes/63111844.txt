Ingredients:
2 4-5 oz. Lobster Tails
1 Tbsp Butter
1 Tbsp Miracle Whip (or mayo)
2 Tbsp Shredded Parmesan
1/2 tsp. Paprika
Fresh Lemon

Directions:
Prep lobster tails by cutting off feet and membrane on bottom side of tail. Once removed, run a knife along the top inside of the tail to loosen the meat from the shell for easier removal when lobster is served. Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Make a boat out of foil just wide enough to hold lobster tail upright. Boat should have 1/2" to 1" sides. Cut a small wedge of lemon and squeeze some juice in between the meat and top side of shell where you just loosened. Set lobster in foil boat with belly side up and tail upright. Squeeze some lemon juice over lobster meat. Melt butter in a small microwave safe bowl- about 30 seconds. To melted butter add Miracle whip, shredded Parmesan, paprika, and lemon juice to taste. Mix well. Spoon on top of lobster tails, making sure to cover all the meat. Place lobster boats into an 8"x8" glass baking dish. Fill dish with water about 1/2" deep. Be careful not to get water into lobster boats. If you like, place used lemon wedges in the water. Bake lobster at 375 for 10 minutes. Then set oven to Hi Broil and broil for 2 minutes. Then broil for an additional 1-2 minutes with oven door cracked open. This helps brown the tops. Serve and enjoy!
