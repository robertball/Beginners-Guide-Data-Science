Ingredients:
1 box of your favorite brownie mix
1 fun size bag of milky ways
1 tbsp butter
1 tbsp milk

Directions:
Follow the directions of the brownie mix you have chosen.
While the brownies are cooking away in your oven, put the unwrapped milky ways in a sauce pan on very low heat, followed by the butter. After the candy and the butter have melted, add the milk. Stir every few minutes so the chocolate doesn't burn. Leave on the burner until the brownies have finished. Once you take the brownies out of the oven, let cool about 5 minutes, and spoon the milky way sauce ontop. let cool, cut, and ENJOY!
