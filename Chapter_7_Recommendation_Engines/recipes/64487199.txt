Ingredients:
1 T finely granted parmesan cheese
1-1/2 c milk
1-3/4 T butter
2-1/4 T all purpose flour (the amt of flour determines how thick sauce will  be)
1/4 t salt
1/8 freshly ground pepper (about 3 turns on grinder)
1/2 pinch nutmeg
1/2 pinch cajun seasoning
3 large egg yolks
4 large egg whites
1/2 c gruyere or swiss or even cheddar or monteray jack, packed coarsely, shredded
1/8 t creme of tartar

Directions:
Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 375 degrees
Heavy butter souffle dish
Add parmesan cheese and tilt dish, coating bottom and sides
warm milk in heavy saucepan over medium heat until steaming
Melt butter in heavy saucepan over medium heat
Add flour and whisk until mixture begins to foam and loses raw taste, about three minutes, do  not allow to brown
remove from heat, let stand
pour in warm milk to butter and flour mixture, whisking constantly until very thick, 2 to 3 minutes - make sure it has boiled for 1 minute
take off heat, clean off the sides of pan, always make sure you cover with butter or a piece of clear film, so it does not form a crust
cool a little but not too much
separate eggs, always use an extra bowl to crack them into
using an electric mixture, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry - always turn the bowl on it's side to get even mixing, and use whites only at room temperature, if too cold, add a little warm water and let them heat up
when they are foaming add 1/8 t creme of tartar - they should have a velvety look to them, if you over beat, you can add one more egg white and whip again
fold 1/4 of the egg whites into souffle base and stir
move to one side all the souffle base, then add the egg whites into the space and fold until incorporated
when almost incorporated, add all but 2T of cheese - you add that when it is 3/4 cooked
transfer to baking dish
run your spatula about 1 inch in at the top just to score and adds a top when cooked
if using small dishes, wrap a greased foil collar around dish, just to keep the souffle in place
set timer for 30 minutes and then check how it is going, do not open oven before that - it will jiggle, not done
after 40 minutes check, top with cheese
insert a stick, stick must come out clean
serve immediately
if doing individual ramekins bake for 15-17 minutes
