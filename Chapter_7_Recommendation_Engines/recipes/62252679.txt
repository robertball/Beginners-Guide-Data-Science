Ingredients:
Ingredients
2 packages (1/4 ounce each) active dry yeast
1 teaspoon plus 6 tablespoons sugar, divided
1 cup warm water (110° to 115°), divided
1 cup warm milk (110° to 115°)
2 teaspoons salt
1 egg
2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons canola oil
5-1/2 to 6 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons butter, melted, optional

Directions:
•In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/2 cup warm
water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add the milk, salt, egg, oil and
remaining sugar and water. Gradually add 2 cups flour; beat until
smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.
•Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about
6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.
•Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in
half. Roll out each piece to 1/3-in. or 1/2-in. thickness. Cut with
a floured 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Brush with butter if desired.
•Using the dull edge of a table knife, make an off-center crease in
each roll. Fold along crease so the large half is on top; press along folded edge. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Cover
and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
•Bake at 375° for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from
pans to wire racks to cool. Yield: 2-1/2 dozen.
