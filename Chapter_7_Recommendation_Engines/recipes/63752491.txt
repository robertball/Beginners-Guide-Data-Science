Ingredients:
Sauce:
1/4 cup olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 large onion, chopped
2 tsp. dried oregano
1 tsp. red pepper flakes
2 tsp. salt (or less)
1 tsp. black pepper
3 tsp. dried parsley
3/4 cup heavy red wine
3/4 cup water
1 large can whole tomatoes
1 15 oz. can tomato sauce with garlic, etc
1 10 oz. can tomato puree
1 large can tomato paste
1 cup ketchup, yes ketchup!
Meatballs
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
2 big cloves garlic minced
1 onion chopped
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. fresh ground pepper
1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes
2 tsp. oregano
3 tsp. dried parsley
2 eggs
4 slices white bread, drenched in water, then squeezed

Directions:
For the sauce, heat the olive oil in a large heavy dutch oven type pan over medium heat, add onions and garlic and saute until transparent. Add all the sauce spices and dried herbs, stir and cook for a few minutes while you open all the cans to add to the sauce!
Now add all of the red stuff; smash the whole tomatoes in your fists (the fun part), add the tomato sauce, tomato puree, tomato paste and the ketchup. Stir it all up, then add the red wine and water. Bring the mixture to a gradual boil while you make the meatballs. (Or you can meatballs before, if you an inefficient person.)
For the meatballs, GENTLY mix all the ingredients in order in a large bowl. Seriously, keep your wrists and fingers very loose while you're doing this. Do not work hard. Then, still with loose wrists, GENTLY form the meatballs into 1 1/2 to 2 inch balls. Big balls!
When your sauce is bubbling (more like burping) start adding the meatballs. I add them around the exterior of the pot first because it's easier to fit them all in there that way.
After you fit them all in, turn down the heat to low and cook for 2-4 hours. We like this served over vermicelli, but any pasta will do as long as you give it a drizzle of olive oil.
