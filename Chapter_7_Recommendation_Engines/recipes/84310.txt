1 teaspoon crushed dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 pinch black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil

1 cup fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese with basil and sun-dried tomatoes

Directions:
In a small bowl, stir together rosemary, basil, garlic, and pepper.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip pork chops in lemon juice, and sprinkle both sides with herb mixture. Place pork chops in skillet, and sear both sides, about 7 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low. Sprinkle feta on top of chops; cover skillet, and cook until cheese begins to melt, about 5 minutes.
