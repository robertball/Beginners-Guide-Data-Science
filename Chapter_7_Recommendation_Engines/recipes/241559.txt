Ingredients:
3 cups peeled and cubed butternut squash
2  carrots, peeled and cut 1-inch pieces
1 large parsnip, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 small sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 small red onion, cut into 1-inch wedges
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
½ teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
¼ teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
½ cup low-sodium chicken broth
¼ cup white wine
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard

Directions:
Place an 11x17-inch baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Combine butternut squash, carrots, parsnip, sweet potato, and red onion in a large bowl; add 2 tablespoons olive oil, rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and stir to coat. Spread vegetable mixture in a single layer onto the warmed baking sheet from the oven.
Roast vegetables in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; stir and continue roasting until tender, about 15 minutes more.
Pound chicken to 1/2-inch thickness on a work surface; season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper to taste.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a bowl.
Pour chicken broth and wine into the same skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, about 2 minutes.
Stir honey and mustard into wine mixture; add chicken and turn pieces until coated. Serve chicken alongside roasted vegetables.
