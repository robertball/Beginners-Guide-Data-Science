Ingredients:
50 ml (2 fl oz) red wine
50 ml (2 fl oz) ruby port
300g (11 oz) fresh cherries without stones
1 pinch of five-spice powder
2 pinches of freshly ground (ready-ground also works, if best quality) cinnamon
1 pinch each of Sea salt and freshly milled black pepper

Directions:
In a medium-sized saucepan, on a high heat, boil the red wine and port until reduced by half (this removes the alcohol).
Add in the rest of the ingredients, return to the boil, then lower the temperature and just simmer for 2 or 3 minutes.
Remove 20 or so of the cherries and set aside.
Pour the contents of the pan into a blender and blend for 2 minutes.
Strain through a fine sieve and into a small saucepan.
Add the set-aside cherries to the sauce.
Taste and adjust seasoning if required.
