Ingredients:
2 cups Swanson® Beef Broth or Swanson® 50% Less Sodium Beef Broth
1/4 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons Jamaican jerk seasoning
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 pounds boneless beef top loin or beef sirloin steak
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro leaves

Directions:
Stir the broth, oil, seasoning, vinegar and garlic in a 2-quart shallow, nonmetallic dish or resealable gallon-size plastic bag. Add the steak and turn it over to coat with the marinade. Cover the dish or seal the plastic bag and refrigerate it for 8 hours, turning the steak over a few times while it's marinating.
Lightly oil the grill rack and heat the grill to medium. Remove the steak from the marinade and pour the marinade in a 1-quart saucepan.
Heat the marinade over medium-high heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and cilantro. Keep warm.
Grill the steak for 28 minutes for medium-rare or to desired doneness. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve the lemon-cilantro sauce with the steak.
