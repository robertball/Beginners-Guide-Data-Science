Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup lard
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 teaspoon vinegar

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Use a pastry blender to cut in the lard, until it resembles small peas. Using a fork, lightly stir in the egg and vinegar. If the dough does not stick together enough to pull away from the sides of the bowl, stir in a little cold water, about 1 teaspoon at a time. Form dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.

Description: 
My mother-in-law gave me this recipe.  She always used lard and I found it easier to work with than vegetable shortening.
