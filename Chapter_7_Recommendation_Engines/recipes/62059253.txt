Ingredients:
2 cups whipping cream (1 pint)
2 cups milk (I used skim)
1 1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla

Directions:
1.pour everything into a shallow dish, I used a huge tupperware thing with wide bottom.
2. Mix together with egg beaters on low speed until sugar is mostly dissolved and the top appear foamy.
3. Stir so foam is mixed in.
4. Cover with plastic wrap or a cover that goes with the container.
5. Put in your freezer for 4-5 hours.
**Very good with my eggless cookie dough (made for ice cream) see recipe.

It isn't your regular ice cream, it's a little different, I think it's better! You can just use a plain old freezer!! Make it any flavor you want.
