Ingredients:
Cake:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsps baking soda
3/4 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
4 eggs, room temperature
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp almond extract
2/3 cup sour cream
1/3 cup amaretto
Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tsps amaretto
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp almond extract
1/8 tsp salt
3-4 tbsps heavy cream
Sliced almonds (optional)

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a 10-inch bundt or tube pan.
2.  In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
3. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, 1 at time, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract, almond extract, and sour cream. On low speed, mix in half of the dry ingredients until just combined. Pour in amaretto, and mix gently. Add in remaining dry ingredients, and mix until just combined. Batter will be somewhat thick.
4. Pour batter evenly into prepared bundt or tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 55-60 minutes, or until a bamboo skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow cake to cool 10 minutes in the pan, then removed to a cooling rack to cool completely.
5. To make glaze: whisk powdered sugar, amaretto, vanilla extract, almond extract, salt, and heavy cream together until smooth. If glaze is too thick, add additional heavy cream until desired consistency is reached.
6. Pour glaze over cooled cake, and top with sliced almonds and sprinkling of ground cinnamon, if desired.
