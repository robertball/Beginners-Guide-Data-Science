Ingredients:
1 can whole cranberry sauce
2 green onions
1 jalapeno pepper
3 serrano peppers
½ small white onion
Juice of one lime
Crackers, for serving

Directions:
If you've got a blender or food processor, toss your onions and peppers in there to be chopped. If not, you'll want to chop everything up so it's pretty small.* Put everything into a bowl, combine with the cranberry sauce, and mix well. Once you've got everything nice and combined, squeeze the lime juice over the mixture and mix. Stick this in the fridge for an hour or longer—it tastes better the longer it has to sit. It's super good the next day.
