Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1 cup peanut butter
1 small egg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.  Cream together all three ingredients.  Form into 1" balls (can roll in suga here if desired, but I don't), place on greased cookie sheet, and press with a fork to make a criss crossed design.  Cann add a Hershey Kiss here if desired.  Bake at 350F for 8-10 minutes.

Description: 
Three ingredients are all you need for this yummie, easy to make recipe.  I used to make these with my mom and brothers when we were younger, and it has always been a family favorite.  Add sugar or Hershey's Kisses on top before baking for extra goodness. :)
