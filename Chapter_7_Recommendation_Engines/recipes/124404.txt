Description: 
I LOVE harvesttime and being able to cook with all the fresh produce gathered from gardens and groves.    Since there's so much of everything, I try to be creative by enhancing old recipes with slight variations. That's what happened with these baked apples. The spices and touch of orange make the flavor just perfect!                                                          --Lorraine Chausse                                                               Cornwall, Ontario
