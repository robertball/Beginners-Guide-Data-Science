Ingredients:
3 1/2 pounds boneless beef chuck roast
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic
3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
6 potatoes, quartered
1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
1 pound fresh mushrooms, quartered
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chuck roast in a 9x13 inch baking dish with high sides. Roast for 1 hour in preheated oven. Spoon off any fat that has accumulated.
Combine the 2 cans of mushroom soup and the chives in a large bowl. Remove roast from oven, and scatter the potatoes, carrots, and mushrooms around the roast. Pour the soup mixture over the meat and vegetables. Cover with aluminum foil.
Return the baking dish to the oven to roast for 2 additional hours. Uncover, and sprinkle with the grated Cheddar cheese. Return to the oven until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is one of those add and subtract bakes. Put in what you like and take out what you don't, but I think you will like the overall taste. This is a guideline recipe. I add and subtract every time I make it depending on what's in the house. This is the meal to make when you need beef, carbs, and good stuff.
