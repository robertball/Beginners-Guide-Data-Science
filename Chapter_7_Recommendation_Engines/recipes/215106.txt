Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 large onion, chopped
1 turkey liver, chopped
1 (1 pound) loaf challah bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
salt to taste
2 eggs, lightly beaten

Directions:
Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the liver; cook and stir until the liver is evenly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat, and cool until just warm.
Place challah bread in a large bowl. Toss with the onion and liver mixture, squeezing lightly to distribute any liquid. Stir in the beaten eggs, and season with salt.

Description: 
A family recipe that came from my Grandpa Joe. He was a butcher and carved the Thanksgiving turkey every year that I can remember, always to perfection! This fills a 15-pound turkey perfectly.
