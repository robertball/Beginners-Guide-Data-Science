Ingredients:
4 pounds pink salmon (such as Chicken of the Sea®), drained, flaked and cartilage removed
4 large eggs
1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs
3/4 cup mayonnaise
2 lemons, juiced
2 tablespoons ranch dressing mix
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

1 teaspoon dried dill
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
1/2 cup white cornmeal
1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed
16 lemon slices
16 sprigs fresh parsley

Directions:
Mix salmon, eggs, bread crumbs, mayonnaise, lemon juice, ranch dressing mix, salt, pepper, garlic powder, dill, and seafood seasoning in a large bowl; divide into 15 portions and shape into patties. Dust each patty with cornmeal.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet. Fry a few patties in hot oil, not overcrowding the skillet, until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat until all patties are cooked. Garnish each with a lemon slice and a sprig of parsley.
