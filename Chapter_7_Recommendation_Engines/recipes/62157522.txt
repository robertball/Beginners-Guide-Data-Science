Ingredients:
1.5 c all-purpose flour
.5 whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon cinnamon
.25 c chopped pecans
.5 c applesauce
1 c white sugar
2 eggs
1.5 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 ripe bananas, mashed
1.5 small baking apples, chopped or shredded

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9x5 inch pan.
2. Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and pecans in one bowl.
3. In a second bowl, cream applesauce and sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs and vanilla, then bananas and apples. Add flour mixture, stirring just until combined.
4. Pour into prepared pan and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 hour (or until toothpick comes out clean). Covering the bread with tinfoil ~45 minutes into baking helps the bread bake evenly. Remove from pan and let cool.  Store in refrigerator or freeze.

Description: 
This is a moist and flavorful bread that is fairly healthy.  I like to eat it toasted with peanut butter.
