Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup lime juice
1/2 cup tequila
2 garlic cloves; minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon chile powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 lb. raw, peeled and deveined medium shrimp
10 flour tortillas
3 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 large bell pepper; cut into strips
1 large onion; cut into strips
Fresh lime wedges

Directions:
Combine 1/2 cup oil, lime juice, tequila, garlic, salt, chili powder, and cumin. Blend well. Add shrimp, cover, and marinate in refrigerator about 20 - 30 minutes. Do NOT marinate for longer or the lime will "cook" the shrimp. Drain, set aside.
Wrap tortillas in aluminum foil. Bake 15 minutes while preparing fajitas.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper and onion and cook about 2- 3 minutes. Add shrimp and stir for 2 minutes more. Shrimp is done when it turns bright pink.
Spoon mixture on a plate and garnish with fresh lime wedges.
