Ingredients:
4 cups cooked basmati rice
1/4 cup lower-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided
1 pound pork, cut into quarter inch cubes (use what you have! Pork butt, pork shoulder, pork chops... I've made this with leftover Easter ham)
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups chopped red bell pepper
1 cup frozen shelled edamame
2/3 cup thinly sliced green onions,

Directions:
Cook rice according to package directions.
Combine soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, and hoisin in a bowl. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil; swirl to coat. Add pork to pan in a single layer; cook 2 minutes, without stirring (unless using cooked ham). Stir-fry pork for 4 minutes or until done. Add pork to soy sauce mixture; toss to coat.
Add egg to pan; cook 45 seconds or until set. Remove egg from pan; cut into bite-sized pieces.
Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add bell pepper, edamame, and 1/2 cup onions; stir-fry 1 minute. Add rice; stir-fry 2 minutes. Add pork and soy sauce mixture; cook 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Top rice mixture with egg and remaining onions.
