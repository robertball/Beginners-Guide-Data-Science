Ingredients:
3/4 stick of butter, melted
1/4 c. brown sugar, loosely packed
4 medium-sized ripe bananas, smashed
1 (3.5oz) container of banana baby food (I used Gerber)
2 c. flour
1 tsp. baking soda
pinch (1/8 tsp.) of salt
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
In a medium bowl, mix flour, baking soda, and salt.
In a large bowl, whisk together butter, brown sugar, and baby food.
Fold the flour mixture into the liquids, 1/2 cup at a time.
Fold in eggs and bananas just enough to moisten.
Pour into a greased loaf pan, and bake for 45-55 minutes, until top is deep brown, and a toothpick inserted in to the loaf comes out clean.
