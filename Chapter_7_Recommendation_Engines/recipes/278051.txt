Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
4 medium red potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/3 cup diced yellow onion
3 tablespoons truffle oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a glass baking dish with cooking spray.
Combine potatoes, onion, truffle oil, and parsley in the prepared baking dish; stir to coat potatoes with oil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Stir, and continue to bake, stirring every 10 minutes, until crispy, 20 to 30 minutes longer.
Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bake until melted, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
The truffle oil tastes amazing with these simple cheesy potatoes. My mom bought me some truffle oil at a farmers' market and I came up with this recipe to use it. You can substitute vegetable oil, and still enjoy the parsley and Parmesan combination.
