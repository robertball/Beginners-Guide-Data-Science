Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
¼ pound bacon, diced
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
5  plum tomatoes, seeded and cut into eighths
2 cloves garlic, minced
½ cup chicken stock
⅓ cup balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon anchovy paste
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir bacon until softened, but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add cauliflower and continue to cook until cauliflower is lightly browned, stirring frequently, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir tomatoes and garlic into cauliflower mixture, cooking for 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken stock, balsamic vinegar, sugar, and anchovy paste and mix.
Cover skillet and reduce heat to low; simmer until cauliflower is tender, about 5 minutes more. Remove lid and increase heat to medium-high. Continue cooking until liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with parsley to serve.

This is a side-dish, but can also be made in the main dish by adding noodles or rice. Be careful on the amount of salt that is added because bacon can be very salty.
