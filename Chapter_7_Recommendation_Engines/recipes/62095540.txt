Grilled Veggie Salsa Recipe

Ingredients:
3 whole tomatoes (can also use a few dozen cherry tomatoes--place on skewers to grill)
2 cloves garlic
1 onion (red is great in spicy version, vidalia makes a sweeter salsa)
2-3 jalepenos
2 ears of corn
1 lime
cilantro to taste
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium high. Brush and oil grate.
Cut onion in quarters, leaving root end on. Place garlic cloves and (if used) cherry tomatoes on skewers.
Place tomatoes, garlic, onion, jalapenos, and corn on grill. Turn every few minutes so all sides get cooked--smaller veggies will cook faster, pull them off and put them in a bowl as they finish. It's OK if skins get a little crisy, or if the tomato skins crack and leak a little.
When all veggies are grilled, allow them to cool. Then remove skin from onions and garlic, and remove any excessively burned parts from other veggies. Veggies can be prepared in advance to this point and left in fridge until ready to make salsa.
When ready, place tomatoes, garlic, onions, and jalapeno in food processor. Cut into appropriate size pieces. Remove or leave in jalapeno seeds to adjust the heat level. Pulse several times to achieve small chunks--do not puree.
Add cilantro leaves and pulse one more time. Spoon out into bowl. Add juice from lime, and salt and pepper.
Slice kernels off of corn and add to bowl. Adjust seasoning to taste and serve with tortilla chips.
