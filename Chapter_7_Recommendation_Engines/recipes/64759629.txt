Ingredients:
6 sugar cones
1/4 cup white chocolate chips
1/4 cup finely chopped candied ginger
2 cups assorted fruit

Directions:
1. Wrap 1 sugar cone in a paper towel and place in microwave. Microwave on high for 15 seconds, or until the sugar cone is soft and pliable. Working quickly and carefully, shape the end of the cone upwards into a cornucopia shape and hold it there until the cone re-hardens, about 20-30 seconds. Repeat this process with each cone.
2. Place white chocolate into a microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds, or until chocolate is melted, stirring often. Place the candied ginger in a small wide bowl. Take one of the shaped cones and dip the top of the cone into the melted chocolate, and then into the candied ginger. Set cones on a wire rack to allow the chocolate to set.
3. Fill each cone with the fruit. Place the cones on a serving platter and sprinkle any extra fruit around the cones.

Description: 
Sugar cones shaped like cornucopias make for a festive treat! I like to dip them in white chocolate and candied ginger, but you could dip them in sprinkles, candies, nuts, you name it! And you can fill them with any kind of fruit (fresh or dried), berries, candies, nuts---the possibilities are endless!
