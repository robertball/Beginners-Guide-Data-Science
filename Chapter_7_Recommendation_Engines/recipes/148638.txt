Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
3 green onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 (15 ounce) cans green beans, drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes
1 pinch dried basil
1 pinch dried oregano
1/4 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove from the pan to drain on paper towels. Reserve the grease in the skillet and add the onions; cook and stir over medium heat until softened. Add garlic and cook for about 30 seconds more. Remove from the heat.
In a saucepan, combine the green beans, tomatoes, basil, oregano and brown sugar. Crumble in the bacon and add the onion and garlic from the skillet. Warm over medium heat until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
