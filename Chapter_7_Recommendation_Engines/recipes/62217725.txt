Ingredients:
1 cup cornmeal
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 egg
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup fresh or thawed frozen corn
Vegetable oil

Directions:
Start heating the griddle to about medium heat.
Place the cornmeal, baking powder, salt, egg and water into a bowl and stir to combine. Once mixed, stir in the corn. The mixture should be the consistency of pancake batter.
Brush the lid or griddle with vegetable oil until shimmering. Pour enough batter onto the lid or griddle to form a 4 inch round, approximately 2 tablespoons. Depending on the size of your griddle or lid, you can cook more than 1 cake at a time.
Cook until brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve immediately or transfer to a warm (200 degree F) oven until all of the cakes are done.
