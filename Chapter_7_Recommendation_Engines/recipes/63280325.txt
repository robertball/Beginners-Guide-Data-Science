Ingredients:
Flank Steak:
4 cloves garlic, peeled and pressed through garlic press
2 tsp chili powder
3 tsp brown sugar
1/2 tsp cumin
2 tsp pepper
2 tsp kosher salt
1 tbsp olive oil
1 2-lb flank steak
Chipotle-Tomatillo Salsa:
4 cloves garlic, peeled
1/2 lb tomatillos, husked, stems cut off and halved
2 canned chipotles en adobo (remove seeds if you don't want it too hot)
1 tbsp olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
For steak:
Mix together garlic, chili powder, brown sugar, cumin, pepper and salt until blended. Spread a heavy coating over both sides of the steak. If time allows, refrigerate steak 4-8 hours. Or at room-temperature for 1 hour if in a time crunch.
Heat one side of a gas grill to medium-high. Or use a grill pan over the stove top or charcoal grill. Lightly spray or brush steak with oil. Lay steak on hot part of grill, cover and cook 5 minutes. Flip, cover and cook 5 minutes. Move steak to cooler part of grill, cover and cook 2-5 minutes until steak reaches desired doneness. Let rest 15 minutes. Slice thinly against the grain and serve with chipotle-tomatillo salsa.
For salsa:
Preheat oven to 400. Spread garlic and tomatillos on baking sheet, drizzle lightly with oil and roast 10-15 minutes until soft.
Scoop garlic and tomatillos into food processor or blender, along with chiles and olive oil. Pour into a serving dish and let cool.
