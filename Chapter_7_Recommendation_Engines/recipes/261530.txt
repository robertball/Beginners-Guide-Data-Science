Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground bison
1 cup milk
1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 cup chopped green chile peppers
1/2 cup bacon bits
1 large egg, beaten
1 1/2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground sage
3/4 cup barbeque sauce, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine ground bison, milk, bread crumbs, green chile peppers, bacon bits, egg, liquid smoke, onion powder, dry mustard, garlic powder, and ground sage in a bowl. Mix by hand.
Transfer mixture to a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Spread barbeque sauce over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until bison is no longer pink, about 1 hour 45 minutes.

Description: 
Created this one today. Wanted a spicy, yet still tender, meatloaf. Since I don't eat beef, bison was used instead. Very tender and flavorful.
