Ingredients:
1 pre-made pizza crust (such as Boboli)
1 cup cooked chicken breast, diced
1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons wing sauce (hot, medium or mild, your preference)
4 oz package blue cheese
1 celery stalk, sliced thin
1 cup shredded mozzerella cheese
Purchased ranch dressing for dipping, celery sticks and baby carrots to serve along side pizza

Directions:
Preheat oven to 475 degrees.  Line a cookie sheet with foil and place pizza crust on top.
Place diced chicken in a bowl and add 3 tablespoons wing sauce, mix well.
Spread remaining wing sauce evenly over pizza crust. Sprinkle blue cheese, diced chicken, and celery on pizza.  Cover pizza with shredded mozzerella.  Bake 12 minutes until hot and bubbly.  Allow pizza to cool several minutes and cut into squares.  Serve ranch dressing, celery and carrot sticks on the side.

Description: 
My favorite sports pub serves this, and I've come up with a simple and delicious home version.  Many local restaurants sell wing sauce, and most grocery stores carry it near the steak and BBQ sauces.  It's rich, so serve in squares as an appetizer.  Enjoy!
