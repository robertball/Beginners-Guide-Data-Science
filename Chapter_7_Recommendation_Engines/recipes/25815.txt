Ingredients:
5 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, chopped
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup peanut butter
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix
2 cups rolled oats
2 cups chopped peanut butter cups

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt the semisweet chocolate, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Mix in the melted chocolate and peanut butter. Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and instant pudding mix; gradually blend into the peanut butter mixture. Stir in the oats and chopped peanut butter cups. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
