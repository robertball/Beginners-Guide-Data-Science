Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
2 leaves lettuce
2 slices tomato
2 slices bread, toasted
1 tablespoon mayonnaise

Directions:
Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.
Arrange the cooked bacon, lettuce, and tomato slices on one slice of bread. Spread one side of remaining bread slice with the mayonnaise. Bring the two pieces together to make a sandwich.

Description: 
The basic classic: bacon, lettuce, and tomato -- nothing fancy, just delicious. (I personally use fake vegetarian bacon these days, and it's still really good!)
