Description: 
I joke that celery root tastes like celery if celery actually tasted good; for the most part, this is true. The flavor is quite mild and pleasant, and the texture is somewhat similar to mashed potatoes. This simple puree is a very versatile side dish, but the tasty root will also work sliced thin and layered in a gratin, either with or without potatoes. I hope you give this great fall and winter vegetable a try soon.
