Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon ginger paste
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon kosher salt
4 boneless pork chops
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Whisk together the garlic, ginger, sage, and salt in a bowl, and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the pork chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least two hours.
Heat olive oil in a skillet on medium-high or preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the pork chops from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
Great tasting pork chops that are great on the grill or pan fried.  These chops come out tasty and juicy with just a few seasonings.  This is a favorite of my family. To ease preparation you can season and then freeze.  Defrost as you would normally and they are ready to cook. This seasoning also works well by seasoning meat prior to freezing.  The longer it sits on the chops the better.
