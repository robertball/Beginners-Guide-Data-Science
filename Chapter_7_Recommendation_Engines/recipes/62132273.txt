Description: 
My kids always order this when we go out for Chinese, and they wanted me to make it at home. The recipe offers two sauce variations, but the first one is more like the restaurant we got to. It includes ketchup, and what kid doesn't like ketchup?! I serve this with white rice, but if you prefer fried rice....be my guest!
