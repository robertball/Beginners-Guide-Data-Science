Ingredients:
1 Tbsp canola or coconut oil
1 medium sweet onion, chopped
1 lb ground skinless chicken or turkey breast
1 1/2 tsp cumin
1, 32 ounce, carton low-sodium chicken broth
1, 10 ounce, can diced tomatoes and green chilies
1, 12 ounce, sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2 -inch cubes
1 large parsnip, peeled and sliced
2 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 3 minutes.  Add chicken and cumin; cook, breaking up chicken and wooden spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes.
Stir in broth, tomatoes with green chiles, sweet potato, and parsnip; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until sweet potato is fork-tender, about 15 minutes.  Serve sprinkled with cilantro.

Description: 
Healthy, delicious, easy, and quick.  It's also very adaptable- you can alter, change, or add ingredients to suit your taste.  I increased the meat in the original recipe because I can never find just 12 ounces of ground white poultry.
