Ingredients:
1 pound white confectioners' coating
1 pound jellybeans

Directions:
Line a jelly roll pan with waxed paper and set aside.
Melt the white confectioners' coating in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Spread the melted white confectioners' coating onto the prepared pan. Sprinkle the jellybeans over the top.
Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until firm. Break into pieces to serve.

Description: 
This is a delicious recipe reminiscent of the peppermint bark made at Christmastime that uses a favorite Easter treat. Fun and easy to make too! Everyone really enjoys the combination of creamy white chocolate and fruity jellybeans. Use your favorite, but I always go for the small pectin variety. Hope you enjoy!
