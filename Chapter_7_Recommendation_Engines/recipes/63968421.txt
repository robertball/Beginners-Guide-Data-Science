Ingredients:
1 onion (chopped)
~2.5 lbs boneless sirloin or flank steak sliced into thin strips
~2 cups beef consumme or beef broth (1 14.5oz can is fine)
1 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/3 cup dark brown sugar (light brown sugar also ok)
2 tbsp. sesame oil
6 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup sauce (from the crockpot after dish is cooked)
2 bags frozen broccoli florets (can also use 2-3 fresh heads of broccoli)
White or brown rice, cooked (about 1.5 cups uncooked)

Directions:
In the insert of the crockpot, whisk together beef consumme, soy sauce, dark brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and onion.
Gently place your slices of beef in the liquid and toss to coat.
Turn crockpot on low and cook for 6 hours. (or cook on high for 4 hours)
When done, add 1/2 cup of cooking liquid to a small bowl.  Slowly add the cornstarch, whisking together to create a slurry.  (If you add all of the cornstarch at once without whisking, it will just create a paste).  Pour slurry into crockpot and mix well.  Cook on low for an additional 30 minutes to thicken up the sauce.
Toss in your broccoli florets then serve hot over rice.
