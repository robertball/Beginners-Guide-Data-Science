1 tablespoon olive oil
4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
salt and pepper

Directions:
In a skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil and melt the butter. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place chicken in the skillet and brown on both sides.

Description: 
Yummy doesn't even begin to describe this chicken with cream sauce! So easy, moist and flavorful!! The only thing I did extra was to put a touch of salt, pepper and garlic powder in the sauce. My family wolfed this down in record time!
