Directions:
In a VERY large bowl (or two medium bowls), combine the first 6 ingredients. Set aside.
In a microwave safe bowl, heat white chips and oil on high for 60 seconds (you could also melt chocolate and oil in a double boiler pan). Stir and microwave for another 30 seconds and stir until completely melted and smooth (you may need to microwave for a couple more seconds).
Pour melted chocolate over cereal mix and stir until all the cereal is evenly covered with white chocolate. Spread cereal mix on 2 large baking sheets (I used cookie sheets) lined with wax paper. Let cool and then break apart into chunks.
Store in an airtight container.
