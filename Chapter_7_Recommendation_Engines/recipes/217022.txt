Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups matzo cake flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons margarine, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1/3 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 drop yellow food coloring, or as desired (optional)
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon powdered non-dairy creamer
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Whisk together the matzo flour, baking soda, baking powder (see Note), and salt in a large mixing bowl.
In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, white sugar, margarine, vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of lemon extract, lemon juice, vegetable oil, and food coloring with an electric mixer set on medium speed until smooth; pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture. Stir until combined into a smooth batter, and pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until set and lightly browned, about 45 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf will come out clean. Cool completely, then remove from the pan.
Place 1 cup of confectioners' sugar in a bowl. In a separate small bowl, mix the non-dairy creamer with water, and stir in 1 tablespoon of confectioners' sugar. Stir the creamer mixture into the confectioners' sugar by teaspoons until the mixture forms an even, workable glaze. Mix in 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract. Spread the glaze over the cooled lemon loaf. Allow to set, and serve in 1-inch slices.

Description: 
This delicious non-dairy Passover dessert can be made year-round, just swap out the flours. This was such a hit at my Seder that everyone swore I had cheated and used real flour!
