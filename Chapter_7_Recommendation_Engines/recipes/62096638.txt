Description: 
I created this recipe on accident. After already starting dinner one night I realized I didn't have enough potatoes on hand to make mashed so I improvised and came up with these. It's quick and easy and they are delicious. Just line your cookie sheet with nonstick foil and clean up is a snap! Enjoy!
