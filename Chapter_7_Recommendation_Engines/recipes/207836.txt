Ingredients:
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1/2 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1/2 (6 ounce) can crabmeat
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 (16 ounce) package wonton wrappers
1/2 cup diced green onion

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, artichoke hearts, spinach, crabmeat, garlic, onion powder, black pepper, and white pepper in a bowl. Set aside.
Place wonton wrappers into mini muffin tins and bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven and scoop about 1 teaspoon of the crab mixture into each wrapper. Return to the oven and continue baking until wontons are golden brown and the filling is hot, about 5 minutes more. Garnish with green onions and serve immediately.
