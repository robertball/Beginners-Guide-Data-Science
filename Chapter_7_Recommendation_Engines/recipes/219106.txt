Description: 
My mom lives in a small town in western New York, called Clifton Springs. Whenever I go home to visit, I usually indulge in some Buffalo chicken wings from a place called Emerson's. They have two flavors of wings; Buffalo-style, and sweet and sour. I came up with what turned out to be a deliciously sticky, ginger and garlic glaze. I really hope you give these a try.
