Ingredients:
3/4 cup Gourmet Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
1 cup firmly packed light or dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 large eggs
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter and flour an 8-inch square baking pan. In a large bowl combine the ¾ cup semi-sweet chocolate and butter, Microwave for one minute. Stir until smooth, if needed microwave for 15 additional seconds until smooth. With a spatula stir the brown sugar and vanilla into the chocolate mixture; do not use a mixer for this recipe, over stirring makes them dry and cakey. Add the eggs and mix.
In a bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Fold the flour mixture into the chocolate mixture, mixing until blended, it's ok to have little bubbles. Pour into 8 inch pan.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until a tester comes out to proper consistency. If you like them on the cakey side wait until the tester comes out clean. For on the fudgy side if the tester comes out liquid leave it in to bake, if the tester comes out with little bits of brownie they’re done.

Description: 
These brownies are the best I've ever found. Not cakey, but not to fudgy either. I made these twice a week for a few months when I discovered them.
