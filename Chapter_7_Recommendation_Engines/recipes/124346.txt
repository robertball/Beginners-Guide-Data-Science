Description: 
My mother-in-law shared this recipe with me 40 years ago. She served this salad at all holiday meals, and the tradition has continued in our family. Preparation is so much easier today, thanks to red grapes without seeds! Another 'updated' shortcut in the preparation is miniature marshmallows...cooks from the good old days know what 'sticky fun' it was to snip regular-sized marshmallows!
