Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups grated zucchini
1 cup Lump Crab meat
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup minced onion
1 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning TM
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine zucchini, crab, egg, and butter or margarine. Stir in seasoned crumbs, minced onion, and seasoning. Mix well.
Shape mixture into patties. Dredge in flour.
If you freeze the uncooked patties, we have found that it may be necessary to press out excess liquid  and reform the patties before cooking.
In a medium skillet, heat oil over medium high heat until hot.  Fry patties in oil until golden brown on both sides.

Description: 
Connie's original vegetarian version is incredible, but we decided to try it with a little crab in it and LOVED it. Old Bay seasoning, crab, and shredded zucchini do the magic. If you have lots of zucchini in your garden, this is a great way to use it. Also, these freeze nicely so you can make them ahead of time, freeze uncooked patties on a cookie sheet, and when they're frozen, stack them in a freezer bag until you're ready to cook them! Then thaw in the fridge overnight, press out excess liquid and reshape patties if necessary, and pan fry to enjoy!Modified from: Connie's Zucchini Crab Cakes
