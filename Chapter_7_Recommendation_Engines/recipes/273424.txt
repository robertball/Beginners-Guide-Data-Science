1 small onion, roughly chopped

Heat oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add carrots and onion; cook until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, coriander, and cumin; cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
Add bone broth and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer until the carrots are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add parsley; cook for 1 minute more.
Puree with an immersion blender or in a blender until smooth. Add yogurt; blend until thoroughly mixed. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls and garnish with cilantro.
