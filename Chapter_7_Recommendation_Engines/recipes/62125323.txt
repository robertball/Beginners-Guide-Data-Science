Description: 
This is a recipe I tried to copy from Pappaduex's Greek Salad, it has tomato chunks, cucumbers, capers, marinated shrimp, lettuce, Italian seasoning, and Feta cheese.  Although a slight twist to the original Pappaduex Greek Salad it is the best accompaniment to almost any meal.  Very filling! Enjoy.
