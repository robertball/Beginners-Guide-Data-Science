Description: 
My version of this popular Puerto Rican eggnog is the most requested recipe among my friends, and it's legendary. It does take some working in putting it together but worth the wait. Also, diet, calories, etc., are out the window with this one! Serve over lots of ice and in small quantities, since it doesn't taste like eggnog and people tend to drink more than they realize! Store in a glass container in the refrigerator.
