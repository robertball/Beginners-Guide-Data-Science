Ingredients:
1 small onion, diced
2 tablespoons of olive oil
3 cloves of garlic, smashed and then diced
1 cup lentils
2 1/2 cups of broth (I made my own bone broth but any broth would do)
salt and pepper to taste
1 can of stewed tomatoes (Italian style)
1 medium potato, quartered and then sliced

Directions:
1. Cook onion in oil in a medium size pot over medium heat for a few minutes with salt until soft, then add garlic, let cook for a minute more
2. Add lentils and broth then stir in stewed tomatoes including the liquid.  I like to squeeze the tomatoes as I'm pouring them out into the pot so that they break up a bit.
3. Cook for 20 mins
4. Add the potatoes and cook for 20 mins more or until potatoes and lentils are soft
Would be great served over rice

I threw this together with ingredients I had around the house tonight and was really surprised how well it turned out! This is a hearty, satisfying stew with a heavy tomato base
