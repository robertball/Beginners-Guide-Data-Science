1/4 cup sake (rice wine)

1. Combine first 6 ingredients in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil; cook until reduced to 1/4 cup (about 2 1/2 minutes).  Remove from heat; cool.
2. Combine soy sauce mixture and chicken in a zip-top plastic bag, and seal. Marinate in refrigerator 1 hour.
3. Heat a large grill pan over medium-high heat.
4. Thread 6 chicken pieces and 5 green onion pieces alternately onto each of 4 (10-inch) skewers.  Brush kebabs with soy mixture.  Coat pan with cooking spray.  Place kebabs in pan; cook 4 minutes on each side or until browned and chicken is done.
