Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (19.8 ounce) package brownie mix (such as Duncan HinesÂ®)
2 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup water
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided
2 cups white chocolate chips
12 strawberries, hulled and halved
12 pitted cherries
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Combine brownie mix, eggs, oil, and water in a bowl. Add 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips. Pour mixture into the prepared pan.
Bake until a toothpick inserted near the edge comes out clean, 20 to 23 minutes. Let cool in the pan, about 20 minutes. Cut into 12 squares and place on a wire rack.
Place remaining semisweet chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl. Place white chocolate chips in a separate microwave-safe bowl. Heat each bowl in the microwave until chips are melted, about 1 minute each.
Place 2 halves of a cut strawberry on top of each brownie with tops touching. Drizzle semisweet chocolate over brownies and let cool briefly. Drizzle white chocolate over brownies and let cool briefly.
Spread whipped topping over strawberries and brownies. Place a cherry in the center; drizzle additional chocolate on. Let stand until set.
