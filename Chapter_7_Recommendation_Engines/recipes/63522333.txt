Ingredients:
1 loaf prepared frozen bread dough  (thawed)
3 scrambled eggs
1/2 lb. favorite breakfast sausage cooked
1 small onion sauteed
4 oz. Sargento Shredded Mild Cheddar Cheese
1 egg
1/4 tsp. Garlic Salt
1 tbsp. grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees
Take loaf of thawed bread dough and stretch into a 16" long oblong about 6 " wide and place on board.
Spread eggs, sausage, onions and cheese on top of dough on the left side only.  (This will leave the right half open to fold over the left.)
Fold the dough over the stuffing mixture and pinch together along the seams on all sides.
Place loaf on a baking sheet seam side down with the ends tucked under.  No seam should be seen at all.
Take the last egg and mix with the garlic salt and parmesan cheese and brush over the loaf.
Place in oven and bake until golden brown around 20 minutes.
