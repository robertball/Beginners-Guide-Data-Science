Ingredients:
6 bone-in chicken breasts, skin removed
1 tsp poultry seasoning
1/2 tsp garlic powder, or to taste
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
2 tbsp olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, cut in small dice
2 stalks celery, trimmed, cut in small dice
2 carrots, peeled, cut in a small dice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup flour
1 32 ounce box low sodium chicken broth
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 can cream of celery soup
1/2 cup half & half
10 ounce package frozen petite green peas, thawed
4 large flour tortillas, cut into strips about 1 x 2 inches
Additional broth or water, as needed

Directions:
Layer chicken breasts bone side down around the bottom of a large heavy Dutch oven. Sprinkle with poultry seasoning, garlic powder, & black pepper. Cover with cold water to 2 inches above the chicken. Bring to a low boil over medium heat. Skim, cover, reduce heat & simmer 15 minutes. Remove from heat & let stand covered 20 minutes. Remove chicken breasts to a plate. Pour poaching liquid through a fine sieve into a bowl & save. When chicken is cool enough to handle, remove meat from the bones & cut or pull into bite size pieces.
Wipe out Dutch oven. Add olive oil, onion, celery, & carrots. Saute 7 minutes or until just tender. Add minced garlic & saute another 2 minutes. Sprinkle with flour & cook 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. Add strained poaching liquid & boxed chicken broth & bring to a boil to thicken slightly. Add canned soups, half & half, chicken, & green peas. Bring to a low boil.
Sprinkle enough tortilla strips over stew to cover the top. Push into the stew & stir. Continue until all tortilla strips are used. Cook on low, gently stirring occasionally, 8-12 minutes until tortilla dumplings are tender. Add additional broth or water if needed to thin the stew & bring back to a simmer.

My husband's Aunt Mary showed me how to make dumplings using flour tortillas. I've added to it over the years to make this true comfort food!
