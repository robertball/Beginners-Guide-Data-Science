Ingredients:
1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts; cut into 8 fingers
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tbsp butter
1 package Crescent rolls
3 thin slices of medium cheddar cheese (I use Sargento slices); seperated to cover 8 chicken fingers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Bring butter, garlic and onion to a simmer and add chicken fingers.  Brown the chicken.  Put it in the freezer for 5 minutes to cool.
Slit chicken fingers to within 1/4 inch of ends.  Insert thin slices of cheese.
Wrap one crescent dough triangle around each chicken finger and place on cookie sheet, cheese side up.
Bake 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
Add some cheese and dip these little guys in whatever you like to dip stuff in.  Super fast and fun for the kids.  Better than hot dogs, so us adults can eat them too.  Just thought of it one night and they were great!  Try them and let me know what you think.
