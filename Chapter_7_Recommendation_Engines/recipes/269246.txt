Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups California walnuts, toasted
4 cups Italian parsley leaves, packed
2 cups Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, freshly grated
4 cloves garlic
1 1/2 cups extra virgin olive oil
1 pinch Salt and pepper to taste (optional)
4 pounds pappardelle pasta, fresh
Topping:
1 1/2 cups California walnuts, toasted, chopped
grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (optional)

Directions:
Place half of the walnuts in a food processor; add half of the parsley, cheese, and garlic and process until finely chopped. With motor running, slowly pour in half of the oil; puree until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and repeat with remaining walnuts, parsley, cheese, garlic, and oil, for a total of 2 batches. Season with salt and pepper; set aside. (Makes approximately 4 cups)
Cook pasta in boiling salted water until al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain, reserving some of the cooking water. For each serving, toss 2 cups cooked pasta with 1/4 cup walnut pesto, adding some of the reserved cooking water as required to thin the pesto; toss well to coat evenly.
Transfer to warm pasta bowls; sprinkle with chopped walnuts and shaved or grated cheese, as desired. Serve immediately.
