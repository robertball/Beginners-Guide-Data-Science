Ingredients:
Linguine or spaghetti noodles
3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
Seasoning salt
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
3 sprigs of fresh thyme leaves, stems removed
1/4 cup browned butter
1/2 cup grated mizithra cheese
1/4 cup pine nuts
Fresh ground pepper

Directions:
Break pasta noodles in half and cook in boiling water until al dente. Grill or pan-fry chicken with a little seasoning salt on both sides (I like to use a George Foreman grill) and set aside to cool slightly. Brown butter in pan on medium heat, until butter has caramel fragrance and is almost done foaming (be careful not to burn).
Combine chicken, drained pasta, spinach, basil and thyme leaves in large bowl and pour butter over the top. Toss well before adding cheese and nuts, toss again and garnish with fresh ground pepper.

Description: 
It's so hard to find recipes with mizithra cheese other than the typical browned butter, so here is a new twist on an old favorite! Great for summer evenings!
