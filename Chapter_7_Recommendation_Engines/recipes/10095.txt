Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon red food coloring

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Mix well the shortening and butter, sugar, egg, almond and vanilla. In a separate bowl, mix flour and salt and add to shortening mixture.  Divide dough in half.
Blend red food coloring into one half.  Roll 1 teaspoon of the red dough and 1 teaspoon of the white dough on lightly floured board into 4 inch strips.  Place strips side by side and  press lightly together and twist like a rope.  Curve top of rope down to look like the handle of a candy cane.
Bake 9 minutes or until lightly browned.  Remove while still warm.   Sprinkle with  1/2 cup crushed peppermint stick candy and 1/2 cup sugar (optional).
