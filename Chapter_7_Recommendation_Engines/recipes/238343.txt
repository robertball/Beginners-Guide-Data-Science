2 cups water

Directions:
Blend coconut flakes in a blender until powdery, scraping down the sides as needed. Add water and blend on medium-high speed for 45 seconds. Blend 2 or 3 more times for a thicker and creamier milk.
Strain milk through a metal strainer into a container with a lid. Cover container and refrigerate.
