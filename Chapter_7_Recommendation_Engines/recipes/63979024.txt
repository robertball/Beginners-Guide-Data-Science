Ingredients:
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons flour
2 cups whole milk
Salt
Pepper
8 oz shredded mozzarella cheese
6 oz shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
1. Heat the milk until warm
2. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until it starts to bubble, then add the flour and whisk until it begins to turn golden, 1 to 2 minutes
3. Slowly add the milk about 1/3 cup at a time, stirring thoroughly after each addition. This will appear thick and pasty at first, then gradually thin until all the milk is incorporated. Stir regularly until it begins to simmer, then let simmer for 7 minutes.
4. Turn off the heat and all the shredded cheeses, stirring until incorporated. If the cheese is too heavy, add more milk to thin to desired consistency.
