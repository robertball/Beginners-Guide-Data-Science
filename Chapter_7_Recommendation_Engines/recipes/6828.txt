Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 2/3 cups warm water
2 tablespoons margarine
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Mix together the unsifted flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1-1/2 teaspoons salt, yeast, water, and butter in the bread machine on the manual setting.
OR, mix 1-1/2 cup flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1-1/2 teaspoons salt, and yeast.  Heat water and butter to 120-130 degrees F.  Add water to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed on mixer.  Add 1/2 cup flour, beat at high speed 2 minutes.  Stir in more flour to make a stiff dough.  Knead 8-10 minutes.  Cover and let rise.  Punch down.  Cover; let rest 15 minutes.
Remove from bread machine.
Divide dough into 12 pieces; shape 3 pieces into smooth balls.  Poke a 1 inch hole in each.  Drop bagels into a large skillet with 1 inch water (simmering) with 1 tablespoon sugar and 2 teaspoons salt in the water.  Cook on medium low heat for 3 minutes, turn and cook 2 minutes; turn again, cook 1 minute more.  Drain on towels.  Repeat for rest of dough.  Place on greased cookie sheet.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20-25 minutes.  Remove from sheets and cool.  If desired, before baking, mix 1 egg white and 1 tablespoon water, brush on bagels, and sprinkle with sesame, poppy, or caraway seeds.
