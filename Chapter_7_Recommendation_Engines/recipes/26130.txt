Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons orange juice
1 egg
3 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts
2 1/2 cups fresh cranberries, roughly chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream together butter, white sugar and brown sugar. Beat in the milk, orange juice and egg. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Stir in chopped walnuts and cranberries. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are golden. Let cookies cool on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely

Description: 
Makes a great, light, cake-like cookie.  I use the food processor to chop the cranberries (life is just too short!).
