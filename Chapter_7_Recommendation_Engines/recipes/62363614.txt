6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Place crackers in a large resealable plastic bag; seal bag and crush crackers until they are coarse crumbs. Add flour, potato flakes, seasoned salt, and pepper to bag and mix well.
Beat egg in a shallow dish or bowl; heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.
One by one, dredge chicken pieces in egg beat, then place in bag with crumb mixture, seal bag and shake to coat.
Reduce heat to medium and cook coated chicken in skillet for 15 to 20 minutes, turning frequently, until golden brown and juices run clear.

Description: 
Get in on the fun of cooking with chicken fried in a saltine cracker crust.  Potato flakes give that coating a little something extra.

I like the flavor of the coating! I do have one suggestion. I tried applying the coating the way the recipe calls for (just dip in egg then coating), and also the way I learned in culinary school (dip in flour, then egg, then coating). The latter method was much better the chicken was crispier and much juicier. I will probably make again - thanks!Modified from: Chicken Fried Chicken
