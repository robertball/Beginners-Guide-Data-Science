Ingredients:
1 to 1 1/2 pounds Tenderloin or Top Sirloin steak sliced (Stir-Fry Strips)
Hoisin Sauce
1 Green Pepper, sliced into strips
1 Medium Onion, sliced into strips
4 ounce Mushooms, sliced
2 tablespoon Sesame Oil
1 tablespoon minced Ginger Root
1 teaspoon minced Garlic
1 teaspoon toasted Sesame Seeds (optional)
1/2 cup Beef Stock, divided
1 tablespoon cornstarch.

Directions:
Cut across the grain for tenderness and paint strips with hoisin, let marniate at least 1 hour or over night.
Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, and add oil. Saute garlic and ginger root for about 5 seconds, then add vegetables, and cook until they are lightly tender, and then set aside.
Either grill or strir fry steak strips. Lean tenderloin is easily overcooked. I like my steak in the rare range for optimal tenderness and moistness.
Mix cornstarch and half the stock in a small bowl then set aside.
Mix the vegetables and steak togetther and add remaining stock. Stir for a couple minutes and add cornstarch mixture, then cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.
Serve on a bed of rice and a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds.

This is how I remember it was made at a Chinese restaurant that I worked at while in college. Just onion and green pepper but I've been know to add fresh mushrooms.
