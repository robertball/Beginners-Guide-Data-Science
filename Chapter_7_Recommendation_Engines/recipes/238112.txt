Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 cup vegetable oil
4 1/2 cups self-rising flour

Directions:
Beat white sugar, confectioners' sugar, and butter together in a stand mixer until smooth and creamy. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat until fully incorporated. Pour oil into sugar-butter mixture; beat until smooth. Slowly add flour to sugar-butter mixture, 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition until dough is stiff. Refrigerate dough, 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Drop dough by the spoonful onto baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Work in batches if needed.
