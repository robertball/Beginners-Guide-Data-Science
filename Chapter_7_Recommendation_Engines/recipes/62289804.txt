3 pounds lean ground beef
1/4 onion, minced
2 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans, drained

Directions:
Cut the sausage into 1-inch chunks and quarter the chunks. Place in a large skillet over medium-high heat for about 5 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Season with cayenne pepper to taste.
In the same skillet over medium-high heat, saute the ground beef for 5 minutes. Stir in the rice, and onion; reduce heat to medium and saute for 5 more minutes. Drain well and add to the pot. Stir the kidney beans, pinto beans, and pork and beans into the pot. Add a little water, if necessary, and simmer over low heat until ready to serve.

Description: 
My current version of a classic recipe here is still a work in progress, but it's a pretty good one. This is a meal in itself, and tastes even better the next day when reheated.Modified from: Ground Beef and Sausage in Red Beans and Rice
