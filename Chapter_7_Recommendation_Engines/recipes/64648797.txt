Ingredients:
1 tbsp brown sugar
1 tbsp paprika
1.5 tsp each ground cumin and ground coriander
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
Salmon Steaks
1/2 cup mango chutney
1.5 cup plain yoghurt
1/3 cup fresh coriander, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450F and line a baking sheet with paper.
In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, paprika, ground cumin, ground coriander, salt, and cayenne pepper to create the salmon rub.
Drizzle some olive oil over the fish and then rub the fish with the rub you have just created.
Put on the baking sheet and roast in the oven for 10-12 mins.
Meanwhile, place chutney in a medium sized bowl. Use a fork to squish any mango chunks until fairly smooth.
Stir in the yoghurt and fresh coriander.
Pour over the salmon to serve.

One of my favourite ways to spice up my salmon. This recipe is a great mix of sweet with a bit of a kick to it. Serve with a nice side of veggies and you are good to go!
