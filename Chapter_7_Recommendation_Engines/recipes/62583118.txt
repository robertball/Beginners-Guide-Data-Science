Ingredients:
3 1/4 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced
1 shallots, diced
3/4 cups Arborio rice
sea salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped chives
2 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a saucepan, warm the broth over low heat.
Warm 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid, and set aside.
Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to skillet,  and stir in the shallots. Cook 1 minute. Add rice, stirring to coat with oil, about 2 minutes. When the rice has taken on a pale, golden color, pour in 1/2 c broth, stirring constantly until the wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/4 cup broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender but not soft and sauce is creamy, about 20 to 30 minutes.
Remove from heat, and stir in mushrooms with their liquid, butter, chives, and parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
