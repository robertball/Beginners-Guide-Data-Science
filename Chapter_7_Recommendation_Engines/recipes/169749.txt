Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon garlic salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
2 pounds pork tenderloin, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup chicken broth
2 teaspoons minced lemon zest, or to taste
1 tablespoon capers, or to taste

Directions:
Place the flour, garlic salt, and pepper into a plastic bag. Shake to mix, the add the pork tenderloin pieces, and shake again to coat. Shake off the excess flour.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the pork medallions in the hot oil until golden-brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Pour in the balsamic vinegar and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium, and simmer until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pork to a serving platter, then stir the lemon zest and capers into the simmering sauce. Continue simmering until the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency.
