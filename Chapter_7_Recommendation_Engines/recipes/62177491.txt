Ingredients:
¾ cups sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
1 tsp. vanilla
1 30 oz. can pumpkin pie mix (not plain canned pumpkin)
4 eggs
2 cups flour
3 tsp. baking powder
2 tsp. baking soda
¼ tsp. salt
3 tsp. cinnamon
1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and grease and flour an 9”x13” pan.
In a large bowl, blend sugar and oil until well blended. Blend in vanilla and pumpkin pie mix. Beat in eggs, one at a time.
In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices. Stir into the pumpkin mixture until blended.
Pour batter into prepared pan, and bake in the pre-heated oven for 30-35 minutes.
Cool completely.
Store covered in the refrigerator. The cake tastes great if eaten right when it cools, but is best after it has been in the refrigerator over night.

Description: 
Who says that a can of pumpkin pie mix can only be used for pie? This super moist, super yummy pumpkin cake was invented one year when my husband wanted me to make a pumpkin cake. He accidently brought home a big can of pumpkin pie mix instead of 100% pumpkin. After looking at several pumpkin cake recipes, and borrowing from pretty much all of them, I came up with a recipe to use the pie mix in a cake, and the result was AWESOME! This is now one of our favorite cakes. Serve it plain, with a little whipped cream, with some cream cheese frosting, or with a little sprinkling of powdered sugar.
