1 pound Italian sausage
1 medium onion (chopped)
2 cloves garlic (minced)
2 T. olive oil
8 cups water
6 beef boullion cubes
6-8 medium potatoes cut in inch size cubes
1 Hungarian pepper
2 cans (14.5 oz. each) stewed tomatoes
1 can tomato sauce (8 oz.)
1 t. dried basil
1/2 t. dried oregano
18-20 oz. cheese tortellini (frozen or fresh)
2 cups thick sliced zucchini (or squash)
1/4 c. chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Remove casings from sausage. Brown sausage and cook until crumbly and no longer pink.
Cook onion, garlic, and olive oil in the pot until tender.
Add water, boullion cubes, potatoes, Hungarian pepper, stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce, basil, oregano, and the cooked sausage. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer uncovered 30 minutes.
Add cheese tortellini, zucchini, and parsley. Simmer another 25 minutes, covered, for fresh tortellini, or 45 minutes, covered, for frozen tortellini.
Serve with Parmesan cheese sprinkled over the top.

Description: 
I combined a lot of ingredients that I bought this summer at a farmer's market and froze for use in the winter time.  I was extremely happy with this combination of ingredients... and so were my neighbors!  The soup also freezes very well!
