Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup uncooked brown rice
1 cup water
6 bell peppers, assorted colors
2 (8 ounce) cans natural tomato sauce
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium onion, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the rice and water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and cook 45 minutes. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the beef, garlic and onion until meat is evenly browned and onion is softened.
Remove and discard the tops, seeds, and membranes of the bell peppers. Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward. (Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary so that they will stand upright.)
In a bowl, mix the browned beef, cooked rice, 1 can tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of the mixture into each hollowed pepper. Mix the remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers.
Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until the peppers are tender. Sprinkle the peppers with grated parmesan cheese after baking, if desired.
