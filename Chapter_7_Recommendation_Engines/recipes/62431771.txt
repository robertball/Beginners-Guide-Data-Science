Ingredients:
2 lbs small red potatoes, quartered
1/2 tsp onion powder (optional)
4 tbsp white wine vinegar
2 tbsp cider vinegar
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp honey
1 tbsp minced shallots
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tsp fresh chives, chopped
2 tsp fresh parsley, chopped
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper

Directions:
Place the quartered potatoes in a pot and add enough water to cover by 2 inches. Season the water salt and the optional onion powder. Bring the water to a boil and reduce to a simmer immediately. Cook the potatoes until they are tender, about 15 minutes.
While the potatoes cook, make the dressing. Combine the white wine vinegar, cidar vinegar, Dijon mustard, and honey in a small mixing bowl. Slowly drizzle olive oil in a steady stream and continually stir. Stir in the chives, parsley, salt and pepper.
Let the dressing sit for about 10 minutes to let the herbs meld together.
Drain the potatoes and transfer to a serving bowl. Give the dressing another stir and then pour over the potatoes. Gently toss to coat well.
Serve warm or at room temp.
