Ingredients:
1 (1/4-inch piece) fresh ginger
2 strips of lemon peel
1 cinnamon stick
1 star anise pod
2 whole cloves
1 piece cheesecloth
3 pounds apples - peeled, cored, and quartered
1/2 cup of water
1/2 teaspoon of salt
2 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste

Directions:
Tie up ginger, lemon peel, cinnamon stick, anise, and cloves in a piece of cheesecloth for easy retrieval.
Place apples into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Add spice bundle, water, ginger, and salt. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Avoid releasing pressure manually as applesauce may splutter up through the vent and scald you. Remove the spice packet.
Mix in brown sugar until dissolved. Taste and adjust the level of sweetness if needed.
Notes:
Lemon strips: use a vegetable peeler to get the zest, not the pith.
Using for baking, so didn't want it too sweet.
Freezes well; make sure to allow enough headroom for expansion.
