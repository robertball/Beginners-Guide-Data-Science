Ingredients:
1 pound fresh rhubarb, chopped fine
1 10 ounce container frozen sweetened sliced strawberries
1 cup sugar
1 Tbsp lemon juice
10 ounces tequila or more to taste
ice

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine rhubarb, strawberries, sugar and lemon juice.   Bring to a boil stirring constantly.
Reduce to a simmer until rhubarb is tender and forms a sauce (20-30 minutes)
Refrigerate until cool.
Add to a blender along with tequila and ice and blend until desired consistency, adding more ice as needed.   In my Margaritaville blender, half of this recipe is one pitcher full.

Description: 
This is a spin-off of my friend Darby's famous rhubarb strawberry ice cream.   It's a little tart and a little sweet and perfectly refreshing.   This will be perfect for your day on the lake.
