2 tablespoons Olive Oil
1 medium Onion, diced
1 cup Carrots, diced
2 cloves Garlic, minced
1 cup Arborio Rice
2 cups Chicken Broth
1 cup dry White Wine
1 pound medium Shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 slices Prosciutto, finely chopped
1 cup sweet Corn
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons dried Basil

Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the Onion, Carrots and Garlic until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the Rice, and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring frequently.
Pour in 1 1/2 cups of the Chicken Broth, and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered for 5 minutes, continuing to stir. Pour in the remaining Chicken Broth and Wine, increase heat to medium, and cook for about 5 more minutes, stirring constantly.
Add the, Shrimp, Prosciutto and Corn. Cook, stirring constantly, until the remaining liquid is almost absorbed, and the Shrimp is cooked, about 5-10 minutes. When the Rice is just tender and slightly creamy, season with Parmesan Cheese, Basil, Marjoram, Cilantro, Lemon Juice, Salt and Pepper.
