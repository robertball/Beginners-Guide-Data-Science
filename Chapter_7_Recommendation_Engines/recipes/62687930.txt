Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons olive oil
~2 cups shredded kale (cabbage can be substituted)
1 cup chopped onion
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup diced carrot
1/2 cup diced celery
4 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 tablespoon dried thyme)
5 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
2 15-oz. cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 14-oz. can diced tomatoes
3/4 cup diced zucchini
1/2 cup peeled, diced potato
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2-inch thick slices of stale crustless country bread (one for each bowl of soup you're serving)
1/2 teaspoon olive oil and 1/4 cup parsley for garnish

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the kale or cabbage, garlic, onion, carrot, celery, and thyme, and cook, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes or until the vegetables are softened.
Add the broth, beans, tomatoes, zucchini, and potato, plus 1 cup of water.
Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer covered, about 15 minutes or until potato is tender.
Thicken soup by pureeing about 2 cups of the soup, either using a hand mixer or in a blender, and then return it to the pot. (Adjust the thickness to your preference). Add salt and pepper and simmer a few more minutes.
Serve the soup by first putting a slice of bread in the bottom of a soup bowl. Ladle the soup over the bread. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with parsley. Serve very hot.
