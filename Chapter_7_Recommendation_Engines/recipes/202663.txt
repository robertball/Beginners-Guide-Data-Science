Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (12 ounce) package bulk pork breakfast sausage
6 fresh mushrooms, chopped
1 red onion, chopped
2 tablespoons barbecue sauce
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 egg
1/2 cup instant oatmeal
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
4 strips bacon

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix the ground beef, sausage, mushrooms, onion, barbecue sauce, Worcestershire sauce, egg, oatmeal, garlic powder, pepper, and Cheddar cheese together in a large bowl until evenly mixed. Form into a loaf and place in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Lie the bacon strips across the top of the meatloaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

I've never been a big meatloaf fan but I like this recipe. My family raves about it! I think the onion, mushroom, cheese and bacon combination really makes it stand out from your ordinary meatloaf!
