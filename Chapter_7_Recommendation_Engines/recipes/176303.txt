Ingredients:
3 zucchini, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons fine sea salt
1 tablespoon herbes de Provence
1/4 cup breadcrumbs
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange a layer of zucchini slices into the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan so they slightly overlap one another; drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with some of the sea salt and herbes de Provence. Repeat layering until the zucchini is all used.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
While the zucchini bakes, stir together the breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, and 3 tablespoons olive oil in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread evenly over the baked zucchini and return to oven 10 minutes more; serve hot.
