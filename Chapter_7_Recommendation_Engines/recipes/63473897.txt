Ingredients:
About half the liquid from a 15-ounce can of artichokes
1 small red or yellow onion, diced fine
1 tablespoon minced garlic (from a jar or substitute 3 cloves of minced garlic)
4 large eggs
Artichokes from the can, drained, the tough bits discarded, chopped
1 4-ounce jar pimento, drained
1/2 cup (65g) fine dry bread crumbs
1 teaspoon kosher salt
Few turns of ground pepper
Few drops of Tabasco (four, today)
8 ounces grated sharp cheddar
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or cilantro

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325F. Spray an 8x8 or 9x9 baking pan.
In a skillet, saute the onion and garlic in the artichoke liquid until soft.
Meanwhile, separately whisk the eggs, then add all the remaining ingredients (except the parsley) and the cooked onion/garlic mixture. Turn into the pan, pressing slightly to make flat. Sprinkle with parsley.
Bake for about 35 minutes or until lightly set. Cool and cut into 16 or 25 squares.
