Description: 
I had chicken on the grill, and hubby announced he was hungry for BBQ style!  Went to grab some BBQ sauce to slather on at the end of cooking but the cupboard was bare!  Everything BUT BBQ sauce!  So, I grabbed 3 ingredients and hoped for the best... got DH's seal of approval!  Add salt, honey or sugar if you like your sauce saltier or sweeter!
