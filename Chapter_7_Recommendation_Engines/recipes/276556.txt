Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
1/2 onion, diced
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
1 head cauliflower, cut into chunks
2 russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat butter in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot butter until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add chicken stock, cauliflower, potatoes, carrots, and celery; bring to a boil. Continue to boil until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
Transfer potatoes, cauliflower, and carrots carefully to an electric blender or food processor with 1 cup broth; blend until it reaches your desired consistency.
Transfer mixture back into the pot. Season with salt and pepper. Add water as needed if consistency is too thick for your liking. Let simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Serve.
