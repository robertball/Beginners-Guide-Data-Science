Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)
1/4 cup milk
1 pound ground beef
2 cups Prego® Fresh Mushroom Italian Sauce
9 cooked lasagna noodles
1 cup shredded Italian-blend or mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Stir the soup and milk in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth.
Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until it's well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Stir in the Italian sauce.
Layer half the beef mixture, 3 lasagna noodles and 1 cup soup mixture in a 2-quart shallow baking dish. Top with 3 lasagna noodles, remaining beef mixture, remaining noodles and remaining soup mixture. Sprinkle with the cheese. Cover the baking dish.
Bake for 30 minutes or until the lasagna is hot. Uncover the baking dish.
Heat the broiler. Broil 4 inches from the heat for 2 minutes or until the cheese is golden brown. Let stand for 10 minutes.
