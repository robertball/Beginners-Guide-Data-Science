1/4 cup coconut yogurt
2/3 cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained

1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder

1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup shredded vegan mozzarella-style cheese

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine vegan cream cheese and coconut yogurt in a bowl and stir to combine. Mix in spinach, vegan Parmesan, garlic, and Italian seasoning. Fold in artichoke hearts and season with salt and pepper.
Grease the bottom and sides of an 8x8-inch oven-safe baking dish with olive oil. Pour in spinach mixture and spread out evenly. Top with vegan mozzarella.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is beginning to brown, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and serve warm.
