Ingredients:
4 (1 ounce) squares German sweet chocolate
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons butter
3 ounces cream cheese
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 9 inch square baking pan.
In a double boiler, melt chocolate over low heat with 3 tablespoons of butter.  Set aside to cool. In a medium bowl, mix together 2 of the eggs and sugar until thick.  Stir in baking powder, salt and 1/2 cup of flour. Blend in cooled chocolate, nuts and vanilla extract. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, cream 2 tablespoons of butter with the cream cheese.  Gradually stir in 1/4 cup of sugar. Blend in one egg,1 tablespoon of flour, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.
Spread half of the chocolate batter in a pan.  Layer on all of the cream cheese batter.  Spoon on the remaining chocolate batter in spots.  Zigzag through batter with a knife to create a marbling effect.
Bake 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven.  Let cool on wire rack before cutting into squares.
