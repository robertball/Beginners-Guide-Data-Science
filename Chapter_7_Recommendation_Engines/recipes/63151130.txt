Ingredients:
1/4 cup warm water
1 Tbsp yeast
1 cup sour cream
2 Tbsp cup honey
2 Tbsp butter
1/4 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 egg
3 to 3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
Filling:
1 cup brown sugar
2 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon
1/3 cup butter

Directions:
Proof the yeast by combining it with the warm water.  Set aside.
Heat sour cream until lukewarm.
In a mixer combine the warm sour cream, honey, butter, baking soda, salt, eggs, and the water yeast mixture.
Add half the flour and mix.
Continue adding flour until the dough no longer sticks to the sides of the mixer.
Turn out and knead until smooth and elastic.
Cover and let rise until double in bulk.
Punch down and knead for a minute or so.
Roll out into rectangle, approx 12x16 inches.
Melt the butter and spread over dough.
Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together and spoon over butter.  Roll up the dough from the long side.
Cut into 12 even slices (to easily do this, cut in half, then cut each half into half, then each piece into 3 slices).
Place each slice into a 9x13 pan which has been sprayed with cooking spray.
Let rolls rise until double; this may take longer than white flour doughs.
Bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned.
