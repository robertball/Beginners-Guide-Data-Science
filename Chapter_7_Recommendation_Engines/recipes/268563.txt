Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 pounds butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into large chunks
1 onion, diced
1 teaspoon minced garlic
4 cups water
4 teaspoons chicken bouillon
2 teaspoons sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup unsweetened coconut milk, or more as needed
2 tablespoons chopped parsley, or to taste
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Heat olive oil in the pot. Add 1/2 of the butternut squash, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until starting to brown, 5 to 10 minutes.
Add remaining squash, water, chicken bouillon, salt, and ginger. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Strain off 1/2 of the cooking liquid. Blend soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Add enough coconut milk to reach the desired consistency and color. Garnish with parsley and drops of sriracha sauce.

Description: 
This is a surprise favorite of anyone who tries the soup. The sauteeing of veggies in the beginning brings out a rich flavor. My kids actually get excited when I make this! It keeps well for up to a week.
