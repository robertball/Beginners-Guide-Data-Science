Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable broth
1.3 cup millet
1 small sweet potato, peeled and shredded
1/4 cup mined onion (that's about 1/4 a medium-sized onion)
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme (you can always use fresh if you have it)
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the millet and the broth to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. When it boils, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and simmer the grain for about 20 minutes. You might need to check the level of the liquid to be sure it doesn't dry up and burn. You know, like rice. The millet will be tender when done.
In a medium sized bowl, stir together the sweet potato, onion, eggs, flour, thyme, pepper flakes and salt and pepper. When the millet is done, add it to the potato mixture and toss until everything is well-blended.
Heat a large saute pan and add either oil or cooking spray. Heat over medium-high and drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the pan. Flatten a bit into a patty shape and cook for about 6-7 minutes total, with a flip of the patty in the middle.
