Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/8 cup Balsamic Vinegar
1 can diced tomatoes
1 can tomato paste
1 cup broth
1 tablespoon italian seasoning
black pepper to taste
1 (15 ounce) can black olives, chopped
1 cup cottage cheese/fresh mozzarella/or queso fresco
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with a thin layer of cooking spray. Place squash halves cut side down on the baking sheet.
Bake squash 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife can be easily inserted. Remove from oven, and cool.
Meanwhile, add olive oil to a medium size saucepan. Over medium heat, saute the onion and garlic. Add the balsamic vinegar and reduce until slightly thick.  Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, broth, italian seasoning, and black pepper. Cook for about 15 minutes, or until you have a medium thick sauce.
Remove squash strands with a fork, reserving the shells. Layer each half with a spoonful of the sauce, a layer of spaghetti squash strands, olives, and cheeses. Repeat layers until shells are full, or until all of the ingredients are used. Top with mozzarella cheese.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese melts.
