Description: 
Translation: Ham in Maple Syrup. French-Canadian recipe usually served during the winter-season, or at the sugar shacks. It's great as a main meal served with mashed potatoes and carrots, but is also a great side dish for breakfast. This is my grandmother's traditional and delicious recipe!
