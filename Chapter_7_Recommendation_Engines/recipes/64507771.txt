1/2 cup melted shortening or butter
1/2 cup sugar
2 tsp salt

Scald milk and set aside to cool.
Beat egg in a bowl.   Add sugar, salt, milk and shortening.  Add softened yeast.   Stir in flour.
Knead and let rise 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  (If you don't have another warm place, you can turn the oven on low and put a damp cloth over the dough.)
