Ingredients:
6 asparagus spears, ends trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
2 egg whites
1 prebaked pizza crust (such as BoboliÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Cook asparagus until bright green and still crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain asparagus and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Pat dry with a towel.
Stir mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, and dry mustard together in a bowl.
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form, 2 to 4 minutes; fold into mayonnaise mixture.
Place pre-baked pizza crust onto a baking sheet, arrange asparagus on crust, and spoon mayonnaise mixture on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
