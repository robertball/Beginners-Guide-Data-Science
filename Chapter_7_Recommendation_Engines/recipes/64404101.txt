DIRECTIONS
In a large saucepan combine 5 Tablespoons Red Curry paste  with 2 cans coconut milk. If you are using lite coconut milk you may need additional cornstarch for thickness
Simmer for 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup fresh basil, 1/2cup bamboo shoots, 4 tsp Fish Sauce, 3 Tbsp brown sugar, 1/3 cup chicken stock, and Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. If sauce is too runny add a heaping tsp of corn starch to 1/4 cup of chicken stock and stir in
While you are simmering -- saute the chopped peppers  and chopped onion in a frying pan or wok lightly covered in olive oil till onions are translucent. Fry lightly peppered chicken breasts till cooked through. Or you can use a half rotisserie chicken or left over seasoned chicken. We love to use leftover Aleppo Chicken
Add chicken, peppers and onion to curry sauce. Simmer 10 minutes and serve over rice.
