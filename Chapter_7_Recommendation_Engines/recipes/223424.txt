Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup butter, softened

1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix flour, baking soda, and baking powder in a small bowl.
Beat butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth; stir in egg and vanilla extract. Gradually blend flour mixture into butter mixture. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and toss in 1/4 cup sugar; place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until golden, 8 to 9 minutes. Let stand on cookie sheet 2 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
Quick and easy sugar cookies. They are really good plain or with candies in them. My friend uses chocolate mints on top, and they're great!
