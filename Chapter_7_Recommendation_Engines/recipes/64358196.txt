Ingredients:
1 pkg. Golden Butter Cake Mix
1/2 cup oil
4 large eggs
1 small can Mandarin orange segments, undrained
1 can crushed pineapple in juice
1 small pkg. vanilla instant pudding
12 oz. Cool Whip, thawed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
Mix together the cake mix, oil eggs and mandarin orange segments with their juice; beat well.
Pour into 3 greased and floured 8 inch pans or 2 9 inch pans.  Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until the cake starts pulling away from the sides of the pan.
Cool for 10 minutes in the pans then remove to racks to finish cooling.
Partially drain some of the pineapple juice and discard.  Mix the rest into the vanilla instant pudding mix and stir together well.  Fold this mixture into the Cool Whip until blended.  Frost the cooled layers.  Store in the fridge until ready to serve.
