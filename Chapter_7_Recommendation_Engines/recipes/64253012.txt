Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups plus 1 teaspoon hot water, divided
2 cups brown sugar
2 tablespoons lard (or butter)
1 cup raisins
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, add 2 cups of the hot water, brown sugar, lard, raisins, salt, spices and cocoa powder and cook over medium-high heat until it comes to a boil.
Stir constantly for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat and let it cool until it reaches room temperature.
In a large bowl, measure out the flour and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. and line the bottom of a 9x5" loaf pan with wax paper, and then spray the paper and sides of the pan with cooking spray.
Dissolve the baking soda in 1 teaspoon of hot water, and then stir into the brown sugar mixture.
Pour everything into the flour and mix well, then scrape the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake for 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let it cool for about 20 minutes in the pan, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.
Wrapped in tinfoil, the cake will get spicier and keeps up to a week.
