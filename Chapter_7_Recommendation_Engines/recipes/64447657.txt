Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups almond flour
6 Tbsp coconut flour
1/2 cup unflavored whey protein powder
1 Tbsp baking powder
1 tsp garlic powder
3/4 tsp xanthan gum
3 large eggs
6 Tbsp butter, melted
3 cups shredded cheese* (Swiss, cheddar, mozzarella or a combination)
1 1/2 cups sliced ham**
1 egg yolk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 F.
Combine the almond flour, coconut flour, whey protein powder, baking powder, garlic powder and xanthan gum in a large bowl.
Add the eggs and melted butter to the flour mixture, then mix until dough is formed. Divide the dough in half.
Place one half onto a large piece of parchment paper.
Shape the dough into a rough circle. Top it with another piece of parchment paper, then roll out the dough into a 12-inch circle. (It should be quite thin.) Remove the top piece of parchment paper.
Sprinkle half of the cheese and half of the ham onto one half of the rolled out dough, leaving a 3/4-inch border.
Using the parchment paper, lift and fold the other half of the dough over the cheese and ham. Seal the calzone by pinching the edges of the dough together with your fingers.
Repeat steps 4 through 6 with the remaining dough, cheese and ham.
Transfer the calzones (with the parchment paper) onto a baking sheet.
In a small bowl, mix the egg yolk. Brush it over the calzones.
Bake the calzones for 25 to 30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.
