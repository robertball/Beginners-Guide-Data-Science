Ingredients:
Crisco速 Original No-Stick Cooking Spray
1 (19.5 ounce) package Pillsbury速 Classic Fudge Brownie
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup Jif速 Extra Crunchy Peanut Butter
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 (12 ounce) container extra creamy whipped topping, thawed and divided
Chocolate Shavings, as garnish (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray an 8 or 9-inch round springform pan with no-stick cooking spray.
Prepare brownie mix according to package directions. Spread batter evenly into springform pan. Bake 45 to 48 minutes for 8-inch or 36 to 38 minutes for 9-inch pan. Cool.
Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Gradually beat in peanut butter, powdered sugar and 3 cups whipped topping until well combined. Keeping dessert in springform pan, spread mixture evenly over cooled brownies.
Top with remaining whipped topping. Use the tines of a fork to create swirls in the whipped cream. Sprinkle chocolate shavings on top of whipped cream. Refrigerate 2 hours before serving.
