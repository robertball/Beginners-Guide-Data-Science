Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking soda
1/2 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup raisins
1/3 cup chopped pecans
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter
1 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 cup orange juice
3 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 loaf pans.
Sift flour, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Toss raisins and pecans with 1 tablespoon of the flour mixture in a separate bowl.
Beat sugar and butter together using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until fluffy. Add pumpkin puree, orange juice, eggs, and vanilla extract; blend until well combined. Add flour mixture slowly and blend thoroughly. Fold in raisins and pecans.
Pour batter evenly between the 2 prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until firm and tops spring back lightly when pressed, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely on racks before serving.
