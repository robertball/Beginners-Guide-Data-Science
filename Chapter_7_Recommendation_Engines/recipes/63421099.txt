Ingredients:
1/2    lb. small sausage breakfast links
4 Tbsn Butter
1/2 c  Brown sugar packed
4 sm.  apples, peeled and cut into eighths
CORNBREAD
1 c    flour
3/4 c  yellow cornmeal
3 Tbsn packed brown sugar
1 Tbsn baking powder
1 tsp  salt
1 lg   egg lightly beaten
4 Tbsn melted butter
1 c    milk

Directions:
Grease the bottom and sides of an 8 or 9 inch square baking pan.
Brown the sausages in a skillet until cooked thru.  Remove the meat and discard all but 2 tablespoons of the drippings.
Add 4 tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the pan.  Heat until the sugar is melted.
Add the apples and saute about 10 minutes until they are soft.
Arrange the sausages in rows across the square pan.  Insert the apple slices rounded sides down between the rows of sausages, wedging them in tightly.  Pour the juice from the skillet over all.  (The pan can be covered and refrigerated overnight at this point, if desired.  Bring to room temperature before proceeding.)
Heat the oven to 400.
To make the cornbread combine the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl.  Add the egg, melted butter, and milk.  Stir with a wooden spoon until well combined.  Pour the batter over the sausages and apples, smoothing the top to cover well.
Bake for 25 minutes or until a cake tester inserted into the bread comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and immediately invert onto a platter.
Cut into squares to serve.
