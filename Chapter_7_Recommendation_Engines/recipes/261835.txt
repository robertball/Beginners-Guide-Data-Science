Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower florets
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place cauliflower in a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain.
Transfer cauliflower to a food processor. Pulse into large, coarse crumbs.
Combine cauliflower crumbs, Cheddar cheese, bread crumbs, and eggs in a large bowl. Mix until combined. Shape mixture into 1-inch bites; place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms of tots are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Flip tots over and bake until browned on the opposite sides, about 10 minutes more.
