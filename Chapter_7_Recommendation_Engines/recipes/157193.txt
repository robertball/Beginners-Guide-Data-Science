Ingredients:
1 large yam, peeled and cut into 1/4 inch thick slices
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet or shallow baking dish with aluminum foil.
Arrange slices of potato in the prepared pan so they are overlapping slightly. Season with salt and pepper and then drizzle olive oil over them as evenly as possible.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and have begun to wrinkle around the edges, about 30 minutes.
