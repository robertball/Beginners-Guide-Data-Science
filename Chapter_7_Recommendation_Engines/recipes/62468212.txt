Ingredients:
2 cups Flour
1 cup of Crisco Lard
1/2 cup of cold water
Pinch of salt

Directions:
Put salt into the flour and stir in.  Next cut Crisco into the flour until thoroughly mixed.  Pour in cold water and mix only until all is mixed, do NOT overwork.  Take a fist sized portion of dough and roll into a circle approximately 1/8 inch thick.  Fold in 1/2 and place into a pie tin.  Cut off dough within an inch of the edge of the pie tin.
If you are making a one crust pie, cut small slices into the bottom of the crust, then place crust into the oven at 425 for 15 minutes, until golden brown.
For a two crust pie, place aside and prepare filling, then roll another crust and place over filling.  Cut edge as before and folder under and seal.  Cut vent slices into top crust, brush with egg whites for a glazed, shiny look.  Cook in over according to pie directions i.e. apple pie, berry pie, etc.
