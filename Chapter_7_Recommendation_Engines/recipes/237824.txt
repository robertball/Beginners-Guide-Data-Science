Description: 
Don't get me wrong; if you hand me a hot dog at the ball game, it's not like I'm going to throw it back in your face, but given the choice this butter-crisped, split-topped bun is the way to go. Thanks to its genius design the meat and fixings go in the top, which leaves three relatively flat sides to toast in butter.
