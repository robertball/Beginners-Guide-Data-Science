Ingredients:
10 large shrimp, peeled and deveined
3 ounces fresh crabmeat
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
8 flat taco shells
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup sour cream, for topping
1/4 cup salsa, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring 1 quart of water to a boil in a large pot. Place shrimp and crab in a steamer basket on top of the pot without touching water; cover. Steam until shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Remove shrimp and crab meat from steamer and chop. Combine seafood mixture and cream cheese in a bowl. Lay taco shells on a baking sheet and top with seafood-cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is completely melted, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven.
Cut each taco into 4 pieces using a pizza cutter and top with sour cream and salsa.
