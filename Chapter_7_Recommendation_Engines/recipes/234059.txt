Ingredients:
2 large pork chops
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard
4 cloves garlic, chopped
2 teaspoons dried thyme
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon mesquite-flavored seasoning
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Cut each pork chop from one side through the middle horizontally to within 1/2 inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book.
Whisk olive oil, brown sugar, lemon juice, mustard, garlic, thyme, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, mesquite seasoning, parsley, salt, and pepper together in a bowl and pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add pork chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 6 to 8 hours.

Description: 
This is the best pork chop marinade I've ever tasted. I starting throwing things together in a bowl and I'm so glad I wrote it down...try this! Flavor is best when pork is grilled.
