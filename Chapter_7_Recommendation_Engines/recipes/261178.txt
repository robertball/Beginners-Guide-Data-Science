Ingredients:
2 pounds pork ribs, cut into 2-inch sections
1/4 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more to taste
5 slices bacon, chopped
2 cups chopped onion
1 serrano pepper, thinly sliced
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (26.5 ounce) can BUSH'S® Black Beans, drained and rinsed
1 (26.5 ounce) can BUSH'S® Pinto Beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) jar pickled cactus strips (nopalitos) with liquid, such as Dona Maria®
4 cups cooked rice
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced
chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Sprinkle pork with salt and black pepper. Cook bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp and well browned; transfer to paper towel-lined plate, reserving 1/4 cup drippings in pot.
Brown pork pieces in bacon drippings over medium-high heat, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Work in batches; transfer browned pieces to a plate as they brown. Transfer all pieces back to pot, along with accumulated juices. Stir in onion, serrano pepper, broth, and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low or low to maintain a low simmer. Simmer, covered, 1 hour.
Stir in beans and cactus; simmer, uncovered, until heated through, 20 minutes more. Stir in bacon. Serve over rice and garnish with avocado and cilantro.
