Description: 
I made this dish with Hatch chiles that I had in my freezer and some onions and mushrooms that needed to be used. I served it over a bed of cilantro-lime rice. I shredded my chicken breast and mixed it in with the rice. Hubby preferred his chicken breast whole. We're going through a stay-at-home order due to the Coronavirus pandemic and this was a great meal to make with items that I already had.
