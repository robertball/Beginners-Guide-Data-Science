Ingredients:
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons file powder
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
2 green onions, chopped
2 large sweet onions, chopped
1 large green bell pepper, chopped
3 large tomatoes, peeled and chopped
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon salt
1 bay leaf
2 cups mushroom broth
1 1/2 cups uncooked brown rice
1 pound red snapper fillets, cut into 2 inch pieces

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Mix in flour, and whisk constantly 2 to 3 minutes, until a thick paste-like roux has formed.
Stir file powder, garlic, green onions, onions and green bell pepper into the roux. Cook and stir until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir tomatoes into the mixture. Season mixture with black pepper, cayenne pepper, allspice, cloves, salt and bay leaf. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is well blended, 10 to 15 minutes.
Pour in mushroom broth, and mix in rice. Increase amount of broth to cover all ingredients, if necessary. Bring to a boil, and mix in snapper. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 1 hour, or until rice is tender.

Description: 
This jambalaya may have been a few places since the bayou, but it's a thick, rich dish that everyone will love! I've experimented with many types of seafood in this recipe, and the flavor and consistency of snapper works the best. Serve with French bread and hot red pepper sauce!
