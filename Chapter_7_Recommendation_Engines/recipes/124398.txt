Description: 
AFTER our children left home, I had to learn to cook all over again, I began to economize on food purchases by buying some meats in quantity and freezing extras for future menus.    My husband especially loves this chicken recipe, which I pared down to fit our life-style today.                                        --Helen Whelan                                                         Jarrettsville, Maryland
