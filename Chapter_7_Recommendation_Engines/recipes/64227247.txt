2. Form the cheese mixture into a ball and gently roll in the chopped walnuts and pecans.

3. Bend the end of a Slim Jim to create the turkey neck and head. I find this works best when you warm the Slim Jim in your hand before you bend it - This way it won't break.

4. Mix cream cheese with a couple drops of yellow food coloring in a small zip lock bag. Clip the corner and squeeze cream cheese to create the beak.

6. I used a small piece of red licorice for the gobbler and stick it right into the cream cheese "beak" - this holds the licorice in place.  I arranged 3 rows of pretzel sticks for the feathers. The last row of feathers is thin breadsticks.

7. Serve with crackers and/or veggies - Gobble, Gobble!!
