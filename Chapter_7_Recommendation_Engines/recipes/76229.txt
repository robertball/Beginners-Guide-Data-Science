Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated piecrusts
1/2 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 large Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1 cup cranberries, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Unfold 1 piecrust; press out fold lines.  Fit piecrust into a 9-inch pie plate according to package directions.
Combine SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, flour, and cinnamon in a large bowl; add apples and cranberries, tossing gently. Spoon mixture into piecrust.
Unfold remaining piecrust; press out fold lines.  Roll to 1/8-inch thickness. Place over filling; fold edges under and crimp. Cut slits in top to allow steam to escape.
Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is golden. Cover edges with aluminum foil to prevent overbrowning, if necessary. Cool on a wire rack one hour before serving.
