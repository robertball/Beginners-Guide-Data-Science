Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package tri-color rotini pasta
1 small red onion, diced
1 cup diced roasted red peppers
1 cup cubed mozzarella cheese
1 (6 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1/4 pound salami, diced
3/4 cup sliced stuffed green olives
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives
1/2 cup sliced pepperoncini peppers (optional)
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup Italian-style salad dressing (such as Newman's Own®)
1/4 cup mayonnaise (such as Best Foods®)
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to cool.
Mix rotini, red onion, roasted red peppers, mozzarella cheese, artichoke hearts, salami, green olives, black olives, pepperoncini peppers, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and black pepper in a large bowl.
Whisk Italian-style dressing and mayonnaise together in a small bowl; pour over rotini mixture and toss to coat. Add Parmesan cheese and mix well. Refrigerate salad at least 2 hours before serving.

Description: 
This is my take on several different pasta salads I have tried. It's my daughter's favorite and I have taken it to several picnics and BBQs and it's always a bit hit. At serving time if pasta seems a little dry, drizzle with some olive oil and mix again.
