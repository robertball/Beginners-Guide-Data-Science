Ingredients:
1 cup Frank's Red Hot Sauce
1/3 cup honey
2/3 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Combine ingredients in saucepan and simmer for half hour stirring occasionally.  That's all there is to it.

Submitter: 
Drizzler
Description: 
This sauce tastes similar to the sauce used on Winger's sticky fingers.  It is easy to make and has endless possibilities for modification.  Try adding a bit of cinnamon or cloves to it.  Honey is used to thicken the sauce, but isn't necessary.  If not using the honey, just use extra brown sugar.
