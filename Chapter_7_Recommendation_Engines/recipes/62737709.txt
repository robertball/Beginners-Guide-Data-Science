Description: 
Created this dish because I needed to use up some imitation crab meat.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we do. Sweet, creamy and tastes decadent.  This dish makes a lot so bring your appetite! Use Pappardelle- long thin noodles about an inch wide or substitute egg noodles.  I am sure you can sub the real thing for imitation crab with the same results.
