Ingredients:
2 small red onions
6 cups finely shredded green cabbage
6 cups finely shredded red cabbage
5 carrots, peeled and grated
5 tablespoons white wine vinegar
3/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons caraway seeds
1 tablespoon mustard seeds
salt to taste

Directions:
Peel the onions and half lengthwise.  Thinly slice onion halves.  Place onion in a bowl of ice water, and let soak for 5 minutes.  Drain well in colander.
In a large heatproof bowl, toss together the green and red cabbage, onion, carrot and vinegar.
In a small skillet, heat the olive oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking.  Add the caraway and mustard seeds, and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the mustard seeds stop popping.  Drizzle the hot oil mixture immediately over the cabbage mixture and toss the coleslaw well.  Add salt to taste and toss again.

Description: 
This is a nice change for coleslaw and the tangy vinaigrette is one you will want to make over and over!  A nice accompaniment to a plain meat dish.
