Ingredients:
6 Large Potatoes
Approx 6 Tablespoons Olive Oil
1/2 Cup grated parmesan cheese
Freshly cracked black pepper and sea salt

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 220 degress ceclius.
Peel and quarter potatoes. Par Boil for approximately 15 mins in a large pot. You want them firm but able to break apart when you prick them with a fork.
Drain the potatoes and place back in the pot. Scruff the potatoes by shaking the pot backwards and forwards. Make sure not to break them up too much, you still want reasonable size pieces.
Place potatoes, oil, parmesan and a generous amount of salt and pepper into baking dish. If there is not enough oil, add more until potatoed are really well coated. This ensures you get a great golden crunch.
Bake potatoed for approx 1 hour. Make sure to check them every 15 mins or so, shaking the pan to turn them, giving them an even coat.
Serve with any type of meat, they are so yummy!
