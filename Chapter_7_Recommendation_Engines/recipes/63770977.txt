Description: 
his rub is built on the basics of barbecue. The combination of paprika, sugar, and salt give it the color and the flavor affect you want while the other ingredients add depth. This is a simple rub and the perfect place to start if you are new to smoking brisket. This is one of my most popular rub recipes, not just brisket rub recipe
