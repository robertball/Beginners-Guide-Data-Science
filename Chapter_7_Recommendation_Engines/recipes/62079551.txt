Ingredients:
2 egg yolks
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons orange juice
4 teaspons water
8 teaspoons melted butter
Salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste.

Directions:
In a 2 cup microwave dish, that you can use a small whisk in, mix all the ingredients together.
Set microwave for 1 minute on high.
Cook for 15 seconds, remove and whisk.
Cook for a further 15 seconds and whisk again. Now just check to see if it needs more cooking, it will probably foam up on the edges a little, this is fine. It will come up glossy and smooth. Be cautious on giving it just 10 seconds more. That should be enough.
Once you have made it once or twice you will get the hang of it. And it is so easy to remember, 1,2,4,8.
