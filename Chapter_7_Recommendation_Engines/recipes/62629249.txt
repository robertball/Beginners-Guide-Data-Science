Ingredients:
1 lb raisins
1/2 lb currants
1/4 lb prunes
1/4 lb mixed peel
1/4 lb chopped pecans
3/4 cup rum, I use dark spiced rum but any is fine
3 3/4 cups dark brown sugar, divided
1/2 cup hot water
1 cup butter, softened
6 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp allspice
1/2 tsp nutmeg
3 tbsps instant coffee, I use Maxwell House

Directions:
Fruit Mixture:
Grind the raisins, currants, prunes and mixed peel in a food processor until a paste forms. Scrape the paste out of the food processor into a bowl, add chopped pecans and rum. Cover with saran wrap and place in the fridge for a minimum of 2 weeks.
Fruitcake:
In a medium saucepan place 2 1/4 cups brown sugar over medium heat, stir until melted, add hot water, stir, reduce heat and simmer until dark brown, let cool.
In a large bowl cream butter and remaining 1 1/2 cups brown sugar.
Add eggs, beat well to combine.
Add vanilla, baking powder, spices, instant coffee, rum soaked fruit and cooled melted brown sugar, stir to combine.
Fold in flour gently, do not overmix.
Pour into a well greased and floured (I use baking Pam or Baker's Joy spray) 9 inch springform pan or 8 pot pie pans.
Bake at 300 degrees for 2 to 2 1/2 hours for the 9 inch pan or 45 to 60 minutes for the pot pie sized pans.
Allow to cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes, run a sharp knife around the edge of the pan and remove ring, allow to finish cooling. For pot pie pans run a knife around the edge and remove the fruitcake while still warm from the pan so they don't stick.
When completely cool brush cake with rum, the cake can now be wrapped in foil and stored in the fridge or freezer or I place it in a Tupperware container and brush once in a while with additional rum.
