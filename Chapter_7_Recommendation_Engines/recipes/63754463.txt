Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Set aside in cool water.
In a large heavy skillet saute mushrooms, garlic and onions. Add ground turkey and sausage and cook until evenly brown. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat, and stir in spinach, parsley, ricotta and Parmesan cheese. And a little bit of mozzarella or cheese blend.
