Ingredients:
1 cup butter
12 oz. (1 bag) milk/semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 cups flour
1 cup brown sugar
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup sugar
1 4 oz Hershey Bar (grated)
2 1/2 cups blended oatmeal
2 eggs
1 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. vanilla
1 1/2 cups chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Measure oatmeal, and blend in a blender to a fine powder.
Cream the butter and both sugars together.
Add eggs and vanilla to the sugar and butter mixture.
Mix in flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and baking soda to the creamed mixture.
Then add chocolate chips, grated Hershey Bar, and nuts to complete the dough.
Roll dough into balls and place two inches apart on a lightly greased cookie sheet.
Bake for 10-12 minutes at 375 degrees until golden brown.
If you use a baking stone, will need about 15 minutes of cooking time.

Description: 
I had a friend who hates oatmeal in their chocolate chips cookies, so of course I didn't tell him that there was any, and to this day these are his favorite oatmeal free cookies!  You have to try them!
