Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups chopped strawberries
3 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line with paper liners.
Beat 3/4 cup sugar and butter together in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add egg and mix well.
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl. Add flour mixture and milk alternately to butter mixture until combined. Stir in vanilla extract. Gently stir in strawberries.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Combine 3 teaspoons sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle over tops of muffins.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
