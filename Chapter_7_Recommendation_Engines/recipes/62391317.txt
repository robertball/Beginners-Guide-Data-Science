Description: 
Bessie is a former co-worker of mine and this salad is what she brought to our monthly potlucks.  When I asked her if she'd write up the recipe for me, she said No, there's only five ingredients.  Surely you don't need that written down! Then she proceeded to rattle it off.  It's just wonderful, but it really needs to sit in the fridge a day before it's served.
