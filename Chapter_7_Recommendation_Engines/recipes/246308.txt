Ingredients:
2 frenched racks of lamb
6 ounces wild game rub (see footnote)
Yuzu Aioli:
1/2 teaspoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/2 lemon, juiced
Salt to taste
1 1/2 cups canola oil
1/2 cup olive oil
2 eggs
1/4 cup yuzu juice (or substitute lime juice), or more to taste

Directions:
Take the two lamb racks and cut them into 1-inch bone chops and set aside.
Whisk white vinegar, mustard, lemon juice, and salt together in a metal mixing bowl. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time.
Mix together the canola oil and olive oil. Slowly drizzle the blended oil into the egg mixture, whisking constantly until it begins to thicken; this should double in volume with mayo-like consistency. Add salt to taste. Add yuzu juice at the end to desired flavor.
Turn the skillet on to medium high heat.
Place lamb chops on cutting board and season both sides well with the game rub.
Add oil to the hot skillet; place chops in hot oil one at a time. Let them cook about 1 1/2 minute per side for a medium rare.
Once finished on grill, take off heat and place on platter and top with the yuzu aioli.
