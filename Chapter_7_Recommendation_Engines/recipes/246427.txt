Description: 
When the weather gets hot, we make a big salad for supper several times a week. This part antipasto, part tuna pasta salad, is my husband's favorite. With some crusty bread, it is a meal all in itself. It is easily adaptable to your family's preferences. I sometimes add other kinds of marinated vegetables and/or strips of mozzarella cheese or provolone cheese.
