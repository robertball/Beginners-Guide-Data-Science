Ingredients:
Topping:
3/4 cup (3 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
3/4 cup pecans, chopped fine
3/4 cup old-fashioned rolled oats (see note)
1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon table salt
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
Apple Filling:
3 pounds Golden Delicious apples (about 7 medium), peeled, cored, halved, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges (see note)
1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees.
FOR THE TOPPING: Combine flour, pecans, oats, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and salt in medium bowl. Stir in butter until mixture is thoroughly moistened and crumbly. Set aside while preparing fruit filling.
FOR THE FILLING: Toss apples, granulated sugar, and cinnamon together in large bowl; set aside. Heat butter in oven-proof skillet over medium heat. When foaming subsides, add apple mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until apples begin to soften and become translucent, 12-14 minutes. (Do not fully cook apples.)
Sprinkle topping evenly over fruit, breaking up any large chunks. Place skillet on baking sheet and bake until fruit is tender and topping is deep golden brown, 15-20 minutes.
Cool on wire rack until warm, at least 15 minutes, and serve.

Description: 
Adapted from America's Test Kitchen.  
Golden Delicious apples work for this recipe, but any sweet, crisp apple such as Honeycrisp or Braeburn can be substituted; do not use Granny Smith. While rolled oats are preferable in the topping, quick-cooking oats can be substituted. Serve the apple crisp warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.
