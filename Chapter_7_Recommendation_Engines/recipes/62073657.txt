Ingredients:
1 16 oz. bottle Wish-Bone Fat-Free Italian salad dressing
1 can dark beer, any kind
1 cup BBQ sauce (sweet or smoky, your choice -- I like KC Masterpiece, Original or Spicy Original flavor)
8 boneless chicken breasts

Directions:
In a 2-gallon resealable plastic bag, pour salad dressing and beer.  Seal bag, and shake to mix.
Rinse chicken breasts and trim off the white tendon.  Add to bag.
Squeeze as much air out as possible, and seal bag.
Refrigerate at least four hours, no more than 24 hours.  Occasionally, turn bag over to marinate all chicken pieces.
Oil grill grate, and turn to medium-high heat.  Add chicken breasts to grill and cover.  Cook 3 minutes per side, then start brushing BBQ sauce on all pieces.  Cook another 3 minutes per side and keep basting with lots of BBQ sauce.  When chicken is done, discard basting BBQ sauce!
Serve with additional BBQ sauce, and enjoy.  Have plenty of moist towlettes handy!

Description: 
My best friend Michelle shared this recipe with me after a batch of the best BBQ chicken I've ever had!  This is the only way I make BBQ chicken anymore, and I always get asked for the recipe.  Wow 'em at your next barbecue with this one -- all you need is corn on the cob and a green salad, and just wait for the compliments to roll in!
