Ingredients:
For the Dough:
2 3/4 cup plain flour, plus extra for dusting the counter
2 tbsp sugar
1 1/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp. salt
1 1/4 cup buttermilk
6 tbsp melted butter
* * *
For the filling:
4 tbsp. melted butter
1/2 c. sugar
1/4 c. cinnamon
1 c. chopped walnuts
* * *
For the glaze:
2 tbsp. water
3/4 to 1 c. powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425°F or 220°C.
In a bowl, mix together the dry ingredients for the dough (flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt).
Stir in the butter and buttermilk.
At this point, the dough will be sticky, so just spoon it on top of a heavily floured surface, and add a bit more flour to the top.
With floured hands, gently knead the flour into the dough (adding more flour if necessary) until the dough is manageable and is fairly smooth.
With a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a rectangle/square of approximately 1/2 inch thick.
Spread the surface of the dough with 4 tbsp melted butter, then sprinkle on the cinnamon, sugar, and walnuts.
Roll the dough from the longer side, and cut the dough to about 2 inches thick.
Place the rolls in a lightly greased pan, and bake at 220°C for about 25 minutes, or until the edges have turned golden brown.
To prepare the glaze, mix the water, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar, and pour onto the rolls while they’re still hot.
