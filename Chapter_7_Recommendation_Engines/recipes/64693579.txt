Ingredients:
2 medium eggplants
Sauce, homemade or jar
2-4 Cups shredded mozzarella
1 Cup Parmesan cheese
1/2-1 Cup Extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425.
Wash and slice eggplant into to 1/2” slices.
Brush sheet pans with olive oil (I use 3 pans).
Place eggplant slices on sheet pan without layering or overcrowding.
Brush tops of eggplant with olive oil.
Lightly salt each slice of eggplant.
Bake eggplant in oven for approximately 20 minutes until cooked through.
In a 1.5 quart baking dish, add a 1/4 Cup of sauce and spread evenly.
Place several eggplant slices on top of sauce in a single layer.
Sprinkle eggplant with mozzarella.
Add another 1/4 Cup of sauce.
Repeat process of layering eggplant, sauce and cheese.
Top the last layer with some sauce and the Parmesan cheese.
Bake in oven for 30 minutes or until hot and bubbly.
I like to serve mine with spaghetti.
Mangia!
