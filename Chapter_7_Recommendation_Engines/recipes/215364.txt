Ingredients:
1/4 cup coriander seeds
1/4 cup sesame seeds
2 tablespoons whole cumin seeds
1 tablespoon black peppercorns
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
1/2 cup prepared dry-roasted almonds
1 teaspoon fresh thyme
2 teaspoons kosher salt or sea salt
Pita bread or hearty, crusty dipping bread
Olive oil

Directions:
Heat a heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Stirring frequently, toast coriander seeds, sesame seeds, cumin seeds, peppercorns and fennel seeds until slightly brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Cool and transfer to food processor. Add almonds, thyme and salt. Grind until crumbly; do not allow mixture to become a paste.
Serve Dukkah in a bowl or plate, along with a bowl or plate of olive oil and bread. Dip bread first in olive oil and then in Almond Dukkah so it adheres to the olive oil; serve as an appetizer or hearty and nutritious snack.
