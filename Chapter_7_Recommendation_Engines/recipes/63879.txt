Ingredients:
3 acorn squash (each about 28 ounces)
1 (28 ounce) can BUSH'S® Vegetarian Baked Beans, drained
4 tablespoons barbecue sauce
2 tablespoons maple syrup or honey
4 tablespoons dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons salted butter

Directions:
Cut each squash in half widthwise. Slice 1/4-inch off rounded end of each half so the squash sits upright without wobbling. Scrape out seeds with spoon and discard.
Mix BUSH'S Vegetarian Baked Beans, barbecue sauce, maple syrup and brown sugar in small mixing bowl. Divide mixture evenly among squash halves and top each half with 1/2 tablespoon butter. (The squash can be prepared several hours ahead to this stage and refrigerated.)
Preheat grill to medium*. Arrange the squash halves on grill away from the heat. Cook until squash is tender (sides will feel soft when squeezed) and filling is browned and bubbling, about 1 hour. Remove squash from grill and serve immediately.
