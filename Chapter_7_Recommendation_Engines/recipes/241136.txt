Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (20 ounce) package fresh (not frozen) hash brown potatoes

4 eggs, beaten
2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese (or favorite shredded cheese)

Directions:
Cook smoked turkey sausage slices in a skillet over medium heat until browned on both sides, about 8 minutes.
In a separate pan, cook fresh hash brown potatoes in butter and olive oil until starting to brown. Add eggs and stir constantly until eggs appear to be mostly cooked, but not over-cooked. Add browned Smoked Turkey Sausage to hash browns.
Sprinkle in the shredded cheese and gently stir until melted.
