Description: 
Quinoa - an ancient food from South America - is actually a seed. But it counts as a whole grain and is featured in the Latin American food pyramid. Its golden color and nutty flavor make it a perfect partner for smooth and creamy avocados. You'll find quinoa in your supermarket with other grains. Avocados are another favorite from South America and found in the pyramid. Serve this as a side, a salad or a main dish.
