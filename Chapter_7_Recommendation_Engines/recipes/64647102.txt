Description: 
I made this dish as one of the recipes for a charity event to benefit Place of Hope. We received amazing vegetables as donations and I thought this dish would be perfect.  I wish we grabbed a photo of my friend Suhiel spiralizing an entire box of zucchini!  

You can add poultry or seafood to make this dish hearty or enjoy as is for a perfect side dish or vegetarian option.  

Enjoy!
