Ingredients:
2 large sweet potatoes
3 to 4 Tbsp olive oil
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp seasoned salt, such as Lawry's
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1 to 2 Tbsp hot sauce (to taste)
black pepper to taste

Directions:
Scrub sweet potatoes and dry thoroughly.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Place olive oil, spices, and hot sauce in a mixing bowl, combine well.  Cut potatoes into thick fries and toss in olive oil mixture until all fries are completely coated.  Place on a stoneware sheet or cookie sheet.  Bake  for approximately 18-25 min (depending on your oven and thickness of fries), turning a little over half way through.  Fries should be light to medium browned when done.   Enjoy!
