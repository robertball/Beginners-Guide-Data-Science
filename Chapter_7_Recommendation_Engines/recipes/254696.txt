Ingredients:
1/2 cup diced pancetta or bacon
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (3 ounce) package ramen noodles, coarsely broken in package (flavor packet discarded)
1 (10 ounce) package frozen peas
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus additional for serving
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Cook pancetta or bacon in oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion and salt and cook, stirring, until onion is softened, about 4 minutes. Add noodles and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add peas and broth to skillet and bring mixture to a boil. Cook, stirring, until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes.
Remove skillet from heat and stir in butter, Parmesan, and pepper. (If mixture is a bit soupy, let it stand for 1 to 2 minutes to allow noodles to continue to absorb liquid.) Serve with additional Parmesan, if desired.
