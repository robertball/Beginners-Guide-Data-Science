Ingredients:
1 ½  cup of  buckwheat
½ pound pork/ beef
5 cups of water
1 carrot
1 white onion
1 bell pepper
2 tablespoons of sour cream
1 tablespoon of cooking oil
Bay Leaves
Salt
Pepper
Dill
Parsley

Directions:
Wash the buckwheat and drain the water twice, for the third time pour the hot water into your buckwheat and let it soak.
Preparing the stock:
Wash and cut in square pieces ( ~1 inch wide) the meat, peel the carrot and onion. Shred the carrot and finely chop the onion. Take the saucepan and pour 5 cups of water in it, add the meat, carrot and ½ of the cut onion. Add freshly ground black pepper, salt, couple bay leaves. Boil at medium heat for 20 minutes. Clean of seeds and wash the bell pepper, finely chop it and add in 5-10 minutes after you put the stock on gas.
***Tip from Helen: the heat should be medium and you should watch so that the stock would boil slowly and be transparent. The fat off meat and foam should be skimmed. Watch for this carefully. You don’t need these in your stock.***
After 20 minutes of stock cooking add the buckwheat and let the soup boil for 15-20 more minutes. Meanwhile, take 2-3 eggs (depending in how many plates you serve) and put the boil.
Take the second half of chopped onion and, fry it at medium heat until golden brown. Add 2 tablespoons of sour cream and let it braise for 2-3 minutes.  After you see that your buckwheat is cooked add the sauce of onion and sour cream to your soup.
Chop the herbs and throw into the saucepan 2-3 minutes before serving (herbs are not vital, but they will add the flavor).
Take your hard boiled eggs, remove the sells, cut in halves and put in the plate. Pour your soup in the plates. Your soup is ready to be served.
Enjoy!
