Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 yellow onions, chopped
3 bell peppers, chopped (red, yellow, orange, or a mix also works)
3 jalapeño peppers, seeded and finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 pound ground turkey
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin purée
1 small can (4.5oz) diced green chiles
1 cup chicken broth (optional)
2 tablespoon chili powder
1.5 teaspoon ground cumin
Dash of Mexican chili powder (optional)
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
Ground black pepper, to taste
1 (15-ounce) can navy beans, rinsed and drained (can also use kidney or black beans)
Hot sauce to taste - I used Frank's Red Hot
Sour cream (optional garnish)
Tortilla chips (optional garnish)
Shredded mexican cheese (optional garnish)
Chopped cilantro (optional garnish)
Fresh lime juice (optional garnish)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, jalapeños and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add turkey and cook until browned. Add tomatoes, pumpkin, chiles, 1 cup water (or chicken broth), chili powder, Mexican chili powder (optional), cumin, salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and add beans. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes more. Ladle chili into bowls and mix with hot sauce.  Garnish as desired.

Description: 
Turkey chili with pumpkin to thicken it up and make it healthier.  Adapted from www.wholefoodsmarket.com/recipe/turkey-pumpkin-chili.  I buy prechopped onions/peppers/garlic/jalapenos, and then it is super easy! Adding the hot sauce makes a big difference, so I definitely recommend adding it!
