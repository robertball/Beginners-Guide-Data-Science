Ingredients:
Bread (use whatever you like but CUT IT THICK), Eggs, Milk, Salt, Sugar, Cinammon, Vanilla.

Directions:
Preheat Oven (conventional or toaster oven are both fine) to 350 degrees F. Beat 4 Eggs well and add 3/4 C Milk until mixture is relatively thin.  The idea is for the bread to completely absorb the Egg/Milk mixture. Add 1-2 tsp Vanilla Extract (to taste), 1-2 Tbsp Sugar, 1-2 tsp Cinammon (to taste), and a dash of Salt.  Mix until all ingredients are incorporated.  Soak each piece of bread until bread is completely saturated.  Cook on medium-high griddle just long enough to brown each side then transfer to baking sheet.  Bake until bread begins to "fluff up", approximately 10 minutes or so.  Serve immediately topped with butter and syrup or your favorite fruits and whipped cream.
