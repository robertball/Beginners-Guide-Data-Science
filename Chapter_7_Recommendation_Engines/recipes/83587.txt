Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon
1 medium onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 quart chicken stock
2 avocados - peeled, pitted, and chopped
1/2 cup white wine
1 lime, juiced
1 cup heavy cream
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until evenly brown. Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon grease in the skillet, chop, and set aside. Place onion and celery in the skillet, and cook until tender.
Transfer the onion and celery to a blender or food processor. Pour in 1/2 the chicken stock, add avocados, and blend until smooth.
Transfer blender mixture to a large pot over medium heat. Whisk in remaining stock, wine, lime juice, and heavy cream. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until heated through, but do not boil. Garnish with chopped bacon to serve.

Description: 
Wonderful way to blend the tastes of avocado and bacon in a warm, hearty soup. Besides the bacon bits, this soup works with a dollop of sour cream and some lime zest. Eat with plenty of crusty bread.
