Ingredients:
8 ears fresh corn
1 stick butter, softened
1 fluid ounce bourbon whiskey
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
wood chips, soaked
salt to taste

Directions:
Pull corn husks back to remove and discard the silk. Pull husks back over the corn. Soak corn in a pot of water for 1 hour.
Place butter in a small dish. Add bourbon and cinnamon and carefully mix with a fork until well incorporated.
Preheat the smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).
Place corn, unstacked, onto wire racks. Place the racks into the smoker. Add wood chips according to manufacturer's directions. Smoke until corn is tender, turning halfway through, about 1 1/2 hours.
Pull husks off corn and spread the bourbon butter over corn. Sprinkle with salt.

Description: 
Sweet summer corn is lightly smoked and covered in a subtle, yet delicious bourbon-cinnamon butter. If you already have other foods going in your smoker at a higher temp, throw the corn in - just reduce the time slightly. I like using maple or fruit woods, but for a smokier flavor, use hickory or mesquite.
