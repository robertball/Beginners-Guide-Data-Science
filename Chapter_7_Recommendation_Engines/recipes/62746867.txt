2 T + 2 t salt
1 lb elbow macaroni
2 T butter
1 c chopped onion
2 lb ground beef, chuck or round
1 can (10 1/2 oz) tomato puree (1 1/4 c)
1 can (6 oz) tomato paste
1/4 t pepper
1/4 t cinnamon
1/3 c fine dry bread crumbs
1 egg
1 1/2 c freshly ground Parmesan
Egg Sauce:
1/3 c butter
1/3 c flour
1 1/2 t salt
1/4 t pepper
1/8 t nutmeg
3 c milk, warmed to room temperature
2 eggs, warmed to room temperature

Directions:
In a large kettle bring the water and 2T of salt to a boil.  Gradually add macaroni so that water continues to boil.  Cook, uncovered and stirring constantly, until tender.  Drain in colander, cool to lukewarm.
In a large skillet, melt the butter, add onion and cook gently, stirring occasionally until golden brown.  Add beef; break up with a fork and cook until meat loses its red color.  Stir in puree, paste, 2 t salt, pepper and cinnamon.  Simmer, covered, about 30 minutes.  Stir in bread crumbs.
In the same pot in which the macaroni was cooked, beat one egg enough to combine the yolk and white; add macaroni and toss.
Prepare Egg Sauce.  In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt butter, stir in flour, salt, peper and nutmeg; remove from heat.  Gradually stir in 2 1/2 c milk keeping smooth.  Cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until thickened and boiling.  Beat eggs slightly; add remaining 1/2 c milk; beat to combine; stir into hot sauce.  Over moderate heat cook and stir constantly until eggs are thickened - Do Not Boil.
In a 3 quart oblong pan (13 1/2 x 8 3/4 x 1 3/4") or similar utensil, arrange half the macaroni and sprinkle with 1/4 c Parmesan; add the meat mixture and sprinkle with 1/4 c Parmesan; add remaining macaroni.
Slowly and carefully pour as much as you can of the egg sauce over the top; use a spatula to push the macaroni away from sides of dish so you can pour remaining sauce at edges, dish will look very full.  Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan.
Bake in preheated 375 degree F oven until bubbly hot in center and top browns, approximately 30 - 40 minutes.  Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
