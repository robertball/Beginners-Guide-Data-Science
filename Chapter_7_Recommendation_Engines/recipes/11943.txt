Ingredients:
12 ounces ziti pasta
2 tablespoons pesto
1 (26 ounce) jar tomato basil pasta sauce
salt to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan over medium-low heat, mix together the pesto and basil tomato sauce. Bring to a simmer, and season with salt to taste. (You can also heat the sauce in a covered microwave-safe bowl: cook on high for one minute.)
Place pasta in a large serving bowl. Toss with pesto-tomato sauce. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.
