Ingredients:
1 cup butter, melted
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon coffee flavored liqueur
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, mix together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and coffee liqueur. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the sugar mixture until well blended. Stir in chocolate chips. Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This is a recipe me and my friend Christine managed to perfect through trial and error, it tastes exactly like Mrs. Field's cookies for some reason but the recipe is relatively original
