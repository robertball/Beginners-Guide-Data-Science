Ingredients:
1/2 cup almond butter
1 ripe banana, mashed
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons ground flax seeds
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup finely grated zucchini, excess moisture squeezed out
1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup bittersweet chocolate chips, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line muffin cups with aluminum foil liners.
Mix almond butter, banana, cocoa powder, ground flax seeds, honey, vanilla extract, and baking soda together in a bowl until batter is well blended; fold in zucchini and semisweet chocolate chips. Scoop batter into the prepared muffin cups. Top each with bittersweet chocolate chips.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Place muffins on a wire rack to cool.
