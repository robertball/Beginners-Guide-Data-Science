Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray cookie sheet with cooking spray. In a mixer bowl, combine the baking mix, cheese, melted butter, Old Bay seasoning, salt and buttermilk. Mix until dough is firm. Using a small scoop, place dough on the prepared pan.
Bake at 400 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 14 to 16 minutes, or until golden brown.
Combine the melted butter, garlic powder, onion powder and parsley (we add a few dashes of salt as well). Brush butter mix before placing in the oven. Then, when they are done brush with butter mix again.
