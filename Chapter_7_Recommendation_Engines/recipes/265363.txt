Ingredients:
3 large ripe peaches, peeled and diced
1 lime, juiced
2 tablespoons minced red onion
1/2 habanero pepper, seeded and minced, or more to taste
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine peaches, lime juice, red onion, habanero pepper, sugar, cinnamon, cloves, salt, and pepper in a bowl, stirring gently so peaches don't get bruised. Cover and refrigerate so flavors can meld, at least 2 hours.

Description: 
I love peach salsa! This is also good made with mangos, pineapple, papaya, plums, or any combination. Great with grilled chicken, turkey, or pork.
