Ingredients:
3 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
3 eggs
3 cups sugar
4 ripe bananas, well mashed
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, undrained
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a large fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl.
Mix together vegetable oil and eggs in a separate large bowl with an electric mixer. Add sugar and mix until well combined. Mix in bananas. Fold in flour mixture with a spatula until well combined. Fold in pineapple and pecans. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 90 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely.
