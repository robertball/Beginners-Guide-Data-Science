Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups flour
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/8 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup sugar
1 large egg
1 1/2 tsp. instant espresso powder
1 tsp. vanilla
1 cup mini chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugars with an electric mixer until fluffy. Beat in the egg. In a small bowl, stir together espresso powder and vanilla until powder dissolves. Beat espresso mixture into butter mixture until combined. Gradually stir in flour mixture until blended. Stir in chips and nuts.  Cover and refrigerate dough for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375. Drop heaping tablespoons of dough 2 inches apart on lightly greased cookie sheets. Bake on middle oven rack for 9 to 14 minutes, or until cookies are lightly browned on bottoms. Cool cookies on sheets for 2 minutes before removing.
