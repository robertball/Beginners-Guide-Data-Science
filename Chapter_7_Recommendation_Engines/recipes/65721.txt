Ingredients:
1 pound turkey breast slices
3 tablespoons Kikkoman Lite Soy Sauce
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

Cut turkey breast slices lengthwise into long, 1/4-inch wide strips; place in large bowl. Combine lite soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic powder and pepper. Pour over turkey strips; toss gently to coat well. Arrange strips, in single layer, being careful not to overlap, on 1 or 2 wire racks placed on large foil-lined baking sheet.
Bake in 150 to 175 degrees F oven 4 hours, or until dry. Loosen jerky while still warm; cool thoroughly on racks. Store in refrigerator in air tight container or plastic bag.
