Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
8 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup finely chopped dill pickles
2 tablespoons dill pickle juice
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons minced garlic
4 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon dill weed
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
2 bay leaves
1/2 cup white rice
2 cups warm milk

Directions:
Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Whisk in flour, and cook until the flour just begins to turn from white to a pale beige, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in chicken broth until thickened and smooth. Increase heat to medium high, add dill pickles, pickle juice, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, onion salt, dill weed, curry powder, white pepper, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes, whisking frequently. Remove from heat and whisk in milk. Remove bay leaves before serving.
