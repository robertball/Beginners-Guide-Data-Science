Description: 
This is a cheese vegetable soup recipe that my sister's husband developed that we've had in our family for quite a while. It's really good and freezes wonderfully; one ice cube tray of soup emptied into a freezer bag and then thawed is enough soup for 2 big (or 4 small) bowls when served!
