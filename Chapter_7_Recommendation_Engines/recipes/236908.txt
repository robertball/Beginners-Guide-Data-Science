Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon butter
4 cloves minced garlic
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup chopped green onion, divided
ground black pepper to taste
4 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
1 pinch paprika, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Rub potatoes with olive oil and salt; pierce each several times with a fork and arrange onto a baking sheet about 6 inches apart.
Bake in preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool until cool enough to handle, keeping oven heat at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Halve potatoes lengthwise and scoop potato from each half into a bowl, leaving about 1/4 inch of the potato attached to the skin all the way around.
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute garlic in butter until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir scooped potato, Monterey Jack cheese, sour cream, and most of the green onion together with the garlic and butter; cook and stir the mixture until heated and smooth, about 5 minutes.
Scoop the potato mixture into the potato skins and arrange onto the baking sheet.
Bake in oven until heated through, 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with remaining green onion, bacon, and paprika.
