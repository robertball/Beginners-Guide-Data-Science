Ingredients:
4 large boneless skinless chicken breast
4 slices (1 oz each) of your favorite ham lunchmeat
4 slices of your favorite Swiss cheese

Directions:
Cut the chicken breast lengthwise in a butterfly slice so that the meat will open like a book.
Cut the ham lunchmeat in half lengthwise and lay over opened chicken breast.
Place stuffed chicken breasts in a 9x13 baking dish & bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or till juice runs clear.
Turn off the oven & place sliced Swiss cheese over the top of each piece of chicken.  Let stand in oven a few minutes till cheese begins to melt.
Remove from oven & let stand 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
We like the ham, chicken & Swiss flavor combination but don't necessarily need the breading & all that so this is a simplified version of the classic.  Suitable for any weeknight as well since the prep time is minimal.
