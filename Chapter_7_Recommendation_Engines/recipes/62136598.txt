2 lbs.(or so) skinless boneless chicken breast
1 - 15 oz. bottle good soy sauce
1 to 2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 cup sugar

Directions:
Mix whole bottle soy sauce, sugar, worcestershire in large pot over high heat to melt sugar.
When sugar is melted, add chicken and cover chicken with stock(as much as needed).
When this comes to a boil turn down to medium heat. Cook for 1 to 2 hrs. The more time the better the taste....

Description: 
This is the best chicken I have ever had. I got the recipe from a friend who got it from his mother. Everyone I know who has tried it (It is my goto company recipe) loves it. Very Flavorful. Best served with rice.
