Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter, or more to taste
4 eggs
1 cup diced puffball mushrooms
1/2 cup diced green onions

Directions:
Place a skillet over medium heat and add butter.
Break eggs into a bowl, add mushrooms, and whisk together vigorously. Reserve about 2 tablespoons green onions.
Pour eggs into the hot butter in the skillet and scramble to create soft, fluffy curds. Add remaining green onions, salt, and pepper while scrambling to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes, being careful not to overcook. Garnish with reserved green onions.

Description: 
Puffball mushrooms are an edible species of fungi (calvatia gigante). The fluffy texture and earthy flavor is great in eggs, soups, and quiche. Be careful if you try to harvest wild puffball mushrooms; they can be mistaken for young amanita mushrooms, which can be toxic or downright deadly. To identify: When cut in half, the fungus should be solid and pure eggshell white or light yellow. There should be no outline of a small mushroom inside.
