Ingredients:
1/2 butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 pinch salt
1 yellow onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
8 (6 inch) flour tortillas
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
1 lime, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine cubed squash, 1 tablespoon oil, red pepper flakes, and garlic in a large bowl; mix to coat. Spread out on a baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until squash is tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven.
Combine black beans, cumin, chili powder, and salt in a small saucepan. Heat over medium-low heat until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and red bell pepper; cook and stir until tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Place 2 tortillas in the skillet and cook until heated through, about 1 minute per side. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
Top tortillas with baked squash, black beans, and onion-red pepper mixture. Garnish with green onions, cilantro, and lime.
