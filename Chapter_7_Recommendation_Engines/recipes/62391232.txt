Ingredients:
4 strips of bacon
4 garlic cloves, chopped small
6 potatoes, peeled and cubed small
2 tablespoons of vegetable base
1/2 of a medium onion diced
1 carrot sliced thin
2 stalks celery sliced thin
water (enough to cover potatoes and carrots)
1/2 stick of butter
2 cups milk
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 brick of Velveeta cubed
8 oz brick cheddar cheese cubed
green onions to garnish
Croutons or French Bread

Directions:
Prepare vegetables and garlic for cooking by washing and cutting as described above.
Pan fry bacon until desired crispness. Remove bacon from pan and crumble, set aside. Then add garlic, onion, and celery to remaining grease and cook until tender on low heat, about 5 minutes. Remove from pan (with grease) and set aside.
In a separate pot, add cubed potatoes and sliced carrots. Cover with water, then add vegetable base, butter, and 2 of the crumbled bacon strips. Boil about 10 minutes, until potatoes become soft. Add the milk, cream, and the vegetables and grease mixture. Simmer on low heat for an additional 10 minutes before adding the cheeses. Remove from heat and stir cheeses through. Soup will then thicken slightly.
Top with remaining crumbled bacon, green onions, and serve with french bread for dipping (or if you prefer, top with croutons).

The flavor you've been searching for, well.. I know I was! What's better is that my 8 year old son asked if there would be enough leftovers for him to have it for lunch and dinner tomorrow! A definite success for the tastebuds of potato soup lovers everywhere. Great on a cold winter day, or served with a fresh salad in the summer!
