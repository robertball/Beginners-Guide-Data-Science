Ingredients:
2/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup shortening
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup boiling water
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
3 eggs
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine 2/3 cup sugar, shortening, salt and 1 cup boiling water; set aside.
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. Add eggs and the water/sugar mixture; beat well. Beat in 2 cups flour. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix until a stiff dough has formed. Cover with a damp towel and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease three 8x8 inch baking pans.
In a small bowl, combine 1 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon. Roll dough into small balls. Dip balls in melted butter, then roll in cinnamon sugar. Roll balls into 4 inch long cylinders and tie into knots. Place knots into prepared pans.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, until golden. Serve warm.

My neighbor, Mrs. Baker, used to bake these cinnamon rolls and invite me and my children over while they were baking. The smell of homemade cinnamon rolls was irresistible.
