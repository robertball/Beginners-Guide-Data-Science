Ingredients:
2 1/2 lbs cherry tomatoes, halved, stems removed
1/2 cup sweet onion, finely chopped
juice from 1/2 lemon
3 tbsps balsamic vinegar
1 cup sugar
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp coriander
1/4 tsp cumin
1 cup finely chopped fresh basil

Directions:
1. Place all ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
2. Reduce heat to low, and simmer mixture until thickened and reduced by half, about 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally.
3. Remove from heat. Divide mixture between 2 pint sized, or 3 half pint sized, jars. Allow to cool slightly before placing lids on.
4.  Place lids on jars and keep refrigerated for up to 2 weeks, or freeze for up to 4 months.
Note: Sugar amount should be adjusted depending how sweet your tomatoes are. Simmering time may vary depending upon the moisture content within your particular tomatoes. If a smoother jam is required, puree the mixture before placing it into jars.

Description: 
A great sweet and savory way to use up any extra cherry tomatoes you might have! Tastes great on crackers with either goat cheese or cream cheese! This makes about a pint and a half of jam when it's all said and done.
