Ingredients:
2 bulbs fennel, cut into 4-8 pieces
2 medium red onions, cut into 8-12 pieces
Canola oil (or olive oil)
Fresh ground pepper
Kosher salt or sea salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Spread the fennel and onion on the tray.  Drizzle lightly with canola oil.  Add pepper and salt.  Mix everything together to coat well.  Add more oil, pepper, and salt if needed.  Try to spread out everything as much as possible so it's not touching and more of the surface will be cooked.  Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until vegetables are browned.
