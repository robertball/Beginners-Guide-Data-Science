Ingredients:
Gnocchi
--1 cup cold roasted garlic whipped potatoes (below)
--2 cups flour
--1 egg
--dash of salt
--dash of pepper
--1 tbsp butter
--1/2 clove garlic minced
--cubes roasted squash and\or roasted red pepper.
Roasted Garlic whipped potatoes
--6 medium potatoes
--1 tbsp unsalted butter
--1 tbsp heavy cream
--2 tbsp milk
--dash freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix roasted garlic whipped potatoes and flour.  Add whole egg, salt and pepper and knead into dough.  Add small amount of extra flour if required to produce bread dough consistency (not too dry but enough so that it does not easily stick to your hands).  Divide dough into 4 equal balls.  On a floured surface roll out each ball into a long sausage-like roll.  It should be approx. an inch in diameter.  Cut each sausage into segments anywhere between 3/4 and an inch wide. Boil the gnocchi in well salted water for 4-5 minutes.  The gnocchi are done about 30 seconds after floating to the surface. While Gnocchi are boiling, melt a tbsp of butter in frying pan. Once slightly brown, add minced garlic, roasted squash and\or roasted red pepper and Gnocchi directly from pot.  Saute the works in pan 30 seconds and transfer to plate.  Serve with ample freshly grated Parmesano Reggiano and freshly ground black pepper.
Whipped Potatoes:  Tightly wrap whole head of garlic drizzled with olive oil in tin foil. Roast in 350 degree oven for between 30 and 40 minutes or cloves are very soft. Meanwhile Place peeled potatoes whole in pot with well salted water. Boil approximately 30-35 minutes or until quite soft. Drain water, add milk, cream, butter and roasted garlic cloves. Whip mixture until very smooth.  I serve this with dinner and make the Gnocchi from the cold leftovers the next day.
