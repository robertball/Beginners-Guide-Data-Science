Ingredients:
1 russet potato, peeled and cubed
5 slices bacon, diced
1/2 onion, chopped
1 (6 ounce) can crab meat, drained
1/2 teaspoon parsley flakes
2 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup dry white wine (optional)
1 cube chicken bouillon
1 1/2 cups milk
1 (15 ounce) can creamed corn
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Wrap potato cubes in plastic wrap, and microwave for 30 seconds.  Set aside.
In a saute pan, cook bacon over medium heat until heated through, and add chopped onions.  Cook and stir until onions are clear. Stir in crab meat and parsley flakes.  Set aside.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a large stock pot over low heat.  Whisk in flour until mixture becomes creamy and takes on a eggshell color.  Continue to cook for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in wine.  Dissolve chicken bouillon in milk; when the flour mixture is crumbly, slowly whisk in the milk.  Mix well  in order to eliminate all lumps.
When the mixture is creamy and hot, stir in bacon mixture, cubed potatoes, and creamed corn.  Season with salt and pepper to taste, and simmer for 10 minutes.
For a creamy curry variation add 2  tablespoons curry powder after adding the wine to the flour mixture, and substitute cooked, cubed chicken for the bacon.
