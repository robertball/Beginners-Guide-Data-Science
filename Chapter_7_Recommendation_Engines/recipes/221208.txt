Description: 
This recipe is great to use up leftover ham from holiday dinners. It is warm and hearty and is very easy to make in your slow cooker. I love that the potatoes stay a nice, firm texture and yet are perfectly done. This chowder goes great with some cheesy biscuits or crescent rolls right out of the oven!
