Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3 large eggs
1/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon almond extract
3 pears, peeled and diced
1/2 cup blueberries
1/2 cup almonds, chopped

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch springform pan. Combine 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl; reserve.
Whisk together flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and baking powder in a large bowl. Use an electric mixer to beat the butter and 1 1/4 cups white sugar together in a separate large bowl. Beat until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Mix in 1/3 of the flour mixture until just combined. Beat in 1/2 of the milk and another 1/3 of the flour mixture. Repeat with the remaining milk and flour. Stir in the almond extract.
Gently fold pears, blueberries, and chopped almonds into the batter.  Pour into prepared pan. Sprinkle reserved sugar and cinnamon mixture over the cake batter.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.
