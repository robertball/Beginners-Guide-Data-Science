Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1 cup dark rum
1/2 cup brandy
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1/2 gallon whole milk
Grated nutmeg (optional)

Directions:
Dissolve sugar in rum, brandy and vanilla extract in a large, heavy pitcher. Add milk; freeze until very cold or even slushy, about 4 to 8 hours. (Can be frozen for a month.) Pour into glasses, grate nutmeg over each glass, if desired, and serve.

Description: 
Homemade eggnog is rich, extravagant, irresistible. But the ingredients - heavy cream, raw eggs, sugar and booze - give one pause. A few years back, I discovered a delicious high-flavor, no-risk alternative: milk punch, made with whole milk (no cream, no eggs). And it's easy to make. No cooking, no whipping egg whites and cream: Just mix and freeze. Make a pitcher today, and stick it in the freezer for the season. The spirits keep the milk from freezing; the freezer keeps the milk from spoiling. But remember, it's potent - one of my friends calls it 'the adult milkshake'!
