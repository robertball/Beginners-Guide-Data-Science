1/4 cup corn starch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon of butter

Marshmallow frosting:
2 egg whites
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar

Directions:
Heat oven to 350F(180C)
Grease and flour two 9 inch, or three 8 inch round layer pans.
Measure all ingredients into large mixer bowl and blend 30 seconds on low speed, scraping the bowl constantly. Beat 3 minutes on high speed and scrape bowl occasionally. Pour into pans.
Bake for 30 to 35, until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool.
While the cakes cool, mix the sugar, corn starch and salt from the Butterscotch filling recipe into a sauce pan, and stir in water.
Cook, stirring constantly until mixture thickens and boils. Boil and stir for 1 minute, blend in the butter, and let it cool.
Combine the egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar, syrup and water in the top of a double boiler.
Place it over boiling water and beat with a mixer until stiff peaks form, scraping the pan occasionally.
Remove from heat and add marshmallow creme or marshmallows and continue beating until it is of a good spreading consistency.
Turn out cakes from pans, spread butterscotch filling over bottom layer, sprinkle with nuts.
Top with other layer and frost sides and top of cake with marshmallow frosting.**
Melt 1/2 square of unsweetened chocolate, dip back of spoon into it, and form swirls on top of cake.
