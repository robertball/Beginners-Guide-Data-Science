- In small food processor, mince the onion (and fresh garlic if using).
- Peel and Cut Carrots and Potatoes and set aside (place potatoes in cold water to prevent browning).
- Sprinkle Chicken with kosher salt on both sides
- start cooking your rice and have all other ingredients out and ready for use.
Heat oil in large pan with high sides over medium-high heat. Brown chicken on both sides. Brown in batches and add more oil, little by little, if necessary. Once Chicken is browned and removed from pan, saut√© onions until translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add broth, tomato sauce, wine, oregano, cumin, salt & pepper to taste (about 1 -2 tsp of each). Return chicken to the pan. Add potatoes, carrots and cover. Reduce temperature to medium to medium-low and cook for about 30 minutes or until chicken is done. Alternatively, use a pressure cooker and cook under pressure for about 10-15 minutes.
Serve chicken with carrots, potatoes and sauce over a bed of rice on each plate.
