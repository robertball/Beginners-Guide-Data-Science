Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
1 cup chicken broth, divided
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
8 ounces dry fettuccini pasta

Directions:
Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm oil and brown sides of chicken. Place chicken in slow cooker. Add butter and garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and the chicken broth to pick up the chicken drippings and bits. Transfer to slow cooker. Simmer in crock pot for 6-8 hours on low. During the last 30 minutes of cooking, add the cream and basal and turn the slow cooker heat on high; Simmer until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. (Alternate option: transfer to pot and simmer til it is done). Adjust seasoning to taste.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10  minutes or until al dente; drain, transfer to a bowl and toss with 3 to 4 tablespoons of the sauce.
Cut each chicken breast into 2 to 3 diagonal slices. Reheat the sauce gently if needed. Transfer the pasta to serving plates; top with chicken and coat with the cream sauce; serve.
