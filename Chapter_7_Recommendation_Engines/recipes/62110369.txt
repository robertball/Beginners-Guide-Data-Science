Ingredients:
3/4 c. powdered sugar
1/2 c. butter, softened
1 egg
1 tsp. vanilla
1 1/2 c. flour
1/4 c. cocoa
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. cream of tartar

Directions:
Mix powdered sugar and butter in large bowl; stir in egg and vanilla. Stir in flour, cocoa, baking soda and cream of tartar. Refrigerate until chilled, 2-3 hours. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Divide dough into halves.
Roll each into rectangle about 9 x 13 1/2 inch on well-floured cloth-covered board. Cut each crosswise into 9 (1 1/2 inch) strips.
Prepare peanut butter filling. FILLING: Mix 3/4 cup peanut butter and 3 tablespoons butter in medium bowl. Gradually stir in 1 cup powdered sugar.
Shape the filling into 18 (1 1/4 inch) balls. Roll each ball into rope, 9 inches long, on floured surface. Place peanut butter ropes on centers of chocolate strips. Bring long edges of each strip up over filling; seal well. Shape into pretzel on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake until set 8-10 minutes; cool. Spread with glaze; sprinkle with chopped peanuts, if desired. 18 cookies.
GLAZE: Mix 1 cup powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons cocoa in small bowl. Stir in 2 tablespoons milk until smooth. If necessary, stir in additional milk, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, until desired consistency.
If using self-rising flour, omit baking soda.
