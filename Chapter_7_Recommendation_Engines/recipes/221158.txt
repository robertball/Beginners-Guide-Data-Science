Ingredients:
10 (4 inch) pieces pull-apart red string licorice (such as Twizzlers®)
50 miniature chocolate covered peanut butter cups, unwrapped
1 cup prepared chocolate frosting
50 chocolate-covered graham cracker cookies
50 candy-coated milk chocolate pieces (such as M&M's®) (optional)

Directions:
Cut licorice candy whips into 2-inch pieces, and pull them apart to make small strings. Set aside.
Place a miniature peanut butter cup upside down on a work surface; top with a dab of frosting. Center a chocolate-covered graham cracker cookie onto the frosting to make a small cap with a mortarboard. Gently press the cookie onto the peanut butter cup.
Place a small dab of frosting in the center of the graham cracker cookie and attach a red licorice string as a tassel, letting the tassel drape over the edge of the cookie. Place a candy-coated milk chocolate piece onto the center of the cookie over the end of the tassel to make a button.
Repeat with remaining candies and cookies to make 50 graduation caps with tassels.
