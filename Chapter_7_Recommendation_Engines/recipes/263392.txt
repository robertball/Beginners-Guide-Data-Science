Ingredients:
1/2 (12 ounce) package bacon, or to taste
3 cups broccoli florets, diced
1 1/2 cups corn kernels
1 packet chicken bouillon granules
2 tablespoons dried basil
2 tablespoons dried oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons ground thyme
2 cups mixed salad greens
6 tablespoons butter, divided
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
8 ounces uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 large cloves fresh garlic, chopped
3/4 cup cream cheese, softened
1 cup half-and-half

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 7 minutes. Add broccoli and corn; cook until tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir chicken bouillon, basil, oregano, and thyme into the skillet. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 2 minutes. Add mixed greens, 2 tablespoons butter, and red pepper flakes. Cook for 5 minutes more. Turn off heat and set aside.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in another large pan over medium-high heat. Season shrimp with salt and pepper; place into the hot pan. Cook until starting to turn pink, about 30 seconds. Add garlic. Cook and stir until shrimp is opaque, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Drain linguine, without rinsing. Return pasta to the pot and leave the heat on medium-low. Add cream cheese and stir until melted. Add half-and-half and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Let simmer while stirring for 1 minute. Toss in the bacon mixture and shrimp until combined. Serve immediately.
