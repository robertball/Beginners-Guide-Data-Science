Ingredients:
1 cup brewed coffee (strong; leftover morning coffee always works well)
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 teaspoon cocoa powder (Special Dark)
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon of cocoa powder (Special Dark)
Whip cream (optional)

Directions:
Pour sugar into coffee, if the coffee wasn’t already warm, microwave for 40 seconds. Stir sugar until it is all melted.
Let the coffee cool in the refrigerator.
While it’s cooling, melt the semi-sweet chocolate morsels in the microwave. Stir until smooth and then add the 1 tsp of cocoa powder (Special Dark is the best, it gives the drink the strong flavor that it needs) and stir until it is mixed well. Let it cool as well, but do not stick it in the refrigerator, the chocolate will harden!
Crush 1 cup of ice in the blender and crush it until it is very fine. Pour the coffee and sugar mixture and blend that together. Add the milk. Then add 3 cups of ice (could be more or less ice, depends on how thick you want your drink) and blend well, until the ice is finely crushed. Add the melted chocolate and blend it well. Then add the cocoa powder. If you want your drink more chocolatey, then add more. Just taste it to test it.
After that add the optional whip cream and enjoy!
