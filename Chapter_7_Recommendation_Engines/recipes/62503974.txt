As many cloves of garlic as desired

5 leaves of basil (my mom uses fresh sweet basil)
Salt and pepper

Description: 
I have recieved so many compliments on my mom's sauce, I decided to put the recipe on here. I love it so much, but they don't seem to make it this way at restaurants. I think other people who weren't raised in an Italian family should have the opportunity to make/try something so delicious!
