Ingredients:
4 large unpeeled garlic cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon ground coriander
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1 1/4 pounds ground turkey
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1/2 large cucumber, sliced thin
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1/4 cup Major Grey Chutney
4 small (4 inch) pita breads

Directions:
Set garlic in a small skillet over medium-high heat; toast until spotty brown, about 5 minutes. Peel, mince and set aside.
Mix salt, pepper, coriander, 1/2 tsp. cumin, cinnamon and cloves in a small bowl.
Break up turkey in a medium bowl; add garlic, spinach, spice mixture, ginger and jalapeno; stir lightly with a fork to combine. Divide turkey mixture into 4 portions. Toss meat back and forth between cupped hands to form a ball. Pat with fingertips to flatten to about 4 1/2 inches wide. Refrigerate.
Mix cucumber, lime juice, 1/4 tsp. cumin and salt to taste in a small bowl. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
For charcoal grill: Build a hot fire on one side of grill. Replace rack. When coals are covered with white ash, add burgers. Cover and cook, turning only once, until done, about 5 minutes per side.
Grill pitas until spotty brown and warm, a minute or so per side. Split crosswise. Place a burger on each of 4 pita halves. Top with cucumbers and chutney, then remaining pita halves.
