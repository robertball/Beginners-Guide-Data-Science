1 teaspoon margarine, or as needed, softened
3/4 cup almond milk
1 tablespoon vinegar

1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon sea salt
2 large bananas, mashed
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square metal baking dish with margarine.
Mix almond milk and vinegar together in a cup.
Mix rice flour, brown sugar, amaranth flour, soy flour, flax seed meal, baking powder, baking soda, and sea salt together in a large mixing bowl.
