Ingredients:
8 slices maple-cured bacon
7 eggs
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon ground nutmeg
4 slices bread
5 tablespoons oil, or as needed
1 teaspoon maple syrup, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Lay bacon strips in a single layer on prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
Beat 3 eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large, shallow bowl. Dip each slice of bread into egg mixture to saturate completely.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook bread slices in hot oil, turning once, until browned on each side, about 5 minutes. Transfer toast to a plate.
Beat remaining eggs in a bowl. Cook and stir eggs in the same skillet over medium heat until eggs are scrambled and set, 3 to 4 minutes.
Place 1 slice of toast on a plate and top with 1/2 of the bacon, 1/2 of the scrambled eggs, and 1 slice of toast. Repeat with remaining toast, bacon, and eggs. Top each sandwich with maple syrup.

Description: 
A sandwich with all the comfort. You can cook the bacon in a skillet instead of the oven, if desired. I also sprinkled the sandwich with cinnamon.
