Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package uncooked medium egg noodles
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
8 ounces canned sliced mushrooms
Dash of white wine
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup evaporated milk
1 cup chicken broth
Pinch of thyme and basil
salt and pepper to taste
2 (6 ounce) cans salmon, drained and flaked, or tuna
1 cup frozen peas, thawed, or canned peas, drained
1 small can of french fried onions
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a medium baking dish with Pam spray.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne pasta, cook for approx. 8 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the onion, celery, and garlic, and cook 5 minutes, until tender. Increase heat to medium-high, and mix in mushrooms. Add a dash of white wine.  Continue to cook and stir 5 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan, and whisk in flour until smooth. Gradually whisk in evaporated milk and chicken broth, and continue cooking 5 minutes, until sauce is smooth and slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper. In the skillet, combine all the ingredients and transfer to the baking dish. Top with french fried onions and cheese.
Bake 20-25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
