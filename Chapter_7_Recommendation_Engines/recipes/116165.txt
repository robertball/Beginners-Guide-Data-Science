Description: 
This is one of my favorite ways to fix chicken in a hurry. Everybody just loves it and leftovers are always just as good the next day. For variation, Ive used pork instead of chicken and added additional ingredients like pineapple, mandarin oranges, snow peas and broccoli. -Vicki Ruiz, Twin Falls, Idaho
