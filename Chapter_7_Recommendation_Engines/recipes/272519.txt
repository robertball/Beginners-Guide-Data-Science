Ingredients:
2 refrigerated pie crusts
1 (16 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (15 ounce) can prepared chili
4 hot dogs, sliced into bite-sized pieces
1/2 medium onion, diced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cut the pie crusts in half. Lay 1 half crust on a cutting board and top with 1/4 of the Cheddar cheese, 1/4 of the chili, 1/4 of the hot dog pieces, and 1/4 of the onion. Firmly fold over the crust and pinch the edges to seal contents inside; transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining 3 crusts. Slice the top of each pie with a knife to allow steam to escape.
Bake pies in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool a bit before serving.

Description: 
This is a quick meal to make. It's just like having a chili dog, but wrapped up in a nice neat portable hand pie. Feel free to replace the canned chili with your own recipe.
