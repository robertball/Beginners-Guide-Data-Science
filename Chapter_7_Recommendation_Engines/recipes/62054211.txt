Ingredients:
1 cup of dry lentils (rinsed)
2 cups of beef broth
2 extra cups of cold water
2-3 tablespoons of olive oil
1 large chopped onion
1 minced garlic clove
1/2 cup diced carrots
1/2 cup diced celery
1/2 cup diced potatoes (optional)
1/2 cup of chili sauce
few shakes of hot sauce
salt/pepper to taste

Directions:
1. saute onions and garlic in olive oil till tender
2. add beef broth and extra water followed by the rest of the above ingredients
3. bring to a boil and then cook on low heat for 1 hour
Hint:
I kick it up a bit by adding a few drops of malt vinegar (I guess you can use any vinegar) to my bowl just before serving it.  You can also double the recipe and freeze it. Ummm...Yummmmy!
