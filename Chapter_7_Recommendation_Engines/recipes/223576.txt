Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups green lentils
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 onions, diced
1 pound mushrooms, diced
3 stalks celery, diced
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 cup chopped almonds

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add lentils. Reduce heat and simmer until lentils are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions until slightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Add mushrooms and celery; cook until mushrooms have softened, about 7 minutes.
Whisk 1/4 cup olive oil, soy sauce, honey, lemon juice, and garlic together in a bowl.
Stir almonds into onion mixture; mix well. Carefully fold in lentils and dressing; stir to coat. Serve warm or cold.

Description: 
Hearty and delicious way to serve green lentils - onions make it sweet, almonds are for texture. YUMMY! Soaking the lentils the night before may help with the gas but not necessary.
