Description: 
Here's a unique recipe that has been in my spouse's family for 3 generations. It was probably created during World War II as a new way to prepare SPAM®, which was widely used in that time of shortages and rationing. These open-faced sandwiches are delicious and economical and are loved by his entire family. They are great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!
