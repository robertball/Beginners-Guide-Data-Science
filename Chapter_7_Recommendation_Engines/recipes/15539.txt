Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds swordfish steaks
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
2 teaspoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons light soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
In a non-reactive shallow dish, combine the swordfish with the orange juice, ginger, sesame oil, and soy sauce and marinate for 30 minutes.
Prepare an outside grill with an oiled rack set 6 inches above the heat source.
Drain and reserve the marinade. Grill the swordfish for 6 to 7 minutes per side until the swordfish is opaque in the center.
In a small bowl,  mix together the cornstarch with the water. Place the reserved marinade in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add the cornstarch sauce to the marinade and cook 1 minute until thickened. Serve the orange sauce with the swordfish.
