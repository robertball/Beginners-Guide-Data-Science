Description: 
A delicate cookie with oats, peanut butter and peanut butter cups. Loaded with peanut butter but not overly peanutty in flavor. Doesn't have the off texture of some peanut butter cookies. A great way to use up leftover candy.Modified from: Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies from Heaven
