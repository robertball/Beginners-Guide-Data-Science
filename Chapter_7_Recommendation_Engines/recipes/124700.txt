Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1 cup butter (no substitutes)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt

2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream sugar, butter, vanilla and salt. Add eggs and mix well. Combine flour, baking powder and baking soda; add to creamed mixture. Chill until firm, about 1 hour.
On a floured surface, roll dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. cookie cutter; place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 7-8 minutes or until light golden brown. Decorate if desired.

Description: 
This is one of my great-grandmother's recipes that I received years ago from one of my great-aunts. We bake these cookies for holidays and other special occasions. I have fun at Christmas cutting the cookies with holiday cookies cutters and decorating them with colored sugar and icing, then wrapping them in colored plastic wrap and giving them to friends.
