Ingredients:
1 tablespoon coconut oil
3/4 cup diced carrots
3/4 cup diced onion
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
1 cup lightly packed fresh spinach leaves
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 large pinch chopped fresh thyme
1 large pinch chopped fresh parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 2/3 pounds lean ground beef
1 egg, lightly beaten
3 slices bacon, cut into 10 pieces

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir carrots and onion in hot oil until slightly softened, 3 to 7 minutes. Add tomatoes, spinach, garlic, thyme, parsley, salt, and black pepper; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Puree vegetable mixture using a stick blender until smooth. Alternatively, pour vegetable mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
Mix pureed vegetables, ground beef, and egg together in a bowl with your hands until evenly combined. Divide meat mixture into 10 equal portions; form each into a mini-loaf and place on prepared baking sheet. Place 1 bacon piece on top of each loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 40 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
Gluten-free, grain-free, nut-free, these little meat loaves are delicious, even without ketchup! After pureeing the vegetables, use a wooden spoon to help combine with the meat. I find that if the meat is right out of the refrigerator it will cool the vegetables down enough to handle fairly soon. Don't add the egg to hot vegetable puree or it will cook!
