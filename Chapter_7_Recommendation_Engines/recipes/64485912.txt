Ingredients:
Pillsbury Perfectly Pumpkin cake mix
jar of cream cheese frosting.
white almond bark
sticks if making cake pops

Directions:
Just follow the instructions on the box, and once baked crumble cake in a large bowl and mix with about 1/2-3/4 of the jar of frosting. Roll into balls and coat with vanilla almond bark. If you want to make them look fancier, sprinkle with crumbled graham crack crumbs. For more detailed, step by step instructions for making cake pops you can check out a previous post I did a few months ago right here (just omit the lollipop sticks). Happy baking friends!
