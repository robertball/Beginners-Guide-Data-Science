Ingredients:
Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
1 teaspoon whole fennel seeds
1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
1 teaspoon coarsely chopped fresh rosemary, plus one sprig (optional)
1 boneless pork loin roast
(21/2 pounds), tied with kitchen twine
11/2 pounds parsnips, peeled and cut into 3-by-1-inch pieces (1/2 inch thick)
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425°. Coarsely grind 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, the fennel seeds, orange zest, and chopped rosemary in a mini chopper or a spice grinder. Rub spice mixture all over pork, and insert rosemary sprig under twine. Transfer to a large, heavy ovenproof skillet (preferably cast iron) or a roasting pan.
Roast pork for 20 minutes. Toss parsnips with oil and ½ teaspoon salt; arrange around pork. Roast for 20 minutes. Stir parsnips. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of pork reaches 140°, about 15 minutes more. Transfer pork and parsnips to platter, and let pork rest for 10 minutes before untying and slicing. (If parsnips are not uniformly golden, return to oven for 5 minutes while pork rests.)
