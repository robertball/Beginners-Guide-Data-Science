Ingredients:
1 lb ground lamb
1 1/4 lb ground beef
1 egg
1/2 onion
1/4 cup cilantro
2 jalapeno peppers with seeds and membrane removed.
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. of paprika
1/2 tsp. of cumin
1/2 tsp. of turmeric
1/2 tsp. of dill weed
1/4 tsp. white pepper
Sumac* - optional
*Sumac, available as a ground spice in Middle Eastern markets, comes from the dried berries of a shrub that grows wild in Mediterranean areas. The taste is sour, fruity and astringent.

Directions:
Take the meat and egg out of the refriderator and let rest on the counter for about 1/2 hour.  While they are resting roughly chop the 1/2 onion and jalepenos and place in a food processor.  Chop until both onion and peppers are smooth and there are no large visable pieces. Add cilantro and chop another 30 seconds.
After the 30 minutes mix the meat, egg and onion mixture together; add all the other spices and mix well.  Long flat metal skewers work best if you plan to cook on a grill; they can also be found at International bazaars.  Take about 1 cup of the mixture and work it onto the skewer until it is stuck well 4-5 mintues.  Continue with each skewer.  Cover and put into the refridgerator until you're ready to cook them.
To cook under the broiler just shape into long sausage-like patties 1 1/2" X 8" long.  Place them on a broiler pan; place on the top rack.  Cook until they are lightly browned or 3-4 minutes, turn them over and cook the other side 3 minutes or until done.  When kababs are done brush with butter and sprinkle lightly with sumac.
