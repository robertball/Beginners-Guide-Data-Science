Description: 
This picalilli amazingly tastes pretty good as soon as it's cooled, but ideally it should be left for at least a month to allow the flavors to develop. We've opened jars after 6 months and they are even better! Ginger makes this quite fiery, you might want to adjust the quantity to suit your own taste. Vegetables can be varied according to personal preference; red peppers and sweet corn are suggestions.
