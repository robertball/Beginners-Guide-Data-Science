Ingredients:
2 green plantains
2 tbsp avocado oil
Â½ tsp sea salt + more
2 cloves garlic, minced (omit for low FODMAP)
Herbs of your choice (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Slice off both ends of the plantains and score the skin lengthwise, being careful not to cut through the flesh. Peel off the skin and discard.
Use a spiralizer at the thickest setting to spiralize the plantains. Cut the long strips into shorter, bite-sized pieces.
In a large bowl, toss the spiralized plantain with the rest of the ingredients.
Spread out over the parchment paper-lined baking sheet in a single layer. Do not crowd the pan. Use 2 baking sheets if necessary.
Bake for 10 minutes.
Remove from oven and flip over the fries carefully.
Bake for additional 10-15 minutes.
Sprinkle with more salt, then serve immediately.
