Ingredients:
1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
2/3 cup milk
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup margarine
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons molasses
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 pinch baking soda
1 teaspoon caraway seed
1 1/2 teaspoons bread machine yeast
3/4 cup raisins

Directions:
Combine the vinegar and the milk. Let stand for at least 15 minutes or until the mixture thickens.
Add the vinegar mixture, brown sugar, egg, butter, salt, molasses, bread flour, baking soda, caraway seeds and yeast in the order directed by your bread machine's manufacturer.
Set machine to basic cycle (fruit bread, white bread, etc depending on your bread machine), medium crust setting. Add the raisins when indicated to by your bread machine's manufacturer.
Alternately this bread can be mixed in the bread machine and then bake in the oven. Set bread machine to dough setting. Remove dough, shape into a loaf, cover and let rise in a warm place, until just under doubled in size. This will take about 1 hour.  Bake the bread in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes. Bread will golden brown and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom.
