Ingredients:
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
All-purpose flour
1/2 (17.3 ounce) package Pepperidge FarmÂ® Puff Pastry Sheets, thawed
8 thin slices deli Black Forest ham
4 slices deli Swiss cheese
Confectioners' sugar
Maple syrup

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Beat the egg and water in a small bowl with a fork.
Sprinkle the flour on the work surface. Unfold the pastry sheet on the work surface. Roll the pastry sheet into a 12-inch square. Cut into 4 (6-inch) squares. Brush the edges of the pastries with the egg mixture.
With a corner of 1 pastry facing you, place 2 slices ham and 1 slice cheese on the bottom half of the pastry. Fold the pastry over the filling to form a triangle and press the edges to seal. Crimp the edges with a fork. Repeat with the remaining pastries. Brush the pastries with the egg mixture. Place the pastries onto a baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown. Sprinkle the pastries with the confectioners' sugar. Serve with the maple syrup.

Description: 
Set aside the bread and serve this ham and cheese melt on puff pastry instead. Sweet and savory never tasted so good...especially when topped with a sprinkle of confectioners' sugar.
