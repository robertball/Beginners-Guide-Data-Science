Ingredients:
Lemons - 4
Whole Cloves - 1/2 teaspoon
Cinnamon Stick - 1 stick
Sugar - 1 cup
Water - 1 cup

Directions:
In a medium sauce pan, combine water, sugar, cloves, and cinnamon stick.
Zest one lemon into the mixture.
Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
Once the mixture boils, continue to heat until the mixture has reduced to a thick syrup.
While the mixture is cooking, juice the 4 lemons.
Once the mixture is reduced to a syrup, pour in the juice of the 4 lemons, and bring to a boil again.
After a few minutes of boiling, strain the mixture and cool.
To serve, pour 1-2 tablespoons (or more if desired) into the bottom of a cup, add crushed ice, and mix with water, club soda, or ginger ale.
