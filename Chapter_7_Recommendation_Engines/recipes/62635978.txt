Ingredients:
5 cups puffed wheat cereal
1 tbsp butter
1/2 cup dark chocolate chunks (about 50%)
1/4 cup organic/natural peanut butter (or homemade, see footnote)

Directions:
Measure puffed wheat into a large bowl.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; add chocolate chunks and stir continually until only small chunks of chocolate remain. Remove from heat and add peanut butter. Continue to stir until smooth.
Pour over puffed wheat and mix well with wooden spoon. Grease a loaf pan and press puffed wheat mixture into pan, leveling top.
Chill in refrigerator 40 minutes or until firm to the touch, and cuts without crumbling. Store in fridge for up to a week.

Description:
