Combine cumin seed, turmeric, ground cumin, and coriander in the bottom of a heavy 6- to 8-quart stockpot. Cook over medium heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add olive oil, followed by onion and garlic; cook until onion begins to soften and garlic is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in vegetable broth, tomatoes, lentils, salt, and white pepper.
Bring mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and let simmer for 30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. Continue to simmer until lentils are cooked through and tender, about 1 hour.
