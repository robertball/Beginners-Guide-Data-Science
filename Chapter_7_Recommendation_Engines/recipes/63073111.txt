Ingredients:
2 TBSP  unsalted butter
1 large red onion (10 oz or so)
1 large yellow onion (10 oz or so)
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 TBSP white sugar
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 Cups beef broth or stock
freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 thick slices French bread, about 3/4 inch
4 TBSP shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
2 TBSP freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided

Directions:
Thinly slice onions from root to tip.
Preheat oven to 350.  Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet.  Add onions and salt and saute over low heat for about 15 minutes.
Add sugar and saute and additional 15 minutes or so over medium heat.
Add garlic.  Saute a few minutes then add stock/broth and black pepper.  Simmer for about 10 minutes.
In the meantime, toast bread in the oven until crisp and golden, about a few minutes each side.
Distribute soup amongst oven-safe soup crocks.  Place a slice of toast in each crock.  Evenly sprinkle the mozzarella and then Parmesan cheese across the toast.
Broil until cheese is browned and bubbly.
Serve immediately and carefully.

Description: 
I like a lot of onion in my soup!  This is how I make mine, which isn't much different from all of the many other onion soups out there.  Using a rich beef stock/broth makes a big difference.  I like to enjoy this with a big green salad for a nice meal.
