Ingredients:
Apple Raisin Chutney:
2 tablespoons butter
1 small onion, finely diced
2 apples - peeled, cored and diced
1/2 cup raisins
1/4 cup white sugar
1 cup apple juice
Tourtiere:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound ground pork
1 onion, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
salt and pepper
1 potato, peeled and grated
3/4 cup chicken broth
2 Tenderflake® Frozen Deep Dish Pie Shells, defrosted overnight in the refrigerator
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Apple Raisin Chutney: Heat butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and saute for 2-3 minutes or until soft. Add apples and remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20-30 minutes or until apples are soft and the liquid has evaporated. Cool before serving.
Tourtiere: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground pork and cook, breaking apart with the back of a wooden spoon for 8-10 minutes. Add onions, carrots, and garlic. Cook for 2-3 minutes and add spices and herbs. Cook for another 1-2 minutes and stir in potato. After another 1-2 minutes add broth. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer for 2-3 minutes or until liquid has evaporated. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Remove bay leaf and discard.
Transfer the pork mixture into one of the prepared pie shells. Remove the second pie shell from the foil tray onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll pastry with a lightly floured rolling pin to a 10-inch (25cm) round. Place on top of the filled pie and press the edges to seal. Trim any excess pastry and flute the edges.
Cut a small slit in the top to allow steam to escape. Use the leftover pastry to make decorative leaves if desired. Brush the top of the pie with egg wash.
Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown.
