Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese or feta cheese
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to middle position, and preheat the oven broiler.
Mix together turkey, spinach, goat cheese, and salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Divide into equal portions, and form into 4 patties about 4 1/2-inches in diameter.
Arrange patties on a foil-lined broiler pan, or a wire rack set over a lipped cookie sheet. Broil, turning once, until cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes.
