Ingredients:
3 pounds baby back pork ribs
1 (7.2 ounce) package butter and herb rice mix
1/2 large green bell pepper, seeded and diced
5 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tablespoons dried sage
2 tablespoons dried oregano
2 tablespoons dry mustard powder
2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
2 tablespoons honey
1/4 cup fresh orange juice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare the rice mix according to package directions, but adding bell pepper and garlic at the end. Set aside.
In a small bowl, mix together the sage, oregano, mustard powder and Cajun seasoning. Rub onto both sides of the ribs. Mix together the honey and orange juice in a separate bowl. Brush half of the sauce onto the meaty side of the ribs.
Set the ribs in a roasting pan so they are standing in a ring with the meaty side facing outward. Secure with kitchen twine. Spoon the rice mixture into the center.
Roast the ribs for 40 minutes in the preheated oven, basting with the remaining glaze halfway through. Rib meat should reach 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) when a meat thermometer is inserted in the thickest part. Cool for at least 5 minutes before slicing into rib portions and serving with rice on the side.
