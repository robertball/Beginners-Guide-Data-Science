1 egg
1/4 cup cilantro
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 onion, diced

2 tsp oregano, divided
2 tsp ancho flakes,divided
1.5 cups chile sauce, divided
2 cups cooked pinto beans, drained

Directions:
Soak the bread in the 2 Tbsp of milk for about 10 minutes, to soften the bread.
Combine the beef, 2 Tbsp of the chile sauce, habanero pepper, egg, cumin, chili seasoning, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp ancho flakes, and cilantro together with a spoon.
Add the soaked bread and milk and mix until well combined. Form meatballs in the size you want and set aside.
In a skillet, saut√© the onion and bell peppers in the vegetable oil. Add the meatballs and cook until browned on two sides.
Add the remaining chili seasoning, oregano, chile sauce and beans. Simmer until the sauce has thickened and the meatballs are cooked throughout. Do not stir, instead, gently shake the pan every once in a while to move the meatballs around, flipping once during the simmering process. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
Gluten free meatballs with a Tex-Mex accent. Ground beef meatballs with a taco taste simmered with bell peppers and beans in a chile sauce. Delightful with corn tortillas, guacamole, and sour cream. My celiac and non celiac family members enjoy these. They can be made into large meatballs or bite-sized as an appetizer or party treat!
