Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm water
1 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp ginger
3 Tb dry yeast
1 1/2 cup warm water
1/2 cup molasses
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 cups rye flour
1/4 cup powdered milk
2-4 Tb gluten
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 Tb caraway seeds
1 Tb dill seeds
4 cups white flour

Directions:
Combine first 4 ingredients & let stand until bubbling.
Mix next 6 ingredients in large bowl, add yeast mixture & mix again.  Add remaining ingredients, keeping out 1 cup flour.  Mix until dough clears bowl.  Add remaining cup of flour in small increments, beating with dough hook until all is worked in.
Let dough rest 15 minutes, and then beat again, working in more flour if possible.  Cut dough in half & form 2 long taper-loaves by pounding flat into rectangle & folding each side over center in thirds, repeating twice & sealing seam with water. Lay seam side down on ungreased baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal.
Cover lightly & let rise.  With sharp knife make slanting slashes on tops of loaves.  Brush with espresso.
Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, until they sound hollow when thumped with fingers

Description: 
This recipe is optimized for use with a mixer which has a dough hook, instead of kneading by hand. It uses dill and caraway seeds for extra flavor.  The original recipe called for bacon grease, but I use olive oil.Modified from: Dark Rye Bread
