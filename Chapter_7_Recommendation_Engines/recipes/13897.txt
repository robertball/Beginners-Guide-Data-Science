Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms
1 small zucchini, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup dry lentils
3 cups water
2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 cup water

Directions:
In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onions, mushrooms, zucchini, and garlic.  Cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes.
Add lentils and 3 cups water to vegetables.  Bring to a rolling boil, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook 45 to 60 minutes.
Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, and 1/2 cup water.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.  If necessary, add more water to keep the sauce from sticking.  Be careful not to dilute; the sauce should be quite thick.

Description: 
This is a very nice, thick sauce.  It has a meat taste, without the meat.  Nice and hearty, great with a crusty bread on a cold, Fall day.
