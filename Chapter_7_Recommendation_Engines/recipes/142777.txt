Ingredients:
2 zucchini, halved lengthwise
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup part-skim ricotta cheese
1/4 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons dried basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Scoop out the seeds of each zucchini half with a spoon. Season the hollowed-out halves with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper.
Mix together the ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, dried basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper in a bowl.  Divide cheese mixture between four zucchini halves. Arrange stuffed zucchini on greased baking sheet.
