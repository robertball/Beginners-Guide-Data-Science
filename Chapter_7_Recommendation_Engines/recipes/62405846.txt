Description: 
I love to make my custom version of Cheesy Sausage Zucchini Casserole in the summer.  It's healthier than the original since it uses ground turkey instead of sausage.  I also added an Italian flair by using Italian seasoned turkey, pasta instead of rice, and an Italian blend of cheeses instead of processed cheese.Modified from: Cheesy Sausage Zucchini Casserole
