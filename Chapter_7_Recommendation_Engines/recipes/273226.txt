Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups oat flour
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup vanilla-flavored soy milk
1 egg
1/2 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 cup dried cherries
3/4 cup slivered almonds, divided

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
Combine oat flour and sugar in a large bowl. Add butter; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Mix in egg and soy milk. Mix in baking powder and cinnamon; dough should be the consistency of soft cookie dough. Fold in cherries and 1/2 cup almonds.
Drop cookie dough onto the prepared sheet in 2-tablespoon portions, leaving a few inches between each cookie. Sprinkle remaining slivered almonds on top of each cookie.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cookies comes out clean, about 15 minutes.
