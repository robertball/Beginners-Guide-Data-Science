Ingredients:
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 green onions, minced
3 cloves roasted garlic, mashed
1/4 cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Cook and stir sesame seeds in a small dry skillet over medium-low heat until they are fragrant and toasted, about 2 minutes. Transfer immediately into a small bowl and let cool.
Mix ground beef, green onions, roasted garlic, mirin wine, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, black pepper, salt, and toasted sesame seeds together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Divide the meat mixture into 8 portions and form each portion into a large beef patty about 1/2 inch thick.
Pan-fry the burgers in a large skillet over medium-low heat until browned and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the burgers should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees F).
