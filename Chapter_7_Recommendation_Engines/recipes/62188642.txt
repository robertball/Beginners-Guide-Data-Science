Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cups light brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in bowl; set aside.
In large bowl/mixer bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy (about 3-4 minutes at medium speed).  Add vanilla extract and beat in eggs, one at a time.  Stir dry ingredients into the butter mixture until well blended. Mix in the chocolate chips and walnuts.
Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or just until set.
Cool slightly on the cookie sheets before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
