Description: 
My maternal grandmother (my Momma) used to make this soup whenever I was ill as a little girl.  It's very good comfort food with potatoes, carrots, celery and onion, but a lot of reviewers will pan it saying A good base recipe, but I added ...  Frankly, I don't want to hear it.  I like it just the way it is :D
