Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (3 pound) beef pot roast
1 onion, chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound carrots, cut into chunks
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 1/2 pounds potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups beef stock
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle dark beer
1 bay leaf
3 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons whole-grain Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon tomato paste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven. Brown the pot roast on all sides in the hot oil; remove from pan and set aside. Cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until they begin to soften and turn brown, about 5 minutes. Add the carrots, mushrooms, and potatoes to the pot; cook and stir until they begin to color, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix the flour into the vegetables; stir continuously for 1 minute. Pour the beef stock and beer into the mixture and bring to a boil, stirring continuously. Add the Bay leaf, thyme, brown sugar, mustard, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Place the pot roast atop the entire mixture. Cover pot with lid.
Bake in the preheated oven until the meat and vegetables are completely tender, about 2 1/2 hours.
