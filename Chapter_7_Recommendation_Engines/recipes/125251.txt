Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs and vanilla; beat until fluffy. Combine flour, baking powder, salt and cocoa; add to creamed mixture. Stir in nuts if desired. Spread in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 to 18 minutes. Sprinkle marshmallows evenly over cake; return to oven for 2 to 3 minutes. Using a knife dipped in water, spread the melted marshmallows evenly over cake. Cool. For topping, combine chocolate chips, peanut butter and butter in a small saucepan.

Description: 
I'd have to say that I've been asked to share this chocolaty layered her recipe more than any other in my collection. It's a longtime favorite of our three daughters. How many times we've all made these, I can't count.                                    -- Esther Shank, Harrisonville, Virginia
