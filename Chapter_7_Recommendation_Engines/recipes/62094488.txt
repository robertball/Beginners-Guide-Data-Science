Ingredients:
1 tsp sugar
½ cup lukewarm water
1 pk active dry yeast
2 ½ cups milk or water
¼ cup butter
1 tbsp salt
½ cup molasses
6-7 cups flour (all-purpose)
2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp allspice
1 tsp cloves
4 cups raisins

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water to which sugar has been added. Leave undisturbed for 10-15 minutes until yeast is bubbly.
In saucepan, heat milk with butter and salt until butter melts; let cool to lukewarm.
In large mixing bowl, combine molasses, yeast mixture and 3 cups flour, spices and raisins. Beat with wooden spoon 2-3 minutes. Continue adding flour until moist soft dough is formed.
Place on flat surface and knead for about 10 minutes until dough becomes smooth and elastic. Place in a lightly oiled bowl in a warm place until doubled in bulk (1½-2 hours).
Divide dough in half and shape to form 2 loaves, making them smooth. Place in 2 greased 9x5 inch loaf pans and allow to rise again until doubled (1-2 hours).
Loosely cover pans with a clean damp
cup towel. Bake in preheated 375 degrees F oven, until loaves are browned and sound hollow when tapped (Approx 1 hr)
Brush tops of loaves with melted butter
while hot.
