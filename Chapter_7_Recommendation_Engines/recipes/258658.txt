Ingredients:
2 (12.5 fl oz) cans chicken chunks, drained
1 ½ cups panko bread crumbs
1 (4 ounce) packet saltine crackers, finely crushed
1 cup sour cream
2  eggs
½ (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix, or to taste
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon dried onion granules
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon cooking oil, or as needed
1 (11 ounce) can condensed Cheddar cheese soup
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup sour cream
5  green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
Mix chicken, panko, saltines, sour cream, eggs, ranch dressing mix, mustard, onion, black pepper, and parsley together in a bowl until well combined. Shape chicken mixture into 8 patties, approximately 3/4-inch thick.
Pour panko onto a plate, coat patties, and place on a platter. Chill for 1 hour or overnight.
Coat a nonstick skillet with vegetable oil over medium heat. Cook patties until golden brown and heated through, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Place a layer of paper towels on a baking rack, transfer patties to paper towels to drain.
Combine soup and broth in a saucepan; heat until just boiling, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, stir sour cream and green onions into sauce. Serve patties with sauce on top.
