Ingredients:
7 1/2 cups sugar
3 fluid ounces liquid pectin
4 1/2 cups water
3 pounds quinces, cored and chopped, peels on
1/4 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Sterilize 8 (1/2 pint) jars in boiling water for at least 5 minutes, and have new lids ready.
Place the quinces in a large pot, and pour in water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Strain off 4 cups of the juice. Mix juice with sugar and lemon juice in a heavy pot, and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Stir in pectin, and return to a boil. Boil for 1 full minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and skim off foam. Ladle into hot sterile jars, and process for 10 minutes in a hot water bath to seal. Refrigerate jelly after opening.
Store sealed jars in a cool dark place. Refrigerate jelly after opening.
