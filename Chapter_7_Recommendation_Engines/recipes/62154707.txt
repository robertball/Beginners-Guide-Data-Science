Description: 
When I lived in Egypt, this was the base sauce for many dips as part of the mezza (salad or starter) course of a meal and it's used straight on a falafel and pita sandwich.  Now I use it as my secret ingredient in my American cooking.  This is the perfect thing to make after you've used a small amount of a container of tahini for something else!  I freeze it in 1/2 cups to pull out when needed.  Add roasted eggplant and lemon juice - babaghanuush!  Add mashed chickpeas and lemon juice - hummus!  Add to 2 lbs. ground beef - the best hamburgers!
