Ingredients:
1 ¼ cups water
1 (6 ounce) package quick-cooking stuffing mix (such as Stove Top®)
1 (20 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained
1 (16 ounce) package skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces
8 ounces shredded Swiss cheese
4 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
½ (16 ounce) bottle French salad dressing, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Stir stuffing mix into the water, place a lid on the saucepan, and remove pan from heat. Let sit until the stuffing is thickened, about 5 minutes. Fluff stuffing with a fork.
Mix sauerkraut, chicken, Swiss cheese, and Cheddar cheese together in a large bowl. Stir enough French dressing into the sauerkraut mixture to moisten to your liking; spread into a casserole dish. Spread stuffing over the sauerkraut mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned along the edges, about 25 minutes.
