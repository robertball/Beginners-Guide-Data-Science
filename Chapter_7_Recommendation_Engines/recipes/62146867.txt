Ingredients:
3/4 cup fat free milk
1/4 cup farina (cream of wheat)
1-3/4 cups bread flour
1 heaping tablespoon Fibersure*
1 tablespoon corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/3 cup dark raisins (plump them in boiling water and then drain well before adding to dough)
cornmeal
nonstick cooking spray
*optional...I use either Fibersure or Benefiber to add fiber and make these muffins even healthier.

Directions:
Add all ingredients (except raisins and cornmeal) to machine according to manufacturers directions.
Choose the dough cycle.
Add raisins when machine beeps for add-ins, if you add them too early they will disintegrate.
After the dough cycle is done let it "rest" in the machine with the lid closed for 10 minutes.
Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray; sprinkle evenly with corn meal.
Roll dough to 1/2 inch thickness on a lightly floured surface.
Cut dough into circles using a 3 or 4 inch round cookie cutter (a clean tuna can will work in a pinch) and place on prepared cookie sheet.
Spray tops of muffins with cooking spray and lightly  sprinkle with cornmeal.
Cover dough and let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes.
Preheat a lightly greased/sprayed griddle or non-stick skillet to medium heat...about 350 degrees.
Cook muffins 4 to 5 minutes on each side; flipping gently so as not to break the air pockets inside ie:the nooks & crannies :-); till golden brown.
Cool on wire rack.
Store in a ziplock bag or tightly sealed container.
Use a fork to split them open and toast before eating.
