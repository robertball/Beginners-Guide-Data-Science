Description: 
I used to make what I considered a good cheese ball, and then my friend let me taste hers... and hers was a great cheese ball! Serve with assorted crackers. One year, I made several mini cheese balls and gave them as gifts with a box of nice crackers to my kid's teachers and bus drivers... it was a success! Enjoy!
