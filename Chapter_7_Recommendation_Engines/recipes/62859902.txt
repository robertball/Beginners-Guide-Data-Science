1/3 cup mayonnaise + more for spreading
1/4 cup finely chopped red onion

1/4 tsp dried oregano
4 slices crusty bread
8 thin slices tomato
4 slices provolone

Directions:
Heat broiler, with rack in highest position.
In a medium bowl, combine tuna, mayo, onion, lemon juice, salt, pepper and oregano and stir until combined.  (If choose to use capers then add them here, also.)
Arrange bread on baking sheet and spread a little mayo on each slice. Divide tuna salad evenly among slices, then top each with 2 slices tomato & 1 slice cheese.
Broil until cheese is golden brown and bubbling, 3 to 4 minutes.
