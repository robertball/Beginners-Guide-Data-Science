Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (4 ounce) package chorizo sausage, sliced
1 large onion, diced
2 ounces smoked bacon, chopped
4 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 (16 oz) ring debreziner sausage, sliced
2 bell peppers, seeded and sliced
1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can white beans, drained
1 cup beef stock
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 teaspoon dried savory
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

Directions:
Heat oil in a large stew pot over medium heat. Cook and stir sliced chorizo until slightly brown and the oil takes on color, 5 to 6 minutes. Add onion, bacon, and garlic; cook until onion is soft and bacon is crisp, about 5 minutes. Add debreziner sausage and peppers and cook until mixture is smooth and soft, about 5 minutes more.
Stir in crushed tomatoes, white beans, beef stock, tomato paste, and ketchup. Season with savory, salt, pepper, cayenne, and bay leaves. Add flour to thicken and simmer, half-covered, until flavors combine, about 40 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
