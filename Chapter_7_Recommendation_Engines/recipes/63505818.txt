Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Olive Oil
2 pound Ground Beef
1 Onion (diced)
3 cloves Garlic
2 Carrots (small diced)
2 ribs of Celery (small diced)
1 28-ounce can Whole Plum Tomatoes
1 cup Dry Red Wine
1 Fresh Bay Leaf
6 sprigs Fresh Oregano
Salt to taste
1 cup Flat Leaf Italian Parsley (torn)
1/2 cup Parmesan (grated)
2 tablespoon Unsalted Butter
2 pound Rigatoni

Directions:
Heat a large saucepan with olive oil. Brown the ground beef with a large pinch of salt. Add garlic to saucepan and cook for 3 minutes.
Add onion, carrots and celery into a food processor and pulse to finely chop vegetable. Add vegetable mix to pan and cook for another 3 minutes.
Deglaze the pan with red wine. Add in the tomatoes, breaking them up as you stir them and bring to a simmer. Add the bay leaf and oregano and taste for seasoning.  You may want to add a little salt here. Simmer for about 2 hours, skimming off any excess fat that comes to the top.
Once the sauce is done, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Drop the rigatoni in and cook until al dente. Remove from the water with a spider or slotted spoon and add to the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a little bit of your pasta water.
Remove from the heat and stir in parsley, parmesan, butter and a drizzle of olive oil and serve immediately.
