Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup Chardonnay wine
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 packet dry hollandaise sauce mix
16 fresh steamed asparagus tips

Directions:
To Marinate: Place chicken in a nonporous glass dish or bowl. Pour wine over chicken, then sprinkle with tarragon. Cover dish and refrigerate to marinate for 2 hours.
Preheat oven to broil/grill.
Remove chicken from dish or bowl, discarding remaining marinade, and broil/grill for 25 minutes or until cooked through and juices run clear.
Meanwhile, prepare hollandaise sauce according to package directions. When chicken is cooked, place 4 spears of steamed asparagus on each chicken breast and dribble with prepared hollandaise sauce to taste. Sprinkle with cheese and serve.
