Ingredients:
4 large fish fillets
1/4 cup diced carrots
1/4 cup diced celery
1/4 cup chopped green onion
2 lemons, thinly sliced

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut four 2-foot lengths of foil and fold each in half to make a 1-foot square. Place 1 fish fillet slightly below the middle of each square of foil. Sprinkle 1/4 of the carrots, celery, green onion, and parsley on each fillet. Top with lemon slices.
Fold the foil over the fish and crimp the edges together slightly. Place the foil-wrapped fillets on a baking sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the fish flakes easily.
