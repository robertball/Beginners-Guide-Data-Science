Description: 
A delicious and economical twist on a pasta primavera, this winter dish has been a favorite of vegetarian clients for years. It was born from a Sicilian side dish for Pumpkin Agrodolce (literally sour and sweet), taught to me by one of my first master chefs, but this is a meal that stands alone.
