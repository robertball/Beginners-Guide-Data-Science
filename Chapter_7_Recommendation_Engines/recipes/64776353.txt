Stuffed Shells Recipe

Ingredients:
30 jumbo pasta shells (from a 12-ounce box)
1 pound ricotta cheese (about 2 heaping cups)
3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (12 ounces), divided
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (24-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups), divided
2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese or Pecorino Romano cheese

Directions:
Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 375Â°F.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the shells and cook according to package directions. Drain, then briefly rinse with cold water until cool enough to handle.
Place the ricotta, 2 cups of the mozzarella, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and stir to combine. Taste and add more salt if needed; the overall saltiness will depend on the cheeses used.
Spread 1 cup of the sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Stuff each shell with about 1 heaping tablespoon of the mozzarella filling and place filling-side up in the dish. If some shells split during the cooking process, you may have a few fragments left over, but you should end up with about 2 dozen shells in the dish.
Top the shells evenly with the remaining 2 cups sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella and Parmesan or Pecorino.
Bake uncovered until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
