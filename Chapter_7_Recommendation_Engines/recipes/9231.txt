Ingredients:
1 pound turkey tenderloins
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon Dijon-style prepared mustard
2 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed

Directions:
Place the turkey tenderloins in a sealable plastic bag and set aside.
In a small bowl combine the soy sauce, mustard and rosemary. Pour over turkey, seal bag and shake to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours shaking once or twice.
Preheat oven on the broiler setting. Remove the turkey from the marinade and place on the rack in the broiler pan. Broil 4 inches from the heat, turning once, for 20 to 22 minutes or until meat is cooked through and when pierced with a fork the juices run clear. Slice and serve with Cranberry Chutney.
