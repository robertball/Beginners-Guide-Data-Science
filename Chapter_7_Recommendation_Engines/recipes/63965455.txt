Ingredients:
½ c. chopped onion
2 lb. ground beef
¼ c. chili powder
1 t. ground cinnamon
1 t. ground cumin
¼ t. ground allspice
¼ t. ground cloves
1 bay leaf
½ (1 oz.) square unsweetened chocolate
3 t. beef bouillon
21 oz. water
2 cans tomato sauce
2 T. cider vinegar
¼ t. ground cayenne pepper

Directions:
My Directions: Omit vegetable oil. Put broth into pan and add all remaining ingredients except hamburger and cheese. Stir together. Add hamburger and stir to mix. Bring to a boil; simmer until thickened. Serve over hot spaghetti. Top with cheese, chopped onions, and beans, if desired. Very good!
Original Directions: Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 6 minutes. Add beef, in batches if necessary, and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until browned. Add chili powder, cinnamon, cumin, allspice, cloves, bay leaf, chocolate, beef broth, tomato sauce, cider vinegar, and red pepper. Stir to mix well. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 1½ hours, stirring occasionally. It is the best if you now refrigerate overnight. Remove the bay leaf. Reheat gently over medium heat. Serve over hot, drained spaghetti. Top with shredded cheddar cheese.

Description: 
Very good. Better than the mix and even though it has many ingredients, it’s not too difficult.
