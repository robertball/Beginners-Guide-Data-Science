Description: 
This recipe was made with the paleo 'diet' in mind. It's gluten-free, dairy-free, and has no added sugar. I needed an alternative to other paleo breakfasts since I also cannot have eggs. This is the result. 

Those with fewer restrictions might enjoy stirring in a bit of maple syrup, adding brown sugar, or topping with granola for extra crunch.
