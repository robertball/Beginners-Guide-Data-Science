Ingredients:
Cake:
2 c. all purpose flour
2 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. salt
2/3 c. canola oil
1 c. sugar
2 large eggs, room temperature
1 c. milk
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1-1/2 c. fresh blueberries, lightly coated with flour
Sugar in the Raw (optional)
Vanilla Glaze:
1-1/4 c. powdered sugar, sifted
1/2 c. heavy whipping cream
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract

Directions:
Heat oven to 325Â°F.  Place 12 baking cups on baking sheet.  In small bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt.  Set aside.
In large bowl, with electric mixer on medium speed, beat together oil, sugar and eggs until light and thick (about 3 minutes).  Add dry ingredients in three parts, alternating with milk and vanilla extract, beating after each addition until smooth.  Fold in blueberries.
Pour batter into baking cups, filling 3/4 full.  Sprinkle with raw sugar.  Bake 16 to 18 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean.  Remove from baking sheet to wire rack and let cool completely.  Repeat with remaining batter.
Meanwhile, combine powdered sugar, heavy whipping cream and vanilla extract in small bowl.  Heat in microwave at 50% for 30 seconds.  Stir glaze until smooth.  Cover with plastic wrap until ready to use.
Drizzle glaze over coffee cakes.  Allow glaze to set before serving.
