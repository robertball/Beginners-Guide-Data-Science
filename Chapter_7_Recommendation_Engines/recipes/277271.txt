Ingredients:
4 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and sliced
3 cloves fresh garlic, minced
1 pound chicken wings
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups water
3 bay leaves
1 teaspoon whole peppercorns
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon fine salt, or to taste

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, jalapeno peppers, and garlic together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken wings and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
Remove chicken wings from the marinade and shake off excess. Reserve marinade.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Place chicken wings in the hot oil and pan-fry for 2 minutes per side. Slowly pour in reserved marinade (including garlic) and water. Bring to a boil. Add bay leaves and peppercorns and simmer until chicken is tender, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Stir in vinegar and cook for 5 minutes. Stir again and season with sugar and salt to taste. Serve hot.
