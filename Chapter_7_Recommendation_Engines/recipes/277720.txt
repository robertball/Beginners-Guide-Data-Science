Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup canned pumpkin
1/4 cup canola oil
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
nonstick cooking spray

Directions:
Whisk flour, sugar, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk in buttermilk, pumpkin, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract until well blended.
Spray a large nonstick griddle or skillet with cooking spray. Heat over medium heat.
Pour batter by scant 1/3 cupfuls into the hot skillet, working in batches. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of pancakes and bottoms are lightly browned, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter, spraying the skillet with cooking spray between batches as needed. Serve warm.
