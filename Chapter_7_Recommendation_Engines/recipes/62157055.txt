Ingredients:
4 ears of corn (still in husks)
2 Limes
2 tbsp. sea salt
2 tsp. chili powder
1/2 stick butter melted

Directions:
Peel back husks leaving them attached at the bottom of corn and remove silks (the annoying stringy stuff)  Put husks back up and soak in luke warm water for one hour. Grate lime zest from both limes into a bowl and mix with salt. Remove corn from water, peel back husks (leave attached) and pat corn dry with paper towels, leaving the husks wet.  Brush the corn with the melted butter.  Sprinkle the salt-lime zest mixture over both sides of the corn, and then sprinkle the chili powder on top of that. Put husks back up and put on pre-heated grill for approx. 25 min.  Make sure to keep turning the corn so it doesn't burn!
