Ingredients:
1 can coconut cream (not milk-you'll regret it!)
1 small avocado
Juice of one lime
3 tbsps. Soy Sauce
1 tsp green curry paste.
Vegetables
1 celery stalk, very thinly sliced
1 red pepper, cubed
1 zucchini (courgette), cubed
1/2 cup green beans
1 small avocado

Directions:
In a blender, add all the curry ingredients and blend until smooth. Transfer it to a wok and bring it to a boil. Lower the heat and add the vegetables, cover and simmer for 10 minutes. You don’t want the vegetables to be limp and over cooked, Thai dishes are fresh and crisp so always keep the timing in mind when its time to cook the veggies.
Garnish with basil, and serve with a bowl of brown jasmine rice.
Absolutely amazing and vegan. Really does not need meat. Hold the chicken!
