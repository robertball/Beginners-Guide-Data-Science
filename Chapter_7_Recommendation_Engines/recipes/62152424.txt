1 lb. thin sliced chicken breast
1 tbsp. vegetable oil
3 slices bacon, chopped
1 green pepper, cut into thin slices
1 onion, cut into thin wedges
1 cup mushrooms, sliced
1 cube Knorr chipotle (or 1/2 tsp. chipotle powder)
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/2 tsp. ground cumin
1/4 tsp. dried oregano, crushed

Directions:

2. In plastic bag, combine chicken, oil and spice mixture, making sure all pieces of chicken are covered. Let marinate at least 1/2 hour.
3. Cook bacon in a skillet until slightly crisp. Drain fat and add green peppers. Sautee for about 5 minutes, then add onions and sautee until translucent. Add mushrooms and cook until softened.
4. Meanwhile, cook chicken in skillet over medium heat for about 12-14 minutes, or until juices run clear, turning once halfway through cooking time.
5. Cut chicken into thin slices and add to bacon/veggie blend, stirring to mix everything together.
6. Throughout cooking process, cook flour tortillas on a small, dry frying pan over low heat until softened. Keep tortillas warm in preheated oven at low setting until ready to serve.
7. Spoon fajitas into tortillas. Add salsa verde, a splash of lime juice, and a sprinkle of salt right before serving.
