Ingredients:
1 can refried beans
2 cups shredded cheese
1/2 cup salsa or hot sauce
1 cup sour cream
2-3 tomatoes, diced
1/4 onion, finely chopped
2-3 avocados, diced
1/2 cup alfalfa sprouts (optional)
1 bag corn chips or Doritos

Directions:
Spread beans evenly in 9x13 in baking dish, or, if making a party dip, make a hill of them in the center of a large plate.  Spread half of the cheese over the beans and melt it (in microwave or oven).
Spoon on half of the sour cream and spread evenly. Layer half each of the tomato, onion and avocado.  Top with as much salsa as you wish.  Next later the rest of the sour cream and vegetables - same order as before. Add more salsa, if desired. Top with remaining cheese and then alfalfa sprouts, if desired.  Serve with chips and additional hot sauce or salsa on the side.
