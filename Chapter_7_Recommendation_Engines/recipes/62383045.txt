Ingredients:
1/2  cup snipped fresh parsley
1/4  cup olive oil
1/4  cup snipped fresh basil
1  Tbsp snipped fresh oregano
1  to 2 tsp. cracked black pepper
1/2  tsp. salt
2  beef top loin steaks, cut 1 1/2 inch thick
2  medium red or yellow sweet peppers cut into 1/2-inch rings, seeds removed
1  Tbsp. Olive oil

Directions:
1. In a bowl combine parsley, 1/4 cup olive oil, basil, oregano, cracked black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Trim fat from meat. Rub half the mixture on both sides of steaks. Cover; refrigerate steaks 1 hour. Meanwhile, brush pepper rings with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season lightly with salt and pepper
2. For a charcoal grill, grill steaks on the rack of an uncovered grill to desired doneness, turning once. (Allow 15 to 19 minutes for medium-rare (145 degrees ??F) or 18 to 23 minutes for medium (160 degrees F)). Grill pepper rings next to the steaks the last 8 to 10 minutes of grilling, or until peppers are tender, turning once. Remove steaks from grill and sprinkle with remaining herb mixture. Cover and let stand for 10 minutes.
3. To serve slice steaks across the grain. Serve with sweet pepper rings.
