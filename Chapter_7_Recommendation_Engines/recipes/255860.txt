Ingredients:
2 small spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 (26 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
olive oil
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or more as needed for serving

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place squash cut side up on a rimmed baking sheet. Divide the sauce among the 4 halves. Brush cut edge of squash with olive oil to prevent drying out.
Bake in preheated oven until squash is soft and sauce is hot, about 1 1/2 hours.
Serve squash with grated Parmesan cheese.
