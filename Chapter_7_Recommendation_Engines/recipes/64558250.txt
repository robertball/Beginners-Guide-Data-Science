Ingredients:
2 cups almond flour
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
1 cup shredded carrots
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp almond extract
1/4 cup organic maple syrup
3 tbsp melted and cooled coconut oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and prepare a baking sheet with a slip mat, cooking spray or parchment paper.
Using a standing mixer or hand mixer, add maple syrup, almond extract, salt, baking soda and cinnamon and mix to combine.
Add 1/2 cup of almond flour to the mixer and combine. Once combined add another 1/2 cup. Repeat the process until 2 cups are combined.
Next add 1 tbsp coconut oil and mix slowly. Repeat for the next 2 tbsp of oil.
Last fold in the shredded coconut and carrots to the mixture by hand.
Using a medium sized ice cream scooper to scoop out 12 cookies onto the baking sheet.
Gently press cookies down with the palm of you hand onto the baking sheet to flatten as these will not spread.
Bake 12 minutes at 350 degrees F. Remove from oven and allow cookies to cool on baking sheet 10 minutes prior to remove and placing on a cooling rack.
Top with Reddi-whip or coconut whip for a tasty & healthy treat!
Store in the refrigerator so that cookies maintain their structure.
