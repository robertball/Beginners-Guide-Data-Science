Ingredients:
2 8 oz. crescent roll packages
8 oz. reduced fat cream cheese
16 oz. light sour cream
1 Tbsp. dried dill weed
1 tsp. onion or garlic salt
veggies and shredded cheese to top with

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spread each package of crescent roll dough onto it's own cookie sheet, do not separate dough. Cook for 7-8 minutes or until lightly golden. Let cool.
While dough is cooking, mix cream cheese, sour cream, dill weed and onion or garlic salt. Once baked dough has cooled, spread cream cheese mixture over dough.
Top with your choice of veggies and shredded cheese. I use: small pieces of broccoli and cauliflower, sliced black olives, sliced green olives, halved cherry tomatoes, carrot shreds, and finely shredded cheddar cheese.
