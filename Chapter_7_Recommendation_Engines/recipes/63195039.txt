Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups milk
1 1/4 cup whipping cream
2 Tbsp. instant coffee crystals
6 eggs, lightly beaten
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
2 tsp. vanilla
8 cups torn white bread slices (about 12 slices)
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1 8 oz. pkg cream cheese
Cream Cheese Topping:
3/4 cup whipping cream
1-2 oz. cream cheese (softened)
1 Tbsp. powdered sugar

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375. In large bowl stir together milk, whipping cream, and coffee crystals until coffee is dissolved.
2. Stir eggs, the sugars, and vanilla into milk mixture. Stir in bread pieces until moistened. Evenly divide among eight ungreased 6-ounce ramekins or custard cups, filling each almost full. Place on a 15x10x1-inch baking pan.
3. Bake 30 min or until puffed, set, and a knife inserted near center comes out clean. Transfer to wire rack (pudding will fall slightly as they cool).
4. Mix items for cream cheese topping. Mix on med until soft peeks form. May add extra cream cheese and powdered sugar for thicker topping if desired. May also use milk in place of whipping cream if desired will get the same outcome.
