Ingredients:
1/2 cup Smucker's® Chocolate Sundae Syrups Ice Cream Topping
4 cups milk
2 tablespoons Smucker's® Caramel Sundae Syrups Ice Cream Topping
1 cup Extra Creamy whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Combine chocolate syrup and milk in a 2 quart saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the chocolate milk begins to steam and mixture is well blended. Remove from heat.
Drizzle caramel syrup into a bottom corner of a 1 quart resealable plastic bag. Place 2 heaping tablespoons whipped cream over caramel syrup. Repeat drizzling syrup and adding whipped cream two more times. Close bag gently removing all air. Cut a 1/2 inch wide corner off the bottom of the bag.
Ladle the hot chocolate into four serving cups. Squeeze topping from the bag in a circular motion creating a caramel cream swirl over each drink.
