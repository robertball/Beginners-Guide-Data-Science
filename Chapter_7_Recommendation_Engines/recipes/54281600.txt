Ingredients:
2 (5 ounce) salmon fillets
1-1/3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon white wine
1 teaspoon honey
1 tablespoon and 2-1/4 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
1-1/4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and spray with non-stick cooking spray.
Coat a small saucepan with non-stick cooking spray. Over medium heat, cook and stir garlic until soft, about 3 minutes. Mix in white wine, honey, balsamic vinegar, mustard, and salt and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, for about 3 minutes, or until slightly thickened.
Arrange salmon fillets on foil-lined baking sheet. Brush fillets with balsamic glaze, and sprinkle with oregano.
Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 14 minutes, or until flesh flakes easily with a fork. Brush fillets with remaining glaze, and season with salt and pepper. Use a spatula to transfer fillets to serving platter, leaving the skin behind on the foil.
