Ingredients:
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 pounds boneless country-style ribs, cut into 2-inch chunks
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup hot water
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1 small onion, halved and sliced

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Add rib pieces; shake to coat.
In a pressure cooker, brown meat on all sides in oil; drain.
Combine the water, ketchup, chili powder and hot pepper sauce; pour over ribs. Add onion.
Close cover securely; place pressure regulator on vent pipe. Bring cooker to full pressure over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook for 15 minutes. (Pressure regulator should maintain a slow steady rocking motion; adjust heat if needed.) Remove from the heat; allow pressure to drop on its own.
Skim fat from sauce if necessary and serve with ribs if desired.
