6 T butter, divided
3 slices prosciutto, diced
2 T minced shallots
3 minced garlic cloves
1 c sliced mushrooms
1/4 c Marsala wine
1/2 t black pepper
1 c chicken stock
2 t corn starch

Directions:
Combine ingredients for chicken rub in a small bowl.  Use your thumb and fingers to crush the spices in a bowl to release the flavor.
Rub each chicken breast with the spices and allow to sit for 20 minutes or so.
Place medium saute pan on stove on med-high and add 2 T olive oil to the pan.  Saute chicken breasts two at a time until cooked through (6-8 minutes per side).  Set chicken aside and loosely cover with foil.  Drain oil from pan.
Melt 3 T butter in same saute pan on medium and add mushrooms.  Saute until golden brown.  Remove and set aside.
Melt additional 3 T butter in saute pan.  Saute prosciutto in the melted butter for about 2-3 minutes.  Add shallots and garlic and saute 30 seconds.
Add Marsala wine and simmer for another 30 seconds.  Add cooked mushrooms and black pepper.  Simmer for 5 minutes.
Dissolve corn starch in chicken stock.  Add stock to saucepan and simmer an additional 5 minutes.
Add parsley and cream to sauce and simmer for 3-4 minutes or until thick.
Add chicken breasts, cover pan, and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
Serve over a bed of egg noodles.
