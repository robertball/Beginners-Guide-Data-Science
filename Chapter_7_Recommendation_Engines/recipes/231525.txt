Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup olive oil
1 cup cold water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Stir olive oil and cold water into dry ingredients, mixing to make a soft dough. Pinch off a handful of dough, roll into a thick log between your hands,  and use a scissors to cut into pieces about 2 inches long. Place biscuits about 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven on middle rack for 15 minutes; flip biscuits and bake until golden brown on both sides, about 15 minutes more. Let cool on pieces of waxed paper. Place biscuits into a sealed container and refrigerate overnight for best flavor.
