Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup cold unsalted butter diced
1/4 cup cold vegetable shortening
1-3 tablespoons ice water

Directions:
By Hand Directions:
Place flour and salt in a large bowl, whisk to combine.
Add the butter and shortening and work it into the flour using a pastry cutter or two forks until the mixture resembles small peas.
Add 1 tablespoon of water and continue working the dough until it comes together, adding more water as needed.
Turn out dough onto a sheet of wax paper and form it into a disk. Top with another sheet of wax paper and roll into a circle that’s about 12” diameter and 1/4” thick. Lift wax paper from the top to loosen, then replace and carefully flip the crust and do the same with the bottom wax paper.
Carefully transfer the crust to your pie plate and crimp edges as desired. Chill until ready to use.
For a baked pie: fill according to pie directions and bake as directed.
For a filled pie: poke the bottom and sides of very cold crust with the tines of a fork several times. Bake at 400°F for 11-14 minutes until cooked through and slightly golden brown.
For a double crust or lattice pie: double the recipe, splitting the dough ball in two before rolling it out. Chill the top layer for about 10-15 minutes or until it’s firm but still workable before adding it to the top of the pie.
