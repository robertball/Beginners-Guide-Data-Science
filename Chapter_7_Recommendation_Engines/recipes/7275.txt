Ingredients:
6 carrots, quartered
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3/4 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple with juice
1 (3.5 ounce) package flaked coconut
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a small saucepan, cover carrots with water. Bring water to a boil and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Let cool and mash.
In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs.  Add vegetable oil, buttermilk, 2 cups white sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla.  Add flour, baking soda, ground cinnamon and salt.   Mix in pineapple, 2 cups mashed carrots, nuts and coconut.
Pour into paper towel-lined 13 x 9 x 2-1/2 inch pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 minutes, or until cake tests done.
Place cake on a plate, and allow to cool completely before frosting.
To Make Frosting: Combine cream cheese, melted butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and confectioners' sugar.  Spread on cooled cake.  Cake tastes best after refrigerating  overnight.

Description: 
The difference between this and other carrot cakes is the fact that the carrots  are pre-cooked instead of raw. It is a really moist cake that is better the day after it is made. Cake tastes best after refrigerating overnight.
