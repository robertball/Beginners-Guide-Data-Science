Ingredients:
1 cup apple cider
9 tbs. lemon juice
6 tbs. Worcestershire sauce
10-15 drops hot sauce
2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/2 cup apple jelly
Family pack of chicken pieces. I prefer thighs

Directions:
Combine marinade ingredients. Heat and stir just till jelly melts. Cool to room temp. While that's cooling remove skins from chicken. I like to do this when it's about half defrosted so it's easier to handle. Place chicken and marinade in 1 gal. zipper lock bag for at least 1 hour, 4 is better. Grill, turning freguently being careful not to let chicken burn. Takes about 1/2 hour depending on size of chicken.

Description: 
Family favorite grilled chicken. Sweet apple taste with a little spice. One of the best things about our time in Texas was learning to grill great food like this. After the first time you make this recipe everyone will know when you are making it just by the delicious smoke smell from cooking.
