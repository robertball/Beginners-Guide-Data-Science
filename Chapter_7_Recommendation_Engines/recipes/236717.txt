Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon gluten-free vanilla extract
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup sorghum flour
1/2 cup sweet rice flour
1/2 cup brown rice flour
1/2 cup almond meal
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Beat the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the eggs, one at a time, into the butter mixture until completely blended; add vanilla extract.
Whisk cornstarch, sorghum flour, sweet rice flour, brown rice flour, almond meal, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture; add oats and mix to form a soft dough. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are golden and set, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
These oatmeal cookies are very moist with a good flavor. Add a cup of raisins, chocolate chips, or cinnamon chips if you desire. I know it is a lot of ingredients, but wow are they good. Pour a big glass of milk and enjoy! Yum yum!
