Ingredients:
*5 med potatoes
*5 stalks of celery
*6 carrots
*2 med onions
*3 bell peppers ( i use one red, yellow and green )
*1lb bag of frozen peas or corn (your decision)
*1 can cream of mush soup
*1 can tomato soup
*1 can golden cream of mushroom soup
*1 can beef broth (optional, I dont use it)
*1 14.5oz can diced tomatoes (optional, I use this in place of beef broth)
*2 cups 2% milk
*1/3 cup instant tapioca mix
*1 tbsp basil
*2 tbsp white sugar
*2 tbsp olive oil
*3 tsp chopped garlic
*salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Peel, wash and dice potatoes into medium sized chunks. Quarter your carrots. Chop celery. De-core and chop bell peppers into medium sized chunks. Slice onions into rings. Place potatoes into large pot and add olive oil and cook over medium heat for 5-7 minutes. Now add your celery, onions, bell pepper and carrots. Cook for an additional 5 minutes. Add, salt and pepper, sugar, basil and garlic. Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes. Now add your cream of mush soups, tomato soup, and beef broth or diced tomatoes (which ever one you chose to use), milk and tapioca mix. Stir well bringing to a boil. Constantly stir so milk does not burn on bottom of pan. Once boiling, reduce to low, cover and simmer for 3 hours, or untill your desired tenderness for veggies has been acquired. Be sure to stir once every hour to ensure the tapioca is mixing well. This goes amazingly well with a crisp baguette cut into slices with a balsmic vinaigrette/olive oil dipping mixture and sliced havarti cheese and red wine.
