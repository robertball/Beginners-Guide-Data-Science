Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup warm water
2 1/4 teaspoons rapid rise yeast
2 tablespoons raw honey or raw sugar
2 teaspoons sea salt
4 cups whole wheat flour
2 tablespoons gluten
Toppings (Optional)
1 tablespoon filled flax seeds (mixed with 3 tbsp water)
sesame seeds
poppy seeds
garlic (minced)
onion (minced)

Directions:
In a large bowl (I use a KitchenAid mixer), combine water, sweetener and yeast. Stir until yeast is dissolved.
Add salt, flour and gluten and mix until a dough has formed.
Knead for 10 minutes by hand or 5 minutes with a mixer with a dough hook.
Cover with a towel and let sit in a warm spot until dough has doubled in size.
Punch down and divide into 8 equal pieces.
Shape each piece into a flat circle, no more than one inch thick.
Place on a non-stick or parchment lined baking sheet and let rise for about 1/2 hour.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees.
If using topping(s), brush each bun with flax seed and water mixture.
Sprinkle with desired topping(s).
Bake 25 - 30 minutes.
