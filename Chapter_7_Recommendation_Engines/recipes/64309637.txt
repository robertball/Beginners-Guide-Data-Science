2 cups medium grain rice [Calrosa]
2 1/2 water
6 tbsp rice vinegar
1/4 cup lite soy sauce
1/4 cup oyster sauce
1/2 cup sugar [or 2 Tbsp truvia]

1.2 oz [10 servings] roasted seasoned seaweed

Directions:
Mix together soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar or Truvia in a recloseable gallon bag.
Slice Spam into 1/2 inch cubes, place cubes in bag with marinade. Zip bag shut, turn, gently squeezing to coat Spam in marinade. Marinate at least 1 hour.
In saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add rice. Bring back to boil, cover pan, reduce heat to low, simmer 15 minutes.
In the meantime, warm a skillet over medium high heat. Add Spam, stirring frequently  till Spam is browned and the marinade is absorbed.
When rice is done cooking, add rice vinegar to rice, stirring to combine.
Tear seaweed sheets into 1 1/2 inch pieces.
In large bowl, stir together rice and seaweed. Add Spam, toss to mix all ingredients.
