Ingredients:
Meat Loaf:
2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1 package (6 ounce) dry stuffing mix, any variety
3/4 cup milk
2 eggs
1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
Glaze:
1/2 cup maple-flavored syrup
1/2 cup ketchup

Directions:
In a large bowl combine lean beef, onion, and stuffing mix.
In a small bowl, beat together milk, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Pour over meat mixture and blend together with your hands, or use a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment.
Press meatloaf mixture firmly into a 9" x 5" loaf pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Drain off any fat, if necessary.
Make glaze: In a small bowl, stir together ketchup and syrup.
Spoon 1/4-1/2 c. glaze over the top of the partially-baked meatloaf. Return meatloaf to oven and bake an additional 15 minutes, or until firm. (Test by inserting a knife into the center. It should not feel "mushy" or reveal a pink center.)
Remove from oven; let stand 10 minutes. Serve with extra glaze or ketchup.
