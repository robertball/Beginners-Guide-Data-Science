4.Whisk eggs until evenly yellow and fry into flat omelet.
5.Cut cooked egg into long strips.
6.Cook bulgogi according to recipe directions.
7.Using a bamboo sushi roller or a piece of tin foil, lay the dried seaweed shiny side down.
8.Spread about ½ cup of rice onto 2/3 of the seaweed, leaving the top 1/3 bare (if you moisten your fingers or a spoon to pat down the rice, you'll get less of a sticky mess).
9.Lay the first ingredient down around 1/3 of the way up from the bottom of the seaweed.
10.Lay the other fillings down on top.
11.Roll from the bottom (as if you're rolling a sleeping bag), pressing down to make the fillings stay in.
12.As you continue to roll, pull the whole thing down towards the end of the bamboo mat.
13.Spread a tiny dab of water along the top seam to hold the roll together.
14.Set aside and continue with other seaweed sheets.
15.Cut each roll into 7-8 pieces.

Description: 
I am calling these Korean rice rolls “sushi” because at first glance, they do resemble the Japanese rolls that Westerners associate with sushi. But kimbap is not considered fine or fancy fare in Korea, it's actually picnic and snack food that you eat with your hands. Traditional fillings include seasoned vegetables, egg, meat and/or imitation crab, but these days anything goes. From Seoul to NYC, fillings range from cheesy to spicy to fresh. Kimbap is like the Korean version of a sandwich- you can change the filling to fit any diet, palate, or occasion.
