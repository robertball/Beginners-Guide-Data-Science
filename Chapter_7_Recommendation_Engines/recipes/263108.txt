Ingredients:
1/2 head lettuce, shredded
1 large tomato, chopped
1/2 large mango, chopped
1/2 large red onion, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
4 tablespoons mayonnaise, divided
2 tablespoons sriracha sauce, divided
1 teaspoon lemon juice, divided
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 pound mahi mahi fillets
2 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
1 tablespoon blackening seasoning (such as Louisiana Fish Fry Products)
1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
2 (8 inch) flour tortillas, warmed

Directions:
Combine lettuce, tomato, mango, red onion, red bell pepper, and cilantro in a medium bowl and mix thoroughly. Add 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, 1 teaspoon sriracha sauce, and 3/4 teaspoon lemon juice; mix together. Add salt and pepper. Refrigerate salsa until ready to serve.
Mix 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon sriracha sauce, and remaining lemon juice in a small bowl.
Coat shrimp and mahi mahi fillets with 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and cover with blackening and Cajun seasoning. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add fillets; cook until fish is golden, firm, and easily flaked with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place fillets on a plate. Add shrimp to the pan; cook until opaque, about 3 minutes per side.
Spread a layer of the sriracha-mayonnaise sauce over each tortilla. Add shrimp to 1 tortilla and mahi mahi to the other. Add mango salsa to both.
