Ingredients:
1 pound dry pinto beans
4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 clove garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons butter
2 cups chopped onion
1 2/3 cups canned stewed tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 1/4 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Soak pinto beans overnight with plenty of water to cover. Drain, remove to a large cooking pot, and cover with fresh water. Add the bacon, red chile flakes, and garlic. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for about 3 hours.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in butter until tender. Add the tomatoes, parsley, cumin, marjoram, and salt. Simmer over low heat for about 45 minutes to blend the flavors.
When beans are tender, drain off any remaining water. Pour in the tomato mixture, and simmer for an additional 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve hot.

Description: 
This recipe was used by a chef I worked for and still enjoy feeding to my crew at home. This was served as a side dish for a Mardi Gras feast. You can also make this for vegetarian by omitting the bacon. A little of the favor is missing, but it still has a kick.
