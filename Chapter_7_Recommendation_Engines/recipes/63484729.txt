Sweet Deviled Eggs Recipe

Ingredients:
12 eggs
2 teaspoon white vinegar
2 tablespoon real mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon prepared mustard
2 tablespoon pickle relish
4 tablespoons sugar or to taste
salt and pepper to taste
2 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Place eggs in a pot of salted water with a touch of vinegar (makes it easier to peel). Bring the water to a boil, and let eggs cook in boiling water until they are hard boiled, approximately 8 to 10 minutes. Drain eggs, and let cool. Once cool, remove the shell, cut the eggs in half lengthwise and scoop out the yolks.
Place the yolks in a medium-size mixing bowl and mash them. Blend in vinegar, mayonnaise, mustard, relish, sugar, salt and pepper. You may need to add more mayonnaise to hold the mixture together, or more sugar to sweetness preference, but it should be slightly dry.
Carefully put the egg yolk mixture back into the egg whites but do not pack it.  There will be enough mixture so the whites are overfilled.  Sprinkle with paprika.  Garnish with parsley or an olive. Refrigerate before serving.

Description: 
My families holiday favorite, especially with our farm fresh eggs.  If you like your deviled eggs a bit on the sweet side, these are for you.  I do admit to alot of guessing on the quantities, but they seem to always be a hit.Modified from: Deviled Eggs II
