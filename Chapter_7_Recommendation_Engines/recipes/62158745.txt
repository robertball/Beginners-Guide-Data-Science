Ingredients:
2 cups of Fresh picked Dandilions
1-1/2 cups of Flour
1 cup vegetable oil
Salt and Pepper

Directions:
First off, before you pick the dandilions, make sure they have not been sprayed with any chemicals.
After you pick as much as you like, make sure the stems are picked off.
Then put the dandilions in a large bowl and fill with water and some salt to kill off any little ants that may be on them, let soak for a few minutes.
Drain the water off and rinse several times then put them into a strainer and shake off any water.
Next take the flour and put in medium size bowl and add your salt and pepper, mix, then add the dandilions, and cover them real well.
In a large skillet, take the vegetable oil and heat on med. high, once the oil sizzles when water hits it, its ready.
Dip the dandilions into the hot oil and fry til lightly golden brown and crisp, stirring occasionally, about 2-3 minutes, be careful not to burn.
Place on paper towels when done, and enjoy!

This little yellow flower burst with some awesome flavor when pan fried. My mom and grandma always used to make these while we were kids and now me and my sisters make them.
