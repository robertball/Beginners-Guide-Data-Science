Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) broiler-fryer chicken, cut up
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 small onion, chopped
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Place chicken in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a saucepan, whisk flour and water until smooth. Stir in brown sugar, ketchup, vinegar, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Cool.
Stir in the remaining ingredients. Pour over chicken. Cover and refrigerate for 2-4 hours. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 35-45 minutes or until chicken juices run clear.

Description: 
A tangy form-scratch sauce makes this tender chicken extra flavorful. My mom is an excellent cook who has fixed delicious dishes like this one for years. If you're in a hurry, just prepare it ahead and pop it in the oven when you get home.
