1/4 cup white vinegar or lemon juice
8 pieces of chicken with the bone (breasts, thighs, legs, wings)

Directions:
Combine Carnation Milk(R) and vinegar in a large bowl. It will thicken up. Add chicken pieces and make sure the pieces are covered in the milk mixture. Cover well and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place flour in a shallow dish. Remove chicken from milk. Dip chicken pieces into flour, shaking off any excess. Place on prepared baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper.
Bake in preheated oven 50 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Turn chicken over after 30 minutes and continue baking.
