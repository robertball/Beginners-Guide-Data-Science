Description: 
My friend Mary Thompson baked this and brought it to share when we both worked for Girl Scouts. She had found the recipe in the LA Times (or maybe she was the Mary who requested it through the SOS column!) I've made it twice and want to figure out how to adapt it for my bread machine. It is DELISH!
