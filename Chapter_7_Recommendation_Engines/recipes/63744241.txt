Description: 
This healthier version of a broccoli salad uses yogurt instead of mayo and low-fat cheese to cut down on fat but not flavor.  Vegetarians can take out the bacon, and vegans can leave out the bacon and cheeses.  The result will still be a tasty, healthy salad.  This is a great dish for any family dinner or occasion.Modified from: Bodacious Broccoli Salad
