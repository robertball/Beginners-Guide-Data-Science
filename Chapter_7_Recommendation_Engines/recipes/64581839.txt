Ingredients:
15 oz part-skim ricotta
1 large egg
Â¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup spinach, chopped
Salt and pepper
4 cups homemade tomato sauce
4 medium grilled zucchini, sliced ?" thick
16 oz part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded
2 tbsp parsley, chopped

Directions:
In a medium bowl mix ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, spinach. Stir well and set it aside.
Lightly coat the inside of the slow cooker with cooking spray.
Ladle about 1 cup of homemade tomato sauce on the bottom of the slow cooker and spread it well.
Layer 5 or 6 zucchini slices to cover.
Place some of the ricotta cheese mixture and top with the mozzarella cheese.
Repeat the layers until all your ingredients are all used up.
Top the lasagna with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
Cover and cook on high for 3-1/2 to 4 hours.
Turn off the slow cooker and let stand for about 1 hours. (UPDATE: Since some readers said the lasagna became a little soupy, I made it again and I let it stand for about 3 HOURS before serving. I found it was great because the liquid absorbed much more - Please, do not forget this step).
Before serving top with fresh parsley
