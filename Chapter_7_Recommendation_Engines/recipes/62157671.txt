Ingredients:
1 cup sour cream
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 c baking soda
4 cups all purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 c cream of tartar
1 c salt
1 cup unsalted butter, cold
2 cups milk chocolate chunks
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 Tbs white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Mix the sour cream, egg, vanilla, and baking soda in a bowl.
In another bowl mix all the dry ingredients. With a pastry blender, cut in the cold butter until coarse crumbs remains.
Add the chocolate chunks and mix well.
Add the cream mixture and mix just until moistened.
Roll the dough into a 1-1/2 inch thick round.
Cut dough into 12 even wedges. Brush the scones with the remaining egg and sprinkle with sugar.
Place the wedges onto a greased baking sheet about 2 inches apart.
Bake for about 15-20 minutes or until they look golden brown.
Serve warm.
