Ingredients:
Tacos
*1 lb. of your choice fish (I use Mahi mahi or  grouper)
*Juice of 1/2 lime
*1 to 2 Tbl taco seasoning
*Flour tortillas
Peach salsa
*1 tomato
*2 large peaches
*1 Tbl diced yellow onion
*1 clove garlic diced
*1/2 to 2 whole jalepenos (to taste)
*Juice of 1 lime
Honey-lime slaw
*1 cup cabbage shredded (or bagged slaw mix)
*3 Tbl cup plain yogurt
*1 Tbl honey
*Juice from 1/2 lime

Directions:
Marinate the fish in this seasoning and lime juice overnight or while you are making the salsa and coleslaw. Rub the fish with a little olive oil to prevent sticking if grilling. I like to cook the fish on my cast iron grill, about 6 minutes per side, depending on the thickness. Could be grilled, pan fried in a little oil, or baked.
Peach salsa- Mix all ingredients. Great to use right away, but tastes better after refrigerating a few hours.
Slaw- Whisk together honey, lime, and yogurt. Mix with shredded cabbage.
Flake fish and add to warmed tortillas. Spoon some salsa and cole slaw over top. Then enjoy!

Description: 
I was craving a fresh tasting fish dish and getting sick of plain grilled fish. Tried this out with some fresh peaches & tomatoes from the garden. I think it turned out fantastic! You can make everything ahead and grill the fish just prior to eating. This is the first recipe I am posting, I hope you like it.
