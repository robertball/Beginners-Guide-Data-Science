Ingredients:
2 bags (1 lb each) Green GiantÂ® frozen cut green beans
1 can (8 oz) sliced water chestnuts, drained
1/2 cup roasted red bell peppers (from 7-oz jar), cut into small strips
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 container (10 oz) refrigerated Alfredo pasta sauce
1 can (2.8 oz) French-fried onions

Directions:
Spray inside of 3- to 4-quart slow cooker with cooking spray. In large bowl, mix all ingredients except onions. Stir in half of the onions; spoon mixture into slow cooker.
Cover; cook on Low heat setting 3 to 4 hours, stirring after 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
About 5 minutes before serving, in 6-inch skillet, heat remaining half of onions over medium-high heat 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until hot. Stir bean mixture; sprinkle with onions.
Either jarred Alfredo sauce or sauce prepared from a dry mix can be used. Whichever sauce you choose, measure 1 1/4 cups.
Look for jars of roasted red bell peppers near the pickles and olives.
