1 (18.25 oz) pkg Devilâ€™s Food Cake Mix
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup butterscotch chips
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 cup sweetened flake coconut
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk (NOT evaporated milk)

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large bowl, combine the cake mix with butter.  Blend with a pastry blender or fork until crumbly.  Sprinkle evenly in the bottom of a greased 9 x 13-inch pan.  Press lightly.
Sprinkle butterscotch chips and chocolate chips evenly over top of cake layer.  Top with coconut and nuts.
Pour sweetened condensed milk evenly over top of the ingredients in the pan.  Use the whole can, even though it seems like a lot.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 30 minutes or until light golden brown.  Cool completely.  Cut into bars.
