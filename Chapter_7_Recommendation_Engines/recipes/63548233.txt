Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
2 heads of green cabbage (I save the lighter color near the core for soup)
3/4 of a head of cauliflower
1 medium zucchini
3 cloves Garlic, minced
1 small yellow onion, chopped
2 large eggs
1/4 cup almond flour
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
Equipment Â– food processor with the shredder attachment
Tomato Sauce
1 28 oz can crushed tomato (recommend san marzano)
1 cup low sodium chicken broth
1-2 cloves garlic, minced or chopped
1 teaspoon dry parsley
1 8 oz can organic tomato paste
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F
Mix first 4 ingredients in a sauce pan and bring to a boil. Add tomato paste and fill the can 1/4 of the way with hot tap water and take all of the paste of the edges of the can and stir into the sauce. Taste then season with salt and pepper. Let simmer for at least 30 minutes.
Using a large sauce pan fill 3/4 of the way with water and bring to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of sea salt and add in Cauliflower for 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the cauliflower and let sit in a bowl. Meanwhile keep the water boiling and add in cabbage (you may only be able to do one at a time) Boil for 5 minutes, remove from pan and set aside.
Uisng your food processor and attach the shredder disk and put the cauliflower and zucchini through and put into a large bowl.
Meanwhile take another large bowl and add pork and beef, onion, garlic, spices and salt/pepper then mix together.
Start adding the cauliflower mixture into the meat until it is about an even in ratio. There may be some of the cauliflower/zucchini mixture left over. Add eggs and almond flower and combine well (do not over mix). Take your baking dish and pour enough tomato sauce to coat the bottom of the pan.
Separate cabbage leaves and lay on the counter or a cutting board.
Taking one at a time lay flat, using a tablespoon scoop filling and roll in your hand and place in the middle of the leaf. Starting at the bottom of the leaf roll once, bring in sides and continue to roll. Place cabbage seam side down. Repeat process with the other leaves.
Cover with tomato sauce and bake covered for 1 hour
Save a little sauce for any additional sauce to add on your serving plate

Description: 
love stuffed cabbage (Galumpkis) and wanted to share my version of Paleo Stuffed Cabbage. I also love zucchini so I find a way to incorporate in many meals. I made this for a dinner party and everyone was commenting on how delicious and light they were but nobody realized that rice was omitted and I used cauliflower and zucchini. I was hoping for left-overs but that was not the case!!
