Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
4 eggs
5 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon parsley
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1 cup spinach leaves, divided
1/2 cup canned artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
2 roma (plum) tomatoes, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish.
Beat eggs, bacon, mozzarella cheese, milk, flour, garlic, parsley, and thyme together in a bowl until evenly combined.
Arrange 1/2 of the spinach in the bottom of the pie crust; sprinkle artichoke hearts over spinach layer. Pour egg mixture over artichoke hearts. Layer the remaining spinach over egg mixture; top with tomato slices.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the quiche comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
Delicious quiche! Just try it already. My favorite part about it is how beautiful it is. Usually I don't make attractive-looking things!
