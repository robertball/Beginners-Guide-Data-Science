Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 cups sliced fresh strawberries
1 cup strawberry puree
1 cup rhubarb puree
1 cup 1/4-inch slices rhubarb
2 1/2 cups brown rice flour
1/2 cup tapioca starch
1/2 cup garbanzo-fava bean flour
1/4 cup coconut flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans evenly with butter.
Combine cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition. Pour in vegetable oil; beat until fluffy. Fold in strawberries, strawberry puree, rhubarb puree, and rhubarb gently.
Mix brown rice flour, tapioca starch, garbanzo-fava bean flour, coconut flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt together in a separate bowl. Fold into the strawberry-rhubarb mixture until thoroughly blended. Add walnuts and vanilla extract to the batter.
Divide batter between the greased loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes; invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Dense, moist, sweet, and tender quick bread loaded with rhubarb and strawberries. This recipe originated in the strawberry beds while picking those gold-speckled ruby and wine-colored sweet spring fruits. The rhubarb is planted alongside the beds and its red and green stalks were begging to be harvested. The two combined are visually beautiful, fragrant and delicious.
