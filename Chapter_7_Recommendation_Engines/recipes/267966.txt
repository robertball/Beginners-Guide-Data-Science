Ingredients:
1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 (8 ounce) container creme fraiche
1 egg
1/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup mixed nuts
3 pears - peeled, cored and sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Unroll the puff pastry sheet and line a tart pan with it. Cut off any overhanging pastry. Prick pastry several times with a fork.
Stir together creme fraiche, egg, and sugar in a bowl until smooth. Fold in nut mix.
Arrange pear slices on puff pastry and cover with creme fraiche mixture.
Bake tart in the preheated oven until the filling is lightly colored and pastry has puffed up and browned, about 25 minutes.
