Ingredients:
1 cup canola oil
1 (16 ounce) package wonton wrappers
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds
1 pound frozen ahi tuna, thawed and cut into 1/2-inch chunks
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon dill pickle juice
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce, or more to taste
1 avocado, cut into chunks

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cut wonton wrappers into small triangles 2 to 3 inches in length. Cook in the hot oil in a single layer until crispy and golden, 1 minute per layer. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
Combine soy sauce and sesame seeds in a bowl. Add ahi tuna; mix until coated with soy sauce and sesame seeds.
Mix mayonnaise, pickle juice, and sriracha sauce together in a small bowl to make sauce.
Arrange fried wonton wrappers on a large serving plate. Layer ahi tuna and avocado chunks on top. Drizzle sauce on top.
