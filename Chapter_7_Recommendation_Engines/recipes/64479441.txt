Ingredients:
1 cup part-skim ricotta cheese; 1/4 cup honey; 1/8 teaspoon almond extract; 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar; 1/4 cup sliced almonds; 3 large, ripe peaches, pitted and cut into 1/2 inch wedges; 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme

Directions:
1.  Combine the ricotta, 2 tablespoons of the honey and the almond extract in a mini food processor; puree until smooth, about 1 minute.  Transfer to a small bowl, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (and up to 3 days).  2.  Combine the balsamic vinegar and the remaining 2 tablespoons of honey in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Once the mixture begins to boil, reduce the heat to medium and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it has reduced to a syrup measuring about 1/4 cup, which will thicken further when it cools.  If the balsamic vinegar you're using is aged or of very good quality, it will take about half the time to reduce to 1/4 cup.  3.  Toast the almonds in a small, dry skillet over medium-low heat, stsirring frequently, until golden and fragrant, shaking the pan as needed to avoid scorching.  Cool completely.  4.  Toss together the peaches, tyme and the balsamic syrup in a medium bowl.  This may be done up to 2 hours in advance.).  5.  Divide the ricotta mixture among 4 cocktail glasses or dessert bowls.  Top with the peach mixture, sprinkle with almonds and serve.
