Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
1 teaspoon olive oil
3 leeks, chopped
2 cups chicken broth
6 small red potatoes, cubed
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 bay leaf
1/4 cup half-and-half cream
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
Heat butter and olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Cook and stir leeks in hot butter and oil until softened, but not browned, about 5 minutes.
Increase heat to medium-high and add chicken broth, potatoes, dill, and bay leaf. Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.
Whisk half-and-half with flour in a small bowl until smooth; set aside.
Mash about half of the potatoes against the side of the pot using a fork for a creamy, chunky soup.
Stir flour mixture into the soup. Continue simmering until thickened, about 5 minutes.
