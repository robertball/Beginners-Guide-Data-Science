Description: 
This is one my favorite green bean side dishes. It has been in my family for a very long time. It goes great with pot roast and potatoes. It's almost like a green bean relish. Not your ordinary green bean dish! Even better left over. I've also added rinsed and drained water chestnuts for some crunch.
