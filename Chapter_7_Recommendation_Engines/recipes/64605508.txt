2/3 cup pumpkin puree (not pie filling)

Directions:
Place all the ingredients into a food processor and blend until smooth and creamy scraping down the sides as needed.
Add more olive oil if it's too thick.
Taste and adjust seasonings.
Place the savory pumpkin hummus in a shallow bowl, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, garnish with sesame seeds, chopped parsley and paprika.

Description: 
Classic hummus is made with chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, and salt. But did you know that you can add different ingredients and have a new flavor every time? Now that autumn is upon us, I wanted to give a fall twist to the classic dip.
