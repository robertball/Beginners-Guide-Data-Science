Ingredients:
6 ounces processed American cheese, shredded
3/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon prepared mustard
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1 dash ground white pepper
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
In a saucepan over low heat, stir the cheese and milk 10 minutes, or until smooth. Stir in the mustard, soy sauce and white pepper.
In a small bowl, mix the egg and 3/4 cup of the hot mixture.
Combine the egg mixture with the remaining hot mixture. Continue cooking over low heat, stirring constantly, for  approximately 10 minutes, until the mixture thickens and boils.

Description: 
My version of the old classic, using American cheese, mustard and soy sauce.  Takes a bit of time, but worth the effort! Serve it on toast. Garnish with crumbled bacon and chopped tomato.
