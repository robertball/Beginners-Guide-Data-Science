Ingredients:
1 (14 pound) turkey
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
Herb Butter:
1 cup butter, softened
1 tablespoon fresh thyme
1 tablespoon fresh sage
2 tablespoons flat leaf parsley
1 tablespoon fresh chives
1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
Remove giblets and neck from the cavity of the turkey. Rinse and dry bird. Fold wing tips behind the turkey. Season the cavity with salt and pepper.
Combine butter and fresh herbs.
Starting at the neck end of the turkey, loosen the skin by sliding your fingers underneath it, being careful not to tear it. Slide your hand as far as you can toward the other end of the turkey, separating the skin from the meat. Rub two-thirds of the herb butter over the entire breast. Tie drumsticks in front.
Place the bird on a rack in a roasting pan breast-side up; cover loosely with a foil tent. Place bird in oven and decrease the temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake 3 to 3 1/2 hours.
Melt remaining herb butter. Remove foil tent from turkey during the last 45 minutes of baking and baste once with melted butter.
The turkey is done when the thigh meat reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees F and the breast meat reaches an internal temperature of 170 degrees F. When the turkey is done, remove from the oven; let stand 30 minutes before carving.
