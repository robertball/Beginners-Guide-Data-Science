2 tablespoons olive oil
1 lime, zested and juiced

1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (optional)
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 cup bean sprouts

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain and return to pot.

Serve topped with avocado slices and more freshly ground black pepper.
