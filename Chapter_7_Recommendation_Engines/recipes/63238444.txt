Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups water
1 tablespoon oil
2 tablespoon PB2
1 handful of blueberries

Directions:
Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, PB2 and salt into a large bowl.  Whisk the water and oil together in a small bowl.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and pour in the wet.  Stir just until blended; mixture will be lumpy.  Add in blueberries and stir.  Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
