Ingredients:
4 Chicken Breasts, thawed or frozen
2 Tbsp Butter, softened or melted
1 packet dry italian dressing mix
8 oz cream cheese
1 can cream of mushroom soup (standard size)

Directions:
Place chicken breasts in crockpot. Coverwith softened or melted butter, then coat with dry dressing. Cook until chicken is no longer pink inside. This will likely be 4-6 hours on high or 6-8 hours on low. (Thawed chicken requires less cooking time than frozen).
30 minutes before serving, combine cream cheese and soup in a small saucepan over low-medium heat, whisking until smooth. Pour over chicken, shredding chicken (if desired) and stirring until incorporated.
For best results, let mixture continue to cook on low for 30 minutes to incorporate flavors. (Can omit this step if short on time)
Serve over your choice of rice, noodles, toast, etc.

Description: 
It's not pretentious or gourmet by any means, but if you want a simple, yummy comfort-style food even picky children will eat, try this out. I serve it over rice with a side of steamed veggies and let everyone salt and pepper it to taste. It's quick to throw in the crock pot, and easy to keep the ingredients on hand. We love this meal.
