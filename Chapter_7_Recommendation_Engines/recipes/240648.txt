Ingredients:
8 ounces mini pretzels
1 cup butter
1 cup light brown sugar
2 cups milk chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 11x17-inch baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
Spread pretzels onto the prepared baking sheet.
Combine butter and brown sugar in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and mixture is thickened, 5 to 8 minutes. Pour mixture over pretzels.
Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Sprinkle chocolate chips over pretzel mixture. Bake for 1 minute more. Stir mixture to evenly spread chocolate over pretzels. Lightly sprinkle salt over pretzels. Cool until set, 2 to 3 hours. Break into pieces.
