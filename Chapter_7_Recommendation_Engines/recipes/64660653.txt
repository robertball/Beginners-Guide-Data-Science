Ingredients:
1 whole Chicken
1 cup Milk
2 whole Lemons, zested
1/2 stick Cinnamon
1  tsp Salt
10  cloves Garlic, whole & unpeeled
1 bunch fresh sage (or thyme) 1 tsp of dried sage or thyme can be substituted
Olive oil for sautéing

Directions:
Heat Instant Pot using Sauté function. Once hot, add a tbs of olive oil to coat the bottom of the pot, salt and pepper chicken on both sides and add to pot, breast side down.
Brown for 5-7 minutes and turn. Brown five minutes more. Turn off Sauté function.
Add zest from two lemons, 1 cup milk, 1 tsp salt, cinnamon, garlic, and fresh or dried sage or thyme.
Put lid on the instant pot and cook under high pressure for 25 minutes. Let stand for 5-10 minutes and then use the quick-release option to release pressure.
Remove chicken from sauce and take chicken off of the bone and break into bite-sized pieces.
Add chicken back into sauce and stir to combine.
Serve over any number of sides, a potato dish, a rice dish, or your favorite grain.
***Update**** I have had lots of questions on social media about browning in the instant pot and whether it will affect pressurization. Some have asked if you should scrub out the browned bits. I haven't had any problems with pressurization, but if you have a lot of caked on browning, it could interfere. If that's the case, DO NOT clean out the pot. You're just dumping tons of flavor down the sink. Instead, I would recommend de-glazing. After browning your chicken, take it out of the pot and set it aside. Add a small amount of milk (milk, water, or even chicken stock) to the pot while it's on the saute section. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the browned bits off the bottom of the pot. Add more liquid, a small amount at a time until you've released all the browning. Turn off the saute function and add the chicken back to the pot and proceed normally. Congrats! You now know a new cooking technique that's useful in stove-top cooking as well. btw, I really like my flat-bottomed stir fry style wooden spoon for de-glazing at it has a nice, flat edge for scraping up the browned bits.
