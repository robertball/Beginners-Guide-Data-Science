Ingredients:
2 cups peeled and cubed Yukon Gold potatoes
1 3/4 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup sliced carrots
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups frozen corn
1 1/2 cups cubed fully cooked ham
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 cups milk
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Combine potatoes, broth, carrots, and garlic in a large pot and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Stir in salt, garlic powder, and black pepper. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until potatoes and carrots are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add corn and ham. Reduce heat to lowest setting.
While soup simmers, melt butter in a saucepan and whisk in cornstarch. Add milk and whisk to combine. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, about 2 minutes. Pour mixture into the pot with the soup. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 2 minutes more, or until ready to serve.
