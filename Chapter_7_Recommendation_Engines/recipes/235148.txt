Spread 1/2 the angel food cake pieces on the bottom of a trifle dish. Pour 1/2 the whipped topping mixture in an even layer over the cake pieces. Sprinkle 1/2 the crushed candy bars over the top.

Description: 
Angel food cake, Butterfinger® candy bars and Cool Whip® are the well known favorites in this delightful (and easy) no-bake dessert. Looks great in a trifle bowl. I don't even like Butterfinger® bars and I thoroughly enjoy this stuff!! You can do this in a 9x13-inch pan as well, but the trifle looks so nice!
