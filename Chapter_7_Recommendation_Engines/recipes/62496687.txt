Ingredients:
1 Cup Quinoa Flour
1 Cup Almond Flour (also known as almond meal)
2 1/2 Tablespoons Potato Starch
1 Teaspoon Guar Gum
1/2 Teaspoon Kosher Salt
1 Tablespoon Corn Free Baking Powder
1 Egg
1 Cup Sugar
4 Tablespoons Melted Butter
1 1/4 Cup Yogurt or Sour Cream
1 1/2 Cup Fresh or Frozen Blueberries

Directions:
Combine all the dry ingredients in a bowl and wisk until mixed together. In a separate bowl wisk the egg until it is light in color (about 20-30 seconds. Then add the sugar and wisk until homogeneous (about 30 seconds). Next, add the melted butter in two to three additions and wisk well after each addition. Then add the yogurt/sour cream in two additions while making sure to not over mix. Add the blueberries to the dry mixture and gently stir to coat. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and fold for about 20 to 30 folds (there may be some small spots of flour but that is ok). Batter will also be very thick. Then fill 12-14 regular sized muffin tins with the batter mixture and bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until golden on top and a toothpick comes out clean. Let rest for about 5 min then remove from muffin pan.
