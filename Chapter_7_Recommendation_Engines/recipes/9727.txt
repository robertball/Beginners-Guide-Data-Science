Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup butter
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon amaretto liqueur
2 1/2 cups quick cooking oats
1 cup dried apricots
1/2 cup finely chopped almonds
2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons amaretto liqueur

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
In a large bowl beat the butter or margarine until softened.   Add the brown sugar and sugar and beat until fluffy.  Add egg and 1 tablespoon of amaretto and mix well.
Stir together flour and baking soda, and then add to the butter mixture and beat until well mixed.  Stir in the oats, apricots, and almonds.
Drop by rounded teaspoons onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 8-10 minutes.
Cool on cookie sheet for 1 minute, then remove and cool thoroughly on rack.
Stir together powdered sugar and enough of the 2 to 3 tablespoons of amaretto to make an icing of drizzling consistency.  Drizzle over the cookies.

Description: 
Chunky and chewy cookies...a delicious mouthful! Almond extract may be used in place of amaretto.  In dough use 1/2 tsp almond extract and 2 tsp of water in place of the amaretto.  In icing use 1/4 tsp almond extract and enough water to get the correct consistency in place of the amaretto.
