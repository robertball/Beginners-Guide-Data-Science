Ingredients:
1/2 cup almonds
5 cups shredded cabbage
1 1/2 cups dried cranberries
3/4 cup celery, diced
3/4 cup chopped green onion
3/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
Dressing:
1/2 cup mayonnaise (such as Hellman'sÂ®)
1 1/2 tablespoons honey mustard
1 1/2 tablespoons honey
3 pinches dried basil, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread almonds onto a baking sheet.
Toast almonds in the preheated oven until golden and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Cool completely.
Stir cabbage, cranberries, celery, green onion, red bell pepper, and toasted almonds together in a large bowl.
Whisk mayonnaise, honey mustard, honey, basil, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl until dressing is thick and creamy. Pour dressing over cabbage mixture and stir to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors combine, about 3 hours.
