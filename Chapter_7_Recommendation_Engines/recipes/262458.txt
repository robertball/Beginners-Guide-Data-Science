Ingredients:
Almond-flour pastry:
1 1/2 cups almond flour
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil
Filling:
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
6 slices bacon, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
5 eggs
1 teaspoon garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups shredded Gouda cheese
1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, cut into halves
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease an 11x7-inch glass baking dish.
Combine almond flour, Italian seasoning, and salt in a bowl; stir well. Mix in olive oil using a fork until mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Knead dough into a ball. Press down dough into the prepared baking dish to form the crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 20 minutes.  Let cool for 5 minutes. Brush bottom with Dijon mustard.
Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 3 minutes.
Whisk eggs and heavy cream together in a bowl. Season with garlic, salt, ground black pepper, and ground nutmeg.
Layer bacon pieces over the bottom of the almond-flour pastry; top with shredded Gouda cheese. Pour in egg mixture and place cherry tomatoes on top. Sprinkle with oregano.
Bake in the preheated oven until set and golden, about 30 minutes.
