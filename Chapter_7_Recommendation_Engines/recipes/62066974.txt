****************************************
Ingredients for Cake mixture:
250 g butter  (at room temp.)
2 heaped cups sugar (can be raw sugar or mixed or just plain white
a pinch of salt
3-4 lightly beaten eggs (dep. on size)
1 vial (4 ml; 0.14 fl.oz) Dr.Oetker rum flavouring
20 ml vanilla essence
1/2 cup brandy or orange brandy or cointreau
1/3 cup poppy seed
4 cups self raising flour
About 500 ml orange juice
zest of  oranges
Note !!!!!
If you have a juicer you can make your own orange juice!
When you do this do not peel the oranges.
This gives the cake a better flavouring!
For cake tins:
100 g unsalted butter, melted
2 x 1/3 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Method to Caramelize oranges and
lemon slices:
Scrub oranges and lemons well, grate the skin of  2 oranges and 2 lemons, put zest aside.
Slice those 2 oranges and 2 lemons into approx. 5 mm thick slices.
Juice remaining oranges and lemon, for cake and glaze.
Place 2 cups of white sugar into a heavy pan slowly add the water.
NOTE !!!!:
If a sugar crystal drops into the syrup during
cooking the whole syrup may crystallize when cooling.
To prevent this make sure the sugar is dissolved
completely, avoid splashing syrup against the sides
of the pan, use a wet pastry brush to wipe away any remaining sugar crystals.
All this has to be done before the liquid comes to a boil !!!
Dissolve the sugar and add the orange and lemon slices, bring to boil, lower heat and slowly simmer until slices are tender, if  syrup gets to heavy add some orange juice and if desired, brandy.
Making the Glaze:
Reduce remaining syrup by boiling vigorously, add some brandy and orange juice, marmalade can also be added at this stage to flavour the glaze.
When reduced to a thick syrup, remove from heat and let cool. if marmalade has been added, strain through a sieve to remove solids.
