Description: 
This is beautiful when cut to serve with the veggie stalks, onions and brilliant yellow yolks of the Easter boiled eggs in the middle. Some Easter egg yolks take on some food coloring. My mother would make a contest of having us kids guess whose eggs were who's. I know now it was her way for us to finish our plates! Also with good old ground beef.
