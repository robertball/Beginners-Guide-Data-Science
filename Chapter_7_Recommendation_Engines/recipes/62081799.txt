Ingredients:
2 cups cooked squash
3/4 cup stick margarine
2 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 cup sharp cheddar cheese, grated
1 cup evaporated milk
2 cups cracker crumbs (Ritz are best)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Saute the squash in some of the butter.  When cooked, thoroughly mash the squash with the other ingredients and mix well.  Cook in a greased 13 x 9 dish for about 60 minutes.  Cover for the first 45 minutes with aluminum foil and then remove foil for last 15 minutes of cooking time.  Top should be golden.
May be mixed ahead of time and baked the next day--leave onion out until just before baking though.

Description: 
This is my grandmother's recipe.  One Thanksgiving she broke her arm and I was entrusted with it.  Now that she is gone I love to make it in her honor.  It's by no means low fat but it is a wonderful, buttery, cheesy squash casserole perfect for family holidays--there's always a fight at our holidays over who gets to take the leftovers (if there are any)!
