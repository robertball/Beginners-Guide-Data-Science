Ingredients:
1 teaspoon salt
1 pound dandelion greens, torn into 4-inch pieces
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 onion, thinly sliced
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Soak dandelion greens in a large bowl of cold water with 1 teaspoon salt for 10 minutes. Drain.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil with 1 teaspoon salt. Cook greens until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water until chilled.
Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and red pepper flakes until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds more. Increase heat to medium-high and add dandelion greens. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
Sprinkle greens with Parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
Dandelion greens are one of my favorite bitters! They're not for everyone, but I enjoy their unique flavor. I decided to try them sauteed instead of in a salad and it was a huge hit! Makes good use of those dandelions in the yard or you can usually find dandelion greens at the grocery or Asian market.
