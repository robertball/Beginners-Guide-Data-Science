Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
bundle of fresh asparagus
tablespoon butter
1/4 cup red cooking wine

Directions:
trim off the dried end of the asparagus spears and cut spears into 2 inch lengths.
cut bacon into 1 inch squares.
Put butter and wine into a small pan on medium heat.
Add asparagus and bacon.
Cover and cook for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally to allow bacon to come into contact with the pan.
Halfway through the cooking process, drain the liquids from the pan and continue cooking until the asparagus is cooked but still semi firm.
Serve and enjoy.
Asparagus should be watched when cooked to avoid overcooking.  It will lose some of the flavor if allowed to cook to limp.
I created this recipe on a lark..just wanted to do something different than cook it and spread cheese sauce on it.  It was the best asparagus I've ever eaten.  It won't make a non asparagus lover like asparagus, but it will certainly make asparagus lovers enjoy it!
