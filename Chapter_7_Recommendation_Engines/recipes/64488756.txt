Ingredients:
8 Large curly Kale Leaves
1/2 cup good olive oil
2 to 3 anchovy fillets  (I know what you are thinking but I swear you will not tast them and they add a ridiculous amount of depth of flavor)
2 cloves of garlic minced
4 Tbsp Sherry Vinegar
1 tsp fresh lemon zest
3/4 cup grated fresh Parmesan Cheese
1/4 cup pistachios crushed
pinch sea salt
pepper to taste

Directions:
Strip kale leaves from the stalk by holding them by the bottom end of the stalk and pulling your hand up the stalk pushing the leaves off the stalk.  Discard the stems.  Rinse and pat dry.  Either pulse in a food processor  or stack the leaves and sliver them with a knife. Add to serving  bowl.
In a saute pan heat olive oil on high and then turn down to medium.  Add whole anchovy fillets and saute.  Once they start to break up and dissolve add the garlic and cook until garlic is just starting to turn golden then add the Sherry Vinegar and cook 30 seconds more.  Set aside to cool
Once anchovy, oil, vinegar and garlic mixture is cool pour over chopped kale and add remaining ingredients and toss.
