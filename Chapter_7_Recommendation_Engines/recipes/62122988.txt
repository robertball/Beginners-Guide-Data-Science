Ingredients:
Dough
2-1/4 cup flour
2 tsp sugar
1 tsp salt
1 pkg yeast
1 TBS oil
3/4 warm water
Filling #1:
6 TBS ranch dressing
4 tsp mustard
10 slices of ham or turkey - sliced into strips
1 - 2 cups of grated swiss or provolone cheese - sliced into strips
Filling #2:
BBQ sauce (1/2 bottle)
shredded chicken (rotisserie)
1 - 2 cups of grated cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375
Proof the yeast by pouring your warm water and sugar into your food processor along with the yeast.  Allow to rest for 15 minutes and it should begin to bubble and look active.
Add the oil and salt.
Then add the flour a 1/2 cup at a time and pulse until just blended.  Do not over blend or the dough will be tough.
Once mixed you can knead the dough by hand on a lightly floured counter top for about 5 minutes.  Then spray a glass bowl with oil and place the dough in it with a light towel to cover it for about 1/2 hour or until it has risen.  (In a warm place)
Roll out the dough to approximately 9 X 11 and spread on whichever filling you choose.  Do not spread the filling too close to the edge though.
Roll up dough like you would cinnamon rolls and tuck the ends under before placing it on a large baking tray that has been lined with parchment paper.  (The seam should be on the bottom to ensure that it doesn't unroll.)

Description: 
My friend Jana is a great hostess!  She always has friends over for lunch and manages to know just what to serve.  This recipe was graciously given to me after a fabulous lunch at her house and my kids just LOVE it! I will usually double the dough and make both fillings.  So easy and so good!  Thanks Jana!
