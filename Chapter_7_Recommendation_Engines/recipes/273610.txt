Ingredients:
Pastry:
3 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup softened butter, cut into chunks
Cream Filling:
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Fruit:
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained and patted dry
5 large fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced
1 ripe kiwi, peeled and thinly sliced
1/3 cup fresh blueberries
1/3 cup fresh raspberries

Directions:
Mix water and vanilla extract together in a small bowl.
Stir 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl. Cut in butter until mixture forms fine crumbs. Do not overmix, or pastry will be tough. Stir in enough vanilla water to pull dough together. Chill for 15 minutes.
Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Gently transfer to an 11-inch tart pan. Pat dough into place, cutting off edges and aligning pastry along the edges of the pan. Freeze pastry shell until firm, at least 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake pastry shell in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Prick any large bubbles with the tip of a knife. Allow to cool completely.
Meanwhile, make the filling. Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Beat sugar, cream cheese, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl until smooth. Fold in whipped cream.
Spread filling into the cooled tart shell, smoothing out to reach the edges. Arrange mandarin oranges, strawberries, kiwi slices, and berries over the top, covering as much of the filling as possible. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator.
