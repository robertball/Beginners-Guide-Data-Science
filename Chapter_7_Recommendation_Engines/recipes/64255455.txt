Ingredients:
4 Salmon Fillets
1/2 C Toasted very finely chopped pecans
1/2 C Panko (substitute with regular bead crumbs in a pinch)
1/4 C Olive Oil
1 T Finely chopped parsley
1 T Butter
1 Large pinch of salt

Directions:
Melt butter in a medium skillet.  Add pecans, panko, parsley and salt & stir to combine.  Set aside.
Wash the salmon and remove scales from the skin.  Make 3 small cuts across the skin side to prevent the skin from shrinking when it cooks.  Dry salmon thoroughly.
Working with the salmon skin side down, mound the pecan mixture evenly across each piece.  Drizzle olive oil over the pecan mixture on the salmon and press firmly on the mixture so that it has good contact with the salmon.
Heat a splash of olive oil in a large skillet over high heat.  When the oil is hot, add the salmon, pecan crust side down.  Cook for 2 minutes or until the pecan crust has browned.
Flip the salmon over and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes or until it is light pink and flakes easily.  Be careful not to overcook the the salmon or it will become tough and chewy.
