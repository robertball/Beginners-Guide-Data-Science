Ingredients:
1 English muffin
6 slices avocado
3 slices Dietz & Watson Swiss Cheese
4 slices Dietz & Watson Maple Honey Ham
2 eggs
1 tablespoon white vinegar

Directions:
Cut the top off the English muffin, using the muffin as the base for the Croque Madame.
Place three slices of avocado on each muffin base, then place the Dietz & Watson Swiss Cheese on top. Place the Dietz & Watson Maple Honey Ham on top of that.
Prepare a pot for the eggs. Fill a shallow saucepan with three inches of water and bring it to a simmer.
Crack 1 egg into the saucepan and add distilled white vinegar to the water. Turn down the heat until the bubbles disappear. Use a wooden spoon to make the water swirl, keeping egg at the center of the whirlpool. Cook for 3 minutes and remove with a slotted spoon. The yolk should wiggle, but shouldn't be too loose. Repeat with the second egg.
Place eggs over the ham. Poke eggs a little bit to allow the yolk to run down each muffin.
