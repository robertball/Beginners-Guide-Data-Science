Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
1  green bell pepper, seeded and cut into squares
1  red bell pepper, seeded and cut into squares
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup chicken broth
3 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 ½ teaspoons salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
3 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
3 (14.5 ounce) cans Mexican-style stewed tomatoes
1  rotisserie chicken, meat removed and chopped
water, as needed

Directions:
Heat olive oil in Dutch oven or deep skillet over medium-high heat. Saute chopped onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and garlic in hot oil until tender but not yet browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour chicken broth over the vegetable mixture; season with chili powder, cumin, salt, and black pepper. Place a lid on the pot, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes.
Stir black beans, stewed tomatoes, and chicken meat together in a separate pot over medium-low heat; bring to a low simmer. Stir the vegetable-broth mixture into the black bean mixture. Bring again to a simmer and cook, adding water as needed to keep the mixture from becoming too dry, until the flavors blend, at least 30 minutes.
