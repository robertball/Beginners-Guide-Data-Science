Ingredients:
1 lb (4 sticks) butter (softened)
1 cup cornstarch
1 cup sugar
4 cups all purpose flour

Directions:
mix butter, sugar and cornstarch until well combined
Slowly add the flour until a ball forms.  If not using stand mixture you will probably need to use your hands.
Flatten onto a cookie sheet in the shape of a rectangle.
Pierce with fork all over the dough.
Sprinkle with colored sugar (match the holiday if you like)
bake in preheated 325 oven 10-20 minutes until lightly browned
Let cool 2-3 minutes on the tray.
cut with sharp knife into smaller rectangles.  I usually do about 1"x1".
If you are using cutters, roll out the dough on parchment paper to 1/4" thick.
Bake as above.
you can sprinkle with sugar or dip in chocolate when they are cool
