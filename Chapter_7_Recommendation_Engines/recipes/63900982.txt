Ingredients:
1 Perfected pastry pie shell (deep dish)
FILLING:
10 golden delicious apples
1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoons cinnamon
CRUMB TOP:
2/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup flour
14 tablespoons chilled butter or butter flavored shortening

Directions:
Keep pastry shell in fridge to chill.
Peel, core and slice apples 1/4" thick. Place in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle 1/3 cup sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon over the apples and stir to coat.
Mix topping by stirring together sugar & four. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until moist and crumbly.
Put 3/4 of apples into pie pastry until heaping.
Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the butter/flour/sugar mix over the apples. Gently pile the rest of the apples on top and cover with as much as the crumb topping that will stay on top (fill in nooks and crannies)
Cook pie at 400 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes
