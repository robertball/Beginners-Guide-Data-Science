Ingredients:
2 tablespoons melted butter (or canola oil)
2 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
------
4 tablespoons granulated sugar
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 dash salt

Directions:
Whisk sugar, flour, cocoa, and salt together in a 12 oz. mug or large ramekin.
Stir in the water, butter (or oil), and vanilla.
Microwave on full power for 60 to 99 seconds depending on your microwave's wattage (90 seconds is perfect in my 800W). The center should remain a bit uncooked. Let sit for a few minutes and then enjoy!
