Ingredients:
1/2 cup Almond Butter
1/4 cup and 2 tbsp Coconut Flour
1/2 cup Chocolate Chips
Sea Salt

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix almond butter and coconut flour until a thick paste forms.
Scoop a heaping teaspoon of the mixture onto a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and form into a ball using your fingers. Continue until all the mixture is used.
Place the baking sheet into the freezer for 20 minutes.
With 2 minutes left, melt the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in 30 second increments until the chocolate is completely melted.
Using a spoon, dunk the frozen almond butter bites into the melted chocolate, making sure to fully cover every side.
Place the chocolate covered almond butter bite back onto the parchment paper and top with some sea salt.
Repeat steps 5 and 6 until all almond butter bites are coated in chocolate.
Place the bites back into the freezer for 10 minutes.
