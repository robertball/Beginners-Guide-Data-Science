Ingredients:
The Muffin Batter:
-3/4 cup melted butter (1 and 1/2 sticks, 6 ounces)
-1 cup white (granulated) sugar
-2 beaten eggs (just whip them up in a glass with a fork)
-2 teaspoons baking powder
-1/2 teaspoon salt
-1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries (no need to thaw if they're frozen)
-2 cups plus one Tablespoon flour (no need to sift - pack it down in the cup when you measure it)
-1/2 cup whole milk
-1/2 cup apple pie filling (I used Comstock)
The Crumb Topping:
-1/2 cup sugar
-1/3 cup flour
-1/4 cup softened butter (1/2 stick)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Grease bottoms only of a 12-cup muffin pan (or line cups with double cupcake papers.
Melt the butter.
Mix in the sugar.
Add beaten eggs, baking powder, & salt.
Mix thoroughly.
Put one T. of flour in a plastic food storage bag with your cup of blueberries. Shake it gently to coat blueberries and leave them in the bag for now.
Add half of the remaining flour to your bowl & mix with half of the milk.
Add the rest of the flour & milk.
Mix thoroughly.
Put the can of apple pie filling in a bowl & chop up the apples with a sharp knife. (You will want some apple pieces in each muffin so the pieces have to be fairly small.) Measure out 1/2 cup of pie filling & add it to your muffin batter.
Stir thoroughly.
Fold the blueberries into your muffin batter. Mix gently so that the blueberries will stay intact.
Fill the muffin tins 3/4 full and set them aside.
If you have any batter left over, grease bottom of a small tea-bread loaf pan & fill with remaining batter.
To make the Crumb Topping:
Mix sugar & flour in small bowl.
Add softened butter.
Use a fork or knife to "cut" it into the dry ingredients until the resulting mixture is crumbly. (You can also do this in a food processor. Just layer the dry ingredients with chilled butter that you've cut into chunks, then process it in an on-and-off motion with the steel blade until it looks like coarse cornmeal.)
Fill the remaining space in the muffin cups with the crumb topping.
Bake muffins in a 375 F. degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes. (If you had muffin batter left over and put it in a tea bread pan, it should bake about 10 minutes longer than the muffins.)
Cool the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes. (Muffins need to cool in pan for easy removal.)

Description: 
These are wonderful when they're slightly warm, but the apple and blueberry flavors will intensify if you store them in a covered container overnight.
