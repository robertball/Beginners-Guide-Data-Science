Ingredients:
Wednesday, December 11, 2013 12:11 a.m. by  Susan Kennedy
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
6 oz cream cheese, room temperature
2 cups granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup mini dark chocolate chips
2 cups Oreo crumbles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375, line a cookie sheet with parchment. I have found that parchment keeps the cookies from spreading too much, as they tend to do on a greased pan or a silpat.
In the bowl of a stand mixer on medium speed, cream together butter and cream cheese until thoroughly combined.
Add sugar and vanilla, mix well.
Add flour one cup at a time and mix on low just until combined. Stir in chocolate chips with a rubber spatula.
Pour Oreo crumbles into a bowl. Scoop dough out and roll into roughly 1.5" balls, then roll in cookie crumbles, coating thoroughly. Be sure to cover the dough balls really well in crumbs, as this is what holds the cookie together while baking. Space cookies about 1-2" apart on sheet. Bake on center rack about 14-15 minutes and allow to cool on sheet several minutes before removing to wire rack to cool completely
