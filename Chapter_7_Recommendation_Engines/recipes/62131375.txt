Ingredients:
4 to 6 lb. beef roast, chuck, tenderloin, your preference
2 to 4 TBLS Bolner's fiesta chicken fajita seasoning
1 large onion
4 to 5 TBLS apple cider vinegar
Tortillas
lettuce
shredded cheddar cheese
tomatoes
sour cream
taco sauce
anything to put on fajitas

Directions:
Cut beef roast into 3 or 4 chunks. Liberally sprinkle fajita seasoning over the beef. Place upside down in crock pot/slow cooker and liberally sprinkle the other side of the meat. Cut onion from top to bottom so you have strips of onion rather than small chopped pieces. Toss in slow cooker. Sprinkle vinegar over and around beef. Slow cook on high about 8 hours or until meat pulls apart easily with two forks. Serve on tortillas with your favorite fixin's. Have the next day on chips for nachos. I have also used this recipe with a pork roast to make awesome bbq pork sandwiches.  Enjoy!!

Description: 
Bolner's fiesta chicken fajita seasoning is a must for this recipe! My husband brought me some from Dallas years ago and I wondered what to do with it. I make this recipe to rave reviews. Then I ran out of Bolner's and tried a package mix. They were awful. Order some online and you will not regret it!
