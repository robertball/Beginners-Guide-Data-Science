Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2/3 cup barbeque sauce
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2/3 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken pieces - cut into 1/2-inch strips

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir barbeque sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder together with the melted butter. Stir chicken into the sauce mixture to coat.
Place cover on saucepan and simmer until the chicken pieces are cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove cover and spoon sauce over chicken pieces; continue cooking until sauce thickens, about 4 minutes more.

Description: 
This is a great recipe for a quick and easy entree. My wife, who is 8 1/2 months pregnant, had chicken thawing and asked me to cook since she was exhausted. She didn't have any plans so I just threw some things together and came up with this recipe. I'm sure it could be improved upon, but in a pinch it was easy and delicious.
