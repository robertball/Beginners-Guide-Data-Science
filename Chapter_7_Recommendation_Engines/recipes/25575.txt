Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter flavored shortening
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup milk
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 (8 inch) round pans. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and almond extracts.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
