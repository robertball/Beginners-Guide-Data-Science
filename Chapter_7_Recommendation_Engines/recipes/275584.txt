Ingredients:
3 (8 ounce) center-cut salmon fillets, with skin
1 teaspoon garlic-pepper seasoning
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Pat fillets dry with a paper towel and set in a baking dish, skin-side down. Sprinkle with garlic-pepper seasoning and dill. Turn fillets over and generously rub salt all over the skin only. Cover baking dish and set on the counter for 15 to 20 minutes.
Heat oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until it just starts to smoke. Reduce heat to medium-high and add butter. As soon as butter melts, add fillets, skin-side down. Cover the skillet, and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 9 minutes, depending on thickness. Remove fillets with a metal spatula and serve immediately.

Description: 
I am a big fan of salmon skin, especially if it's salted and a bit crispy and chewy. This recipe gives me that. Plus, the way it's cooked, the fish has a 'steamed' quality to it. Do not uncover the fillets or move them around as they cook. I always use my cast-iron skillet for this because it always comes out best!
