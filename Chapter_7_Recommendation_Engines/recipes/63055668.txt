Ingredients:
1 TBL olive oil
8 oz boneless, skinless chicken breast, cubed
1 medium yellow onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 stalks celery, diced
1 large carrot, peeled and diced
1 large parsnip, peeled and diced
3 TBL minced fresh rosemary
1 quart (4 cups) low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup wild rice
2  TBL instant flour (such as Wondra)
2 cups fat-free half and half
salt and ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium-high, heat the olive oil. Add the cubed chicken breast and sear until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. The meat does no need to be cooked through.
Add the onion, garlic, celery, carrot and parsnip, then cook until browned, about another 3-4 minutes. Add the rosemary, chicken broth and wild rice. Bring to a simmer and cover. Cook for 45 minutes or until the rice is tender.
Add the instant flour and cook, stirring constantly for 3 minutes or until thickened. Add the half-and-half and het, but do not boil (the half-and-half will separate). Season with salt and pepper.
