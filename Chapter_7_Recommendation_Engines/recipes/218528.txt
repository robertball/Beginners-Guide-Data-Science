Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package fine egg noodles
2 cups cottage cheese
2 cups sour cream
1/2 cup chopped onions
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1 pinch ground paprika

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until they are cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a large casserole dish.
Mix the noodles, cottage cheese, sour cream, onion, Worcestershire sauce, poppy seeds, and salt together in a large bowl. Spread mixture in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and paprika on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes.

This is a recipe my grandmother and mom would make.  It can be served as a main dish or is great as a side.  This is delicious served with beef stew.
