12 Biscuits: Or make your own biscuits.
3 cups of Heart Smart Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Saute carrots, onions and celery in canola oil until onions are translucent.
Meanwhile, fry hamburger on medium high heat in a large pan. Drain grease.
Move meat to one side. Melt butter in pan.
Whisk in flour a little at a time.
Whisk in milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps.
Stir in beef broth.
Add spices and vegetables.
Bring to a boil. Cover and turn off heat.
Meanwhile:
Add 1 cup of buttermilk to 3 cups of Bisquick Heart Smart mix. Stir ingredients until soft dough forms. Place on waxed paper. Roll 1/2 inch thick. Cut with 2 1/2 inch cutter dipped in Bisquick mix.
Pour meat mixture in a Pyrex glass dish sprayed with cooking spray (Pam,)
Add biscuits.
Bake for 24-25 minutes or until biscuits are browned.
The casserole will be quite hot when taken out of the oven.
