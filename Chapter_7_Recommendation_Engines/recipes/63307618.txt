Ingredients:
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup margarine
½ cup flour
½ teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
½ cup sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
¾ cup chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Prepare a mini-muffin tray with paper liners and set aside.
In a small saucepan on low heat melt the chocolate chips with the margarine, stirring constantly.  (Alternatively, you can microwave the chocolate and margarine in a microwave-safe bowl for 30 second increments, stirring in between, until smooth). Set aside to cool.
Once this mixture is cool (slightly warmer than room temperature is cool enough) add in all other ingredients.  Mix thoroughly until batter is smooth.
Fill muffin tray so each cup is 3/4 full.
Bake for 10 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.
Makes about 30 mini cupcakes. Enjoy!

Description: 
My Great Grandmother used to make these for me. We have a photograph of me helping at about two years old.  Now I make them all the time because these little cupcakes are to die for! Extreme chocolaty taste and really fast to whip up. The perfect gift too! Sometimes I add a little instant coffee powder (about a 1/2 tsp) or a little vanilla, almond, mint or raspberry extract depending on my mood - they always come out excellent and are gone in minutes!  The recipe is not temperamental - microwave or stove-top, comes out the same. Mixer or by hand, both work.  :)
