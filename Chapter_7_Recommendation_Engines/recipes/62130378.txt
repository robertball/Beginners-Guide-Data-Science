Description: 
A friend asked me several years ago to participate in her church's chili cook-off.  I had never made chili before, I'm not even a big fan of chili, but I came up with this concoction, and it won the chili cook-off every year that I entered!  It's best to make this the day before and rewarm it when you're ready to eat, so the flavors really have time to set up and blend.
