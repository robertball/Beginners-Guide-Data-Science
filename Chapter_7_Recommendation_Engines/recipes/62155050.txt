Ingredients:
3 ripe plantains( or as much as you want)
3/4 of a medium size ginger root
1 or 2 medium size pepper
1/4 of a small size onion
1 1/2 cup of vegetable oil
a pinch of salt to taste.

Directions:
Peel off the ripe plantains and the ginger roots. Peel and wash the onion and the ginger roots. Cut the ripe plantain into squares. Place it in a bowl. Wash the peppers. Cut the ginger roots into a reasonable size. Add a little bit of water and blend together the ginger root and the pepper. DO NOT BLEND UNTIL SMOOTH; but blend until its a little bit coarse. The mixture should not be too watery. Add the mixture to the ripe plantains and add a pinch of salt. Make sure that all the plantain is coated with the ginger-pepper mixture. Heat a skillet and add oil. Scoop the coated plantain with a spatula and fry for about 5 minutes or until dark brown on each side. Place the fried plantain in a colander to drain the oil. Continue to fry until all the plantains are fried.
*Add to rice or eat the kelewele pronounced (kay lay way lay) as a dessert by itself. Make sure that the plantain is ripe; usually, its peel is green when its NOT ripe.
