1 bay leaf
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Pour oil into a medium saucepan, and place over medium heat.  Add onion, celery, and carrots; cook and stir for 10 minutes, or until vegetables are tender.
Using a strainer, rinse quinoa under cold water.  Drain well.  Stir into the vegetables; cook and stir for 1 minute.  Add water, bay leaf and lemon rind and juice; bring to boil.  Cover, and reduce heat to medium low.  Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed and quinoa is tender.
Discard bay leaf.  Stir in peas, and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve.
