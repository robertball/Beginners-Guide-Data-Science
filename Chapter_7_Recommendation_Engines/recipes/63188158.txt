Ingredients:
4 chicken breasts
1 Tablespoon allspice
1 Tablespoon dried thyme
1 Tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground sage
3/4 teaspoon nutmeg
3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
Juice of 1 lime
2 green onions, chopped
1 cup chopped white onion
5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed

Directions:
Combine the first 8 ingredients (the seasonings) into a large bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together the vinegar, orange juice, olive oil, soy sauce, and lime juice.
2. Slowly whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until smooth. Mix in green onions, white onions and garlic cloves, then add the chicken breasts into the bowl, turning over to cover completely in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour, and up to overnight.
3. Grill or broil chicken for 4-5 minutes a side, brushing the marinade over while grilling. When no longer pink in the middle, remove to a plate, and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice and serve with your favorite BBQ or hot sauce.
