Ingredients:
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 1/4 cups boiling water
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 pound brown sugar
2 teaspoons salt
3/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease one 9 x 13 inch pan.
Dissolve soda in boiling water. Set aside.
Mix together flour, brown sugar, salt, and vegetable oil to form a crumb-like mixture.  Reserve 1 cup of the crumbs.  Mix the remaining crumbs with the water and soda mixture.  Pour batter into the prepared pan.  Sprinkle the reserved crumbs on top.
Bake for 45 minutes, or until done.

Description: 
A variation on the old Pennsylvania Dutch favorite, Shoo Fly Pie. Not as sweet or gooey as Shoo Fly Pie, this cake is much better the day after you bake it. Works really well as cupcakes.  I made mini cupcakes for Christmas, always a hit.
