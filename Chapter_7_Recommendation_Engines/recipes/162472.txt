Ingredients:
5 pounds Italian sausage links
2 (28 ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (29 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon onion powder
4 large green bell peppers, thickly sliced
3 large onions, thickly sliced
25 (6 inch) Italian-style hoagie buns

Directions:
Cut the sausages apart into individual links if necessary, place the sausage links into a large skillet over medium heat, and brown them on all sides. Set the sausages aside, reserving the pan drippings.
Pour the whole tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, and tomato sauce into a large saucepan with a lid; stir in the grated Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, sugar, and onion powder. Bring the mixture to a boil; add the cooked sausages, pan drippings, green peppers, and onions. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are very tender and the sauce has thickened, about 6 hours. Serve on Italian hoagie buns.
