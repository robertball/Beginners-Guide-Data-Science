Ingredients:
Blinis
1/2 cup 125 mL all purpose flour
1 tsp 5 mL granulated sugar
pinch baking soda
pinch salt
1/4 cup 60 mL milk
1 egg, separated
3 tbsp 45 mL butter, melted
Filling
1 1/4 cups 300 mL Tre StelleÂ® Extra Smooth Ricotta Cheese
1 tbsp 15 mL fresh dill, finely chopped
1 tbsp 15 mL caper berries, finely chopped
1/2 tsp 2 mL coarsely ground black pepper
salt to taste
4 slices smoked salmon, torn into pieces to top blinis
additional dill for garnish if desired

Directions:
Blinis: in a medium bowl combine flour, sugar, baking soda and salt. Add milk and egg yolk and mix until smooth. In another medium bowl whisk egg white until soft peaks form. Gently fold into batter; add 2 tablespoons of melted butter and stir gently until combined. Brush a non-stick skillet with remaining tablespoon of melted butter; turn heat to medium-high. Drop teaspoonfuls of batter into pan making mini-pancakes and cook until bubbles appear on the surface and the undersides are lightly browned, flip and cook until brown.
Filling: in a medium bowl, combine Ricotta Cheese, dill and capers; season with salt and pepper; stir. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Place blinis on a serving platter, top with a spoonful of Ricotta Cheese mixture and top with smoked salmon; garnish with additional dill if desired.
