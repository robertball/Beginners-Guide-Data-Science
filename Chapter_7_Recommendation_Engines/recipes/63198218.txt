Ingredients:
8 oz lean ground beef
1 Tablespoon Four Roses Bourbon
2 teaspoons worchestershire sauce
2 teaspoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons montreal steak seasoning
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
2 slices bacon, cooked and cut in half
2 slices cheddar cheese, or cheese you prefer
2 slices tomato, or as preferred
2 leaves lettuce
2 hamburger buns, lightly toasted if desired.

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
In a medium mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, bourbon, worchestershire sauce, brown sugar, montreal steak seasoning, garlic salt, and ground ginger.  Mix thoroughly to combine.
Divide and shape into two hamburger patties.
Place burger patties on the prepared grill, and cook about 5 minutes on each side, to an internal temperature of 160Â°
While burgers are still hot lay the bacon in a criss cross fashion on top of each burger.  Place cheese on top of the bacon, remove burgers from grill and top hamburger buns with the lettuce, sliced tomato and cooked burgers.

Description: 
In 2011 I attended the Chefs of the Coast cook off where 4 chefs battled it out cooking their own personal recipe using Four Roses Bourbon. I thought that I could absolutely make a burger worthy of the Four Roses name and this is it.  It's a savoury burger that is seasoned to perfection and topped w/ bacon and other assorted toppings.
