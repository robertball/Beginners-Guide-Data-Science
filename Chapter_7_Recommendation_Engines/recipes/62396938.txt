Ingredients:
1 sheet of frozen puff pastry (thawed for 40 minutes)
1 cup of Cool Whip
1 small box of vanilla instant pudding
1 cup of milk
2-3 squares of Baker's white chocolate
fresh fruit for the top such as:
mandarin oranges, blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, etc.

Directions:
Pastry
Thaw puff pastry for 40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Unroll dough on a lightly floured surface.
Gently roll dough a few times with floured rolling pin.
Vertically cut the dough into three columns.  (This will make cutting triangles easy for the individual pastries.)
Cut the sections into triangles that are approximately 3 inches on each side.
Place the triangles into a muffin tin and poke with a fork.  The corners of the triangles will hang over the edge.
Bake at 400 for 8-10 minutes or until edges are brown.
Filling
Place one cup of milk and instant pudding in a bowl and stir until sooth.
Add one cup of cool whip.
Place pudding filling into the middle of the pastry puffs with a pastry bag.  (I had to use a turkey basting needle because I did not have a pastry bag.)  Be creative on how to fill your pastries.  Add more Cool Whip for a thinner filling.
Topping
Melt Baker's chocolate according to directions.  Spread white chocolate onto the top of each pastry and add fresh fruit.
The white chocolate, when it dries, will keep your fruit in place.
