Ingredients:
8 oz. whole pitted dates
3 ounces cream cheese
1/4 cup powder sugar
1 teaspoon grated orange peel
1 capful of orange extract

Directions:
Combine cream cheese, powder sugar, orange extract, and orange peel.
Make a slit in each date.
Using a piping bag and a small attachment, fill each date with mixture.
Be careful not to over fill. Filling to much will take away from the natural sweetness and taste of the dates.
