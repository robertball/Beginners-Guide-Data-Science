2 large yellow onions, chopped
1 1/2 tbsp chopped fresh thyme or 1 1/2 tsp dried
5 1/4 c (42 oz) chicken or vegetable stock or canned low sodium broth
1/3 cup heavy cream or half and half
3 tbsp dry Marsala or dry sherry
Pinch of cayenne epper
Salt and freshly ground pepper
Fresh thyme leaves for garnish, if desired

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375
In baking pan, place squash cut sides down.
Add a small amount of water to the pan and bake until tender, about 50 min.
When finished, let cool, spoon squash out and blend smooth using a mixer or food processor.
In large saucepan, over medium heat, sauté bacon. When done, sauté the onions and thyme until tender. Drain fat and blend these items until smooth with a food processor.
Place squash, bacon, onions in a soup pot and add the chicken broth. Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 20 min to blend the flavors.
