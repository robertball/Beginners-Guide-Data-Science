Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
3 tablespoons light corn syrup
3/4 cup finely chopped pecans
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup brown sugar, packed
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 egg
2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Melt 1/4 cup of butter in a saucepan, and stir in the 1/2 cup brown sugar until dissolved.  Remove from heat.  Add corn syrup and pecans.  Stir to combine and set aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift the flour and baking powder together in a bowl, and set aside.
Cream brown sugar and 3/4 cup butter.  Add egg and vanilla extract and mix on medium speed until the mixture is creamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in the flour mixture until well mixed. Press one tablespoon of dough into the bottom of an ungreased regular cupcake pan cup, and press the dough into a small piecrust shape, with 1/4-inch walls up the sides of the cupcake cup. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Place 1 teaspoon of the prepared pecan filling on center of each dough cup.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cookie shells are lightly browned, 10 to 13 minutes. Watch closely after 10 minutes. Let the cookies cool in the cupcake pans for 5 minutes before removing to wire rack to finish cooling.
