Ingredients:
2  15.25 oz cans tropical fruit salad
1 15 oz can papaya chunks
2 fresh mangoes, peeled, chopped and de-seeded, or 1 15 oz can mango
1 11 oz can mandarin oranges
1/2 to 2 cups plain non-fat natural yogurt, such as Dannon or Mountain High
1 or 2 bananas, sliced (optional)

Directions:
This recipe is best if the canned fruit is drained overnight in the fridge, but works well with no notice also!
Drain canned fruit. Put all ingredients but yogurt into large bowl.
Add yogurt to taste and mix gently - 1/2 C is enough to connect the flavors, 2 C if you desire a little more yogurt 'tang'.
