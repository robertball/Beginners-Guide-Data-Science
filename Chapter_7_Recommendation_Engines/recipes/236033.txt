Ingredients:
1/2 sweet potato, peeled and diced
1 1/2 cups spelt flour
1 cup rolled oats
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 very ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup sunflower seed oil
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup chopped pitted dates

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Place diced sweet potato into a small pan with enough water to cover, bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain sweet potato; set aside to cool.
Whisk together spelt flour, oats, baking soda, and cinnamon in a bowl. Stir together bananas, oil, and sugar in a separate bowl.
Stir banana mixture into spelt mixture just until dry ingredients are moistened; fold in dates and sweet potato. Divide mixture evenly into 12 muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Cool in pan for 10 minutes; remove to cool completely on a wire rack.
