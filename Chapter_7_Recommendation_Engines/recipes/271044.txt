Ingredients:
2 rib-eye steaks, cut 1 1/2- inch thick
4 teaspoons grill seasoning (such as Montreal Steak SeasoningÂ®)
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce

Directions:
Combine steaks, soy sauce, olive oil, and seasoning in a large resealable bag. Marinate meat for at least 2 hours.
Remove steaks from bag and discard the marinade. Pat excess oil off the steaks.
Add about 1 tablespoon water to the bottom of the air fryer pan to prevent it from smoking during the cooking process.
Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Add steaks to air fryer and cook for 7 minutes. Turn steaks and cook for another 7 minutes until steak is medium rare. For a medium steak, increase the total cook time to 16 minutes, flipping steak after 8 minutes.
Remove steaks, keep warm, and let sit for about 4 minutes before serving.
