Ingredients:
2 cups cauliflower, cut into florets
2 small to medium zucchini, peeled and roughly chopped
1 tsp. fresh lemon juice
3-4 tbsp. water

Directions:
Place cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl, cover with water and microwave on high for 8-10 minutes until very tender.
While waiting for the cauliflower to finish steaming, start to pulse the raw peeled zucchini with the lemon juice only (no water at this point).  Drain cooked cauliflower.  Working in batches if necessary, add cauliflower to the pulsed zucchini with two tablespoons of water.  Puree on high until smooth.  Stop occasionally and push contents from the top to the bottom.  If necessary, add the rest of the water to make a smooth puree.
