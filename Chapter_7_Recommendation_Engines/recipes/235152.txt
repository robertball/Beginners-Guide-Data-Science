Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (20 ounce) package chicken thighs
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (8.5 ounce) boxes dry corn muffin mix (such as JiffyÂ®)
1 pinch garlic salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Season chicken thighs on all sides with salt, pepper, and garlic salt.
Pour corn muffin mix into a shallow bowl. Roll chicken thighs in corn muffin mix until well coated. Transfer coated thighs to prepared baking sheet.
Bake chicken thighs in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
My family and I were tired of eating the same old style of baked chicken, either shake-and-baked or just seasoned. So I got this idea and decided to try it. Needless to say, this is how we bake chicken now and the kids love it. A little sweet but always moist.
