Ingredients:
500 grams bucatini
250 grams grated Pecorino Romano
1.5 Tbsp fresh ground black pepper, or more to taste
1 tsp salt for the pasta water

Directions:
Cook the bucatini in salted water.
In a glass bowl, add the grated cheese and mix with a fork making sure the cheese contains no lumps.
Once the bucatini are al dente, with a spaghetti fork or tongs, lift out the pasta and put it directly into the bowl with the cheese. Do not allow the water to drain too much.
Add one ladle of pasta water to the bowl. Stir the bucatini around until a cream has formed. Add more pasta water, little-by-little, until a thick cream has formed. Sprinkle fresh ground pepper over the pasta. Toss and serve immediately.

Description: 
This peasant food comes from Roman sheep herders who had little time and money to spend on eating. They used their sheep's cheese and a bit of the water that cooked the pasta to create a cream, then added black pepper to give it some extra flavor. Cheap, easy, and fast: this was perfect for them and for us even today!
