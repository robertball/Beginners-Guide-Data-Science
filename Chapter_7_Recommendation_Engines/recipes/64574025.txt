Ingredients:
Warm Milk of Choice
Espresso or Matcha Powder
1 tsp Collagen powder
1 dash Cinnamon
Â½  dash Cayenne pepper
Raw Honey to taste

Directions:
I use the Nespresso Milk Steamer and this machine is something I am obsessed with. The milk is a comforting temperature and is never too hot, which is really important for migraine sufferers.
Make your latte the way you like it, caffeine or decaf, tea or coffee, by combining espresso from your espresso machine with your choice of steamed milk.
Sweeten with raw honey to taste and stir in powdered ingredients.
Collagen powder is delicate so do not add it to a latte that is hot enough to burn your mouth. Be sure to stir it thoroughly or it will clump!

Description: 
I created this CC Latte recipe after researching ingredients that I could mix with a cozy cup of warm foamy milk (or nut milk) that would taste good and also help my body fight inflammation, pain, headaches, and boost metabolism for a nice energizing morning.
