Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
2 1/2 cups milk
3 cubes chicken bouillon
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup cold water
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 pound seasoned grilled chicken chunks
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
1/4 cup lemon juice
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Heat butter and olive oil together in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until tender but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add milk, bouillon, oregano, salt, and pepper to onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook sauce for 5 minutes.
Whisk cold water and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth. Mix cornstarch mixture and chicken into sauce; cook until heated through and thickened, about 5 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Turn heat under saucepan with sauce to low; add lemon juice, parsley, and lemon zest and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add pasta, toss to coat, and transfer to a serving bowl; top with Parmesan cheese.
