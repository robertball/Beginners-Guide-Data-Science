Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 cup chopped hazelnuts
1 teaspoon brandy

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder, spices and salt.
In a large bowl, beat the sugar and eggs until thick and light-colored.  Beat in the lemon juice.  Beat in the lemon zest.  Gradually blend in the dry ingredients.  Stir in the hazelnuts.  Cover and chill for 4 hours.
On a floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/2 inch.  Using a 1 1/2 inch round cookie cutter, cut out cookies and place 1 inch apart on lightly greased baking sheets.   Cover the baking sheets with clean towels and leave undisturbed for 4 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Turn the cookies over and place a drop of brandy in the center of each cookie.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly colored.  Transfer to wire racks  to cool.
