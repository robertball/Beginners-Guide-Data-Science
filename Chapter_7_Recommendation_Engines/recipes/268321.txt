Ingredients:
3 pounds beef short ribs
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
10 cloves garlic, smashed, or more to taste
1 (1 inch) piece ginger - peeled, cut into 1/4-inch slices, and smashed
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
1 cup hoisin sauce

Directions:
Place ribs on a work surface and season generously with salt and pepper.
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over high heat. Brown ribs in the hot oil on all sides, in batches if necessary, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer ribs to a plate; pour off and discard all but a couple tablespoons of the rendered fat. Return Dutch oven to medium heat; cook garlic and ginger about 3 minutes. Return ribs to the Dutch oven; add beer and rice wine vinegar. Stir, cover, and reduced heat to low; simmer 2 1/2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Pour hoisin sauce over the ribs in the Dutch oven.
Bake ribs uncovered in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
Transfer ribs to a serving plate; remove and discard ginger from the sauce. Strain and discard fat from the surface of the sauce before serving with the ribs.

Description: 
The absolute best beef short ribs I've ever had. We used boneless, just because that was available and inexpensive, but bone-in would work too, and possibly be even better. Sounds like an odd combination - it is not. It just works. And most of the time required is totally inactive, so it is easy to make. Enjoy!
