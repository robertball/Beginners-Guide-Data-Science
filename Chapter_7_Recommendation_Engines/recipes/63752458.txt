Ingredients:
12 oz. pasta, cooked according to package directions, drained and rinsed
2 cups cut up tomatoes, or halved cherry tomatoes
2 cups broccoli florets, cut into 1 inch pieces
2 cups zucchini, quartered and sliced
2 cups yellow crookneck squash, cut into 1" pieces
2 bunches green onions, including tops, sliced
1 can sliced black olives
1 cup marinated artichoke hearts
1/2 cup salami or pepperoni slices, cut into 1/4 inch strips (optional)
2 or 3 packages Good Seasons Italian dressing mix, prepared according to package directions with red vinegar and salad oil
1/2 cup grated parmesan/Romano cheese blend
1 cup mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2 inch pieces

Directions:
Place broccoli, zucchini and yellow squash in a microwave safe bowl with a tablespoon of water; cover with vented plastic wrap. Cook on high for a minute or two - just until color turns bright but texture is still crisp. Drain and cool while preparing other ingredients.
Prepare salad dressing and allow to sit.
Remove tough leaves from artichoke hearts, and cut into smaller pieces if necessary.
Combine all ingredients except mozzarella in large bowl and stir.
Cover and refrigerate at least 12 hours.
Before serving add mozzarella and more dressing if necessary.

Twenty years ago I got this great basic pasta salad recipe, and over the years have added more and more ingredients.  This is a family favorite.
