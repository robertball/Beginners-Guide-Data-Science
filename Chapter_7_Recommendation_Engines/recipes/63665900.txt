Ingredients:
3 cup cooked white rice
1-1/2 pound ground beef
seasonings for beef (1-2 tsp. granulated garlic, 2-3 tbsp. dried diced onion, 1 green pepper, 1 1/2 tsp.  Tony Tchachere's Cajun seasoning spice)
3 (10.75 ounce) cans  condensed tomato soup
3 tablespoons chili powder
1 1/2 tsp. ground cumin
8 slices processed cheese food (such as VelveetaÂ®)and a combination 1-2 c. shredded cheeses (fiesta blend or monteray/Colby jack mix)

Directions:
Precook rice by method of choice (we use a rice cooker).
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9 1/2 x 13 baking dish.
While the rice is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Season and cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in the condensed tomato soup and chili powder and ground cumin (we add a bit of Worcestershire as well) and 1/2-1 can of water; cook until heated through.
Spread 1/3 of the rice into the bottom of the prepared baking dish and cover with 1/3 of the ground beef mixture. Place 2 slices of processed cheese over the meat, then cover with 2 more layers of rice and meat. Arrange the remaining 6 slices of cheese over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole has heated through and the cheese is bubbly and browned, about 40 minutes.
