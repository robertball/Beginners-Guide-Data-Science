Ingredients:
Crust:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup unsalted butter
Filling:
4 eggs
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 cups diced rhubarb
2 cups sliced strawberries
1 cup blueberries
Crumb Topping:
1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish.
Mix 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl. Cut 1 cup unsalted butter into the flour mixture until crumbs form; press into bottom of prepared baking dish.
Bake crust in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Blend eggs, white sugar, 1/2 cup flour, and salt in a blender until smooth; pour into a large bowl. Fold rhubarb, strawberries, and blueberries into the blended egg mixture. Spread the fruit mixture onto the baked crust.
Mix 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, oats, melted butter, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl; sprinkle over the fruit mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned on top and the filling has set, 45 to 50 minutes.
