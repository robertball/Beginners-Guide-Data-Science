Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package double crust ready-to-use pie crust
1 cup white sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 cup butter, melted
8 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced
2 tablespoons rum
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch pie dish with butter.
Press one pie crust into the prepared pie dish.
Mix sugar, flour, cornstarch, cinnamon, cardamom, and allspice together in a bowl. Slowly stir butter into the sugar mixture until fully incorporated.
Toss peaches and rum together in a separate bowl; add sugar mixture to peaches. Gently toss to coat peaches. Pour peach mixture into pie crust. Top with remaining pie crust; seal the two crust edges together. Cut 4 to 5 slits in the top crust for ventilation. Brush with milk.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); bake until top is golden brown, about 30 more minutes. Turn off the oven and let the pie rest in the oven as it cools, at least 1 hour.
