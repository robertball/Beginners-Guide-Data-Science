Ingredients:
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried rosemary
salt and pepper to taste
2 pounds boneless pork loin roast
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup white wine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Crush garlic with rosemary, salt and pepper, making a paste. Pierce meat with a sharp knife in several places and press the garlic paste into the openings. Rub the meat with the remaining garlic mixture and olive oil.
Place pork loin into oven for 2 hours, turning and basting with pan liquids. After 2 hours remove roast to a platter. Heat the wine in the pan and stir to loosen browned bits of food on the bottom.  Serve with pan juices.
