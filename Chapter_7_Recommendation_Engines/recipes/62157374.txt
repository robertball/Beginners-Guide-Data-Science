Ingredients:
4 large Granny Smith apples
4 tablespoons non-salted butter, softened
3 large eggs
1 cup sugar
2 cups of white flour
1 cup of milk
butter or shortening for greasing the pan

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Farenheit
Quarter the unpeeled apples, take out the core
Slice into 1/4 inch slices, spread them in greased 9x13 pan
For the next step I use a hand held electric mixer
In a large bowl mix sugar and butter, until thoroughly mixed
Add the eggs to the sugar/ butter and mix until creamy
Place the flour into the bowl and mix it in.
After all the flour is mixed in, pour the milk and mix well.
Pour the batter over the apples and mix it all together!
Bake at 400 degrees for 40-50 min until the top is golden brown.
Cool and enjoy!!!
