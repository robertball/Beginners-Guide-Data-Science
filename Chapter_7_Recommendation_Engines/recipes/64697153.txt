Ingredients:
3 cups bread or all purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
3/4 teaspoons yeast
1 1/2 cups lukewarm water

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl.  Add water. Stir until flour mixture is well incorporated. Dough should look wet and shaggy. Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until doubled on the kitchen counter. This process could take 6-8 hours depending on the temperature of your kitchen. Measure out a piece of parchment paper that will fit inside your dutch oven from wall to wall. You will use this to transport the dough to and from the dutch oven.
Once the dough has doubled, flour it generously and place it on a floured piece of the parchment paper. Using the sides of the parchment, lift the dough onto another bowl to rise for an additional hour, covered with a tea towel or plastic wrap.
After that hour, place the dutch oven and its lid (careful that the lid components are safe in high heat) in the oven. Heat the oven to 425F for 30 minutes.  Move the parchment and dough to the dutch oven, cover and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid, and brown for an additional 15 minutes.  After it has finished cooking, transport the parchment and bread on to a cooling rack and rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing.
