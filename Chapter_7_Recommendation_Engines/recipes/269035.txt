Description: 
Very quick and easy pretzel bites with two dipping sauces. This came together kind of by accident when the kids wanted a snack after school. We have made homemade pretzels before and I have to admit that was a little time consuming. The trick with this shortcut is the baking soda water bath. I love Nutella®. Enjoy!
