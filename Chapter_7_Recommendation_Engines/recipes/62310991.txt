Ingredients:
1 lb pizza dough or bread dough thawed and let to rise according to directions on package
leftover meat (potroast, baked chicken shredded)
cheese of choice (cheddar, swiss etc.)
condiments of choice: banana peppers, horseradish, sliced onions.

Directions:
Take risen bread dough.  Roll out on floured surface into 12" long 8" wide rectangles.  Take leftover ingrediants and put in center.  You can mix and match according to your tastes.  I like to use potroast with some horseradish and chedder cheese.  Roll into long loafs and seal edges.  Place on cookie sheet.  Brush with egg wash.  Place in preheated 350 degree oven and cook for 30-40 mins or until golden brown.  Slice and serve.  These freeze well after being cooked too. It's a great way to use your leftover meat.  Ham and cheese, chicken and swiss, potroast with cheddar and horeradish  etc.
