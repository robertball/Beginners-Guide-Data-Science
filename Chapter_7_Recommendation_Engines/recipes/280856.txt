Description: 
This is a very simple treat that can be used with your favorite fruit juices to make many different variations. My favorite variation has banana in it. It brings a bit of creaminess to the icy treat. 
The small bottles of prepackaged juice in the produce section are the perfect amount of juice for this recipe--just pick a flavor! Don't let the mixture freeze completely before you scrape. The secret is to scrape as it freezes.
