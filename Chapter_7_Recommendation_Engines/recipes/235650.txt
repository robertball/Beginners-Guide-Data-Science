Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons minced onions
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Spanish paprika (hot or mild)
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 cup Campbell's® Condensed Chicken Broth
2 tablespoons sliced pimiento-stuffed olives
1 cup shredded cooked chicken
Salt and ground black pepper
1 (17.3 ounce) package Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry Sheets, thawed

Directions:
Heat the butter in an 8-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the parsley, garlic and paprika. Sprinkle in the flour and stir well. Whisk in the broth. Reduce the heat to low. Cook and stir for 1 minute or until the mixture is thickened.
Stir in the chicken and olives and cook for 3 minutes or until the chicken is hot. Remove the skillet from the  heat. Let cool for 10 minutes. Season with the salt and ground black pepper.
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease or line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cut each pastry sheet into 9 squares, making 18 in all. Roll out on a lightly floured surface or pick up and stretch each square to 4x4-inches in size.
Place about 1 tablespoon chicken mixture in the center of each square. Fold the pastry over the filling to make a triangle and pinch the edges together to seal. Place the empanadas onto the baking sheet. Crimp the edges of the empanadas with a fork.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the empanadas are golden brown.
