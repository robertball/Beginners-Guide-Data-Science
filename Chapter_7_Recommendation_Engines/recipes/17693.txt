Ingredients:
¼ cup olive oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 cups roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
1 cup diced orange wedges
¼ cup chopped fresh rosemary
¼ cup chopped fresh thyme
⅛ teaspoon salt
1 cup ground almonds
¼ cup all-purpose flour
⅛ teaspoon ground cumin
⅛ teaspoon curry powder
⅛ teaspoon ground turmeric
⅛ teaspoon salt
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
¼ cup olive oil
¼ cup clarified butter

Directions:
To Make Sauce: Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute garlic for 2 minutes, then add the tomato, orange, rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper and stir together. Cover and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes; remove cover and let sauce reduce for an additional 15 minutes. Set aside and keep warm.
To Make Crusted Chicken: In a shallow dish or bowl,  mix together the almonds, flour, cumin, curry powder, turmeric, 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Coat breasts in flour mixture and fry in a large skillet with 1/4 cup oil and clarified butter for about 5 to 7 minutes each side, or until golden brown and cooked through (juices run clear).
When ready to serve, place chicken on a platter and top with warm sauce; do this right before serving, to retain crispiness of the chicken.
