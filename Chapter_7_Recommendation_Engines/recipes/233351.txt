Ingredients:
12 eggs
3 cups mayonnaise
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/3 cup chopped fresh chives
3 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as South ShoreÂ®)
2 tablespoons dry mustard
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
12 pounds crabmeat, flaked
3 cups crushed buttery round crackers, or as needed
1/4 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Beat eggs, mayonnaise, parsley, chives, seafood seasoning, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until smooth. Gently stir crabmeat into the egg mixture. Fold crushed crackers into the crab mixture in small amounts just until the mixture holds together. Divide the mixture into 3-ounce patties.
Heat a small amount of oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in hot oil until browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.
