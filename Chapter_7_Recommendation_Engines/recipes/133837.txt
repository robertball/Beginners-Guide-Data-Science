Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, crushed
6 potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
1 pound cabbage, thinly sliced
2 quarts water
8 ounces Portuguese chourico sausage, casing removed, sliced 1/4-inch thick
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
2 teaspoons salt
pepper to taste
olive oil

Directions:
Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic; cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 3 minutes. Add sliced potatoes and half of the cabbage, cook until the cabbage wilts, about 3 minutes.
Pour in water, then bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, then cover, and simmer until the potatoes have softened, about 15 minutes.
Carefully puree the soup in batches until smooth, then return to the stove over medium heat. Add sausage and remaining  cabbage; season with paprika, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then cover, and cook for 5 minutes until the cabbage has softened.
To serve, ladle into large flat soup plates and drizzle with generous amount of olive oil.
