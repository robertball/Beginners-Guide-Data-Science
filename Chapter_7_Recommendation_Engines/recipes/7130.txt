Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups soy milk
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons liquid lecithin
1 cup oat flour
3/4 cup brown rice flour
1/4 cup soy flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon arrowroot powder
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup rolled oats

Directions:
Sift together oat flour, rice flour, soy flour, baking powder, arrowroot powder, sea salt, and cinnamon.  Stir in rolled oats.
In a large bowl, mix together soy milk, honey, oil, and lecithin.  Stir in the flour mixture, and mix well.  The batter will be stiff.  Scoop batter into a lightly oiled 9 x 5 inch loaf pan, and smooth into place.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 75 minutes, or until the loaf is firm and lightly browned.  A toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean.  If loaf gets too dark before it is done, tent with aluminum foil for the remainder of the baking time. Cool completely before removing from pan and slicing.
