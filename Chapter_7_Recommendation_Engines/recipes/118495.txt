Ingredients:
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons chopped onion
1/2 cup egg substitute
2 tablespoons chopped fresh tomato
2 (10 inch) flour tortillas
4 thin slices lean ham
1/4 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
3 tablespoons salsa

Directions:
In a small nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray, saute mushrooms and onion until tender. Add egg substitute and tomato; cook and gently stir over medium heat until egg mixture is completely set.
Place one tortilla in a large ungreased nonstick skillet; top with ham, egg mixture, cheeses and remaining tortilla. Cook over medium heat, carefully turning once, until lightly browned on both sides and cheese begins to melt. Cut into four wedges. Serve with salsa.

Description: 
'I came up with these crispy quesadillas because my family found breakfast burritos too messy,' says Terri Capps of Witchita, Kansas. 'They're fast to fix, fun to eat, filling and healthy...and you can add or subtract ingredients to fit individual tastes.'
