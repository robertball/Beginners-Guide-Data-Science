Ingredients:
4 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, tenders removed
1/4 cup olive oil
1 red bell pepper, thinly julienned
1 carrot peeled, thinly julienned
1 stalk celery, thinly julienned
2 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced
1 cup Italian canned plum tomatoes, cut into strips (I use 2 cups because I like them)
salt & pepper
Cooked rice

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.  Add the chicken & saute for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove chicken, reserve.
Add the bell pepper, carrot, celery, and garlic to the skillet and saute, stirring continuously for about 7 to 8 minutes or until vegetables begin to get tender.
Add the tomatoes, return chicken on top. Cover and cook over low heat for about 10 to 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.
Remove the chicken and set over the cooked rice. Add salt and pepper to taste to the pan sauce and veggies and spoon over top.

Description: 
This recipe used to be on this website a long time ago, but I can't find it on here anymore and unfortunately I don't remember who posted it. I just made this last night & thought it should be reposted because it's easy, healthy, and yummy. Hubby said that I should add some white wine, but I'm not sure when it should be added.
