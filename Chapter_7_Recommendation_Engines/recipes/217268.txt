Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup toffee baking bits
1 pound chocolate confectioners' coating

Directions:
Beat the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the vanilla extract. Add flour, alternately with sweetened condensed milk, beating well after each addition.  Fold in the chocolate chips and toffee bits; mixing just enough to evenly combine.
Using a small cookie scoop, make 1-inch balls and place them on waxed paper lined baking sheets. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.
Melt the chocolate coating in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).  Do not overheat or coating will scorch.  Dip the dough balls in the chocolate coating, allowing any excess to drip off. Place on waxed-paper lined baking sheets and sprinkle the truffles with additional toffee pieces. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
I made some changes to a recipe that we found in our Taste of Home subscription that was somewhat bland.  It has become a favorite.  I am asked to make these truffles for EVERY occasion - even for other family members to take to work or other celebrations!
