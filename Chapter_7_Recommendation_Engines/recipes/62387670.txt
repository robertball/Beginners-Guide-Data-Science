Ingredients:
2 boxed yellow cake mixes
1 can coconut milk
3 c toasted coconut - divided
2 small pkg (4 serving size) instant vanilla pudding

~1 1/2 pint strawberries, sliced
16 oz frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Prepare 2 9x13 pans as directed on cake mix boxes. Mix cake mixes as directed, replacing water with coconut milk (adding water to make up any difference in measurement), and adding 1 c toasted coconut. Bake as directed on box. Let cool. Mix instant vanilla puddings with 2 1/4 c milk and 1 c toasted coconut. Refrigerate pudding mixture until ready to assemble cake.
To assemble: Remove 1 cake from pan, place upside down on "cake plate." Top cake with sliced strawberries. Spread vanilla pudding mixture over strawberries. Remove 2nd cake from pan and place on top of the pudding mixture, right side up. Frost with whipped topping. Top with 1 c toasted coconut.

Description: 
I was asked to bring a combination of a coconut cake and a yellow cake filled with strawberries, vanilla pudding, frosted with whipped topping. I came to AR for help, and this is the result. I put it out at work and it was nearly gone in just an hour - thank you to everyone on the RE who contributed ideas!
