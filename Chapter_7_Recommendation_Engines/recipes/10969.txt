Ingredients:
35 soda crackers
1 cup butter
1 cup packed light brown sugar
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup milk chocolate chips
1 cup blanched slivered almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).  Cover a sided cookie sheet with aluminum foil and line crackers on foil.
Combine butter and brown sugar in a saucepan.  Stirring constantly, bring to a boil and boil for 3 minutes.  Pour over crackers completely.
Bake for 5-6 minutes, watch carefully.  Remove cookie sheet from oven, place it on oven door and sprinkle chips over baked crackers.  When chocolate gets soft, spread over crackers with back of a spoon.  Sprinkle slivered almonds on melted chocolate.  Place in refrigerator for at least 8 hours.  Break into cookie-size pieces.  This recipe freezes well.

Description: 
I call these popularity cookies because when I make them and take them to work, they make me popular!  You can make these with club crackers, too.
