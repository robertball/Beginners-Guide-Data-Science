Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2) pound broiler-fryer chicken, cut into pieces
½ cup all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
3 cups peanut oil
½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
3 tablespoons honey
⅓ cup water
⅓ cup lemon juice
2 teaspoons cornstarch
4 teaspoons chili sauce
2 teaspoons soy sauce
crushed red pepper flakes to taste
6  green onions, cut into 2-inch slices

Directions:
Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl; add chicken and toss to coat.
Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; add the chicken a few pieces at a time; fry until golden and no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
Discard all but 2 tablespoons oil from the skillet and return to heat. Cook the ginger in the oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in the honey and cook another 1 minute. Whisk together the water, lemon juice, cornstarch, chili sauce, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl; mix into the honey and ginger; bring to a boil. Add the chicken to the sauce and stir to coat; cook until the chicken is heated through, about 3 minutes. Fold the green onions into the mixture and cook 1 minute more. Serve hot.
