Ingredients:
I ring of polish or beef kielbasa cut into pieces. 1 big jar or 2 cans drained sauerkraut. 1 medium apple sliced and cut into chunks. 1/2 large onion chopped coarsely. 4 big potatoes cut into inch or so chunks. fresh ground pepper, butter and brown sugar.

Directions:
Peel the potatoes, and coarsely chop the onion. put half of the sauerkraut in the bottom of a small roaster (Pam it first), then add the potatoes and half of the onion and all of the apple. lay down the potato/apple/and half the onion. Grind some black pepper onto that. Cut the sausage into about 8 pieces (I like beef kielbasa), and lay it down on top of that. put another layer of kraut and the remainder of the onions. Dot with butter, sprinkle a couple of tbs of brown sugar on it, grind more pepper on top, and cover with the lid.
Bakd in a 400 degree oven.
