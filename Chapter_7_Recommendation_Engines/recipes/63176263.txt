Ingredients:
•	210grams dried elbow macaroni
•	76grams cup grated Cheddar
•	76grams cup grated Emmenthal
•	76grams cup grated mozzarella
•	163grams cup plain yogurt or sour cream
•	4 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces
•	3 eggs
•	1/2 teaspoon salt
•	1/2 teaspoon pepper
•	244ml milk
•	Nonstick spray
•	1/3 cup bacon
•       onion (desired amount)
•       1 clove garlic
•       additional cheese to top

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large pot, bring water to boil. Season water with salt and cook macaroni until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain pasta and place in a large bowl and while pasta is still hot add all the cheese.
Melt the butter leaving a little bit to fry the garlic and the onion in. In a medium bowl add the melted butter, the yogurt/sour cream, the eggs,salt, pepper, bacon and milk, mix and add to the macaroni mixture. Spray a casserole dish with nonstick and pour macaroni mixture into the dish. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes or until golden brown. Top with additional cheese (my suggestion is mozzarella because it comes cheesier)

Description: 
I got hold on a really old and boring macaroni and cheese recipe and decided to make it more of a cheesy treat than a plain boring meal. Every bite is like a cheesy explosion in your mouth that will make you crave for more. It will get your guests begging for seconds :D
