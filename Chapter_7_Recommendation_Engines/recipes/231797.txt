Ingredients:
2 pounds catfish fillets
2 tablespoons seasoned salt (such as Season-AllÂ®)
1 orange, juiced
1 lemon, juiced
1/2 cup Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 dashes hot sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season catfish fillets with seasoned salt. Mix orange juice, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce in a bowl.
Heat olive oil in large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat; fry catfish in hot oil until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Spread mustard sauce on both sides of each fillet; drizzle remaining sauce over fish. Arrange bell pepper, onion, and garlic over fish.
Bake in preheated oven until fish is easily flaked with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
