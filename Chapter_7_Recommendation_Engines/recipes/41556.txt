NA
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
¾ cup milk
2 tablespoons seedless raisins
¼ cup chopped hazelnuts
2 tablespoons coarse-grained mustard
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1 dash hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco(<sup>&trade;</sup>)), or to taste
salt and black pepper to taste
½ teaspoon paprika
1 pound boneless deep sea perch fillets
2  bananas, peeled and sliced

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Gradually stir in flour, and cook until slightly brown. Gradually stir in the milk, raisins, and hazelnuts, stirring constantly. Continue stirring, and add the mustard, lemon juice, and hot pepper sauce. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season the fish fillets with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides. Place the fillets in a single layer in an oven-proof  baking dish. Arrange banana slices over the fish, then pour the mustard sauce over all.
Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.

Description: 
When you read this recipe, this combination might sound really weird, but if you like mustard and bananas, it's really worth a try.  I've served it a number of times and everybody is quite surprised about it.  I use deep sea perch fillet or sometimes cod fillet, but any other fish with this kind of texture is alright to use (don't use an oily fish like salmon or trout).  For mustard, try not to use sweet mustard, because the bananas are sweet already and the dish might end up too sweet.  Serves well with rice.
