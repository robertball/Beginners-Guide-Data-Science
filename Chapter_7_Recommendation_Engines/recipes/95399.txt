Ingredients:
8 ounces dry spaghetti
1/2 small onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped pimientos
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 cups leftover roast turkey, pulled into bite-sized pieces
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease a  9x13 inch baking dish.
Break spaghetti into 2-inch pieces.  Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the spaghetti uncovered, stirring occasionally, until it has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Combine onion, pimiento, and green pepper with cooked spaghetti, 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, turkey meat, mushroom soup, chicken broth, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.  Mix lightly and spread the mixture in the baking dish and top with 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese.
Bake, uncovered, in oven for 45 minutes until the casserole is bubbling and cheese topping is melted and browned.

Description: 
A yummy casserole that uses leftover turkey. It was a post-Thanksgiving tradition in our home when I was a child. I'm not sure where Mom got it, but it's real comfort food!
