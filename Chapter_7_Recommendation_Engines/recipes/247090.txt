Ingredients:
2 eggs
2 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 packet stevia
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Combine eggs, cream cheese, stevia, and cinnamon in a blender; blend until smooth. Let batter sit until bubbles settle, about 2 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Pour 1/4 of the batter onto the skillet; cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is golden brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.
