Description: 
It's a marinade that my family loves so much, the last time I made it, they requested the chicken two days in a row...it's that good. The marinade isn't too hot, with a tangy delicious taste.  

The recipe didn't have a name, so I decided to call it, Kickin' Chicken Marinade.  It's so simple to throw together, with only FOUR fabulous ingredients. If you like Buffalo style wings, chicken and dip...you will love this recipe!
