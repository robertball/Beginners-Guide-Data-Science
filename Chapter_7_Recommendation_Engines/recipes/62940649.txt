Ingredients:
4 thinly cut boneless skinless chicken breasts (aprox 6 oz each)
1 cup italian dressing
1 tablespoon montreal chicken seasonings
1 tablespoon italian seasoning
2 tablespoons canola oil
4 1/2-inch slices of fresh mozzarella
4 1/2-inch tomato slices
4 large fresh basil leaves
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar or balsamic glaze

Directions:
1) Put the first 3 ingredients into a zip lock bag and marinate in fridge for 4-6 hours.
2)When ready to cook, preheat oven to 500 degrees and heat up cast iron skillet on stove top with the canola oil. Once oil is popping hot, add chicken breasts. Let sizzle for 2 minutes. Flip chicken and then place skillet in the oven.
3)Bake at 500 degrees for about 12 minutes (or until chicken is just done))
4)Take skillet out of oven. Top each chicken breast with a slice of mozzarella and a tomato slice. Place back in oven for 3-5 minutes.
5)Transfer chicken breasts to platter. Top each with a basil leaf and drizzle balsamic over the top of each. Yield: serves 4

I love caprese salad and I'm always trying to find new ways to make chicken dishes and eat a bit healthier. Plus the basil in my garden is growing out of control!!
