Ingredients:
1 TB yeast 1TB
3 TB sugar
1/4 cup warm water
2 cups, 1 pint, sour cream, at room temperature
1 TB salt (a little less)
1/4 tsp baking soda
4 1/2 to 5 cups all purpose flour

Directions:
Combine the yeast, sugar and water and let it sit for 5 minutes. Put the sour cream, salt and baking soda in the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the yeast mixture and thoroughly combine with the paddle attachment. Switch to a dough hook and add the flour. Knead with the electric mixer for about 3-5 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl with 1 TB of oil. Turn the dough to coat with the oil and cover it with a kitchen towel. Let it rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-2 hours.
Divide the dough in half and shape into two rounds. Place onto a greased baking sheet (I use foil with baking spray). Let it rise for 1-2 more hours and then bake at 375F for 30-35 minutes.
Let it cool for 10-15 minutes before eating.
