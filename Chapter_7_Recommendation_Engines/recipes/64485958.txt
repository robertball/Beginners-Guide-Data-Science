Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
6 cups all-purpose flour
1 egg
1/4 cup butter, melted and cooled

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the sugar, salt and 2 cups flour. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add egg and butter; mix well. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (do not knead). Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into 24 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubles, about 2 hours. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
