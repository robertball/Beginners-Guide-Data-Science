Ingredients:
8 oz. mini pretzels
2 sticks of butter
1 cup of light brown sugar
2 cups of milk or semi-sweet chocolate chips (I like it with milk chocolate chips)
Sea salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Line 11x17 cookie sheet with tin foil or parchment paper.
Place pretzels in pan and distribute evenly.
In a medium saucepan, melt the butter and the brown sugar, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is thick - about 5-8 minutes. Don't over cook or caramel will not set up.
Pour over pretzels bake in oven for 5 minutes.
Remove from oven and sprinkle chocolate chips over the top and bake for 1 minute.
Spread chocolate over pretzels and sprinkle lightly with sea salt.
Cool for 2-3 hours and then break into pieces.
