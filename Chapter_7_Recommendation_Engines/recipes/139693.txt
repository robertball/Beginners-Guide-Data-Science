Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chopped pitted dates
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 cups boiling water
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Place the dates, sugar, salt, and butter into a bowl, and pour in the boiling water. Stir together and set aside to cool. Once cool, mix in the egg.
Stir the flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar together in a bowl. Pour the raisin mixture over the flour mixture, and stir together until thoroughly combined. Mix in the vanilla extract and, if desired, walnuts. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in preheated oven until knife inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool in pan 10 minutes before turning out onto a rack to cool completely. Wrap in aluminum foil and store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
This is my mother's recipe, a bread she always made at Thanksgiving and Christmas to be used for tea sandwiches with a cream cheese filling. But it may also be eaten on its own like a cake. Because it is so delicious yet simple to put together, it makes a great food gift or potluck contribution. Substitute raisins for dates, if you wish.
