Ingredients:
2 large eggs
3/4 cup sugar
3 cups milk
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 stick butter, melted
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup pecans
1/2 baguette stale French bread, cubed

Directions:
1. To make the pudding, combine eggs, sugar, milk, cream, butter and vanilla, and pecans in a bowl. Whisk well to blend.
2. Place the bread cubes in a large bowl and pour the egg mixture on top. Let stand, turning the bread as necessary, until the bread is soft and saturated with the mixture, about 30 minutes.
3. Pour the bread and custard mixture in a lightly greased 8-inch square or round baking dish (at this point the dish can be held, in the fridge, for up to a day).
4. Preheat oven to 350.
5. Bake the custard in a preaheated oven until the custard is set and the top is lightly browned, about 45 minutes to an hour.
