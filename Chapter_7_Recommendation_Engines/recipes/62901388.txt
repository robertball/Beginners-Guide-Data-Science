Ingredients:
12 oz uncooked ziti
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 lb, lean ground beef, raw
1 teaspoon oregano, dried
1 teaspoon thyme, dried
1 teaspoon rosemary, dried
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
28 oz canned crushed tomatoes
1 cup part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350.
2. Cook pasta according to package directions, drain and set aside.
3. Meanwhile, heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat; add garlic and saute 2 minutes.  Add beef and cook until browned, breaking up meat with a spoon as it cooks, about 3-5 minutes; drain off any fat and set pan back over medium heat.
4. Add oregano, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper; stir to coat beef.  Cook until herbs become fragrant, about 2 minutes.  Add tomatoes and bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes.
5.  Spoon a small amount of beef-tomato mixture into bottom of a 4-quart casserole dish (just enough to cover surface); top with half of cooked ziti.  Next, layer with half of remaining beef-tomato sauce and half of mozzarella cheese.  Layer with remaining ziti and then top with remaining beef-tomato sauce; sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese.  Bake until cheese is golden and bubbly, about 30 minutes.  Slice into 8 pieces and serve.  Yields 1 piece per serving.
