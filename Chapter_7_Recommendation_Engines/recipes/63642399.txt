Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1 cup flour
2 tsp baking powder
a dash of salt
3/4 cup milk
1 stick of melted butter
brown sugar
cinnamon
1 can diced peaches

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Put 1 tsp of melted butter into each regular size muffin tin.
Combine the first 5 ingredients by hand… sugar, flour, baking powder, salt and milk.
Put 2 tbsp of batter into each regular size muffin tin… on top of the melted butter.
Then put 1 tbsp diced peaches on top of the batter.
Sprinkle with brown sugar and then cinnamon. I do a pretty generous “sprinkle”.
Bake the regular size muffin tins for 12 minutes.
Let them cool almost completely before taking out of pan.
Don't forget a dollop of vanilla ice cream...YUM!
