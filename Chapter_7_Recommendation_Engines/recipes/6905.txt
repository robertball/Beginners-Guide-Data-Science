Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, chilled
1 apple - peeled, cored and shredded
1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Measure flour, sugar, baking powder, soda, and salt into a large bowl.  Cut in butter or margarine until crumbly.  Add shredded apple and milk.  Stir to form a soft dough.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead gently 8 to 10 times.  Pat into two 6-inch circles.  Place on greased baking sheet. Brush tops with milk, and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.  Score each into 6 pie-shaped wedges.
Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 15 minutes, or until browned and risen.  Serve warm with butter.
