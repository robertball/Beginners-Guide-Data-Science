Ingredients:
PRE-COOKED CHICKEN IN BROTH:
2 Chicken thighs, 2 Chicken breasts, 2 Chicken legs
6 cups water
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 bay leaves
2 cinnamon sticks
1 tsp salt
RICE:
2 cups basmati rice
1 1/2 cups chopped very ripe tomatoes
2 cups onions
1/2 cup white raisins soaked in 1/3 cup water
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 TBS cardamon (6 whole cardamon pods)
10 whole cloves (1 tsp ground cloves)
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp 7 arabic spice
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
4 cups of prepared chicken broth
4 TBS butter
2 TBS oil

Directions:
Combine your chicken, water, onions, and spices. Cook for 1 1/2 hours or until meat is fully cooked.
In a bowl rinse off rice and pour off excess water. Mix all the seasonings with the rice. It helps the rice absorbs the seasonings better.
In another pan add 2 TBS oil, 1 TBS butter, onion, and tomatoes. Cook until onions and tomatoes begin to soften- about 10 minutes. Add rice, mix well and let cook for 2-3 minutes, add 4 cups of the chicken broth made when boiling the chicken. Stir and place on top 3 TBS of butter. Let the rice begin to boil, turn to low heat and cover. Cook for approximately 45 minutes.
While the rice is cooking take the cooked chicken and tear up. When rice is finished spread it out on a platter/plate and distribute the torn chicken evenly on the top.
