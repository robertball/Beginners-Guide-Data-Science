Ingredients:
2 cups assorted berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries
1/2 cup plus 3 Tbsp. powdered sugar, divided
3 oz. cream cheese
1 cup half-and-half
1 tsp. vanilla
2 tsp. fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Place berries and 3 Tbsp. powdered sugar in a blender or food processor and roughly purée. Taste and add more sugar, if desired. You should have about 1 cup of berry purée, and you can make it as smooth or as chunky as you'd like.
Transfer purée to a bowl or measuring cup with a pour spout and set aside. Wash out blender or food processor and then place cream cheese, half-and-half, vanilla, lemon juice, and 1/2 cup powdered sugar inside. Purée until smooth.
Fill popsicle molds, alternating berry mixture and cream cheese mixture. If desired, stir gently with a popsicle stick for a swirled effect, or leave layered. Freeze until slightly firm. Add a wooden popsicle stick to each mold and then freeze until completely solid.
To remove from molds, carefully run the outside of the mold under warm water until popsicles are loosened.
Store in an airtight container or zip-top bag in the freezer.
