Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups blanched almond flour
6 tablespoons coconut flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
4 eggs, at room temperature
1 medium orange, juiced and zested
1/4 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons coconut oil, warmed until liquid
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup fresh blueberries

Directions:
Set all ingredients on the counter to bring them to room temperature.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 to 18 muffin cups or line them with paper liners.
Combine almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
Combine eggs, orange zest, and orange juice in a large bowl; whisk to combine. Mix in pumpkin puree, honey, coconut oil, and vanilla extract until well combined. Add flour mixture and mix until just combined. Gently fold in blueberries.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
