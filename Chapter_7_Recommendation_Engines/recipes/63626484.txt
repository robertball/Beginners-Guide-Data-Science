Ingredients:
-----For the Meatballs-----
1.3 pounds ground turkey breast
3/4 cup long grain white rice
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon dill
1/4 teaspoon parsley
1 teaspoon salt
-----For the soup base-----
1 tablespoon olive oil
10 cups chicken stock (or water and bullion cubes)
2/3 cup onion, chopped
2/3 cup celery, chopped
2/3 cup carrot, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped

Directions:
Heat a soup pot to medium heat with olive oil.
Saute carrots, onion and celery until onions turn translucent and carrots take on a bit of color.
Add garlic and cook for one additional minute.
Add stock and dill to the pot and bring to a rolling boil.
Prepare meatballs while stock is heating.
Add meatball ingredients to a large bowl and mix thoroughly.
Form meatballs using a tablespoon measure (I usually end up with about 24 meatballs).
Gently drop meatballs into boiling stock one at a time and reduce heat to a simmer.
Simmer covered for 20-30 minutes or until rice inside of meatballs is thoroughly cooked through.
Add salt and pepper if desired.
Allow to cool for about 10 minutes before serving.
