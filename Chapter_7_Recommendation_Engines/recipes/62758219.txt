Ingredients:
4	slices  hearty white sandwich bread , torn into pieces
1/2	cup  mayonnaise
3	tablespoons  unsalted butter , melted
1	tablespoon  Dijon mustard
2	garlic cloves minced
2	teaspoons  grated zest  and 1 tablespoon juice from 1 lemon
3	tablespoons  finely chopped fresh chives
Salt and pepper
8	sole fillets , skinless (about 1 1/2 pounds)
3/4	cup  heavy cream

Directions:
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Grease 13- by 9-inch baking dish. Pulse bread in food processor to coarse crumbs. Transfer crumbs to large bowl and microwave, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp, 4 to 8 minutes. Add mayonnaise, butter, mustard, garlic, 2 tablespoons chives, lemon zest, ¼ teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper to bowl and stir to combine.
2. Pat fish dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Arrange fillets, smooth-side down, on work surface. Place ¼ cup filling on each fillet, roll, and arrange seam-side down in prepared baking dish.
3. Combine cream, lemon juice, ¼ teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in bowl. Pour cream mixture over fish and bake until stuffing is heated through and fish flakes apart when gently pressed, 12 to 14 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining chives. Serve.

Description: 
Many stuffed fish recipes fill the fish with a starchy, bland bread crumb mixture and bake the fish until way past done. We wanted a flavorful, light filling accented and a foolproof method for baking the fish
