Ingredients:
8 very fresh eggs
2 c. water
4 c. cold water
4 c. ice

Directions:
Fill your pressure cooker with the minimum amount of water specified by the manufacturer. Place the eggs in the steamer basket above the water.
Seal the lid and bring the pressure cooker up to low pressure. Cook, maintaining the pressure, for six minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the pressure to drop for five minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the cold water and ice in a large bowl.
Use the quick-release method to open the pressure cooker. Use an oven mitt or spoon to transfer the hot eggs to the ice bath.
Allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
If you happen to raise your own chickens—or have access to really fresh eggs—a pressure cooker is the best way to make hard-cooked eggs. It doesn't really save time (the pressure cooker's usual claim to fame), but here's why it's great: it actually makes fresh eggs easy to peel!
