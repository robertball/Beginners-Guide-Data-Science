Ingredients:
4 Hawaiian bread rolls (Cut in half length wise)
1/4 cup shredded cheese
Chopped grilled chicken (slices)
2 tomato slices
1/4 cup of sliced grilled onion (caramelized)
2 tablespoons fresh guacamole

Directions:
Slice the Hawaiian bread rolls in half, long wise. (not into the intended cube form)
Spread the guacamole on each slice of bread.
Place the tomato slices and onion on top.
Gently lay the grilled chicken strips on top.
Sprinkle on cheese.
Here's the tricky part: Press the bread together to form a sandwich, careful not to let the fillings spill out. (May need to press down firmly)
OPTIONAL: put the sandwich in the microwave for a few seconds to melt the cheese.
