Ingredients:
1 small head cauliflower, rough chopped with florets and stems
1 cup milk
1 cup chicken broth
3 tbsp olive oil
1lb country sausage meat
1 tbsp crushed garlic
½ cup chopped onion
¼ cup all-purpose flour
½ cup chicken broth
½ cup milk
1 cup cremini/button mushrooms, sliced
2 tbsp butter
Seasoning salt
Pepper
12 biscuits

Directions:
Cook cauliflower in pot with milk and chicken broth until well cooked.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in large skillet, add sausage, garlic and onion. Sauté until done, breaking sausage into small crumbles while cooking.
Transfer cauliflower, milk and chicken broth to blender.
Blend on high until very smooth, slowly increasing the speed to avoid spilling and burning! Caution, blender will be very full and very hot!
Drain sausage, returning liquid to skillet.
Add flour to skillet, stirring with whisk and cook roux for 3 - 4 minutes, continually stirring.
Add cauliflower mixture, milk, broth, butter and mushrooms to roux. Stir well.
Season with salt and pepper.
If mixture is too thick, add water ¼ cup at a time until desired consistency is met.
