Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/3 cup melted butter, at room temperature
1/4 cup honey
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a 24-cup mini muffin tin with cooking spray.
Whisk butter, honey, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl.
Stir brown sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Make a well in the center, and pour butter mixture into the well. Stir just until batter is combined.
Sprinkle 1/2 of the chopped pecans into the bottoms of the prepared muffin cups. Spoon batter evenly over top, until just about full and sprinkle with remaining pecans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes. Leave the muffins in the pan for about 5 minutes before removing to serve.
