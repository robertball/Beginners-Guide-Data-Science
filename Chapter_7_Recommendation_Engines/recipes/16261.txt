Ingredients:
½ cup picante sauce
¼ cup Dijon-style prepared mustard
2 tablespoons lemon juice
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
In a large glass bowl combine the picante sauce, mustard and lemon juice. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Remove chicken from marinade and saute in hot oil until well browned on both sides. Add remaining marinade and let simmer until chicken is glazed and tender and juices run clear. Remove chicken to platter/serving dish. Boil remaining marinade for 5 minutes to remove possibility of bacteria, then pour over chicken.
