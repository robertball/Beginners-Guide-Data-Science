Description: 
If you are like me, you like to eat your bananas separately, so what better way to sweeten up your smoothie than with a delicious watermelon? This smoothie is refreshing, light, and sweet! Feel free to change up the quantity of the ingredients mentioned according to your taste. This is a great smoothie if you would like to put more vegetables than fruit but still get the great taste.
