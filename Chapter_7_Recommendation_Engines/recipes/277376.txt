Ingredients:
Meatballs:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
4 ounces bulk Italian pork sausage
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1 small egg
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
Sauce:
1 small onion, finely diced
1 (24 ounce) jar tomato and basil spaghetti sauce (such as RaguÂ®)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
12 (3 ounce) ciabatta buns
3 tablespoons garlic butter, or to taste
1/3 cup shredded Italian cheese blend, or to taste

Directions:
Mix ground beef, pork sausage, bread crumbs, egg, Cajun seasoning, seasoned salt, garlic powder, pepper, and salt together in a large bowl until well combined. Form mixture into twelve 2-inch meatballs. Form any remaining meat mixture into meatballs or patties, and freeze for another time.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Place meatballs in the hot oil and cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer meatballs to a plate and cover with aluminum foil. Drain all but about 1 tablespoon grease from the pan.
Add onion to the pan; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add spaghetti sauce, garlic powder, and seasoned salt; bring to a simmer. Return meatballs to the pan and simmer until no longer pink in the centers, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meatballs should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Meanwhile, slice ciabatta buns in half and spread butter over the cut sides. Place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until buns are slightly crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and turn on the broiler. Place 1 meatball on each bottom bun, top with 1 to 2 tablespoons of sauce, and sprinkle with shredded Italian cheese. Sprinkle top buns with more Italian cheese.
Broil until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.
