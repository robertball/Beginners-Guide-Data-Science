Ingredients:
Milk,whole___________3 ½ cups
Heavy cream__________2 ¼ cups+2 Tablespoons
Sugar, granulated____1 1/4 cups
Vanilla extract, pure_____1 ½ teaspoon
*Xanthan gum (optional)______½ teaspoon
Salt,kosher,coarse___¾ teaspoon
Oreos,double stuffed__10 each

Directions:
Gather all ingredients and equipment.
•If using xanthan gum, sift the sugar, salt, and xanthan gum twice together.
In a blender, combine all of the ingredients except for the Oreos.
Pulse the mixture on high speed for 7 seconds.
Transfer the blend to an ice cream maker and churn per the unit’s instruction; this should achieve a smooth, semi-solid consistency rather than a fully solid one.
Remove the mixture from the ice cream machine; crumble the Oreos and fold them into the mixture.
Place the contents into a storage container(s) and freeze until the blend becomes solid before serving.
