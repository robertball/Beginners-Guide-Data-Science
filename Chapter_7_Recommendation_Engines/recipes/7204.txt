Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon anise seed
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the anise seed and mix well.
In a separate large bowl cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in one egg, and then the other. Beat for 1 minute.
Beginning with the flour mixture, alternately add the milk and flour to the large bowl with the creamed butter and sugar. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated.
Spoon batter into a greased 9x5x3 inch loaf pan.
Bake in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 50 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a cooling rack. May be stored in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.
