Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets
cooking spray
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
1 teaspoon brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Rinse and dry salmon fillets with a paper towel. Mist fillets with cooking spray. Combine Cajun seasoning and brown sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle onto a plate. Press flesh sides of fillets into the seasoning mixture.
Spray the basket of the air fryer with cooking spray and place salmon fillets skin-side down. Mist salmon again lightly with cooking spray.
Cook for 8 minutes. Remove from air fryer and let rest for 2 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Full of flavor with a hint of sweetness, this moist and delicious salmon is ready in under 10 minutes! You may want to add salt before serving if you are using an unsalted Cajun seasoning. I like to use a MistoÂ® sprayer with my own oil, but feel free to use regular cooking spray. For best results, use center-cut fillets that are about an inch thick.
