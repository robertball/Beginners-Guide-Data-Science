Oven Baked Chicken Teriyaki Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons water
1 cup low-sodium soy sauce
½ cup white sugar
¼ cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
4 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
3 cloves garlic, minced
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until dissolved. Combine soy sauce, sugar, mirin, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes together in a saucepan over medium heat until the mixture starts to simmer. Slowly whisk in cornstarch mixture. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened, stirring often, about 10 minutes.
Pat chicken dry with paper towels; arrange in a baking dish. Pour sauce over chicken breasts, coating all sides.
Bake chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).

Wonderful baked chicken with minimal mess to make for easy clean-up. My daughter says it's her favorite teriyaki chicken ever! Can be easily adapted to your tastes and can also be done on the stove if you prefer. Serve over rice.
