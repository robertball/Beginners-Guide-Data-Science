2 tablespoons fine dry breadcrumbs
1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
½ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)

Description: 
A real chicken nugget, at least in the fast food context, is not just a small solid piece of chicken. It's more of a deep-fried, mostly-chicken sausage patty, fabricated from various parts of the bird, such as every legal part. But I like to use chicken thighs.
