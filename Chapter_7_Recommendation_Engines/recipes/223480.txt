Ingredients:
24 (1 ounce) sticks string cheese
5 eggs, beaten
3 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Remove string cheese sticks from plastic wrappings and cut the strings in half crosswise.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place eggs in a bowl and bread crumbs into a large shallow bowl.
Dip cheese stick halves into egg and roll in bread crumbs to completely coat the sticks; place breaded cheese sticks onto the prepared baking sheet. Allow cheese sticks to stand at room temperature for about 5 minutes to set, and repeat dipping in egg and bread crumbs to form a thick coating. Freeze breaded cheese sticks for at least 2 hours.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Deep fry cheese sticks, a few at a time, until the coating is golden brown and crisp and the cheese is soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Let sticks drain on paper towels; cool slightly and serve warm.

Description: 
These is an easy, cost-efficient way to make home-made fried cheese sticks. Taste just wonderful, light crispiness. More for your dollar and easily stored in the freezer for when you have a craving. I make 2 batches, one for the 'now' and one for later. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce.
