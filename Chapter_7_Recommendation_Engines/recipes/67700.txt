Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) package dry spaghetti
8 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons minced garlic
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
cayenne pepper (optional)
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
Heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Melt butter with garlic very slowly to avoid burning the garlic. Season with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and parsley. Sprinkle with cayenne pepper to taste, if desired.
Toss pasta into the skillet until well-coated with butter. Increase heat to medium, and cook until pasta is heated through and has absorbed some of the butter. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
A quick, simple pasta tossed with butter, parsley, and Parmesan cheese. A wonderful recipe to make when you don't feel like making a trip to the grocery store. I used what I had on hand and it worked like a charm! Add summer vine-ripened tomatoes for an extra dash of flavor!
