Description: 
I love to play around with mac and cheese flavors to make them taste like classic dishes that we all love! This one tastes exactly like a big, juicy, all-American cheeseburger with lots of melty cheese, grilled onions, pickles, ketchup, and mustard. If you shut your eyes and take a bite, you'll be amazed! A green salad or Caesar salad is a great accompaniment for this.
