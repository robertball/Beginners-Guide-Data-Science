Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package multigrain tortilla chips
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 orange bell pepper, diced
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
1/2 pineapple, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice
8 thick slices bacon
3/4 cup Caribbean jerk marinade
1 pound cooked shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 pound shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Layer the chips on a tray or cookie sheet. Arrange the red pepper, orange pepper, onion, avocado, and pineapple on top of the chips.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly crisp; drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Chop the bacon and sprinkle over the nachos.
Pour the jerk marinade into a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring continually, until the marinade reduces to a thick sticky consistency, about 3 minutes. Add the shrimp and stir to coat; cook until the shrimp are hot. Scatter the shrimp over the nachos; top with Monterrey Jack cheese and cilantro.
Place the nachos in the oven until the cheese is melted, about 7 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe combines spicy, sweet, and salty with a definite Caribbean flair. The multigrain chips make it a heartier and healthier dish, and add a wonderful nutty flavor. Chicken can be subbed for the shrimp, but increase the cooking time as necessary. Serve with sour cream and picante salsa.
