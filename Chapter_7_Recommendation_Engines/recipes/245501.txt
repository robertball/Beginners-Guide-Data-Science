Ingredients:
2 cups sauerkraut, chopped and drained
1 cup shredded carrot
3 tablespoons spicy mustard
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1 pinch ground cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, finely chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup water, or as needed
oil for frying
2 cups bread crumbs

Directions:
Combine sauerkraut, carrot, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, cumin, parsley, basil, turmeric, cayenne, garam masala, black pepper, and salt in a large bowl; mix until thoroughly combined. Add 6 tablespoons flour and mix well to combine.
Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add sauerkraut mixture and 1/2 cup water; cook and stir until the mixture thickens, adding more water if needed, 5 to 8 minutes. If the sauerkraut mixture is not thick enough or not thickening, add more flour.
Spread sauerkraut mixture evenly in a casserole dish and set aside to cool, about 1 hour.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place bread crumbs in a shallow bowl.
Use a 1-inch cookie scoop or your hands to form the cooled sauerkraut mixture into 1-inch balls. Roll them in bread crumbs and place in the hot oil. Fry in batches until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
