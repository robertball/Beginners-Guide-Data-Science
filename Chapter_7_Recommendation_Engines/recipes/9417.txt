Preheat oven to 425 degrees F(220 degrees C).
Place apple chunks in a large bowl. Combine 1/2 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, and nutmeg.  Sprinkle over apples and toss to coat well.  Spoon into pastry shell.  Drizzle with lemon juice.
For the topping:  Combine 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup flour. Cut in butter.  Sprinkle over apples to cover top. Take two 15 inch pieces of parchment paper and enclose pie; fold edges up 3 times. Place on a baking sheet.
Bake for 1 hour.  Remove from oven, split parchment open and cool pie on wire rack. DO NOT open parchment covering while baking! Cool for 10 minutes before serving hot.

Description: 
My grandmother used to make this pie when we had Christmas at her house. She used a paper bag to cover the pie, but in the updated version we use parchment paper. It is a very old recipe. Enjoy!
