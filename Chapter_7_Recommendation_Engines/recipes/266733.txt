Ingredients:
Sauce:
1 lime, juiced
1 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, minced
1 small bunch chervil
1 sprig lemon balm, chopped
1/2 cup olive oil
4 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
2 ounces Parmesan cheese, thinly sliced

Directions:
Combine lime juice, lemon juice, honey, mustard, ginger, chervil, and lemon balm in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until blended. Pour olive oil in slowly, with the processor running, until sauce is smooth.
Cover apple slices with the sauce in a bowl and chill in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes.
Build 4 towers on each of 4 salad plates by inserting Parmesan cheese slices between apple slices. Drizzle stacks with sauce, and place extra sauce in a spoon on each plate.

I love the explosion of traditional flavors and this mixture of different tastes. These little fruit snacks are paired with a lemony chervil sauce and they are a real treat your guests will love.
