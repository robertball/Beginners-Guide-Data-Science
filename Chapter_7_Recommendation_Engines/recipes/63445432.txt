Ingredients:
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/3 cup distilled white vinegar
2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a small saucepan over a medium-low heat, whisk (using a metal whisk) together vinegar and cornstarch.  Add oil, pineapple juice, ketchup, brown sugar, and salt; whisking constantly until the mixture is heated through.
For a thicker consistency, dissolve another 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch in 1/4 cup cold water.  Stir the mixture into the sauce and continue to heat and whisk until thickened.
