Ingredients:
1 cup light brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
6 large sweet potatoes
1 tablespoon cold butter, cut into pieces
2 teaspoons salt
6 firm bananas, sliced
2 (8 ounce) cans crushed pineapple
1 cup pineapple juice
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir together the brown sugar and cinnamon until evenly blended; set aside.
Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two; peel and cut into 1/2 inch slices.
Layer the potatoes into the prepared baking dish, dot with butter, and sprinkle with salt. Arrange the bananas over the potatoes and sprinkle evenly with the brown sugar mixture. Top with the crushed pineapple. Whisk together the pineapple juice, lemon juice, and honey until the honey has dissolved. Pour over the casserole.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot and browned on top, about 40 minutes.
