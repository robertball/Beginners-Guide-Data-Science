Ingredients:
1 cup macaroni pasta
1 cup low fat cottage cheese
2 tsp flour
1 cup milk
1 pinch salt
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 pinch pepper
1 cup cheddar cheese
2 thinly sliced scallions
½ T Dijon mustard
¼ cup Panko bread crumbs
1 tsp olive oil

Directions:
Boil a large pot of 8 cups water. Once the water is boiling add the pasta and cook until al dente, approximately 8-10 minutes. Drain well and set aside.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spray an 8x8 baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Add cottage cheese to blender and puree until smooth and creamy. Set aside.
In a small sauce pan add flour. Gradually whisk in milk. Bring to a boil and add in salt, pepper, and cayenne. Cook whisking constantly until mixture is slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Whisk in cottage cheese, ¾ c cheddar cheese, scallions, and mustard. Whisk until cheese has melted. Add cheese mixture to macaroni. Toss to mix.
Spoon macaroni into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle remaining cheddar cheese on top of macaroni. Sprinkle breadcrumbs on top of cheese and drizzle with olive oil.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until the top is crusty and lightly browned.
