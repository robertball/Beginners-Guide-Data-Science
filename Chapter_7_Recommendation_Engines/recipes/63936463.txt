Ingredients:
Crust
1 box butter-recipe cake mix
1 egg
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted
Filling
1 8 oz. package cream cheese, softened
2 eggs
1 tsp. pure vanilla extract
1 16 oz. box powdered sugar
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Light grease a 9 x 13 in. baking pan. In a bowl, combine cake mix, egg, and butter with an electric mixer. Mix well. Pat into the bottom of prepared pan and set aside. Still using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese until smooth; add eggs and vanilla. Dump powdered sugar and beat very well. Reduce the speed of mixer and slowly pour in melted butter.
Mix well. Stir in the chocolate chips. Pour filling onto cake mixture and spread evenly. Bake for 40-50 minutes (it took me closer to 50 minutes). You want to center to be a little gooey, so don't bake it past that point! Remove from oven and allow to cool completely. If you want to drizzle melted chocolate over the top allow it to cool for at least 15 minutes and then drizzle over. Allow to cool for at least another hour and then cut into bars. Enjoy!
