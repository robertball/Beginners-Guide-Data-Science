Ingredients:
•	2 x *ripe  avocados (pitted and peeled & quartered)
•	Juice from ½ lime
•	½ jalapeno (seeded and finely chopped)
•	¾ cup fresh cilantro (finely chopped)
•	1 clove garlic (pressed or finely chopped)
•	2 – 4 green onions (chopped)
•	1 Tbsp tomato salsa
•	1 tsp coarse sea-salt to
•	¼ tsp fresh ground black pepper
•	1 tsp hot pepper sauce (or to taste)
*A ripe avocado yields slightly to a gentle squeeze (not too mushy). There are all kinds of videos and advice on the internet on how to pit an avocado.

Directions:
Add all ingredients to a medium sized, flat-bottomed bowl and mash to a slightly chunky (or desired) consistency. I start out with a potato masher, and finish off with a fork. Spoon into serving dish, cover and refrigerate for at least an hour before serving.

Description: 
This is a recipe I put together over time. The objective at first was to mask the taste of the avocado. My wife LOVES THEM and I thought at the time I didn't. Boy was I wrong. Served alone, I'm still not crazy about them. But sliced up in a salad or on a sandwich, its taste and texture add a surprisingly tasty and different twist.   If you have reservations, give this a shot. This is a recipe that gets raves every time I serve it; whether it’s with fajitas or as a dip.
