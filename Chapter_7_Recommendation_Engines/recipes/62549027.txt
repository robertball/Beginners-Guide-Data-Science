Ingredients:
1 lb Lean Ground Beef or Lean Ground Turkey
1 Packet of Taco Seasoning
1 15 oz Can of Ranch Style Beans
1 2.25 oz Can of Sliced Black Olives
1 Head of Leafy Green Lettuce
1 Bottle of Fat Free Catalina Dressing
1 Bag of Fritos
Mexican Shredded Cheese

Directions:
Brown the ground beef or turkey and add the taco seasoning as instructed on the package. While this is cooking start shredding the lettuce for the salad and get all the ingredients opened and ready.
Once the beef is done cooking itâ€™s time to build your salad. I start by adding a layer of lettuce, then ranch style beans and black olives. I top it off with some Mexican cheese, Fritos, and Catalina dressing. Sliced tomato is another great addition to this salad. Then, I enjoy my delicious taco salad.
