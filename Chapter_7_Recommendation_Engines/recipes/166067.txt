Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
3/4 cup dry lentils
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 bay leaf
1/4 cup olive oil
1 large red onion, chopped
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
8 ounces vegan sausage, cut into 1/4 inch slices (optional)
1 bunch kale, stems removed and leaves coarsely chopped
1 (12 ounce) package rotini pasta
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast (optional)

Directions:
Bring the vegetable broth, lentils, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and bay leaf to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the lentils are tender, about 20 minutes. Add additional broth if needed to keep the lentils moist. Discard the bay leaf once done.
As the lentils simmer, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion, thyme, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and pepper. Cook and stir for 1 minute, then add the sausage. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until the onion has softened, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the kale and rotini pasta. Cook until the rotini is al dente, about 8 minutes. Remove some of the cooking water, and set aside. Drain the pasta, then return to the pot, and stir in the lentils, and onion mixture. Use the reserved cooking liquid to adjust the moistness of the dish to your liking. Sprinkle with nutritional yeast to serve.
