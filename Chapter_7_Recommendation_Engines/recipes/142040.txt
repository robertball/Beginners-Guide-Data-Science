Ingredients:
1 (9 ounce) bag frozen french fries
1 pound ground beef
4 slices bread, toasted
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups half-and-half
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
hot sauce to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread french fries out on a baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown.
Meanwhile, divide the ground beef into four equal parts and form into patties. Fry the patties in a large skillet over medium-high heat until well done, about 4 minutes per side.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat and whisk in the flour. Cook while stirring constantly for 4 minutes to cook out the flavor of raw flour. Gradually whisk in the half-and-half so that no lumps form. Bring to a simmer then remove from the heat and add the cheese; stir until melted. Season with salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste.
Place 2 slices of toasted bread onto 2 dinner plates and top each slice with a hamburger patty. Top each patty with cooked french fries. Pour the cheese sauce on top of everything and serve immediately.

Description: 
Every time we visit Springfield, Illinois we have to eat one of their famous horseshoes. The cheese sauce is a little different depending on where you stop to eat, seems everyone has their own way of making it. But we love them all. If you only use one slice of bread and one hamburger patty it is called a ponyshoe. This recipe can also be made with chicken tenders in place of the hamburger patties.
