Ingredients:
2.5 lbs. top sirloin roast
3 Anaheim peppers, sliced
2 medium onions, peeled and sliced
1 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1.5 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp tomato paste
1 tsp honey
3 chipotle peppers from a can, chopped
1/2 tsp Sriracha
3/4 cup beer (I used Coors Light)
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 300 degrees F.
Layer the peppers and onions in an oven-safe Dutch oven.
Mix together the cumin, garlic powder, coriander, oregano, tomato paste, honey, chopped chipotle peppers, and Sriracha. Pat this mixture onto the roast.
Set roast onto peppers/onions in Dutch oven.
Pour beer and Worcestershire sauce around roast.
Cook for 3-4 hours, or until you can shred it with a fork.
Once the meat is shreddable, do so, then put back with the onions and peppers and put that mix onto your tacos.
