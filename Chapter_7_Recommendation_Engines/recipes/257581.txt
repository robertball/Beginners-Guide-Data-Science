water to cover
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, or more as needed
8 cups water, or more as needed
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
1 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup rice wine
1 bunch green onions, cut into 2-inch pieces
1/4 cup brown sugar
10 cloves garlic, peeled, or more to taste
4 small chile peppers, halved and seeded, or more to taste
2 tablespoons chile paste
1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into 5 pieces
3 star anise pods, or more to taste
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
4 small heads baby bok choy
1 (10 ounce) package udon noodles

Directions:
Place beef in a stockpot and pour in enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and drain.
Pour vegetable oil into a slow cooker; add beef, 8 cups water, beef broth, soy sauce, rice wine, green onions, brown sugar, garlic, chile peppers, chile paste, ginger, star anise, and Chinese five-spice powder.
Cook on Low for 8 to 9 hours.
Transfer beef to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Strain broth into a bowl. Discard solids.
