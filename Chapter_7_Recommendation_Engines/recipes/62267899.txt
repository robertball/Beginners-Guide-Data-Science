Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white granulated sugar
1 stick butter (butter, not margarine), softened
2 eggs
3 ripe bananas, mashed
1/3 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
2 teaspoons vanilla
1/2 to 1 cup chopped pecans, toasted (optional)*

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Cream sugar and butter.  Add eggs, bananas and buttermilk.  Sift dry ingredients together, and add to mixture.  Mix just until thoroughly blended.  Stir in vanilla and pecans.
Bake in a greased and floured loaf pan for 55 minutes.
* Toast pecans by placing them in a single layer on a baking sheet and baking in a 350 degree oven for 5 - 10 minutes.  Watch closely so they do not burn.  Pecan halves will take longer to toast than chopped pecans.  I usually toast pecan halves, and then chop them when they are cool.
