Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
1 (10 ounce) package frozen broccoli florets
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, minced
1 teaspoon garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups diced cooked ham
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup milk
4 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon smoked paprika

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Press the pie crust ito a 9-inch pie plate; set aside.
Place broccoli in a glass bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Cook broccoli in microwave in 1-minute intervals until evenly heated through, about 5 minutes total; set aside.
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic in melted butter until slightly translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir ham and broccoli into the onion mixture and transfer to the pie crust.
Beat Cheddar cheese, milk, eggs, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour over the ham mixture. Sprinkle paprika over the entire quiche.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean, 30 to 45 minutes.
