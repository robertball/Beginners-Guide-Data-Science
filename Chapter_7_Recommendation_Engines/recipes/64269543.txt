Ingredients:
6 tbsp cold pressed olive oil
6 large carrots), peeled and chopped
1/2 of a butternut squash, seeded & cubed
1 medium sized white onion, chopped
2 teaspoons ginger, diced
2 cubes of vegetable stock, with salt
6 cups water
6 long strips of orange peel

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium-low heat and saute the onions, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes.  Add carrots and squash to onions to saute for a few minutes.  Do not let the onions brown.
Add the stock, water, ginger, and strips of orange peel.  Increase heat to medium and slowly bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until the carrots soften, about 20 minutes.
Remove the strips of orange and discard.  Then use an immersion blender, blending until the ingredients are a smooth puree.  You may need to add more salt to taste and pepper is a nice add as well.
