Ingredients:
1 cup dried white beans
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound pork loin, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 onion, chopped
1/2 cup chopped carrots
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage
2 teaspoons fresh thyme
3 cups chicken broth

Directions:
Place beans in a large bowl and cover with 6 cups boiling water. Soak for 1 hour; drain.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add pork, season with salt and pepper, and cook until brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate.
Add onion and carrots to the pot; cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add sage and thyme; stir to combine.
Return pork to the pot. Add soaked beans. Add broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until beans are tender, about 2 hours.
