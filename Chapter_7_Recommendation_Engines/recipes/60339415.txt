Ingredients:
2 pound pork tenderloin
seasoning salt to taste
1 cups apple juice
1/2 cup apple butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season the pork tenderloins with seasoning salt, and place them in a 9x13 inch baking dish or small roasting pan. Pour apple juice over the pork, and cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil.
Bake for 1/2 hour in the preheated oven. While the pork is roasting, mix together the apple butter, brown sugar, water, cinnamon and cloves. After the half hour, remove pork tenderloins from the oven, and spread the apple butter mixture over them.
Cover, and return to the oven for 1/2 hours, or until fork tender.
