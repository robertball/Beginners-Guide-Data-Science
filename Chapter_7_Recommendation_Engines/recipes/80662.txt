Description: 
A hot, sweet, sour and fragrant explosion of taste on a plate. The longer you leave to infuse the tastier it gets! You wont serve a better curry. Serve with rice or naan bread. Don't worry about the other whole spices, as the cooking will soften them. Enjoy as your tongue hits all the different combination of flavors.
