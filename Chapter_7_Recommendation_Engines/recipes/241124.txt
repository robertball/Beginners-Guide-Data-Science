1 cup fresh blackberries, rinsed and patted dry
1 lemon, zested

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place tart shells on a baking sheet.
Mash blackberries and lemon zest together lightly in a small bowl. Divide blackberry mixture evenly into the bottom of tart shells.

Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and shells are golden, 22 to 27 minutes.
