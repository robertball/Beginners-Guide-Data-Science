Ingredients:
1  tablespoon dry yeast
2/3 cup brown rice flour (I use 'garfava' flour which is a blend) or 2/3 cup gram flour (I use 'garfava' flour which is a blend) or 2/3 cup fava bean flour (I use 'garfava' flour which is a blend)
1/2 cup tapioca flour
2  tablespoons powdered milk (Dairy alternative, 2 T tapioca flour or sweet rice flour in place of 2 T dry milk powder or non-dair) or 2  tablespoons  non-dairy powdered coffee creamer (Dairy alternative, 2 T tapioca flour or sweet rice flour in place of 2 T dry milk powder or non-dair)
2  teaspoons xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  teaspoon unflavored gelatin
1  teaspoon  italian seasoning
2/3 cup water (110 degrees F)
1/2 teaspoon sugar or 1/2 teaspoon honey or 1/2 teaspoon  agave syrup
1  teaspoon olive oil
1  teaspoon cider vinegar

Directions:
1
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
2
In medium bowl using regular beaters (not dough hooks), blend all ingredients on low speed.
3
Beat on high speed for 3 minutes.
4
(If mixer bounces around bowl, dough is too stiff. Add water if necessary, one tablespoon at a time, until dough does not resist beaters.) Dough will resemble soft bread dough.
5
Put mixture on lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or 11 x 7-inch pan (for deep dish version).
6
Liberally sprinkle rice flour on dough, then press dough into pan, continuing to sprinkle with flour to prevent sticking to hands.
7
Make edges slightly thicker to hold toppings.
8
Bake pizza crust for 10 minutes.
9
Remove from oven.
10
Spread pizza crust with your favorite sauce and toppings.
11
Bake another 20 to 25 minutes or until top is nicely browned.
