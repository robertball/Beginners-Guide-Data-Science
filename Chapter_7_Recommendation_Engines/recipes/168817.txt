Ingredients:
4 beets, trimmed, leaving 1 inch of stems attached
6 tablespoons basil pesto
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the beets in a large saucepan and cover with 1 inch of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the beets are just tender, about 30 minutes. Drain, and allow the beets to cool until you are able to handle them. Peel and cut into 1/2 inch thick slices, then toss with the pesto in a bowl.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Spread the beets out onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the beets are hot and have turned slightly brown around the edges, 10 to 15 minutes.
