Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cream the shortening and brown sugar together. Mix in the egg and milk. Stir in the apples. Add the flour, baking soda, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, ground nutmeg. Stir in the nuts and dates.
Either drop spoonfuls of dough onto a lightly greased cookie sheet or spread dough into a 13x18 inch lightly greased jelly roll pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes for the cookies or 20 to 25 minutes for the bars. Let cool then ice, if desired.
