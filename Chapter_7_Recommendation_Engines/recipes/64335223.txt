Ingredients:
1 cup Rolled Oats
1 Tbsp Cocoa Powder
3-4 Tbsp Almond Milk
1 cup Almond Flour
2 cups Peanut Butter
3 Large Ripe Bananas
2 tsp Vanilla Extract
1/4 cup Maple Syrup
1/4 cup Coconut Oil
1/3 cup Roasted Peanuts
1/3 cup Chocolate Chips

Directions:
Line a 9 inch round cake pan with parchment paper.
Add the oats, cocoa powder, almond milk, and almond flour to your food processor and process until smooth. Add this mixture to the prepared lined cake pan and with a spatula press until evenly uniformed through all sides.
Place the filling ingredients in the food processor and pulse until you obtain a homogenous mixture. Add the topping over the crust and freeze pie until solid for at least 4-6 hours.
When ready to eat, sprinkle the peanuts over the peanut butter pie. Place the chocolate chips in a plate and microwave at 30 second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate has melted. Drizzle the chocolate over the peanuts and pie and serve.
You may have to let the pie sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes to be able to slice. Store leftover pie in the freezer and thaw for 10-15 minutes before eating.
