Ingredients:
1 pound uncooked fresh medium shrimp
1/2 cup uncooked white rice
1 1/2 cups water
1/4 cup butter
3 tablespoons Gold Medal® all-purpose flour
1 medium onion, chopped
1 small green bell pepper, chopped
1 celery, sliced
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 cup water
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Directions:
Peel shrimp.  (If shrimp are frozen, do not thaw; peel in cold water.)  Make a shallow cut lengthwise down back of each shrimp; wash out vein.
In a saucepan bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil. Add 1/2 cup rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Melt butter in 3-quart saucepan over medium heat.  Stir in flour.  Cook about 6 minutes, stirring constantly, until bubbly and brown.  Stir in onion, bell pepper, celery and garlic.  Cook about 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until vegetables are crisp-tender.
Stir in shrimp and remaining ingredients except rice.  Heat to boiling; reduce heat.  Simmer uncovered about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are pink and firm.  Serve over rice.
