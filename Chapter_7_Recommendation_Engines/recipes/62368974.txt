Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 bell peppers, seeded and cut into rectangles
1/2 pound whole button mushrooms, scrubbed clean
2 medium zucchinis, cut diagonally into half inch thick slices
1/2 pound cherry tomatoes
1 red onion, cut into half inch thick slices and all the layers separated
about 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
kosher salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine vegetables in a large bowl.  Pour olive oil over veggies and toss with a spoon.  All the vegetables should be glistening with olive oil.
Sprinkle on salt and pepper, and toss again to evenly distribute.  Taste a vegetable piece to check if there's enough salt and pepper, and add more if necessary.
Arrange veggies on a medium high grill and turn with tongs when they have nice grill lines, about 3-5 minutes per side.

Description: 
Veggies with the simple additions of kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper and extra virgin olive oil taste incredible when grilled.  They'll probably need more salt than you think, so don't be shy!  You can use any combination of the following veggies and even saute them in a frying pan instead of grilling if you want.
