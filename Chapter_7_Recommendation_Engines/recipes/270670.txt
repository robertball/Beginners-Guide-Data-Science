Ingredients:
1 pound king salmon fillets
1 pinch ground black pepper
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1/4 cup miso paste
2 tablespoons minced ginger
1/4 cup gluten-free soy sauce (tamari), or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a pie pan with aluminum foil. Place salmon in the prepared pie pan; season with pepper.
Mix brown sugar, miso, and ginger together in a bowl. Slowly pour in enough soy sauce to reach the consistency of a glaze. Cover salmon with a thick layer of the glaze.
Bake in the center of the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove salmon and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Preheat the broiler.
Broil salmon, checking regularly, until fish flakes easily with a fork and glaze is bubbly and golden, 2 to 3 minutes.
