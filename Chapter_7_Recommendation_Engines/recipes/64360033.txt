Ingredients:
3 pounds corned beef brisket with spice packet
10 small red potatoes
5 carrots, peeled and cut into 3-inch pieces
1 large head cabbage, cut into small wedges
4 cups water

Directions:
Place corned beef in large pot or Dutch oven or slow cooker and cover with water. Add the spice packet that came with the corned beef.  Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.  Simmer approximately 50 minutes per pound or until tender.
Add whole potatoes and carrots, and cook until the vegetables are almost tender.  Add cabbage and cook for 15 more minutes. Remove meat and let rest 15 minutes.
Place vegetables in a bowl and cover. Add as much broth (cooking liquid reserved in the Dutch oven or large pot) as you want. Slice meat across the grain.
If you are using slow cooker.
Place the carrots and potatoes into the bottom of the slow cooker, pour in the water, and place the brisket on top of the vegetables. Pour the water over the brisket. Sprinkle on the spices from the packet, cover, and set the cooker on High.
Cook the brisket for about 8 hours. An hour before serving, add the cabbage and cook for 1 more hour.
