Description: 
This is a wonderful meal anytime of day or night. My grandfather used to make frittatas quite often. Instead of finishing a frittata under the broiler he would cook it halfway, put a plate on top of the pan, flip the pan over, and slide the frittata back into the pan to cook the other side. Sometimes a frittata would stick; other times the hot oil would drip on him as he performed this maneuver. It was during these moments that I learned all the really good Italian curse words I still use to this day.
