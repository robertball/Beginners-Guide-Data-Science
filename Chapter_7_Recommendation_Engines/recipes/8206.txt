Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups cake flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
7 eggs
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 1/2 teaspoons peppermint extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
15 drops red food coloring

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Separate the eggs.
Sift the cake flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add the oil, egg yolks, water, peppermint extract and vanilla extract. Beat with mixer on low for 1 minute.
Beat egg whites with cream of tarter until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whites into the yolk mixture. Pour 1/3 of the batter into a separate bowl and tint with the food coloring.
Alternate large spoonfuls of red and plain batter into an ungreased tube or bundt pan. Run a knife or spatula through the batter to make a swirled effect.
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 55 minutes. Increase heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until done. Let cake cool in pan on rack. Once cool remove from pan and frost, if desired.
