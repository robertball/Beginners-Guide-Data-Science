Ingredients:
1 Chuck Tender Roast
Ground black pepper, salt, onion powder, and garlic powder (for taste)
about 3 heaping tablespoons of corn starch
78 oz (3 containers swanson) beef broth (you could use beef boullion cubes but i reccommend broth)

Directions:
1. Place large stock pot on medium heat, and cover bottom with cooking oil. Spread spices all over roast, and place into cooking oil, let sizzle, and brown for about a minute, then flip and do the same on the other side. After the second side is brown, add the beef broth til it covers the top of the roast. Cover, (it's important to cover, because it helps make the roast tender) and cook for 3 1/2 hours. Check it occasionally and add more broth, as it evaporates. You can add more spices to the broth, if desired. When the roast is finished take it out of the broth, and mix in a seperate bowl, corn starch, and 2 cups of water. Mix until completely dissolved, and add it to the broth. Stir until broth if thickened, then add roast. Now you have a perfect roast, with gravy!
