Ingredients:
2 cups cooked and mashed sweet potato
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup water
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/2 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease or line 15 muffin cups with paper liners.
Mix sweet potato, brown sugar, oil, water, and eggs together in a large bowl using an electric mixer or by hand.
Mix flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl. Blend into sweet potato mixture until combined. Stir in chocolate chips.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
