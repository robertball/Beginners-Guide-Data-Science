Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup sliced onion
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/2 pound spicy pork sausage links, sliced
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 cups baked beans
1/4 cup barbecue sauce
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat one tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in the onion, oregano, parsley, salt, and pepper. Cook for 1 minute, and remove from heat.
Spread 1 tablespoon olive oil over the bottom of an 8x8 inch glass baking dish. Layer the sliced, cooked potatoes in the dish. Top the potatoes with the onion mixture. Arrange sliced sausage over onions. In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, baked beans, and barbecue sauce. Pour evenly over the sausage. Top with shredded Cheddar cheese.
