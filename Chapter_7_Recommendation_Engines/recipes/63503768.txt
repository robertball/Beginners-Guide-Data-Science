1 large onion sliced thin
4 cloves garlic minced

1 can chicken broth

Directions:
Remove large central vein from each leaf,stack and cross cut into 2 inch wide strips. Place in a large bowl with cold water and swish around. Let sit for a minute or two so any dirt will settle at the bottom then remove leaves without disturbing sediment.  Place in  a large stockpot and remaining ingredients. Cover and let simmer over low heat until leaves are tender, about an hour. Adjust seasonings as desired.
