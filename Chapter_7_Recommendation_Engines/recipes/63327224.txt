Ingredients:
3 - 14.5 ounce cans of chicken broth
3 cans of water
1 tablespoon chicken flavored soup base
1-1/2 cups Uncle Ben's converted rice
3 large eggs
2 ounces lemon juice
cracked pepper to taste
1 cooked whole chicken breast, shredded (optional)

Directions:
Pour chicken broth and water in a 3 quart saucepan. Add soup base and stir. Let come to a boil.
Add rice and cover. Let simmer for 25 minutes to cook rice.
In the meantime, place eggs in a blender or beat with a hand mixer until light and fluffy.
Stir lemon juice into beaten eggs, and set aside.
After rice is cooked, shut off heat. Add shredded chicken (optional).
Add egg and lemon mixture to soup slowly, stir continually to prevent eggs from curdling. Add cracked pepper to taste.

Description: 
This soup is perhaps the most iconic of all Greek soups. This recipe is the quick and easy version. It can be served with leftover, shredded chicken that has been mixed in, but that's optional. My mom always made this when one of us were sick or when the weather turned cold. For whatever reason you choose, it will become one of your favorite recipes too.
