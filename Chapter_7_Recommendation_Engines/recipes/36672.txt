Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup chilled stick margarine or butter, cut into small pieces
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 cup fat-free sour cream
2 tablespoons 1% low-fat milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 egg
cooking spray
3 ounces block-style fat-free cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 egg white
1/4 cup raspberry preserves
1/3 cup fresh raspberries
2 tablespoons sliced almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup; level with a knife. Combine flour, 1/3 cup sugar, and salt in a bowl; cut in margarine with a pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture resembles coarse meal. Reserve 1/2 cup flour mixture for topping; set aside.
Combine remaining flour mixture, baking powder, and baking soda, and add sour cream, milk, extracts, and egg. Beat at medium speed of a mixer until blended. Spoon the batter into an 8-inch round cake pan coated with cooking spray.
Combine cream cheese, 2 tablespoons sugar, and egg white; beat at medium speed until blended. Spread evenly over batter; dot with preserves. Top with raspberries. Combine the reserved 1/2 cup flour mixture and almonds. Sprinkle crumb mixture over raspberries. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until cake springs back when touched lightly in center. Cool on a wire rack.
