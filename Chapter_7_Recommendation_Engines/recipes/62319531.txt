This is a recipe from Todd B. a friend and colleague of my husband. Every year he has a gathering of colleagues at this house to make sushi - it is a real sushi banquet, and this spicy Thai soup was a wonderful addition to the delicious assortment of cold sushi, so good that I had to get the recipe and here I share with all of you. It is easy to make and fabulous for any occassion! Thank you Todd!
