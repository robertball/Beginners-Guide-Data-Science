Ingredients:
4 Eggs
1 Cup Sugar
1 1/2 Cup Flour - Unsifted
1/2 Cup Margarine/Butter
2 Tbsl Corn Starch
1/2 Tsp Cardamon - OR
1/2 Tsp Vanilla

Directions:
Beat eggs lightly.
Add sugar & beat lightly, do not over-beat.
Add cooled, melted margarine and flavoring.
Sift flour and corn starch & add to the egg mixture
Dough will be sticky enough to be dropped by spoon.
Pre-heat Krumkake griddle for 7-8 minutes.
Drop a heaping teaspoon of batter in the center of each grid pattern to make full size krumkakes.
Close the lid & hold handles together firmly. Bake until golden brown, approximately 30 seconds.
Roll onto cone & press the seam down onto the hot griddle for a few seconds.
Transfer to a cooling rack and repeat until all batter has been used.
Never use water on the Krumkake Baker. Brush grids with a clean soft brush before storing. Use a wire brush when necessary to keep grooves clean & remove grease build-up.
