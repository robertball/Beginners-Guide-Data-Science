Ingredients:
3/4 cup real bacon bits
1 small red onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
3 cups water
3 Tablespoons chicken bouillon (OR 2 tablespoons chicken bouillon and 1 tablespoon dry ranch mix-my favorite)
10 red potatoes, scrubbed and cubed
1 cup half-and-half cream
2 teaspoons dry parsley
Shredded Cheddar cheese
Chopped green onions

Directions:
Put potatoes in crockpot. Add flour, and toss to coat evenly. Add bacon bits, red onion, garlic, salt, basil, pepper, chicken bouillon, parsley, and water. Cook on low approximately 7-9 hours, or on high 4-5 hours. 15 minutes before serving, add the half and half. Garnish with cheddar cheese and green onions.

Description: 
I love this recipe in my crockpot, especially since there is minimal prep. No bacon to saute, so the crockpot is the only dish you will get dirty. If you have dry ranch mix on hand, I have really enjoyed this variation!Modified from: Baked Potato Soup
