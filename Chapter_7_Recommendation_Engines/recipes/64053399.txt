Ingredients:
8 ounces Cream Cheese
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
CAKE
1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup sugar
1 egg
1/2 cup greek yogurt
zest of one lemon
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
CRUMB TOPPING
1/2 cup flour
1/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoons cold cubed butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare an 8 x 8 inch baking dish by lining it with parchment paper, leaving extra paper hanging over two of the sides. If you don't have parchment paper, grease the pan.
In a medium bowl, stir together cream cheese, sugar, egg, and lemon juice until smooth and creamy. Set aside.
In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
In a medium-large bowl, mix oil and sugar. Add egg and mix well.
Add Greek yogurt, lemon zest and lemon juice. Mix well on medium speed until smooth and creamy.  Gradually add the flour mixture to the batter and mix until incorporated on low speed. Be careful not to over mix.
Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and smooth it out to the edges.
Carefully pour the cream cheese mixture over the top of the batter, spreading it almost to the edges.
In  a medium bowl, add the flour, sugar and cold cubed butter and use a pastry cutter until crumbly with some pea size crumbs.  Sprinkle crumb mixture over the cream cheese layer.
Bake the coffee cake at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes. Allow to cool.
