Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
1 cup plain yogurt
1/4 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups pineapple tidbits in juice, drained and juice reserved
1/3 cup reserved pineapple juice
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
Combine flour, white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Whisk egg, yogurt, canola oil, and vanilla extract in another bowl until smooth. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture until just blended. Add 1/3 cup reserved pineapple juice and fold in pineapple tidbits until batter is just mixed; pour into prepared baking dish.
Stir pecans and remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar in a small bowl; sprinkle over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or completely cool.
