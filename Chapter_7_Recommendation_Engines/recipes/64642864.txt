Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups GF all purpose flour2 tbsp vanilla Vega Protein Powder1/4 cup rolled oats1/4 tsp baking powder1 tsp ground cinnamon1/2 tsp ground nutmeg2 eggs1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce1/4 cup maple syrup1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil1/2 tsp vanilla extract1 red apple, cored and grated (skin on)1/4 cup raw walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350  F.  In a large bowl, combine the flour, protein powder, oats, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In another bowl whisk together the eggs, applesauce, maple syrup, almond milk, olive oil, vanilla, and apple.  Combine the wet and dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Fold in the walnuts.  Spray a standard 12-hole muffin tin with olive oil spray. Pour the batter into the prepared muffin pan. Tap the pan on the counter a few times to remove any air bubbles. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of one of the muffins comes out clean.  Let cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the muffins to loosen them and unmold. Serve warm or at room temperature.
