Ingredients:
1 lb pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
½ large red onion, sliced
1 small yellow onion, diced
3 large cloves garlic, minced fine
¼ cup dry red wine
8 oz portabellas, sliced
½ cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
1 bunch asparagus, sliced 1" on bias
¼ cup black olives, chopped coarse
1 can whole artichoke hearts, quartered
1 lb cased sausage (cooked) or 1 package Tofurkey sliced on bias
16 oz Mascarpone cheese (room temp)
½ cup grated parmesan cheese
¾ cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Bring water to boil, add salt and add pasta when ready; reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining
Meanwhile, sauté onions and garlic in olive oil over medium heat about 6 minutes or until tender, add mushrooms and continue until mushrooms release moisture (about 5 minutes more).
Add red wine and cook until it evaporates.
Add olives, artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, and asparagus along with a little water or stock to allow asparagus to steam until desired crispness.
Add sausage to veggie mixture and warm through.  Add veggie mix to cooked pasta over LOW heat, then gently fold in mascarpone until it melts.  Add parmesan and walnuts.
