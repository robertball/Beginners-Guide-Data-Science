Ingredients:
Dry Rub:
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup kosher salt
1/4 cup paprika
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons black pepper
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
2 racks Smithfield® Extra Tender St. Louis Pork Spareribs, membrane removed
Handful hickory or apple wood chips for smoking, soaked in water and drained (optional)
2 cups your favorite barbecue sauce

Directions:
About 1 hour before smoking, make the dry rub.  Combine all rub ingredients in small bowl; mix well. Generously coat both sides of ribs with rub. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.
Heat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 275 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using.
Place the ribs, meaty side up, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours. Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.
Remove ribs from grill.  Double-wrap each rack in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Return wrapped ribs to the grill and cook for 2 hours more over indirect heat, until very tender. Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill.
Remove ribs from grill and unwrap. Place ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with barbecue sauce.  Cook for about 5 minutes until the sauce is set. Turn ribs and repeat with more sauce.
Serve ribs with remaining barbecue sauce.
