Ingredients:
1 cup diced English cucumbers
1 1/4 teaspoons salt, divided
2 tablespoons diced red onion
1 cup Greek yogurt
1/3 cup chopped Kalamata olives
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon garlic, minced
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups diced cooked chicken
3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/2 cup diced seeded plum tomatoes
1 head Bibb lettuce, or more as needed

Directions:
Place cucumbers in a colander; set onto a plate. Toss cucumbers with 1 teaspoon salt. Let rest to draw about liquid, about 30 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels.
Place red onion and 1 cup cold water in a bowl. Let soak until the strong onion flavor is weakened, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse.
Combine cucumbers, red onions, Greek yogurt, Kalamata olives, dill, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, lemon zest, oregano, and black pepper in a bowl. Fold in chicken, feta cheese, and tomatoes. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate salad for at least 1 hour.
Stir salad and serve on lettuce leaves.
