Description: 
I frantically started searching for recipes when my husband brought home 1 kilo of fresh turmeric root. I found many drink recipes calling for milk, turmeric, and ginger root. I sampled different amounts of each ingredient and feel this is a perfect balance between creamy almond milk, spicy ginger, and the earthy taste of turmeric. This is a less spiced version of Haldi Ka Doodh.
