Description: 
This is a crowd pleaser and the recipe serves twelve. What a coincidence! This is a layered salad that is fun to make and pretty served in a glass bowl. Lots of cornbread, corn, beans, green peppers, spring onions, and crumbled bacon. All layered with a creamy herbed dressing.Modified from: Cornbread Salad I
