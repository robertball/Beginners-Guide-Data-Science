Ingredients:
INGREDIENTS
1 box (9 oz) Green Giant® frozen spinach, thawed, squeezed to drain
1/3 cup garlic-and-herbs spreadable cheese
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (1 oz)
1/4 cup shredded 5-cheese or 6-cheese Italian cheese blend (1 oz)
3 tablespoons freshly grated Pecorino Romano or regular Romano cheese
2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot or onion
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon salt, if desired
1/8 teaspoon pepper, if desired
1 can (8 oz) Pillsbury® refrigerated crescent dinner rolls or 1 can (8 oz) Pillsbury® Crescent Recipe Creations® refrigerated seamless dough sheet
24 paper-thin slices (about 4 inch diameter) smoked ham (from two 9-oz packages)*
Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, if desired

Directions:
Heat oven to 375°F. In medium bowl, mix all ingredients except dough, ham and Parmesan cheese until well blended. Set aside.
Unroll dough. Separate or cut dough into 4 rectangles (if using crescent dough, press perforations to seal). Cut each rectangle into 6 (2-inch) squares. Press 1 square in bottom and up side of each of 24 ungreased mini muffin cups.
Pat each ham slice dry with paper towel. Place 1 ham slice over dough in each cup (edges of ham will be higher than side of cup.) Spoon rounded 1 teaspoon spinach mixture onto ham in center of each cup.
Bake 14 to 18 minutes or until crust is golden brown and filling is hot. To prevent excessive browning of ham, cover lightly with foil after first 5 minutes of baking. Cool in pan 1 minute. Gently remove from pan; let stand 3 minutes. Sprinkle lightly with Parmesan cheese before serving. Serve warm.
