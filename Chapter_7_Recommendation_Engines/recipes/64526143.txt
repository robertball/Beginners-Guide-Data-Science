2 cups uncooked bow tie pasta, or any tube pasta
1/2 pound Italian  sausage links, casings removed

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions.
Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray, cook the sausage, mushrooms and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Stir in the broth, pumpkin, wine, sage, salt, garlic powder and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5-6 minutes or until slightly thickened.
Drain pasta; add to the skillet and heat through. Just before serving, sprinkle with cheese and parsley.
