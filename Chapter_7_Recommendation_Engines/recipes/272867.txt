Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1 (.55 ounce) package instant hot chocolate mix
2 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick Â®)
2 eggs
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon unsweetened baking cocoa
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
cooking spray
3 tablespoons chocolate syrup, or to taste
3 tablespoons whipped cream, or to taste
3 tablespoons miniature marshmallows, or to taste
1 graham cracker, crushed into fine crumbs

Directions:
Whisk milk and hot chocolate together in a large bowl until smooth. Add baking mix, eggs, sugar, cocoa, and vanilla extract; whisk until combined.
Grease a large skillet with cooking spray and set over medium-high heat. Pour in 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the top, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula and continue cooking until golden brown on the edges, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer pancakes to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter.
Drizzle chocolate syrup over pancakes. Top with whipped cream, marshmallows, and graham cracker crumbs.
