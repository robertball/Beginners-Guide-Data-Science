Description: 
This recipe is absolutely delish and much easier than making homemade aioli with egg yolks and olive oil. We use it on chicken sandwiches, fish, with sweet potato fries and much more. Make sure to use fresh ingredients, it makes all the difference! Store in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.
