Ingredients:
1 pkg Manicotti shells (8 oz or about 14 tubes)
3 cups spaghetti or marinara sauce (1 can or jar)
1 cup water
CHEESE FILLING
1 lb Ricotta Cheese
1 lb Mozzerella Cheese, shredded
1 C grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg, beaten
1 pkg frozen chopped spinach, defrosted
1 Tbs minced garlic

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Lightly oil a 9X13 pan.
Mix water with sauce, then pour 1/2 the mixture (about 2 cups) in the prepared pan.  Set aside.
Mix all the cheese filling ingredients well, in a large bowl.
Stuff each shell (UNCOOKED!) with cheese filling and place in the sauced pan.
If any filling remains, keep it for later step.
Pour remaining sauce over the filled shells in pan.
Cover pan with foil and bake 1 hr at 350 F, or until pasta is al dente.
Remove cover, sprinkle top with remaining filling and some parmesan cheese, to your taste.
Return pan to oven and bake until cheeses melt and become bubbly.
Remove stuffed shells with a spatula and serve with green salad and garlic bread.
