1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 egg
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup milk
1 cup mashed bananas

Directions:
Measure flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and chocolate chips into a large bowl.  Mix thoroughly, and make a well in the center.
Beat the  egg in a small bowl until frothy.  Mix in cooking oil, milk, and bananas.  Pour mixture into the well.  Stir only to moisten.  Batter will be lumpy.  Fill greased muffin cups 3/4 full.
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes.
