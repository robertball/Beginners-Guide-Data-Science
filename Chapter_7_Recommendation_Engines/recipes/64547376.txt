Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork sausage
1 can (4 ounces) mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1 small onion, chopped
2 cups biscuit/baking mix
2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese, divided
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup water
3 cups frozen chopped broccoli, thawed and drained
4 large eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
Dash pepper

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook the pork, mushrooms and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. In a large bowl, combine biscuit mix, 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese and water until a soft dough forms.
Press dough onto the bottom and 1/2 in. up the sides of a greased 13x9-in. baking dish. Stir remaining cheddar cheese into the beef mixture; spread over dough. Sprinkle with broccoli.
In a large bowl, beat eggs, milk, salt and pepper. Pour over meat mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 400Â° for 25 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
