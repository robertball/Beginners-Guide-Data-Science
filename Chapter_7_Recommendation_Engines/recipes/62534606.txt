Ingredients:
1 medium acorn squash, halved
2 granny smith apples, cored and halved
2 1/2 tbsp olive oil, divided
1/4 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 tbsp curry powder
2 cups vegetable broth
1 tbsp brown sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Remove seeds and strings from squash and drizzle each half with 3/4 tbsp olive oil. Place on baking tray in oven. Add apples to the tray after 20 minutes and bake squash and apples for 30 minutes.
Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in large stockpot and add garlic and onion. Saute on medium heat for 5 minutes until softened, then add curry powder and cook 2 minutes longer.
Add broth and remaining spices to stock pot, cover, and bring to a simmer.
When squash and apples are tender and cool enough to handle, remove flesh from skins and add to soup pot. Cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly, then transfer to a blender and puree. Add more vegetable broth to thin if needed.
