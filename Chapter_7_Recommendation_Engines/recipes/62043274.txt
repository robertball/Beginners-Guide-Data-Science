Ingredients:
Cake:
2 Cups Sugar
2 Cups Flour
1/4 Cup Cocoa Powder
1/4 tsp. Salt
3/4 Cup Oil
2 Eggs
1/2 Cup Buttermilk
1 tsp. Baking Soda
1 Cup Boiling Water
Icing:
2 cups sugar
1 cup milk
1/2 stick butter
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Sift sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl.  Stir in oil, eggs and buttermilk.  Mix well.  Add the boiling water.  (mixture will be very thin) Pour into a greased and floured 13 X 9 baking pan.  Bake a 350' for 30 minutes.  This is a very moist cake, so it is best to keep it in the baking pan.  Let cool completely and ice.
Mix all together in a boiler pan, bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cook until soft-ball stage. (240' F).  Beat and ice cake.
