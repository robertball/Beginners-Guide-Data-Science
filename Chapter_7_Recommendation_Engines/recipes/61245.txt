1 cup gin
1 1/2 cups ice cubes
2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste

Description: 
A delicious blended ice drink of cantaloupe and gin. This made me one BIG all night drink but divide into 2 or 4 as desired.  Of course you can adjust everything to your liking and blender size. Make sure to use the juiciest and ripest fruit you can get.
