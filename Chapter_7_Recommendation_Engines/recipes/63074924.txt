Ingredients:
2 cups cooked rice (brown or white - use your leftovers!)
2 cups cooked black beans (Make your own or use canned)
2 cups shredded chicken (You can use leftover chicken or cook your own)
1 onion chopped
6 ounces green chilies, fresh or canned (optional)
1 16 oz can of green enchilada sauce (or make your own)
12 corn tortillas, or you can use flour
2 cups shredded cheese

Directions:
Add rice, beans, chicken, onion, chilies and 3/4 of enchilada sauce in a large bowl.
Tear the corn tortillas and put 1/2 of them on the bottom of a 9x13 casserole dish. Cover with 1/2 chicken mixture and put 1/2 of the cheese over. Repeat the process, pouring extra enchilada sauce on top.
Bake in 350 degree oven for 25-30 minutes until cheese is bubbling on top.

Description: 
This is a quick and healthy casserole that makes use of extra beans, rice and chicken in a fun and delicious way. Kids love it and they can help make it because the tortillas are shredded rather than rolled. It is easy to make and freezes well and can be made in large quantities. We serve it at school as part of our healthy lunch program and the kids love it!
