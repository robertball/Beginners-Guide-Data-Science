Ingredients:
8 c. water or veggie stock
6 c. peeled and cubed butternut squash or Japanese pumpkin
1 large white onion, sliced
1 leek, sliced thin
1 T. peeled and minced fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 T. curry powder
1 T. fresh thyme leaves
2 bay leaves
1 pkg. Mori-Nu Silken tofu, cubed
1/4 c. white or yellow miso
chopped fresh chives or parsley
ground pepper

Directions:
Bring ingredients except tofu and miso to a boil in a large pot.  Once boiling cook over medium heat for 30 minutes.  Let cool.
Add tofu and miso. Puree well in blender or food processor.
Serve with chopped chives or parsley.
Note: I often roast the veggies first at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes or till soft, then cook with the water or stock and herbs for an additional 30.  After adding the tofu and miso, I rewarm the soup (or individual bowls of it).
