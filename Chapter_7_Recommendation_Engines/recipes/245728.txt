Ingredients:
2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 onion, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1 tablespoon curry powder
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated
2 bay leaves
1 (16 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pound ground beef
2 cups frozen peas

Directions:
Melt ghee in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds; stir until fragrant and starting to crackle, about 1 minute. Stir in onion, jalapeno pepper, curry, garlic, ginger, and bay leaves. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion starts to soften, about 5 minutes.
Pour tomatoes into the skillet; stir to combine, about 2 minutes. Add chili powder, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and salt; stir thoroughly. Add beef; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up the meat, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until flavors combine, about 15 minutes. Add frozen peas, cover, and simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes. For a thicker consistency, increase heat to medium and simmer curry, uncovered, until sauce reduces, about 5 minutes.
