Ingredients:
For the dough:
3/4 cup milk
2 Tbs lemon juice
1 large egg + 1 egg yolk
2 tsp active dry yeast
Grated lemon zest from 1 lemon
2 Tbs sugar
1 Tbs poppyseeds
1-1/4 tsp salt
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
For the filling:
1/2 cup seedless raspberry jam
For the glaze:
1/2 cup confectioner's sugar
1/2 Tbs milk
1/2 Tbs lemon juice
1/4 tsp vanilla

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine first seven ingredients. Then stir in salt, 2 cups of flour, and butter. Work in as much remaining flour as need to pull dough from sides of bowl. Turn out onto a floured surface until dough is smooth and elastic, adding more flour as necessary.
Place in lightly greased bowl; cover and let rise for 1hr or until doubled in size.
Gently deflate dough and roll into a 12x10 rectangle. Spread with 1/2 cup seedless raspberry jam, leaving 1/2 inch around the edge bare. Roll up jelly-roll style from the long side and seal. Carefully slice log into 12 pieces and place cut-side down in a greased 8x8 square pan. Cover and let rise for 40-45 minutes or until puffy.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350F.
When rolls are risen, place pan in the middle of the oven and bake for about 30 minutes or until lightly browned on top. Make glaze by stirring together ingredients and drizzle over warm rolls.

Description: 
Lemon-poppyseed dough filled with seedless raspberry jam rolled up cinnamon-roll style and topped with a lemon glaze. I came up with this as a compromise for an Easter treat when my daughter wanted lemon-poppyseed cake, my son wanted cinnamon rolls, and I wanted something with raspberry.
