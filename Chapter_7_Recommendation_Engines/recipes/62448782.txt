Ingredients:
1 cup long grain white rice
1 tablespoon extra light olive oil
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, finely chopped
2-3 fresh serranos finely chopped
2-3 chopped garlic cloves
1 can of fire roasted tomatoes (drain & reserve liquid)
and double strength low sodium chicken broth to equal 1 1/2 cup when measured with the reserved tomato liquid
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 teaspoon Mexican oregano
Fresh ground pepper to taste
Fresh limes to squeeze on top

Directions:
In a medium sauce pan, cook rice in oil over medium heat for about 3 minutes. In another pan, saute the onion, peppers, and garlic. Into the pan in which you browned the rice, pour in the reserved tomato juice, and the low sodium double strength chicken broth and bring to a boil. Stir in the canned tomatoes and your sauteed veggies. Season with pepper, cumin, and Mexican oregano. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook for 20 minutes. When finished add the fresh chopped cilantro and stir in.  Serve immediately.  Top with a squeeze of fresh lime.

Description: 
This is an excellent authentic Mexican rice recipe (not to be confused with Spanish rice) that I make as a side dish with all of my Mexican dishes. The key is cooking the rice properly and using good quality chicken broth or stock. 
I just tweaked this original recipe which was excellent to begin with.  I like my food spicier and I also think Serrano chilies have a nicer and less hot in your mouth quality than jalapenos. The squeeze of lime at the end makes all the flavours come alive!Modified from: Mexican Rice III
