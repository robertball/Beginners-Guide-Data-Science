Ingredients:
Marinade:
3 tablespoons teriyaki sauce
3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon toasted sesame-ginger spice (such as Victoria Taylor'sÂ®)
1 pinch sesame seeds (optional)
1 1/2 pounds salmon fillets, cut into cubes
2 medium green bell peppers, cut into large chunks
1 large onion, cut into chunks
1 pint cherry tomatoes, or to taste
8 skewers, soaked

Directions:
Combine teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, lemon juice, olive oil, honey, garlic powder, sesame-ginger spice, and sesame seeds in a large glass bowl. Add salmon, bell peppers, onion, and cherry tomatoes to the marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Thread salmon, bell peppers, onion, and tomatoes onto skewers and place on the prepared baking sheet. Cover wooden skewer ends with aluminum foil.
Bake skewers in the preheated oven just until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes.
