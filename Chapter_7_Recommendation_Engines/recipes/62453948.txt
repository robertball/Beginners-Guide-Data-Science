Ingredients:
Rolls:
1-1/2 cups warm water (100° to 110°F)
1 envelope Active Dry Yeast
1/3 cup nonfat dry milk
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon Vanilla extract
1 egg, beaten
5 to 5-3/4 cups bread flour
Caramel Pecan Mixture:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup Light Corn Syrup
3 tablespoons heavy cream
1 to 1-1/2 cups chopped pecans, toasted*
Cinnamon Filling:
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoons Ground Cinnamon

Directions:
For Rolls: Dissolve yeast in warm water, in a large mixing bowl; let rest 2 to 3 minutes. Add dry milk, butter, sugar, salt, vanilla and egg; mix well. Gradually add in enough flour to make a soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to coat. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place, about 1 to 1-1/2 hours, until doubled in bulk.
While dough is rising, make Caramel Pecan Mixture: Combine butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, and cream in a small, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and boil for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and pour an equal amount of hot syrup into two 8 x 8-inch greased pans. Sprinkle toasted pecans on top of syrup. Set aside.
Punch dough down. Roll out onto a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin to a 16 x 12-inch rectangle. To apply Cinnamon Filling, spread 1/4 cup butter over surface. Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over dough. Roll up jellyroll style. Slice into 8 rolls.
Place 4 rolls, cut side down, in each of the 2 pans, on top of Caramel Pecan Mixture. Cover and let rolls rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden. Remove from oven and let stand 5 minutes. Invert rolls on to serving plate or parchment paper.
