Ingredients:
2 Black tea bags
4t Condensed milk

Directions:
Put the tea bags into a glass of hot water, steam the tea until the color turns dark red, discard the tea bags, and let the tea cool.
Put 5 to 6 pieces of ice into a glass/cup, put in the condensed milk and honey, then pour in the tea. Mix it well.(The ice may melt if the tea is still warm, so you can add a couple more pieces of ice.
Then a strong flavorful milk tea is ready for you to enjoy.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe myself after reading many Chinese posts, none of them sounded like the milk tea I have had before. Honey milk tea is what I always have if I actually order milk tea when I go to a tea place. Technically, bubble tea is not much different from milk tea, although I am not sure why they separate them into two different categories in the tea shop. There are also different styles of bubble/milk tea, like Hongkong style, Taiwan style, etc. The one I am sharing is similar to Hongkong style.
