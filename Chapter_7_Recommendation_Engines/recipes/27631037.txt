Ingredients:
4 teaspoons canola oil
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 pounds peeled baking potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch-thick strips
Cooking spray
2 tablespoons butter
8 garlic cloves, minced (about 5 teaspoons)
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°.
Combine first 3 ingredients in a large zip-top plastic bag, tossing to coat. Arrange potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Bake at 400° for 50 minutes or until potatoes are tender and golden brown, turning after 20 minutes.
Place butter and garlic in a large nonstick skillet, and cook over low heat 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add potatoes, parsley, and Parmesan cheese to pan; toss to coat. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Best Potato Dish. An enormously popular story with readers, Out of the Frying Pan Into the Oven appeared in April 2002. In it we lightened many popular and traditionally fat-laden foods. These fries stand out. First, they're roasted at high heat until crisp and golden. Then you toss them in melted butter, shredded Parmesan cheese, and chopped fresh parsley for a tasty finishing touch.
