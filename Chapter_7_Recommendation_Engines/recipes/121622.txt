Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
2 tablespoons finely chopped green pepper
1 garlic clove, minced
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (4 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced ripe olives, drained

Directions:
In a skillet, cook the beef, onion, green pepper and garlic over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain and set aside. In a saucepan, bring tomato sauce and Italian seasoning to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir 1/2 cup into the meat mixture; keep remaining sauce warm. Unroll pizza crust on a floured surface. Roll into a 12-in. square; cut into four squares. Spread cream cheese over each to within 1/2 in. of edges. Top with meat mixture. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and olives. Fold dough over filling, forming a triangle; press edges with a fork to seal. Place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Serve with the remaining sauce.

A friend gave this recipe to me at my wedding shower. I realized then and there that I'd better learn how to cook! My husband loves these hand-held pizzas.--Laronda Warrick, Parker, Kansas
