Ingredients:
4 bananas, peeled and halved lengthwise
1/2 cup peanut butter
2 egg yolks
2/3 cup white sugar, divided
1/4 cup white vinegar
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Spread peanut butter onto the cut side of the banana halves, and seal the halves back together. Slice into coins, and set aside.
In a saucepan over low heat, whisk together the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar. Stir in the vinegar and butter. Cook, whisking constantly until clear. Whisk in remaining sugar if you like.
Place the bananas into a serving bowl, and pour the sauce over them. This dish may be served hot or cold.

Description: 
A neighbor introduced me to this southern sweet and sour banana dish.  It was quite a hit.  I made a couple of improvements (to my tastebuds) and thought I should share it.
