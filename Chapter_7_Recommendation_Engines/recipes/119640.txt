Ingredients:
12 slices bacon, diced
12 eggs, lightly beaten
salt and pepper to taste
10 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions

Directions:
In a skillet, cook bacon until crisp; remove to paper towels.  Drain, reserving 1-2 tablespoons drippings.  Add eggs, salt and pepper to drippings; cook and stir over medium heat until the eggs are completely set.
Spoon about 1/4 cup of egg mixture down the center of each tortilla; sprinkle with cheese, onions and bacon.  Fold bottom and sides of tortilla over filling.  Wrap each in waxed paper and aluminum foil.  Freeze for up to 1 month.
To use frozen burritos:  Remove foil.  Place waxed paper-wrapped burritos on a microwave-safe plate.  Microwave at 60% power for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes or until heated through.  Let stand for 20 seconds.

In Aberdeen, South Dakota, Audra Niederman steers clear of hunger without hitting the brakes - she simply zaps one of these frozen morning morsels in the microwave. 'This is my family's favorite combination, but try replacing the bacon with cooked breakfast sausage,' she suggests.
