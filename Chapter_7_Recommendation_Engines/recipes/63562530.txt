Ingredients:
1 3/4 cup oats
3 Egg whites
3/4 cup	Unsweetened cocoa
1/2 cup	Unsweetened applesauce
1 tsp Vanilla extract
1/2 cup	Plain greek yogurt (or regular plain low fat yogurt)
1/2 tsp	Cream of tartar (or 2 tsp. vinegar)
1 1/2 tsp Baking powder
1 1/2 tsp Baking soda
1/4 tsp	Salt
1 cup Hot water
1/2 cup	Baking stevia OR 1 cup sweetener of choice that measures like sugar 1
1/2 cup	Semi-sweet chocolate chips
Tip: Foil cupcake liners, remove the inner paper lining (because paper liners tend to stick to muffins!)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with foil cupcake liners, or spray muffin tin with non-stick cooking spray. Set aside.
In a blender, (or food processor), mix all of the ingredients together, except for the chocolate chips. Blend until oats are ground and mixture is smooth.
Place mixture in a bowl and gently stir in 1/2 of the chocolate chips (set the rest aside). Scoop mixture into prepared muffin pans.
Place muffins tins in the oven for 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes, remove muffins from the oven (but donâ€™t shut oven off), and distribute the other half of the chocolate chips on top of each muffin.
Place the muffins back into the oven and bake for an additional 2-5 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
