Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
1/4 cup millet
1/2 cup water
1/4 small onion, chopped (optional)
1/2 lime, juiced
1 small clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 leaves butter lettuce
1 carrot, chopped

Directions:
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; add millet and cook until toasted and fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Add water, cover, and simmer until most of the water is absorbed, about 10 minutes.
Stir onion, lime juice, garlic, cilantro, and salt into millet; cook and stir until heated through and liquid is completely absorbed, about 5 minutes more. Cool millet mixture for 3 minutes.
Divide chopped carrot among butter lettuce leaves. Spoon millet mixture over carrots.
