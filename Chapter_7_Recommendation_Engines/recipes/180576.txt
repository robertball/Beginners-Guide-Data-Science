Ingredients:
1/4 cup dates, pitted and chopped
1 small apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
2 tablespoons chopped dried apricots
2 tablespoons raisins
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 tablespoon orange juice
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon ground mace
2 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the dates, apple, apricots, raisins, orange zest, and orange juice in a small bowl. Season with cayenne pepper, cardamom, and mace; mix well.
Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Mound the fruit filling on the flattened breasts and roll up, tucking in the ends. Secure the chicken with toothpicks.
Heat the vegetable oil in an oven proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts, and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Place in the preheated oven, and continue cooking the chicken breasts until the filling is hot and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
