Ingredients:
•	3 tbsp sunflower seeds
•	Salt
•	1 tbsp sesame seeds
•	1 tbsp flax seeds
•	1 tbsp butter
•	4 oz (100g) Mozzarella Cheese, thinly sliced
•	freshly ground black pepper
•	4 eggs
Alongside
•	4 bacon slices
•	toast bread
•	fresh chives for garnish

Directions:
To prepare the bacon, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or foil, then lay the 4 bacon strips flat, making sure pieces do not overlap. Bake until crisp and browned, 15 to 18 minutes, or desired doneness. Transfer strips to a paper towel to drain & cool. If you are only cooking 1 pound of bacon you can use 2 baking sheets.
Place sunflower seeds and salt into a hot dry skillet, on medium heat and let them toast stirring from time to time so they don't burn.
Add sesame seeds and flax seeds and give them a stir. Immediately add butter and let it melt.
Add Mozzarella slices and stir to combine. Let the cheese begin to melt in the butter.
Add whole eggs and gently stir (then turn off the heat but leave on the burner) and cook until slightly underdone. Remove from heat. The eggs will continue to cook in the hot skillet. Add freshly ground black pepper.
Serve with toast bread, bacon slices, greens, whatever works better for you. Bread and bacon can be made before preparing the eggs.
