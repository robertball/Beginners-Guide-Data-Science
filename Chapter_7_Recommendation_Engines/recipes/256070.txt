Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raw mixed nuts
4 cups water
1 tablespoon honey (optional)
1 pinch salt (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spread nuts onto baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes; shake the baking sheet to flip the nuts. Continue baking until toasted, about 5 minutes more. Turn off the oven but leave the nuts in the oven until slightly cooled, about 10 minutes.
Transfer nuts to a large bowl and top with water. Cover bowl and let soak for 30 minutes.
Remove nuts from soaking water using a slotted spoon, reserving the soaking water. Place nuts in a blender; add 1 cup soaking water. Blend on low for 30 seconds. Add 1 cup soaking water and blend again for 1 minute. Add the remaining soaking water and blend on medium for 30 seconds. Allow nut milk to rest for 10 minutes.
Pour nut milk through a sieve or a nut bag into a glass container. Stir honey and salt into nut milk. Cover container and store in the refrigerator.
