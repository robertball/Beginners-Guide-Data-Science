Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or butter/margarine blend at room temperature
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup Splenda
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp lemon juice
3/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 milled flax seed
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp cloves
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips (optional)
3 medium bananas, mashed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grease a 9x5 loaf pan.
Cream together the butter, brown sugar, and Splenda. Add the eggs, vanilla, and lemon juice and mix well. In a separate bowl combine all dry ingredients. Stir into the butter mixture until smooth. Add yogurt, mashed bananas, walnuts, and chocolate chips and stir until just blended. Pour into greased loaf pan. Sprinkle some chopped walnuts and mini chocolate chips on top of the batter.
Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Let the loaf cool for ten minutes in the pan before removing it. Transfer it to a wire cookie rack and allow it to cool completely before slicing.
