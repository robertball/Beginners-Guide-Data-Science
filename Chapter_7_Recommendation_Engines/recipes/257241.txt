Ingredients:
Cake:
3 cups milk
1 (4.6 ounce) package cook and serve vanilla pudding mix
2 large carrots, grated
3/4 cup raisins, divided
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice
1 (15.25 ounce) package carrot cake mix
1 (5 ounce) package glazed pecans, divided
Frosting:
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bring milk to a boil in a saucepan, stirring constantly. Pour in pudding mix and remove saucepan from heat. Stir in grated carrots, 1/2 cup raisins, cinnamon, and allspice. Cool mixture until lukewarm, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in carrot cake mix to form a thick batter.
Pour batter into the prepared pan. Scatter 2 tablespoons raisins and half of the pecans on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
Combine confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat until frosting smooth. Spread frosting over cooled cake. Top with remaining raisins and pecans.

Description: 
This recipe puts a delightful carrot cake spin on a traditional hornet's nest cake, which takes the flavor of the cake and bakes it into the consistency of a brownie or bread pudding. Cut into small, bite-sized squares for a crowd-pleasing party dessert or just grab a fork and dig in straight from the baking dish, I'm not here to judge!
