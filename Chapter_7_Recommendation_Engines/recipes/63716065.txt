Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts
1/4 c goat cheese
1/8 c roasted red pepper diced
1/8 c pecans chopped
1 clove garlic minced
8 slices pancetta
salt
pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment, foil or silpat.  Rinse and trim the chicken breasts then lay top side down on a cutting board.  From the thinner end take a sharp knife parallel to the cutting board and divide the breast into two halves (one will be two thirds the size).  Now you have four cutlets, place each one inside two pieces of plastic wrap.  Using a mallet pound the breasts until they are 1/4" thick evenly.
Mix together the goat cheese, red peppers, pecans and garlic.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Lay each breast on top of two overlapped slices of pancetta then distribute the cheese mixture evenly onto each breast.  Roll each breast tightly and place open end down on the baking sheet.  Season each roll with salt and pepper.
Bake for 20-25 minutes or until internal temp reaches 165 degrees.
