Ingredients:
3/4 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons butter
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
1 1/2 cups small curd cottage cheese
1 egg, beaten
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of shrimp soup, undiluted
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
1/2 cup white wine or chicken broth
1/2 cup milk
2 (8 ounce) packages imitation crabmeat, flaked
1 (6 ounce) can small shrimp, rinsed and drained
9 lasagna noodles, cooked and drained
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute onion in butter until tender. Reduce heat. Add cream cheese; cook and stir until melted and smooth. Stir in cottage cheese, egg, basil, salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a bowl, combine the soups, wine or broth, milk, crab and shrimp.
Arrange three noodles in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Spread with a third of cottage cheese mixture and a third of the seafood mixture. Repeat layers twice. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle with the Monterey Jack cheese. Bake 10 minutes longer or until cheese is melted and lasagna is bubbly. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Everyone seems to enjoy this dish. I like to prepare it the day before and refrigerate it overnight. Just take it out of the fridge 30 minutes before popping it in the oven. --Viola Walmer, Tequesta, Florida
