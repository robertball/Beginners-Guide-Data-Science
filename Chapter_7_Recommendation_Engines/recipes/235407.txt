Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups water
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 beef bouillon cube
1 cup rice
1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried cilantro

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir water, black beans, cumin, and beef bouillon cube into the onion and garlic mixture; bring to a boil, add rice, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the moisture is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Gently stir Creole seasoning and cilantro into the beans and rice.

Description: 
This is a recipe I use in lieu of kidney beans and rice because I just happen to love the flavor of black beans. We never have leftovers of this side dish!
