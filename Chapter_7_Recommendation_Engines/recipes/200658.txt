Ingredients:
2 (16.3 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury®)
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
3 (5 ounce) cans tuna (such as Chicken of the Sea®), drained
1/4 cup mayonnaise (such as Best Foods®)
1/8 teaspoon whole grain mustard
1 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon ground cumin
1 head lettuce, leaves rinsed and dried

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place biscuit dough on a baking sheet, about 1 to 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 11 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and allow the biscuits to cool.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and cook the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the skillet and dice into 1/2 inch cubes.
Mix tuna, mayonnaise, and mustard in a bowl until combined. Stir in white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and cumin. Reserve 1/4 of the tuna mixture in a separate bowl. Combine the remaining 3/4 portion of the tuna mixture with the chicken. Split each biscuit in half and place over a bed of lettuce leaves. Divide chicken and tuna mixture on top of each biscuit half. Use the remaining 1/4 portion of the tuna mixture as a garnish on the lettuce leaves.

Description: 
This is a recipe that was posted down from my family in Mississippi. Although I live in New York City, I still enjoy all the southern foods. Served best with a light wine or beer, or a very light but sweet fruit juice (pineapple-grapefruit is best).
