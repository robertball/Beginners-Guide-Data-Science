Description: 
I make this recipe pretty much weekly now.  My hubby loves it for breakfast because he doesn't get the morning hungries later.  I replaced half of the almonds with walnuts, eliminated the sunflower seeds and just use all flax seed instead of wheat germ.  I doubled up on the spices too and since I always have raisins and cranberries in my pantry, that all the fruit I use.  I also added some vanilla and salt to balance out the flavor and increased the baking time to make it crunchier.Modified from: Fruit 'n' Honey Granola
