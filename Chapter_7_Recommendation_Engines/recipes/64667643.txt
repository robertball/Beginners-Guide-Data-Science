Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1/4 onion, chopped fine
1 c hot water
2 c milk
1 1/2 c elbow macaroni (or egg noodles)
1 c cheddar cheese (shredded, plus more for topping, if desired)
SAUCE “PACKET” mix together:
1 tsp cornstarch
2 tsp paprika
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp garlic
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar

Directions:
Brown ground beef in a large skillet, typical seasonings (garlic, onion, Lowery’s, pepper) and onions towards end.  Drain and return to pan.
Add hot water, milk, pasta and "sauce packet" ingredients (optional add Worcestershire, cayenne)
Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer 12 minutes or until pasta is tender.
In the last few minutes of cook time, add cheese, stir and re-cover.
When pasta is tender and cheese is melted, remove heat and uncover.
Let stand about 5 minutes. Sauce will thicken as it stands.
Top with additional cheese if you like.
