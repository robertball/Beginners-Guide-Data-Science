Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) bag rippled potato chips (such as Lay'sÂ® Wavy)
3 (9.5 ounce) packages milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Roll a rolling pin over the bag of potato chips until very fine crumbs form.
Heat chocolate chips in a pot over medium-low heat until melted, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove pot from stove and stir in potato chips. Spoon mixture into miniature muffin cups and arrange cups on a baking sheet. Refrigerate until set, about 15 minutes. Store in an air-tight container.

Nothing could be more simple, and trust me, not too many things are more delicious. A perfect combination of sweet and salty! They freeze well too! So so yummy!
