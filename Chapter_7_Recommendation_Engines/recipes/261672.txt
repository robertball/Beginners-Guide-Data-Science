Ingredients:
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 egg
3 tablespoons water
3 tablespoons strawberry jam
1 (8 ounce) jar guava paste, or as desired

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly flour a baking sheet.
Roll puff pastry into a thin sheet on a floured surface. Cut into squares about the length of your hand and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Beat egg and water together in a bowl;  brush each pastry square with egg wash. Stab each square a few times with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool at least 10 minutes.
Mix guava paste and jam together in a bowl until smooth.
Cut a large, vertical slit into each pastry. Spread 1 tablespoon guava mixture into each slit, making sure guava doesn't squeeze out when closed.
