Ingredients:
3 heads of market fresh lettuce mix, I recommend Romaine, Red Leaf and Spinach Leaves. Torn by hand.
2 bunches of green onions, chopped
1 cucumber, peeled and chopped
1/2 lb bacon
3/4 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup water
TBSP granulated Sugar
1/2 cup Blue Cheese Crumbles
6 Hard Boiled Eggs for garnish

Directions:
Wash all the lettuce mixture and set aside to drain.
In a heavy skillet fry the bacon until crispy.  Remove from the heat and drain on paper towels. Crush the bacon into bits.
Add the vinegar, water and sugar to the bacon drippings and reduce by half.  Turn off heat.
Mix the garden greens with the cucumber, crushed bacon bits, green onion and blue cheese. Toss all together to mix ingredients.
Finally pour the warm bacon dressing over the garden greens and toss to cover all evenly. Add the hard boiled eggs sliced to garnish salad.
Serve Immediately
