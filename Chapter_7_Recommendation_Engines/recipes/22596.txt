Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/3 cup HERSHEY®'S Cocoa Powder
2/3 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs, separated
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup milk
2/3 cup ground almonds
1/4 cup water
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 cup HERSHEY®'S MINI CHIPS™ Semisweet Chocolate
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 F.  Generously grease and flour 2 heart-shaped or 9-inch round baking pans.
In small saucepan, melt 1/4 cup butter.  Remove from heat; stir in cocoa.  In large bowl, beat 2/3 cup butter and 1 cup sugar until creamy.  Add chocolate mixture, egg yolks, vanilla and almond extracts; beat until blended.  Gradually add flour, salt and milk; beat until well blended.  Stir in almonds.
In medium bowl, beat egg whites until foamy; gradually add remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, beating just until soft peaks form.  Gently fold into chocolate mixture.  Pour batter evenly into prepared pans.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool 10 minutes (cake will settle slightly); remove from pans to wire racks.  Cool completely.
Place one cake layer on serving plate; spoon half of glaze over layer.  Top with second layer.  Spread top and sides with remaining glaze.  Cool until glaze is set.  Garnish as desired.  10 to 12 servings.
Smooth and Glossy Chocolate Chip Glaze:  In small saucepan, combine 1/4 cup water and 3 tablespoons sugar.  Heat to boiling, stirring until sugar is dissolved.  Remove from heat; stir in 1 cup Mini Chips and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.  Beat with whisk or spoon until chips are melted.  Use immediately.
