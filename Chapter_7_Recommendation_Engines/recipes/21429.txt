Ingredients:
2 cups dry pancake mix
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 eggs
1 cup applesauce
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together pancake mix and cinnamon.  Make a well in the center of the pancake mix. Add the eggs, applesauce, lemon juice and milk; stir until smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.

Description: 
This was passed down from my mother. I don't know where she got it, but it was always a special request at brunches. Serve with maple syrup or apple butter.
