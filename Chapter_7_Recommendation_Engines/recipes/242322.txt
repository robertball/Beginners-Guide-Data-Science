Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons bacon-flavored mayonnaise (such as BaconnaiseÂ®)
6 jalapeno pepper, halved lengthwise
12 slices bacon
12 toothpicks (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix cream cheese and bacon-flavored mayonnaise together in a bowl. Fill each jalapeno pepper half with cream cheese mixture. Wrap each filled pepper with a bacon slice, securing with a toothpick if needed. Arrange peppers in a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp and peppers are tender, about 1 hour. Transfer peppers to a serving plate and allow to cool, 3 to 5 minutes.
