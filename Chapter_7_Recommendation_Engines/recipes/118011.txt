Ingredients:
3 pounds boneless country-style pork ribs
1 cup water
1 cup ketchup
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon celery seed
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
Dash pepper

Directions:
Place ribs in a shallow roasting pan. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour 1 cup sauce over ribs, turn to coat. Let stand for 15 minutes.
Grill ribs, uncovered, over medium heat for 10-12 minutes, basting with 1 cup sauce and turning occasionally. Serve with remaining sauce.
