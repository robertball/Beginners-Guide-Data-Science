Ingredients:
1 med carrot, peeled
1/2 large red bell pepper
1/2 large onion
8 oz package mushrooms (about 9 mushrooms)
2 cloves peeled garlic
^^blend the above in a food processor until small uniform pieces. About the size of cracked wheat.
Put in large bowl.
Add 1 can black bean that have been drained and rinsed to the food processor.
Add 2 T ketchup
2t onion powder
1t garlic powder
1/2-1t liquid smoke
3t browning sauce
2t kosher salt
1t black pepper
1 c cooked brown rice
1 1/2 c uncooked oats

Directions:
Blend until almost smooth but still a few chunks. Add to bowl of veggies. Add about 1 cup oatmeal and mix with hand all ingredients. Add 1c cooked brown rice. I added more oats as I mixed until the mixture was still moist but tight. I then covered and left on the counter for a 1/2 hour. After 30 min. I mixed again and with a large icecream scoop put mix on a silpad lined baking sheet. My recipe made 9 good sized veggie balls. With a spatula dipped in water, I pressed the balls into patties about a 1/4 inch thick. I then put the trays in the freezer and let freeze for about 30 min. Until hard. Took out and put in individual sandwich bags.
When ready to eat, just heat a nonstick pan on med. Heat and brown on both sides. Don't turn until they have a good brown on the first side. Hope you enjoy!
