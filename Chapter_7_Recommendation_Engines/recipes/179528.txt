Ingredients:
1 head cabbage, finely chopped
6 tablespoons margarine
1 onion, minced
1/2 pound processed cheese food (such as Velveeta Â®), cut into chunks
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
3/4 cup bread crumbs
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the cabbage into a large pot with enough lightly salted water to cover; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
Melt the margarine in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the onion in the melted butter until golden. Reduce the heat to low; add the cheese food and allow to simmer until completely melted. Pour the mushroom soup into the skillet. Stir the drained cabbage, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper into the mixture. Transfer to a 2-quart casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese begins to bubble, 20 to 30 minutes.
