Ingredients:
4 eggs
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon anise extract
4 cups cake flour
1 tablespoon baking powder

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat eggs with sugar until thick and pale, about 10 minutes. Stir in the anise extract. Sift together the flour and baking powder; fold into the egg mixture. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
Divide dough into 3 parts. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Flour a springerle mold or rolling pin, and press the design into the dough. Cut apart the cookies and place them 1 inch apart onto a greased cookie sheet. Cover with a towel and let stand overnight.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Dust excess flour from cookies.
Bake for 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, until bottoms are lightly browned. Cool and store in an airtight container for up to 2 months.

Description: 
Soft at first, these cookies harden into 'dunkers' after about 3 weeks. (Yes, they keep a long time!)  They need a mold for the traditional Pennsylvania Dutch cookie, but I bet that they can be made by simply cutting them out. You can substitute other flavorings for anise - lemon and almond are good.
