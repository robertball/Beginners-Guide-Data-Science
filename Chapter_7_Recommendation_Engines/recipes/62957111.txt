Ingredients:
1 eggs, lightly beaten
1 c milk
1/4 cup applesauce
1 c milk
1 cups fine cornmeal
1 cup flour
1 cup gluten free flour
4 drops cup stevia
4 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12 muffin pan.
Whisk together the eggs, applesauce and milk in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside. Stir together the cornmeal, flour, stevia, baking powder and salt in a separate large bowl, and make a well in the center. Pour the liquid mixture into the well and stir just until combined.
Pour the batter into the prepared muffin pan and bake in the preheated oven until golden and the top springs back when lightly pressed, about 25minutes.
