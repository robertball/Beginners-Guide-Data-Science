Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir ground beef until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in Cheddar cheese and onion soup mix.
Divide crescent roll dough into triangles along perforated edges. Place 1 tablespoonful beef mixture onto each triangle; roll dough over meat and transfer crescent rolls to a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
