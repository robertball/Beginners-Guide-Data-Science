½ cup pumpkin puree
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Description: 
I don't normally drink pumpkin spice lattes, but when I do, I make my own and don't drop 5 dollars at the corner coffee stand. And this version, with a spicy kick, actually has pumpkin in it! Cooking the pumpkin and the spices in the saucepan eliminates any raw squash flavor and makes the spices toastier. And the black pepper gives this latte a nice kick.
