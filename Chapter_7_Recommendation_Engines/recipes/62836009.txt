Description: 
Emeril Lagasse recipe that he uses with lamb but I changed to ground beef.  Sauce needs to simmer for 2 hrs. Uses onions, carrots, garlic and celery with canned tomatoes and tomato paste.  I thought this made a good sauce although it was not spicy (maybe I didn't use enough red pepper).
