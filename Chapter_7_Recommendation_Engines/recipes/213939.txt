Ingredients:
3 parsnips, peeled and cubed
2 potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1/4 cup fat free evaporated milk
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the parsnips and potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
Place the vegetables into a food processor, and process until smooth. Add the milk and horseradish; season to taste with salt and pepper. Process until mixed.

Description: 
The puree was smooth and tasted very rich, even though it wasn't. The horseradish gives a little kick that comes in right behind the sweetness of the parsnips.
