Ingredients:
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/4 cup water
4 tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
6 cucumbers, peeled and thinly sliced
3 shallots, thinly sliced
2 Thai bird's eye chiles, halved lengthwise

Directions:
Combine vinegar, water, sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil and cook until sugar and salt are dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning so the pickling liquid is pleasantly sweet, sour, and lightly salty.
Combine cucumbers, shallots, and chile peppers in a large bowl. Cover with pickling liquid. Refrigerate for a few hours to let flavors combine.
