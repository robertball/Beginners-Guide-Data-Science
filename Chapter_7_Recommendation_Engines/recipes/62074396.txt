Ingredients:
1 cup cooked rice (I use jasmine or arborio)
1/2 cup sugar
2 TBSP honey
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup heavy cream, whipped
RASPBERRY SAUCE
1 tbsp cornstarch
1/2 c sugar
1/4 c water
1 10 oz. pkg frozen raspberries
1 tbsp lemon juice

Directions:
Cook the rice per rice package directions, cool slightly. Stir in sugar, honey  and almond extract. Chill for at least 30 minutes. I like to chill it for about 1 hour. Whip your heavy cream, and fold cream into the rice mixture. To make the sauce, mix starch and sugar in saucepan, add water. Stir smooth, then add other ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer to thicken. Spoon sauce over serving of pudding, or simply enjoy the pudding by itself!!
