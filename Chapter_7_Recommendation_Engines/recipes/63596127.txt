Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 cup half-and-half
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher or sea salt

2 cloves finely chopped garlic
3 cups freshly grated sharp white cheddar cheese
4 lbs russet potatoes, peeled and cut into eighths lengthwise (like wedge fries)

Directions:
Place cream, half-and-half, salt, pepper, leeks and garlic in a heavy sauce pan and bring to a simmer over medium high heat.
Add cheese until melted.
Fold in potatoes and mix.
Spread potato mixture evenly in a 9x12 baking dish prepared with non-stick cooking spray.
Cover tightly with foil and bake at 350Â°F for 45 minutes.
Remove foil and bake 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender.

Description: 
I make these very scrumptious but rich potatoes for Easter, and then mix the leftovers with the leftover ham to make a second rich meal.  That'll do you for the year!
