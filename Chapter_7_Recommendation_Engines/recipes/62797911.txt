Ingredients:
3/4 cup (170 grams) raw wheat berries
4 cups water
1 tsp honey
1 cup reserved wheat berry water (110* - 120*F)
2 Tbsp active dry yeast
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup (60 grams) butter, melted and cooled
3 cups (430 grams) stone ground whole wheat flour
2 cups (280 grams) unbleached high gluten bread flour
1/2 cup (80 grams) raw sunflower seeds
1/3 cup (50 grams) uncooked oats
1 Tbsp salt
Vegetable oil for oiling bowl
Vegetable spray for oiling the bread pans

Directions:
Place wheat berries in a sauce pan w/4 cups water.  Heat to boil then simmer for 1 hour.  Pour off excess water and reserve 1 cup of liquid for future use.  Allow wheat berries to cool and set aside.
Stir whole-wheat flour, unbleached flour, and salt in a large bowl. Set aside.
Stir together reserved wheat berry water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon honey in a small bowl; let stand until foamy, 5 minutes.
Stir yeast mixture, melted butter, and remaining honey into cooled wheat berries.
Add wheat berry mixture, oats and sun flower seeds to flour mixture stirring until a soft dough forms.
Allow dough to rest for 20 minutes before kneading.
Turn out onto a floured surface and knead adding enough addl unbleached flour to keep from sticking, until dough is smooth, soft, and elastic, about 10 minutes (dough will be slightly sticky).
Form dough into a ball and transfer to oiled large bowl, turning to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and a hot wet kitchen towel; let rise at warm room temperature until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead several times to remove air. Divide dough in half and shape each half into a loaf, then place 1 loaf in each oiled pan.
Cover loaf pans loosely with plastic wrap and a hot & wet kitchen towel and let dough rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375Â°F.  Bake until bread is golden and loaves sound hollow when tapped, 35 to 40 minutes.
Remove bread from pans and transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours.
