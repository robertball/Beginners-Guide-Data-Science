Ingredients:
4 cups fiddleheads, cleaned and blanched
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 small onion, minced
2 cups chicken stock
2 cups milk or cream
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
salt and pepper, to taste
paprika

Directions:
Coarsely chop fiddle heads and reserve.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add the fiddleheads and chicken stock. Stir, increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a gentle boil. Cover and cook until the fiddleheads are thoroughly tender, about 5 minutes. Add the milk, reduce the heat to medium, and heat until nearly boiling. Do not let the soup boil or the milk will curdle.
Stir in the lemon zest and season the soup to taste with salt and pepper. Divide the soup into four bowls, garnish with paprika and serve immediately.
Serves 4.
