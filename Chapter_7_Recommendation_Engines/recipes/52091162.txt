Description: 
Great make-ahead-of-the-game dip! Cheesy (with some surprises), and served with tortilla chips. Keep hot in a slow cooker to last all afternoon and free yourself to watch the game. Always disappears quickly! Can be served in individual dip bowls with tortilla chips, or over a handful of chips in a bowl.Modified from: Big Game Salsa Dip
