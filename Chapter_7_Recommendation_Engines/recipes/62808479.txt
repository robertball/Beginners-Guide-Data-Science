Ingredients:
Rainbow Rotini or "Wacky Mac", 2 Boxes or Bags
Salt, Tbsp
Vinegar, 1/3 c. & 1/3 c. later
Sugar, 1/3 c.
Olive Oil, Tbsp & 1/3 c. later
Small Onion
Bell Pepper
Celery stalk, or 2
Carrot, 1/3 c. thinly sliced
Dry Italian Dressing packet mix
Garlic, minced from jar, tsp
Salt/Pepper/Celery Salt (to your taste)
Opt: packet or 2 of Equal or Splenda
Sundried Tomatoes, packed in oil from a jar, or soft from a bag
Black Olives, sliced, small can*
Whole kernel Corn, small can*
Feta Cheese, 1 container, crumbled

Directions:
Boil the pasta as directed on the package, BUT add a Tbsp (yes, a Tablespoon!) of Salt, 1/3 c. of Sugar, 1/3 c. vinegar, Tbsp of Oil, and *drain the liquid from both cans into the water to be boiled. I know it's a lot of salt, sugar & vinegar (it will be our secret!) but most of it is drained out later anyway.
Meanwhile, slice the Carrot, chop the Onion, Bell Pepper, Celery and the Tomatoes (set aside the remaining tomato oil). Mix and set aside in the fridge.
Mix the dry Italian dressing packet with 1/3 cup Oil, 1/3 cup Vinegar, Garlic, Salt, Pepper, Celery Salt. (Opt: Add a packet or 2 of Equal or Splenda) Set aside in the fridge.
When the Pasta is tender, drain it and run cold water over it to cool it off. Put into a big bowl then stir in the carrots, onion, bell pepper, celery, tomatoes and the oil drained from tomatoe jar, or more olive oil. Set aside in the fridge.
After all ingredients are cooled off, mix everything together including the cheese. If needed, stir in more oil before it's served, especially if it sits in the fridge for a while.

Description: 
This always gets lots of compliments and will last a few days. I probably make this different every time, so some of these measurements are my guestimations, so modify it to your liking. If you don't have a big crowd, then use half of everything. Enjoy!
