Ingredients:
500ml milk
200ml heavy cream
5 large egg yolks
150g cup sugar
1 vanilla bean
5g chestnut flour (optional)

Directions:
Cut the vanilla bean in two, lengthwise. Scrape out the tender pulp with the back of a knife. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, mix milk and cream.  Warm until foam forms around the edges. Remove from heat.
In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks, vanilla bean pulp, chestnut flour and sugar until frothy. Gradually pour the warm milk into the egg yolks whisking constantly.  Return mixture to saucepan; add the vanilla bean casings and cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.
Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for several hours or overnight.
Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a sealed container, and freeze until firm. If the gelato is too firm, place it in the refrigerator until it reaches the desired consistency.

Description: 
This is my husband's favourite flavour of gelato. It is the antique flavour similar to an egg custard. It serves nicely with fruit or even a piece of pie!Modified from: Gelato
