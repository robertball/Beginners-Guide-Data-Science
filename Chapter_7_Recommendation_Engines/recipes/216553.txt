Ingredients:
1 pound ground lamb
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 green Thai chili peppers, finely chopped
1 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons coriander seeds, crushed
2 tablespoons plain yogurt
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
5 (6 inch) bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 20 minutes
2 red bell peppers, seeded and cut into 2-inch pieces

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Lightly grease a broiling pan.
Mix together the lamb, garlic, chili peppers, onion, coriander, yogurt, turmeric, lemon juice, and salt with your hands until well mixed. Roll the mixture into 15 meatballs. Thread 3 meatballs onto each skewer, separating with chunks of red bell pepper. Place onto the prepared broiling pan.
Broil for 5 minutes, then turn the skewers over, and continue broiling until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes more.
