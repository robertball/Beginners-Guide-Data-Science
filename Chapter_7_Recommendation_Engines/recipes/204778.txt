Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 large eggplant, sliced into 1/2 inch rounds
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 (14 ounce) can pizza sauce
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat the eggs in a bowl. Mix the flour, salt, pepper, and oregano in a 1 gallon resealable plastic bag. Dip each eggplant slice in the egg, then drop the eggplant in the flour mixture one at a time, shaking the bag to coat the eggplant.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Place the eggplant slices in the skillet to cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned. Drain the eggplant slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Arrange the eggplant in one layer on a baking sheet. Spoon enough pizza sauce to cover each eggplant slice. Top each eggplant with mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the mozzarella cheese is melted, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
Eggplant makes a wonderful alternative to your ordinary pizza crust. I have tons of eggplant from my garden so I make these about once a week! Fun way to get your kids to eat their veggies. I suggest adding pepperoni, mushroom, and peppers.
