Ingredients:
4 potatoes, peeled and cubed
4 eggs
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup shaved fresh Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup herb seasoned croutons
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons rice vinegar, or to taste
3 tablespoons mayonnaise, or as needed

Directions:
Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Allow to cool.
Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Pour out the hot water and cool the eggs under cold running water in the sink. Peel once cold. Dice the eggs.
In a salad bowl, lightly toss the potatoes, eggs, artichoke hearts, garlic, Parmesan cheese, croutons, Dijon mustard, rice vinegar, and mayonnaise until all ingredients are coated with dressing.

Description: 
Since my partner is very picky about what he likes in his potato salad, I have made my own version of home-made PS and it's always a hit with friends and family. Not for the calorie faint but it's real, real good! Ingredient quantities are variable to taste. I think it's the garlic that takes it to the next level. Try it! For best flavor allow it to set overnight in the fridge. Using a mix of yellow, white, and red potatoes is really the best.
