Ingredients:
For the Sauce:
3 cloves garlic, crushed
3 tablespoons ketchup
1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional)
1 tablespoon hot sauce, or to taste
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon ground cumin
8 ounces rice noodles
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/3 cup diced celery
1/3 cup minced red and green jalapenos
1/3 cup diced green onions
1/2 pound crabmeat

Directions:
Whisk garlic, ketchup, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, hot sauce, paprika, cayenne pepper, and cumin together in a bowl.
Place rice noodles in a large bowl; cover with boiling water and stir with tongs. Let soak for 10 minutes.
While noodles soak, heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir celery, jalapenos, and green onions until tender and fragrant, about 10 minutes.
Drain noodles and place in the pan; add the sauce and crabmeat. Cook and stir until noodles are coated evenly and everything is heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
Crab, and its old friends, the Holy Trinity, are a classic combo, and so it was no surprise they worked so well in an Asian-style rice noodle dish â€“ an experiment gone right. Garnish with sliced green onion.
