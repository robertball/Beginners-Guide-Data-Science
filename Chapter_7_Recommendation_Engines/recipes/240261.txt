Ingredients:
2 (13.5 ounce) cans coconut milk
2 limes, juiced
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
2 bunches kale, leaves separated, stems discarded

Directions:
Heat coconut milk in a saucepan over low heat until lukewarm, about 5 minutes; pour into a large glass bowl. Stir lime juice, paprika, sea salt, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes into milk until marinade is smooth.
Place kale into marinade and press down to ensure all leaves are covered. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove kale from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.
Working in batches, grill kale leaves in a single layer until edges are slightly crispy and centers are soft, 45 to 60 seconds per side.

Description: 
My wife and I had this at a tapas place in Victoria, BC. Wow, did we love it! Here is our attempt to recreate it. If using a gas grill, use a handful of wood chips to add a smoky flavor.
