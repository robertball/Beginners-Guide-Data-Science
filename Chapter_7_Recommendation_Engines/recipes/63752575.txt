Ingredients:
1 teaspoon Cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon Nutmeg
1 package (14.1 ounces) refrigerated pie crusts
4 Gala or Braeburn apples, peeled, cored and halved
8 teaspoons butter, divided
1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1 cup water
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon Pure Vanilla Extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 500°F. Mix cinnamon and nutmeg in small bowl. Prepare crusts as directed on package. Sprinkle spice mixture evenly on surface of each crust. Cut each crust into 4 equal pieces. Place 1 apple half in center of each piece of crust. Fill center of each apple half with 1 teaspoon of the butter. Carefully fold crust up over apple half, pinching seams together to seal. Place dumplings, seam-side down, in greased 13x9-inch baking dish.
Bring sugar, water and 2 tablespoons butter to boil in small saucepan. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla; set aside. Bake dumplings about 10 minutes or until crust begins to brown. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Pour sauce over dumplings. Bake 40 to 45 minutes longer or until apples are tender and pastry is golden brown. Serve warm with ice cream or whipped cream, if desired.
