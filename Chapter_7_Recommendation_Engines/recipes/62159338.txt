Description: 
These crepes I have made a few times. This is  a special recipe it is simple and delicious. I always experiment with recipes like this. Try taking away or adding ingredients for various tastes. These crepes make great breakfast, lunch, dinner or an after school snack for your kids. 
If you make the crepes in the recommended 8x8 pan then they will turn out to be a little thicker than normal. If you want the crepes to be thinner, use a larger pan. This also means that they will be larger.
