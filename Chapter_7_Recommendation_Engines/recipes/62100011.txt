Ingredients:
1-2 lbs  ground meat
1 pkg taco meat seasoning
12-16 oz picante sauce
12 oz cottage cheese
8 oz sour cream
2 eggs
16 oz shredded cheddar or blended cheese
1 box ready-to-bake lasagna noodles
1 small bag of tortilla chips

Directions:
Brown & drain the ground beef.
Season with taco seasoning.
Mix in picante sauce.
Put aside.
Combine cottage cheese, eggs and sour cream together.
Set aside.
In 13 x 9 pan begin layering the ingredients starting with a small amount of the beef and sauce mixture to prevent the noodles from sticking to the pan.
Alternate noodles and tortilla chips where you would normally put noodles.
The last two layers should be beef mixture and cheese on top.
Place in 350 degrees F oven for 30 to 45 minutes or until the cheese is bubbling and starting to brown.
Check internal tempurature for a minimum of 160 degrees F.
Let stand for 10-20 minutes to set.
Note: If you refrigerate and bake at a later time, plan on an additional 15-30 minutes bake time.

Description: 
This recipe will make you never want to eat Italian style lasagna again!  You may use only tortilla chips instead of lasagna noodles, but I have found that it presents better with the noodles to hold it together.
