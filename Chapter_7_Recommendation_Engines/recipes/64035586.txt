2 Tablespoons butter
2 Tablespoons olive oil

Cut Cabbage into quarters, removing the hard stem. Slice each quarter into 1-inch wide strips.
In a large pot, add butter, olive oil, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes and cabbage.
Saute lightly until cabbage is coated with the butter and oil and starts to lose its stiffness.

Cover and reduce heat to medium-low.
Simmer for 12 - 15 minutes, stirring occasionally until cabbage is tender.
