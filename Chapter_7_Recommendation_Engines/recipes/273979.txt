Ingredients:
4 sweet potatoes
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1 tablespoon chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
1 teaspoon honey
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pierce sweet potatoes several times with a fork and place onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes.
While potatoes bake, combine butter, chipotle peppers, honey, salt, and pepper in a food processor. Blend well until smooth. Transfer butter to a bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve with baked potatoes.

Description: 
I love baked sweet potatoes, but wanted something sweet/smoky to serve them with. Whipped these up to try and they are a great combination - and even better with BBQ!
