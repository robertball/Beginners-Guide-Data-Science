Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1 small zucchini, grated and squeezed dry
1 large egg, beaten
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
10 pitted kalamata olives, diced
4 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese
1 teaspoon Greek seasoning (such as Cavender'sÂ®)
Dipping Sauce:
1 cup Greek yogurt
1/4 cup jarred roasted red pepper strips
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine turkey, zucchini, egg, bread crumbs, olives, feta cheese, and Greek seasoning in a large bowl. Mix until evenly combined.
Form meatballs using an ice cream scoop and place onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes.
While the meatballs are baking, place Greek yogurt, red pepper strips, lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic in a food processor. Pulse until well blended. Season with salt and pepper. Serve dipping sauce alongside meatballs.
