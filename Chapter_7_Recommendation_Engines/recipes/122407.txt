In a greased 3-qt. baking dish, layer half of the potatoes, ham, onion, cheese and soup. Repeat layers. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours or until potatoes are almost tender.

Description: 
I like to make this casserole with the leftovers from a baked ham. It's a great meal all by itself.
