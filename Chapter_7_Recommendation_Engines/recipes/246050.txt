Ingredients:
2 heads cauliflower, broken into florets
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed

1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 (10.5 ounce) can cream of chicken soup, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup crushed buttery round crackers (such as RitzÂ®)

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower florets, cover, and steam until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain; transfer cauliflower to a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.

Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.
