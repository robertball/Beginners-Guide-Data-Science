Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (optional)
2 1/2 cups water
1 (14.25 ounce) can low-sodium beef broth
1 (15.25 ounce) can yellow sweet corn
10 small red potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
6 fresh jalapeno peppers, sliced into rings
1 small white onion, chopped
1 pinch onion powder, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Crumble ground beef into a skillet over medium heat; season with garlic salt and cayenne pepper. Cook and stir the ground beef until completely browned, breaking into small pieces as you stir, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain as much grease from the beef as possible.
Combine water, beef broth, corn, potatoes, sliced jalapeno peppers, onion, onion powder, and black pepper in a slow cooker; add drained ground beef. Cook on High until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally, 3 1/2 to 4 hours.

Description: 
I used vegetables from the farmers market and just started creating this delicious and spicy stew! It's very easy to put together and very tasty! If you like fresh garlic you can add 2 cloves to meat while browning. For a less-spicy option, remove jalapeno seeds.
