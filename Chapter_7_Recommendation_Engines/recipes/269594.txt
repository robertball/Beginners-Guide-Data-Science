Ingredients:
Pasta Dough:
2 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
2 eggs
Filling:
1 cup ricotta cheese
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Egg Wash:
1 cup water
1 eggs

Directions:
Measure flour into a large bowl and make a well in the center. Crack eggs into the center. Beat eggs with a fork until blended. Use the fork to gradually draw in flour from the sides, mixing until all the flour is incorporated.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, 3 to 4 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 20 minutes.
Mix ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses together in a bowl. Whisk water and egg together in a small bowl to make egg wash.
Lightly flour the work surface again. Roll out dough into a thin sheet. Cut into hearts using a cookie cutter. Brush edges with egg wash. Spoon filling into the center of 1/2 of the hearts; cover with remaining hearts. Press edges together to seal.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli in batches and wait until they float to the top. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes after that. Transfer to a colander using a slotted spoon. Repeat with remaining ravioli.
