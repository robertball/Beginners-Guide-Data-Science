Ingredients:
cooking spray
8 slices bacon
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
3/4 cup barbeque sauce Sweet Baby Ray's

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until the edges begin to crisp, about 5 minutes; drain bacon on paper towels. Wrap each chicken breast with 2 slices of bacon in an x-shaped pattern and place into the prepared baking sheet with bacon ends underneath.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; spread barbeque sauce over chicken breasts and bake until the juices run clear, the chicken is no longer pink inside, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 10 to 15 more minutes.

Description: 
Those same old chicken breasts get a hearty, smoky flavor when wrapped in bacon and baked with barbeque sauce in a simple recipe. You can make them on the grill, too.Modified from: Barbeque Bacon Chicken Bake
