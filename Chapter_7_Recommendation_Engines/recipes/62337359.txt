Ingredients:
1 egg, slightly beaten
1 tsp worcestershire sauce
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp seasoning salt
1/2 tsp dried sage or 1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh
1 tbsp dried parsley or 2 tablespoons chopped fresh
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup finely crushed herb stuffing mix
1 pound lean ground beef

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix together the egg, worcestershire, seasonings, parsley and milk in a mixing bowl.
Add stuffing mix and stir to combine. Let sit for 10 minutes until stuffing mix is softened.
Crumble ground beef over mixture and mix together with clean hands just until combined. Do not overmix or pack the burger or meatballs may be too hard.
Shape (do not pack tight) into 1-1/2" balls (I use my #50 cookie scoop).
Place onto a foil-lined baking sheet.
Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.

Description: 
After trying many meatball recipes I decided to come up with my own. These turn out nice and tender and could go well in with a pasta sauce or a cream sauce.
