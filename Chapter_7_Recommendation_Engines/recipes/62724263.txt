Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup chopped pecans
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 cup pecan halves
GLAZE:
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Separate crescent dough into 16 triangles. Spread each with butter. Combine sugar, chopped pecans and cinnamon; sprinkle over triangles. Beginning at the wide end, roll up each triangle. In a greased 9-in. pie pan, place rolls, point side down.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to foil lined cookie sheet. Top with pecan halves. In a saucepan, combine glaze ingredients; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cool for 5 minutes. Drizzle over warm bread.

Description: 
This quick bread has the terrific taste of caramel yeast rolls but with the convenience of refrigerated crescent rolls. Each Thanksgiving, I make several breads for my husband to share with his fellow teachers.Modified from: Pecan Breakfast Loaf
