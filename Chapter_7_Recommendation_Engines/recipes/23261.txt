Ingredients:
COOKIE
1 cup sugar
1 cup LAND O LAKESÂ® Butter, softened*
2 egg yolks
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract
1/2 cup finely crushed red and white mint candies
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
FILLING
7 (1 ounce) squares real semi-sweet baking chocolate
Crushed red and white mint candies

Directions:
Combine sugar and butter in large bowl.  Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until well mixed. Add egg yolks, vanilla and peppermint extract.  Continue beating, scraping bowl often, until well mixed.  Reduce speed to low.  Add flour, 1/2 cup crushed candies and salt; beat until well mixed . Cover; refrigerate until firm (1 hour).
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface, one-half at a time (keeping remaining dough refrigerated), to 1/8-inch thickness.  Cut with assorted 1 1/2-inch cookie cutters.  Place 1 inch apart onto greased cookie sheets.
Bake for 6 to 10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.  Let stand 1 minute; remove from cookie sheets.  Cool completely.
Put cookies together in pairs with about 1 teaspoon melted chocolate for each sandwich cookie.  Decorate as desired by dipping part of sandwich cookie in melted chocolate, then crushed candies or drizzling top with melted chocolate, then sprinkling with crushed candies.  Place onto waxed paper; let stand 1 hour to set.
