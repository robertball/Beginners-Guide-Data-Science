Ingredients:
5 pounds rib roast
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
onion salt
1 tablespoon browning sauce
1 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion salt, browning sauce and water. Place roast in a roasting pan ribs side down and poke deep holes in the roast with a knife. Pour the marinade over the roast. Using a baster, squirt marinade into the holes you created with the knife and over the entire roast a few times.
Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for about 1 hour. (Note: Bake for 40 to 45 minutes for a smaller roast so that it does not dry out.)
Remove roast from oven and reduce temperature in the oven to 200  degrees F (95 degrees C).
When oven has reached 200 degrees F (95 degrees C), return roast to oven and continue cooking for 18 to 22 minutes per pound, or until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).
