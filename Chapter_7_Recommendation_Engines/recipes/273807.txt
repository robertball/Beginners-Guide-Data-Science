Stuffed Sweet Potato Skins Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
4 sweet potatoes, scrubbed
1/3 pound bulk sage sausage, or more to taste
1/3 cup chopped red onion
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prick sweet potatoes several times with a fork and place onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.
While potatoes are cooling, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage and onion in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer mixture to a medium to large heat-proof bowl. Add Cheddar cheese and mix well.
Slice cooled spuds lengthwise. Scoop insides out and into the sausage mixture, creating a cavity in the potato skins. Stir sausage mixture well; mound ingredients evenly into the empty potato skins using a small scoop. Arrange on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.

A savory alternative to our candied usual spuds. These sweet potato skins can be totally prepared other than the final baking time the day before, and refrigerated.
