Ingredients:
1 egg yolk, mixed with enough milk to make 3/4 cup (reserve egg white)
2 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp salt
1/2 cup lard
1/2 cup margarine
~6 apples, peeled, cored and thinly sliced
1 cup crushed corn flakes
1 cup sugar
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla
3/4 cup icing sugar
Lemon juice, to make a thin icing

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F.
Cut lard and margarine into the flour and salt til fat is pea-sized.  Add egg yolk and milk, and mix until the dough comes together.  Reserve the egg white.  Split dough into 2 portions.  Roll one portion out on a floured surface into a rectangle to fit the dimensions of a jelly roll pan.  Place the rolled dough into the pan, and top with an even layer of cornflake crumbs.  Sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon over the crumbs in an even layer.  Top with sliced apples, carefully arranged again in an even layer.  Roll out the second portion of dough on a floured surface, and place on top of the apples.  Trim to fit the pan, and cover any gaps on the top portion of dough.  Whisk the egg white, and brush over dough.  Bake at 400F for 30 mins, til the top is nicely browned and the apples are soft.  Mix vanilla, icing sugar, and enough lemon juice to create a thin icing.  Drizzle over the cooled squares, using as much or as little as you like, to taste.

Description: 
Our neighbour used to make these with fresh apples in the fall, when I was a kid.  They taste much like apple pie, but you can eat them with your hands!
