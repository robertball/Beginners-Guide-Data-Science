Ingredients:
3 bags (or loose tea equivalent) orange pekoe tea
3/4 c sugar
water
Lemon(s) -- optional, and entirely to your own taste

Directions:
Using at least a 2-quart pot, put 1 quart water on to boil with the tea bags (or tea ball) in the water.    Bring to a boil and boil for about five to ten minutes.
Meanwhile, put sugar into a 2-quart heatproof pitcher.  If you like lemons, you can add them at this point -- sliced, diced, wedged, your choice.  Remove the tea bags and pour the concentrated tea into the pitcher.  Do not stir.  Allow the concentrated mixture (which should only be about  half of the volume of the pitcher)to cool naturally -- do not refrigerate at this point or attempt to hasten the cooling process, or you'll spoil the clarity of the tea.
When the tea mixture has reached room temperature, add enough water to fill the rest of the pitcher and stir.  Set the whole thing in the refrigerator and chill.
