Ingredients:
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts
4 cups chicken broth
2 cups water, or as needed
1 (15.8 ounce) can great northern beans, drained and rinsed
1 (12 ounce) jar medium salsa
1 cup tomato puree
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon molasses
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 bay leaves
salt to taste
4 ounces pepper jack cheese, cubed
4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, cubed
1 green bell pepper, diced
1/4 cup sour cream, or to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken, chicken broth, water, beans, salsa, tomato puree, onion, garlic, chili powder, cumin, oregano, molasses, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, bay leaves, and salt in a 6-quart slow cooker. Stir gently to combine. Cover and cook on Low until chicken is falling apart, 4 to 6 hours.
Remove chicken from slow cooker, shred, and return to the cooker. Stir in pepper jack cheese, Monterey jack cheese, and bell pepper. Cover and cook until bell pepper is softened and cheeses have completely melted into the chili, 30 to 45 minutes more.
Adjust salt, black pepper, and chili powder to taste. Remove bay leaves. Serve warm, topped with sour cream and extra cheese, if desired.

Description: 
While not a 'true' white chili, due to the addition of salsa and tomato puree, it's still an easy and delicious meal to throw into the slow cooker and have dinner waiting for you! Stirring cheese directly into the chili adds creaminess and tons of extra flavor, too!
