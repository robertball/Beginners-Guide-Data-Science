Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/3 large eggplant
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
Garlic salt
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1 tomato, chopped
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
red pepper flakes
1/4 cup Italian-style salad dressing

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet or pizza pan with olive oil.
Peel Eggplant.  Slice into round slices, each 1/4 inch thick. In a small bowl, whip together the egg, garlic and water. Place the breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes in a separate small bowl.
Dip the eggplant slices one at a time into the egg, garlic and water mixture, then into the breadcrumbs. One by one, place the coated slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet or pizza pan.
Bake the eggplant for 10 minutes, flip, then top with equal amounts of tomato, Parmesan cheese and Italian-style salad dressing, lemon juice and fresh basil, if desired.
Change oven setting to broil, and continue cooking 3 to 5 minutes. Check the slices frequently while broiling to avoid burning.

Description: 
This easy-to-prepare eggplant appetizer tastes great and can be made a little bit ahead of time. It goes especially well with roasted pork tenderloin and pasta.  My girlfriend loved it--what more can I ask for?!!!!!!!Modified from: Eggplant -- Easy, Good and Tasty
