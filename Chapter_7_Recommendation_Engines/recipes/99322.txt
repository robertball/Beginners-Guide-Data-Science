Ingredients:
8 ounces fresh green beans, trimmed
2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
1/2 tablespoon miso paste
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted

Directions:
Place the green beans into a steamer insert and set in a pot over one inch of water. Bring to a boil, cover and steam for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer beans to a serving bowl.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, miso paste, red pepper flakes, garlic and ginger. Pour over the green beans and toss to coat. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top.

Description: 
This is my interpretation of the green beans from my favorite Japanese restaurant. Serve with a grilled steak! You can omit the miso paste if you choose.
