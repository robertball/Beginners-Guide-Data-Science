Ingredients:
1 cup whole-wheat flour
1 cup quick-cooking rolled oats
2/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 egg white
1 (10 ounce) jar all-fruit spread, any flavor

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly spray a 9 x 9 x 2 baking pan with
no-stick spray.  In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and baking soda.  Stir in walnuts.  In a small bowl, use a fork to beat together the buttermilk and egg white.  Add the buttermilk mixture to the oat mixture.  Mix the oat and buttermilk mixtures until combined.  Set aside 3/4 cup of the oat mixture for the topping.  Press the remaining oat mixture in the bottom of the prepared pan.  Spread fruit spread on top.  Drop small spoonfuls of the reserved oat mixture on top (the surface will not be entirely covered).  Bake for 25 - 30 minutes.  Cool completely, then cut into bars.
