Ingredients:
3 lemons
Zest of 3 lemons
1 1/2 cup sugar
1/2 stick soft butter
4 large egg yolks
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/8 tsp kosher salt

Directions:
Zest and juice lemons.
(Can remove the zest with a veg peeler being sure to avoid the pith.  Then put the zest in the blender with the sugar and whizz.  May be quicker than using the zester)
Cream 1/2 stick soft butter
Mix lemon zest and 1 1/2 cups sugar together
Add lemon zest/sugar mixture to creamed butter
Add & mix 4 eggs but one at a time for some reason we don't know
Add 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice and 1/8 tsp salt, mix well
Cook over low - medium heat until thick (should reach 170 degrees). Stir constantly!
Cool
