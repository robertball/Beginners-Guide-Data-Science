Ingredients:
1 (8 pound) pork butt, trimmed
18 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
4 teaspoons Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere'sÂ®)
2 teaspoons dark brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon dry mustard
1/8 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Cut rows of deep slits into both sides of pork butt using a sharp knife; insert a garlic clove into each slit. Rub vegetable oil over pork butt.
Mix Creole seasoning, brown sugar, white sugar, paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, mustard, cumin, and ginger together in a bowl; coat pork butt with spice mixture. Wrap coated pork butt with aluminum foil and refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.
Heat an infrared turkey fryer or a large skillet over medium-high heat; remove aluminum foil from pork butt. Sear all sides of pork butt in the fryer or hot skillet until an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) is reached, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Wrap the seared pork butt tightly in aluminum foil.
Preheat the roaster or oven to 265 degrees F (130 degrees C).
Place wrapped pork butt in the preheated roaster or oven until pork is easily shredded, 3 to 4 hours. Remove pork butt from aluminum foil and pull meat apart.

Description: 
I serve this to guests during the summer and is one of my favorites especially if feeding a crowd! I use the Smokin' Jack BBQ Sauce recipe on this site!
