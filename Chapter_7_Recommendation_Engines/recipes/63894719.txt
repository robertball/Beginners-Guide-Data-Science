Ingredients:
•About 1 cup sugar
•1/4   cup (1/4 stick) butter, room temperature
•1  stick cinnamon
•1 whole nutmeg
•6 whole cloves
•1/2 teaspoon vanilla
•Pinch salt
•About 3 cups boiling water

Directions:
Simmer all the ingredient together over a low heat for about 15 minutes. Turn off the fire.
Pour the resulting liquid into a cup. Whatever liquid I had, I measured apple juice to be about half of it, and then poured it into the same cup. The ratio was about 2-1 liquid to apple juice. Serve warm.

Description: 
Quite by accident, we discovered by twisting the traditional Hot Buttered Almost Rum recipe, we ended up with a non-alcoholic drink that tastes exactly like a slice of homemade apple pie. It's a great alternative to the ever-present hot chocolate and spiced apple cider.
