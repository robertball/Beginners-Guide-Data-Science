Ingredients:
any amount of leftover carnitas (I use the "Slow Cooker Carnitas" recipe on this site)
1 bag of restaurant-style tortilla chips
1 (8oz) bag of shredded Monterey-Jack cheese
Sour cream (to taste)
1 jar of Chunky Pineapple Salsa

Directions:
Turn on the oven's broiler.
Heat the amount of leftover carnitas you are going to use in the microwave while the oven is heating up.
Place the amount of tortilla chips you want,in a single layer (overlapping a little) on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Spoon the heated carnitas onto the tortilla chips.
Sprinkle the amount of cheese you prefer on top of the meat.
Put in over under broiler for about 4 minutes, or until cheese is melted and done the way you like.
Remove from oven.  Serve with sour cream and chunky pineapple salsa.

Description: 
I made this one day when I had leftover carnitas and wasn't sure what to do with them.  I made these nachos with ingredients I had around.  What a delicious surprise! The pineapple salsa gives a nice sweetness to go with the heat of the carnitas.
