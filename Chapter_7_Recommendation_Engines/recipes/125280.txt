Ingredients:
2 cups self-rising flour*
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
2 teaspoons dill weed
1 egg
3/4 cup milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour and sugar. Cut in butter until crumbly; stir in the cheese and dill. In a small bowl, beat egg and milk; pour into dry ingredients and stir just until moistened. (Batter will be very thick.) Pour into a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until bread tests done. Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.
