Ingredients:
4 slices bread
butter
30 grams mizuna
1/4 piece onion
2 slices ham
2 pcs Wiener sausage
2 slices mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Cut the roots of mizuna then slice it into 5-cm widths. Slice the onion. For the sausage, slice it thinly.
Top the bread with a slice of ham then add the mizuna and the onions. Add the mozzarella cheese then spread the sliced sausages. Sandwich it with the other slice of bread.
Preheat the sandwich maker. Once done, grease the sandwich plates with melted butter. Use a cooking brush to avoid burning yourself.
Place the sandwiches on the sandwich maker then toast for 5 minutes or until crispy.
Slice the sandwich toasts in half before serving.

Description: 
Mizuna is usually used Japanese salads. In this recipe, I've tried to use it in a sandwich toast and it went well. This would be a good substitute for lettuce.
