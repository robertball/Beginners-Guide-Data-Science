Ingredients:
3 large golden beets, scrubbed clean with roots and leaves trimmed
1 medium white or yellow onion
1 tablespoon of coconut oil
3 cups of organic vegetable broth
2 cloves from your roasted garlic bulb {see cashew cream below}
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon coarse ground pepper
1 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Half and then quarter your beets and onion, drizzle with the coconut oil and coat evenly. Put the veggies on a baking sheet that’s lined with parchment paper. Along with the veggies throw in the whole bulb of garlic for the Roasted Garlic Cashew Cream recipe. Roast for about 35 – 40 minutes or until soft and tender, flipping half way.
When the veggies are done cooking, set them aside. Take the bulb of garlic {be careful, the insides are super hot} and pop out two the cloves for the soup, set the rest of the bulb aside for now.
Combine the beets, onions, vegetable broth, 2 garlic cloves, paprika, sea salt and pepper; puree until smooth in either your blender or food processor.
The soup is fantastic eaten both cold and hot. It’s especially good with a swirl of Roasted Garlic Cashew Cream, see recipe below.
