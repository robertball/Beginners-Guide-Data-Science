Ingredients:
2 packages enoki mushroom (chopped coarsely)
1 small carrot (peeled and very finely chopped)
1/2 cup chopped green onions
4 eggs
pinches white pepper (or black)
vegetable oil

Directions:
Dice the mushrooms, carrot and green onions. Make sure the carrots are finely diced so it won't take away from the texture of the enoki mushrooms.
In a large bowl, mix the mushrooms, green onions, and carrots together.
Add the eggs and mix together until it becomes a batter.
Add the pepper and mix well. Don't let the batter become frothy looking.
Heat up vegetable oil in a frying pan. Spoon the mixture (smaller than the size of the palm of your hand) onto the frying pan. You can make 3-5 patties at a time.
Press down lightly on the patties and cook one side for about 50 seconds or until it is solid enough to flip.
When one side is done, use a spatula to flip the patties to the other side. Cook for about 10-15 seconds per side; careful not to let it burn.
Serve immediately and enjoy!
