Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) tilapia
10 ounces macadamia nuts
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon hot sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Preheat your oven bake at 400 10 min. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Combine macadamia nuts, soy sauce, garlic, hot sauce, brown sugar, olive oil, and black pepper in a food processor; blend until the mixture is the consistency of paste.
Spoon a thick layer of the macadamia mixture on top of each tilapia fillet. Place the fish macadamia mixture-side up on the prepared baking sheet. Under the broiler, cook fish until the macadamia crust is golden brown and the tilapia flakes easily, about 15 minutes.
