Ingredients:
1 Pork Tenderloin (about 3/4 pound)
1 cup soy sauce (I prefer low-sodium)
2 tsp ginger
6 medium cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
With a thin knife, remove silver skin from Pork.
Place Pork in a gallon-size storage bag. Add remaining ingredients to bag and seal.
Marinate in refrigerator for 1-4 hours, turning Tenderloin over halfway through.
Preheat gas grill to high heat. Clean and oil grill grate.
Remove Pork from bag and discard marinade. Grill Pork for 3 minutes per side, turning 3 times. After final 3 minutes (12 minutes total), check internal temperature. If it's 165 degrees, it's done. If not, continue grilling on 4th side until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees, usually no more than 3 minutes, max.
Remove from grill and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice and serve.
