Ingredients:
1 Blessing of Love and Gratitude
6 Cups Watermelon, Chopped
2 Cucumbers diced. Regular Cucumbers or the long English Cucumbers (my preference)
2 Red Bell Peppers diced
1 Medium Onion chopped
4 Tablespoons Lemon Juice
2 Tablespoons Olive Oil
1/2 Jalepeno
3 Tablespoons Fresh Mint
2 Tablespoons Fresh Ginger
3 Tablespoons Honey
1/2 Cup Pineapple Juice
Mint for Garnish a few leaves in each bowl you serve
Watermelon chunks for Garnish about 1 cup enough to add some texture or a few to each individual  bowl

Directions:
Cut Cucumbers, Red Peppers, Onion, 1/2 Jalapeno, set aside in a large bowl.
Add Mint and  Ginger.
Cut Watermelon into chunks and measure out six cups.
Fill the Blender or food processor with 1/2 the vegetable mixture and 1/2 Watermelon.
Add the juice from one lemon, olive oil, honey and pulse so it is still course not 100 liquid.
Empty the blender and add the remaining vegetable and the rest of the watermelon.
Blend both batches together in a large mixing bowl or use a large cooking pot deep enough to blend both batches together.
Your basically doing this in two batches since it all won't fit in a blender or food processor at once. It doesn't matter if more vegetables are added to one of the batches and not the other. You just need to get everything blended then combine it all.
Chill at least one hour to allow ingredients to blend.
Serve in individual bowls with a few chunks of watermelon and mint on top for garnish.
It is not necessary to add extra watermelon if you wish to skip that step.
