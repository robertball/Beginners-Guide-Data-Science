Ingredients:
1/3 cup (mixture of almond and coconut flours)
2 cups almond pulp (not dried)
4 dashes cinnamon powder
1 dash nutmeg
4 dashes salt
1 T ground cacoa nibs or unsweetened cocoa powder
8 soaked dates
3 t vanilla
1 T applesauce
¼ cup almond milk
2 T coconut oil,melted
1/3 cup rolled oats
¼ cup water (optional)
1/3 cup dark chocolate bar, melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350º F.
Line a cookie sheet with lightly greased parchment paper.
Soak the dates in hot water for 6-10 minutes until soft and drain.
Melt the coconut oil in the microwave for 20 seconds.
Add all ingredients except dark chocolate into a food processor and process until the “dough” is the same texture and consistency of cookie dough. You may need to add water, depending on how moist your almond pulp was to start.
Using your hands, first roll the cookie dough (approx. 1 T per cookie) and then pinch sides with your fingers to form a square.  Line them up in rows on your parchment paper lined greased cookie sheet. Press each one down very gently using your fingers or a fork to flatten somewhat.
Bake cookies for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
Allow cookies to cool then drizzle melted dark chocolate over top of each cookie.
