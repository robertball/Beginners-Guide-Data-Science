Ingredients:
2 cups flour
3 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1/4 cup shortening
3/4 cup milk

Directions:
Heat oven to 450 degrees F.  Mix flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl.  Cut in shortening, until mixture looks like meal.  Stir in almost all the milk.  Add enough milk to make a soft, puffy, easy to roll dough (not sticky).
Place dough on lightly floured cloth covered surface.  Knead lightly 20-25 times.  Roll 1/2 inch thick.  Cut with floured biscuit cutter.
Place on ungreased baking sheet and bake 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
