Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) containers fresh red raspberries
1/2 cup honey
4 cups water, divided
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup

Directions:
Place raspberries in work bowl of a food processor, and process until smooth.  If an extra smooth sorbet is desired, press pureed raspberries through a fine sieve to remove seeds.  Whisk together pureed raspberries and honey in a large bowl.
Combine 3 cups of water, sugar, and corn syrup in a large saucepan; stir to combine.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Boil until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes; do not stir.  Stir the sugar water and the remaining 1 cup of water into the raspberry puree.
Make an ice bath by filling a very large bowl with water and ice.  Set the bowl of raspberry puree in the ice bath, and whisk until cool.  Pour cooled puree into a 9x13 baking dish, and cover; freeze until solid, 6 to 8 hours.
To make a coarsely textured granita, use a fork to scrape frozen puree into small crumbs.  For a deliciously silky sorbet, transfer frozen puree to a food processor and process until smooth.

Description: 
No ice cream machine required!  Partially sweetened with honey to give it a delicious sun-ripened quality.  Very tart and very flavorful.  This recipe is versatile, as the finished product can be an icy granita or smooth sorbet.
