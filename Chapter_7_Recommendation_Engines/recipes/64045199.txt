Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts (or thighs)
1 cup honey
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup diced onion
1/4 cup ketchup
2 Tbsp. vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes
4-6 tsp. cornstarch dissolved in cold water

Directions:
Put chicken into crock pot.  In a small bowl, combine honey, soy sauce, onion, ketchup, oil, garlic and pepper flakes.  Pour over chicken.  Cook on low for 3-4 hours or high about 2 hours.  Remove chicken from crock pot and cut into bite-sized pieces.  Pour cornstarch mix into the crock pot and cook for ten minutes (or transfer to a pot and bring to a simmer for ten minutes).  Add chicken back to pot, then mix and serve over rice or noodles.

Description: 
A very simple, but deliciously meaty dish. Broccoli would be a good side dish to compliment this.
