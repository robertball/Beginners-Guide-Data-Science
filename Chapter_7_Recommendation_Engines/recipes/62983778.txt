Ingredients:
1 boneless fully cooked ham (9 pounds)
1-1/2 cups Champagne
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
4-1/2 teaspoons honey
3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 teaspoon ground mustard

Directions:
Place ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Score the surface of the ham, making diamond shapes 1/2 in. deep. Bake, uncovered, at 325° for 1-1/2 hours.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil; cook until glaze is reduced by half. Remove from the heat.
Baste ham with glaze; bake 30 minutes longer or until a thermometer reads 140°, basting twice with glaze. Serve with remaining glaze.
