Description: 
Hearty and full of surprises, this meatloaf is not your average fare. From the oozing chunks of swiss cheese to the combination of vegetables in this meal, every bite has a story to tell.  The unique glaze adds a surprising touch that infuses the entire loaf. My husband declared this the best meatloaf he had ever eaten!
