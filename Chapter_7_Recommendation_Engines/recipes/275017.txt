Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar, packed
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
salt
3 cups oatmeal
1 cup dried cranberries
1 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs and vanilla extract; continue mixing until well blended.
Add flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt to sugar mixture; mix well. Stir in oats, cranberries, and white chocolate chips. Pour into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bars comes out clean, 25 to 28 minutes.
Remove baking pan from the oven and let stand for 30 minutes. Cut into bars.
