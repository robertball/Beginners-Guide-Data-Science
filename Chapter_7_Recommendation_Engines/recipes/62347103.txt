Ingredients:
12 ounces (1 box) jumbo pasta shells (approximately 40 shells)
For the tomato sauce
1 28-ounce can peeled plum tomatoes in juice
1 14-ounce can peeled plum tomatoes in juice
2 teaspoons olive oil
3/4 cup roughly chopped red onion
4 cloves garlic, sliced thin
2 sprigs fresh basil
Salt
Pepper
For the stuffing
1-pound bag baby spinach
Salt and pepper
2 teaspoons olive oil, plus extra for serving
2 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise and sliced thin
2 scallions, chopped
2 cups (16 ounces) part-skim ricotta cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded reduced-fat, part-skim mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Pinch grated nutmeg

Directions:
1. Butter a baking sheet. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the shells, and cook 6 to 7 minutes — they shouldn't fully cook. Drain and immediately transfer to baking sheet; spread out so they don’t stick together.
2. Sauce: pour the tomatoes into a bowl and mash with your hands, or chop. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring for 1 minute. Cover, reduce heat to very low and cook until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. (If vegetables begin to brown, add 2 teaspoons water) Add the tomatoes with juice, basil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer, cover and simmer gently 5 minutes. Then simmer very gently, partially covered, until thickened, about 20 minutes. Season with 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Scrape into another container with a rubber spatula; set aside.
3. Add the spinach and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the skillet. Place over medium heat, cover and cook, tossing every now and then with tongs for even cooking, until wilted, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain, and let cool, then squeeze out as much liquid as you can, and chop. Transfer to a bowl; set aside.
4. In the same skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the zucchini and 1/4 tsp salt and cook, stirring every now and then, until tender and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add scallions during the final 1 minute. Add to the bowl with the spinach. Add the ricotta, the ham, 1/2 cup of the mozzarella, the parsley, 1/8 tsp pepper and the nutmeg, and stir to combine.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Spoon a thin layer of sauce on bottom of two 9-x-13-inch baking dishes. Fill shells with the cheese mixture, (1 TBS/shell). Put in dish, spoon remaining sauce over shells, put 1/2 cup mozzerella and 1/4 cup parmesan over. Cover with foil bake for 25-30 minutes.
