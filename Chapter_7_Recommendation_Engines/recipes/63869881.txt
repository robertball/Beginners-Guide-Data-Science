Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 1/2 Tbl. instant yeast
2 c. warm water
1/3 c. honey (100 grams)
3 - 4 c. whole wheat flour
1 1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 c. oatmeal
1/4 cup sunflower seeds
5 1/4 cups fresh milled flour
1 Tablespoon vital gluten

Directions:
Combine yeast, water and honey; let sit for 5 minutes or until frothy and bubbly.  Add salt, add-ins and  1 1/2 cups of flour.  Add remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until you get a soft dough.  The dough should barely pull away from the sides of the bowl and it will still be a little sticky.  Knead for 4 minutes on low, cover and let rise until doubled.  Punch down and shape into a large loaf (spray hands with cooking spray).  Put in a greased loaf pan and let rise again until doubled.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

A little different than my original bread, taking away the oil, and adding sunflower seeds.
