Ingredients:
4 tomatoes
1 tablespoon oil
1 finely chopped shallot
1 tablespoon vodka
3 tablespoon cream cheese
2 tablespoons water
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Puree whole tomatoes without their liquid in a food mill. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a small sauce pan over medium heat. Add the pureed tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and simmer, stirring frequently until the sauce is concentrated, about 20 minutes. Set aside.
Heat the remaining tbsp oil in another sauce pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften. Add the vodka, cream cheese, and water and stir well. Add tomato sauce, and simmer until the flavors blend, 2 to 3 minutes.
