Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
5 tablespoons butter, divided
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 ounces processed cheese food (eg. Velveeta), cubed
2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Cook macaroni according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Stir in flour, salt and pepper until smooth. Gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat. Add the cheeses, stirring until cheese is melted. Drain macaroni.
Transfer macaroni to a greased 1-1/2-qt. baking dish. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni; mix well. Melt the remaining butter; add the bread crumbs. Sprinkle over top. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes or until heated through and topping is golden brown.
