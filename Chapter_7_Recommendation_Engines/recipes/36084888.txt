Ingredients:
3 TBS olive oil
2 heads broccoli
1/2 cup water
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
pinch of crushed red pepper
2 TBS lemon juice

Directions:
In a large, deep skillet, heat 2 TBS of olive oil.  Add broccoli, cut side down, cover and cook over moderate heat until richly browned on the bottom, about 8 minutes.  Add the water, cover and cook until the broccoli is just tender and the water has evaporated, about 7 minutes.
Add the remaining TBS of olive oil to the skillet along with the garlic and crushed red pepper.  Cook until the garlic is golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, drizzle with the lemon juice and serve.
