Ingredients:
2 Tbsp canola oil
2 onions, cut into 1/2 inch dice
5 tsp curry powder
1 medium head cauliflower, broken into small florets
1 (15 oz.) can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
2 (10 oz.) cans diced tomatoes with green chiles
1 (14 oz.) can unsweetened coconut milk
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
salt (to taste)
pepper (to taste)
cayenne pepper (to taste)

Directions:
Add canola oil to a large skillet and heat over medium high heat. Add the onions and saute until golden, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle the curry powder over and stir for about 30 seconds. Add the cauliflower and stir. Add in the tomatoes, coconut milk and garbanzo beans. Stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes, until the mixture has thickened slightly and the the cauliflower is tender. Remove the lid and taste, adding additional salt, pepper and cayenne pepper as needed. Garnish with cilantro.
