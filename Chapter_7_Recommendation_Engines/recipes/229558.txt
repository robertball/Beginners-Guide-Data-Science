Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound bulk sausage
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1/2 cup chopped green onion (optional)
8 eggs
2/3 cup instant potato flakes
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 36 mini muffin cups with cooking spray.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and crumble in sausage. Cook and stir until sausage is crumbly and evenly browned, about 10 minutes . Drain and discard any excess grease.
Sprinkle sausage, Cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, and green onion evenly into the prepared muffin cups.
Beat eggs, potato flakes, and cream together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture evenly over the sausage-cheese mixture in the muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until quiches are set in the middle and lightly browned, about 22 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
A great easy cook ahead dish. I like to make these for my boys to eat for breakfast on the go. Good reheated in the microwave. They freeze wonderfully. I often make these with bratwurst sausage and a teaspoon of leftover KnorrÂ® vegetable-spinach dip. Add mushrooms or olives if you like. You can get creative with ingredients.
