1/4 cup barbeque sauce
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided

salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup diced green onions, divided
4 English muffins, split

Preheat the broiler.
In a large saucepan over medium heat, whisk together hoisin sauce, barbeque sauce, ginger and 1 tablespoon sesame oil. Mix in turkey, salt, pepper and green onions, gently tossing until all ingredients are well blended. Cook approximately 10 minutes.
In a small bowl, mix the remaining sesame oil and remaining green onions. Brush the cut sides of the English muffins lightly with the mixture. Place the muffin halves face up on a medium baking sheet.
Broil English muffins 2 minutes, or until lightly toasted. Remove from heat and top with turkey mixture. Serve warm.
