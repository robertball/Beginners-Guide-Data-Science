Ingredients:
3 cups old-fashioned oats
1 cup almonds, chopped
1/2 cup raw sunflower seeds
1/2 cup coconut flakes
1/4 cup brown rice flour
1/4 cup coconut flour (such as Bob's Red MillÂ®)
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3/4 cup almond milk
1/2 cup brown rice syrup
1/4 cup blackstrap molasses
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
1 tablespoon Madagascar vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Place oats, almonds, sunflower seeds, coconut flakes, cocoa powder, salt, cardamom, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Mix until thoroughly combined.
Combine almond milk, brown rice syrup, molasses, coconut oil, and vanilla extract in a large measuring cup. Stir into the oats mixture with a large spoon until evenly coated. Spread onto 2 large baking sheets.
Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven, stirring every 30 minutes, until dry and crunchy, about 2 hours. Turn off heat; leave granola in the oven until cool enough to handle, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
I was having a hard time finding a commercial gluten-free granola that wasn't too sweet, and that didn't have fruit in it. This recipe is my take on a bowl of heaven! I keep it in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag, in the freezer. Taste test for sweetness before baking!
