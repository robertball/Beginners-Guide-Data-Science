Ingredients:
3 (32 ounce) packages sauerkraut, drained
2 Granny Smith apples, sliced
1/2 large onion, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon caraway seeds
1 cup apple cider, divided
1/4 cup brown sugar
Rub:
1 tablespoon Thai seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (5 pound) boneless pork loin roast

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Mix sauerkraut, apples, onion, and caraway seeds in a large roasting pan. Stir 1/4 cup apple cider and brown sugar together in a separate bowl; pour over sauerkraut mixture.
Stir Thai seasoning, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a small bowl; rub onto the top and bottom of the roast.
Make an indentation in the center of the sauerkraut mixture and place the seasoned roast in the indentation. Pour the remaining apple cider around the roast.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour; baste roast with juices. Continue baking roast, basting every 30 minutes, until cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
Pork and sauerkraut is the traditional New Year's Day meal here in Pennsylvania Dutch Land. This is my rendition of that holiday meal. 
I usually serve it with mashed potatoes and applesauce.
