Ingredients:
3/4 cup cold water
3/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons vinegar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper
1 (4 pound) package country-style pork ribs
water, to cover

Directions:
Stir cold water, ketchup, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, paprika, chili powder, and black pepper together in a large pot. Add ribs to the pot. Pour enough water into the pot to cover the ribs completely.
Bring the water to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until ribs are tender, about 90 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook ribs on preheated grill, basting frequently with sauce, until browned, 12 to 15 minutes.

Just the best. Ribs can be simmered the day before then finished on the grill. Bring ribs to near room temp before grilling.
