Ingredients:
1-1/2 C honey
2 C white sugar
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. cloves
1 tsp. cardamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1-1/2 pkg Neunerlei Lebkuchen Gewurz (purchase at Delicatessen)
1 C margarine
1/3 C sour cream
5-1/2 c flour
3 tsp baking soda

Directions:
Bake @ 325 degrees for 9 minutes (soft) or 12 - 15 minutes (hard).
Warm honey in microwave and add sugar and spices. Once blended, cool mixture to room temperature.
Melt margarine and add sour cream. Add to honey mixture.
Sift together flour and baking soda and add to the honey/spice mixture and mix well. This is a heavy batter, suggest using a heavy duty stand mixer.
Place in fridge overnight to cool. the dough will be quite hard in the morning.
Roll dough into rolls (snakes) that are about 1/2" in diameter.  slice the rolls to produce "nubs" that are about 1/2" wide
place "nubs" on a greased cookie sheet (or use parchment paper) and leave enough space for cookies to expand slightly.
bake at 325F for 10 - 15 minutes
Once baked, leave cookies on sheet 2 - 3  minutes, then remove from pan.
cookies will keep for weeks and will harden as they sit out.

Delicious Mennonite/German cookie, perfect for dunking in coffee or tea!
for a softer cookie, don't bake as long - the longer they bake, the harder they get.
