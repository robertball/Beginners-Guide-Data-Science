Ingredients:
2 eggplants, halved lengthwise
1/2 cup olive oil, divided
1 small onion, chopped
2 large cloves garlic, chopped
2 cups fresh spinach
3/4 cup crushed garlic-herb croutons
1/4 cup grated Parmesan-Romano cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Scoop flesh out of eggplants and chop the flesh, reserving the skins.
Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chopped eggplant; cook and stir until eggplant is softened, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and cook until slightly wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir crushed croutons into eggplant mixture until evenly combined. Add remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, Parmesan-Romano cheese, salt, and black pepper; mix well.
Place eggplant skins in a shallow baking dish and fill each with eggplant mixture. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over each stuffed eggplant. Pour enough hot water into baking dish to reach 1/8-inch up sides of eggplant.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and stuffing is cooked through, about 30 minutes.
