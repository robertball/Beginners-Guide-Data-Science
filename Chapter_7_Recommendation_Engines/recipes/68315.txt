Ingredients:
1 pound raw peanuts, in shells

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread peanuts out on a large baking sheet.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the shells are browned. Watch carefully, the peanuts brown rather suddenly. When cool enough to touch, break open the shells and eat!
