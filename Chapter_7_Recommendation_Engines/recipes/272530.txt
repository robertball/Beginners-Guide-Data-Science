Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/3 cup butter, softened
1 egg
1 1/2 cups mashed ripe bananas
1 cup sourdough starter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Combine sugar, butter, and egg in a large mixing bowl; beat until creamy. Add mashed bananas, sourdough starter, and vanilla extract; mix well.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir into the banana mixture until just combined. Do not overbeat. Fold in pecans, almonds, and cranberries.
Pour batter into the prepared pan. Let batter rest for about 10 minutes.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 65 minutes.

Description: 
Sourdough starter is an amazing addition to one of my favorite breads. Cranberries are a great addition also. Love to slice and toast it in the morning with a little butter.
