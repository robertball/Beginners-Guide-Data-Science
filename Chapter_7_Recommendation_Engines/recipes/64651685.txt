Ingredients:
1 bunch of kale
sea or kosher salt

Directions:

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Place the kale a large baking sheet then sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of salt and drizzle about 2 teaspoons of oil.  Take your hands and coat each leaf lightly with oil and salt.  (you can add more salt if needed after the baking process).
