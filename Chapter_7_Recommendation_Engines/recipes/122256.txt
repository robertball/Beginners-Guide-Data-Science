Ingredients:
2 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon pepper
1 (5 pound) bone-in pork loin roast
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
GLAZE:
1/2 cup orange marmalade
6 tablespoons orange juice concentrate
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons honey
2 1/4 teaspoons ground mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 garlic cloves, minced

Directions:
Combine rosemary, garlic and pepper; rub over roast. Place roast, fat side up, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours. Arrange oranges over roast. Combine glaze ingredients; brush over roast. Bake 30 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees (63 degrees C), brushing often with glaze. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
I've taught university-level English for more than 40 years, but cooking is my first love. I especially like to plan and serve elaborate meals for my friends. This spectacular roast is juicy and tender with delightful seasonings and a beautiful glaze.  -Grady Walker, Tulsa, Oklahoma
