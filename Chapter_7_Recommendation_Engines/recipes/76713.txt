Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
10 medium potatoes, peeled and shredded
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove bacon from the pan, and reserve the grease.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and baking powder. Stir in potatoes to make a sticky dough.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and add 2 teaspoons of salt. Squeeze the potato mixture into 6 or 7 dumplings, or your desired size. Drop carefully into the boiling water. Simmer for 45 to 60 minutes. Remove to a platter with a slotted spoon.
Serve with bacon grease brushed over the top, and crumbled bacon. These may also be sliced and fried the next day for another great meal.

Description: 
Norwegian Klub is a dish my mother made when we were growing up. I like to have it topped with bacon grease, and my wife likes them brushed with butter and sprinkled with sugar. Sliced and fried the next day these are a hearty breakfast meal. If you have a grinder, you may grind the potatoes instead of grating.
