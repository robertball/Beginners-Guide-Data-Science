Ingredients:
4 chicken breast halves
1 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp butter ,divided
1/2 tsp dried tarragon
2 shallots ,minced
1 Tbsp butter
1/2 cup dry white wine, divided
1/4 cup Madeira
1/2 cup heavy cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Salt and pepper the chicken breast halves to taste.  Heat the olive oil and 1 Tbsp. of the butter in a nonstick skillet until hot.  Add chicken breast halves to hot oil/butter mixture and brown chicken pieces on both sides.  Before turning chicken, crush half of dried tarragon on chicken pieces; turn pieces to continue browning, crush remaining tarragon over chicken pieces.  Add 1/4 cup white wine to chicken and cover,  turning heat down and simmering over medium-low heat until done, about 10-15 minutes, turning chicken one more time.
Meanwhile, melt 1 Tbsp. butter in a separate small saucepan over low heat.  Add the shallots and saut√© until soft, about 2 minutes.  Add remaining 1/4 cup white wine, bring to a boil, and cook until liquid is reduced to 2 Tbsp., about 3 minutes.  Add the madeira and bring to a boil.
Stir in the heavy cream and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring frequently, until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Pour madeira sauce over cooked chicken, stirring sauce into wine juices until blended.  Serve chicken and sauce over rice pilaf.
