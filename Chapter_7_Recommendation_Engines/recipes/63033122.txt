Ingredients:
4 egg yolks from free range, pastured chickens
1 cup raw heavy cream
2 cups raw half and half
1/8 cup plus 2 tsp sugar, separated, using demarra or evaporated cane juice from natural sources (Rapadura is a good one also)
1 tsp fresh grated nutmeg
4 egg whites from the healthy eggs you got the yolks from.
3 oz good quality Bourbon (optional)

Directions:
In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the egg yolks until they lighten in color.
Gradually add the 1/8 cup sugar and continue to beat until it is completely dissolved.
Add the cream, heavy cream, optional bourbon and nutmeg and stir to combine.
Place the egg whites in the clean bowl of a stand mixer and beat to soft peaks.
With the mixer still running gradually add the 2 teaspoons of sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.
Whisk the egg whites into the mixture. Chill and serve.
