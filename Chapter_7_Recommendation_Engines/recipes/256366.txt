Ingredients:
1/2 head green cabbage, thinly sliced
3 mangoes, peeled and diced
1 large carrot, peeled and grated
1 stalk celery, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced on the diagonal
2 green onions, chopped
1/4 cup smooth unsalted peanut butter
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons water, or more as needed
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
2 teaspoons chopped unsalted dry-roasted peanuts

Directions:
Combine cabbage, mangoes, carrot, celery, and green onions in a large bowl; toss until mixed.
Combine peanut butter, lime juice, water, soy sauce, cilantro, garlic, and ginger in a food processor; blend until smooth and the consistency of rich cream. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons water if dressing seems too thick.
Pour dressing over cabbage mixture; toss to distribute evenly. Sprinkle chopped peanuts on top.

Description: 
The creamy, garlicky dressing for this fiber-rich salad is reminiscent of Thai peanut sauce. For a milder-flavored salad, try savoy or Napa cabbage.
