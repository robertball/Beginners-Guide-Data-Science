Ingredients:
6 oz Cream Cheese
2 egg yolks
2 sticks salted butter (1/2 lb)
2 cups all-purpose or pastry flour
Filling of your choice, homemade or purchased

Directions:
Two hours before work is to begin, remove the cream cheese, eggs, and butter from the refrigerator.  Allow the ingredients to come to room temperature.
Cream together the egg yolks, cream cheese, and butter until smooth.
Slowly, about a 1/4 cup at a time, add the flour. Do not over work the dough.
The dough is ready when it no longer sticks to the hands.  Once this point is reached, pull off about three-quarters of an ounce of dough and roll it in the hands to form a ball.  Place this ball in a baking dish that has been covered with a light sprinkling of table sugar.
Cover the baking dish with a piece of parchment paper.  Then, place the covered dish in the refrigerator for at least two hours to rest and chill.
After the dough balls have rested, remove them, several at a time from the refrigerator.  It is important for the rolling process that they remain chilled.  Place the balls, one at a time on a lightly sugared counter top.  The ball is now rolled out into a thin dough disk about an 1/8 of an inch thick.
The disk is then filled. Spread filling on the disk in a thin layer, leaving about a centimeter around the edge of the disk without filling.
Place the kiffles seam side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Bake in a 350 degree over for about 20 minutes (this time is approximate and can vary).
