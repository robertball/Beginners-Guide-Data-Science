Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup shortening
3 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon lemon extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 pinch salt
2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon lemon extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Blend the white sugar and shortening until light. Beat in the eggs, milk, vanilla and 1 teaspoon lemon extract. Mix until well blended.
Combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the flour mixture to the shortening mixture. Mix until combined (the dough will be sticky). Drop spoonfuls of dough onto parchment paper lined baking sheets.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes. Let cookies cool then frost with icing.
To Make Icing: Combine the confectioners' sugar, water and lemon extract to taste. Beat until smooth and make icing thick enough to spread on cooled cookies

Description: 
This is a favorite cake like lemon cookie of mine given to my mother when I was only 6 yrs. old, from a wonderful lady who lived down the street from us. We have always called them 'her' Lemon Balls... she is passed on now, but this recipe is made by my mother and I every Christmas!
