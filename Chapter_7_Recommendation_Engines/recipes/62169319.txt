Ingredients:
1 cup mashed potatoes (leftovers and cool works great, best if they were prepared simply, not to much milk added to them)
1 cup flour, plus more for kneading
1 egg
1 tbsp butter
salt and pepper

Directions:
Combine potato, flour and egg in bowl until comes together like dough, continue to work on flour surface, roll into long logs, about 1 inch diameter.
Cut into small, quarter size bits and roll again, each one about the size of your pinky finger.
Drop into boiling salted water take out when they float to top, about 5 min.
Fry in butter or margerine add salt and pepper to taste.
Finish how you like. I enjoy adding drained saurkraut, or fried onion and bacon bits.
