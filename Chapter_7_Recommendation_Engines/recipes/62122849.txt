2 tablespoon minced garlic (or to taste)
1/2 cup celery chopped
1 1/2 cup cubed boneless, skinless chicken breast
2 tbls butter
1/4 tsp thyme (dried) or add fresh to your taste
1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
1 tsp sugar
3 cans of broth, I like half chicken, half vegtable,
1/2 cup dry whit wine (if you dont like real wine use cooking wine, more broth, or water)
1 large can tomatoes (cut up, sometimes I use flavored)
8 ounces drid pasta ( I use angel hair)
fresh parmesan cheese
seasoning to taste (salt and pepper)

Directions:
melt butter, add onion and garlic and saute for a couple minutes. add chicken and herbs. cook until chicken done. (upto five minutes)
Add Sugar, liquids, tomatoes, carrots and celery. bring to boil, then reduce heat and simmer 15-20 minutes
If you are going to eat all the soup tonight, add noodles until they are cooked. If you are going to eat over several days cook noodles seperate and add to bottom of bowl, add soup on top, some swiss chard on top of that until heated (2 minutes)
right before serving sprinkle cheese on top.
