Ingredients:
24 pounds tomatoes
1 (12 ounce) can tomato paste
1/2 bunch cilantro
16 jalapeno chile peppers
2 medium heads garlic
6 large green bell peppers, chopped
6 large onions, chopped
9 tablespoons salt
1 cup distilled white vinegar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Core and peel the tomatoes. Remove the tomato seeds and pulp. Put seeds and pulp through a food mill. Chop the outsides of the tomatoes
In a large pot over low heat, boil the milled liquid and tomato paste  for 1 hour, or until the liquid is reduced by 1/3.
In a blender or food processor, puree cilantro, jalapeno, garlic and 1/2 cup of the tomato liquid from the large pot. Slowly stir this mixture into the pot.
Bring the contents of the pot to a boil while mixing in the green peppers, onions, chopped tomatoes, salt, vinegar and brown sugar. In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in water. Add the cornstarch mixture to the pot. Stirring continually, boil the mixture until all the vegetable are soft  -- about 30 minutes. Allow the mixture to cool, and place it in sterile containers.
