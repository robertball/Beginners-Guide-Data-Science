Wash the rice in a sieve under a cold tap.  Peel and chop the onion.  Wash and slice the mushrooms.
Add the onion and rice to the frying pan.  Fry for about 7 minutes, keep stirring so that it does not stick.

Description: 
This recipe is so easy to make, its one of the first recipes I made at high school in England, and I have been making it ever since.  Its perfect to serve on a cold winter night.  I usually serve this risotto with warm tear and share bread and potato wedges.  I even make a vegetarian version by omitting the sausages and using vegetable stock that I serve at summer bbq's and picnics.  I usually double or treble the ingredients and make a large batch and freeze the remainder. (defrost at room temperature and microwave to warm).
