Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 8" pre-made graham cracker pie crust
16 ounces vegan cream cheese (I use tofutti)
1/2 cup turbinado sugar (or use other DRY sugar substitute)
2 tablespoons egg substitute (I use Ener-G do NOT add the water)
2 teaspoons butter flavoring (extract)
1 teaspoon vanilla
Juice of 1/2 lemon (or 1 tablespoon of lemon juice)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Have the crust ready in an 8" pie pan.
Put liquid ingredients into blender first.  Then   slowly add the vegan cream cheese a couple of spoonfuls at a time.  Once all that is running smoothly (you may need to stop the blender to help the cream cheese mix in), slowly add in the egg substitute and the sugar.  Continue to puree a few minutes until smooth and frothy.
Pour into graham cracker crust.
Bake for 40-45 minutes, until set.  Let cool. Chill in refrigerator for 12 hours before serving.
Top with your favorite fruit and serve.
