Ingredients:
cooking spray
3/4 cup bran cereal (such as General Mills® Fiber One®)
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 tart apple, peeled and diced
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups cold apple cider
1/2 cup applesauce
2 eggs
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray two 24-cup mini muffin tins with cooking spray.
Place bran cereal in the bowl of a food processor; process until ground to a flour-like consistency. Transfer to a large bowl. Add flour, apple, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and salt; toss to combine.
Mix together apple cider, applesauce, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to the apple cider mixture and gently mix until combined; batter will appear runny. Allow to rest while baking soda and apple cider cause batter to thicken and double in size, 1 to 2 minutes.
Scoop a small amount of batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool before eating.
