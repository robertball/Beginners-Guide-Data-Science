Ingredients:
8 cups rolled oats
1 cup amaranth
1 cup sunflower seeds
1 cup finely chopped pecans
1 cup finely chopped walnuts
1 cup sliced almonds
1 cup flaxseed meal
1 cup ground chia seeds
1 cup honey
1 cup maple syrup
1 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup butter
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons salt
2 cups raisins
1 cup dried cherries
1/2 cup dried blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
Combine oats, amaranth, sunflower seeds, pecans, walnuts, almonds, flaxseed meal, and ground chia seeds in a very large bowl; stir until thoroughly mixed.
Mix honey, maple syrup, coconut oil, brown sugar, butter, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt together in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook and stir, about 1 minute. Remove maple syrup mixture from heat.
Pour maple syrup mixture over oat mixture in the bowl; stir until oat mixture is moist. Spread evenly on the baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until toasted, stirring mixture halfway through, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a very large bowl. Add raisins, cherries, and blueberries; stir until thoroughly mixed.

Description: 
It took years of tinkering to come up with my own personal favorite granola recipe. Granola recipes are meant to be modified, but maybe you can start with this. Enjoy warm with milk or by itself! Does well in the freezer for several months!
