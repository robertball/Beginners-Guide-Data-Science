Ingredients:
3/4 cup raisins
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup butter, melted
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
2 cups rolled oats

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine the raisins and the water. Cook over medium heat until just boiling, then remove from heat and set aside to cool.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix together the melted margarine, sugar, and eggs. Stir in the vanilla, raisins, and the raisin water. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves; stir into the egg mixture. Then stir in the oatmeal. If the batter seems too runny, let it sit for 5 minutes.
Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 8 minutes in the preheated oven.
