Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil (reserve 1 TBSP)
1\2 recipe for Jay's Signature Pizza Crust
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
5 plum tomatoes, sliced thin
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Coat a 13 by 9-inch sheet pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Spread out the pizza dough to fit the sheet pan.
In a small bowl mix together the Italian seasoning and 2 TBSP of olive oil. Brush the seasoned oil on the dough, making sure to save about 2 teaspoons. Poke dimples about halfway down into the dough with your fingers. Bake about 8 minutes.
Remove the bread from the oven, top with tomato slices, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and bush with remaining oil mixture. Return to the oven and bake until the bread is gold brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. Cut into squares and serve.
