Ingredients:
2 tubes (8 ounces each) refrigerated crescent rolls
1-1/2 cups finely diced fully cooked ham
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1 package (3 ounces) sliced pepperoni, chopped
8 slices provolone cheese
1 jar (12 ounces) roasted sweet red peppers, drained and cut into strips
4 large eggs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 Tbsp Italian salad dressing mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. Unroll one tube of crescent dough into one long rectangle; press onto bottom and 3/4 in. up sides of a greased 13x9-in. baking dish. Seal seams and perforations. Top with half of the ham; layer with Swiss cheese, pepperoni, provolone cheese and remaining ham. Top with red peppers.
In a small bowl, whisk eggs, Parmesan cheese and salad dressing mix; reserve 1/4 cup. Pour remaining egg mixture over peppers.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out remaining crescent dough into a 13x9-in. rectangle; seal seams and perforations. Place over filling; pinch edges to seal.
Bake, covered, for 30 minutes. Uncover; brush with reserved egg mixture. Bake until crust is golden brown, 20-25 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Cut into triangles. Serve warm.
