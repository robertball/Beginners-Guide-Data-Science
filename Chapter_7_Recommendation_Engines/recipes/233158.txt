Ingredients:
3 cups cranberries
2 cups water
1 cup white sugar
1 (6 ounce) package cherry-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-OÂ®)
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, undrained
1 1/2 cups diced apples
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Combine cranberries and water in a saucepan. Bring the water to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook until all the cranberries have softened and popped, 5 to 7 minutes; remove from heat to cool slightly.
Stir sugar and gelatin into the cranberry mixture until dissolved completely. Add pineapple with juice, apples, and walnuts into the cranberry mixture; pour into a 2-quart serving bowl.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled and firm, 3 to 4 hours.

Description: 
My mom has made this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas for as long as I can remember, and now I am the one making it for her to continue the tradition. We always use frozen cranberries, but fresh works fine too. Don't ever settle for cranberry salad from a can when you can make something this tasty so easy. I've had many people say they don't like cranberries but love this!
