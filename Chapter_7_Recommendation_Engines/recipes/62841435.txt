Ingredients:
6 cloves chopped garlic
8 cups vegetable broth
2 cups shredded cabbage
1 large crown broccoli, chopped into florets
1 large head cauliflower, chopped into florets
1 can chopped tomatoes, drained
1/2 cup finely grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place large soup pot on stove and turn burner to "high."
Add garlic and cook until it begins to sizzle.
Add about 1 cup of veggie broth and mix.
Add cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and tomatoes.
Cover and bring to a boil.
Turn burner down to "simmer."  Cook, covered, for about an hour or until broccoli and cauliflower are crisp-tender (or until it is all mush, if you have recently been deprived of your wisdom teeth, tonsils, etc.).  Stir occationally.
Remove from stove and ladle into individual serving bowls as desired.  Sprinkle with parmesan cheese.
Eat up!

Description: 
During the cold part of the year I often halve this recipe and eat the whole pot throughout the day!  It is incredibly easy and suitable for all types of veggies (the following is just my favorite combination).  It is also wonderful if you're feeling not up to snuff or if you've been eating too much rich food.  When I had my wisdom teeth removed I only used cabbage and cauliflower and cooked it until it turned to mush... and it was still delicious!
