Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup butter
2 eggs
2 tablespoons milk
5 cups sliced fresh or frozen rhubarb
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-OÂ®
2 cups white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.
In a large bowl, stir together 2 cups of flour and baking powder. Cut in 1/2 cup of butter by pinching between your fingers or using a fork or pastry cutter until the mixture is crumbly. Stir in the egg and milk just until the mixture is moistened. Pat into the bottom of the prepared pan. Spread rhubarb over the crust in an even layer, then sprinkle the dry gelatin powder over the rhubarb.
Prepare the topping by stirring together 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup flour. Cut in 1/2 cup of butter as you did for the crust. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the rhubarb.
Bake in the preheated oven until the topping is golden brown and the rhubarb is tender enough to easily pierce with a fork, about 45 minutes. Cool and then cut into bars to serve.
