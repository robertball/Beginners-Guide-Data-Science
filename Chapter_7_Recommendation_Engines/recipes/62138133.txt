3 tabelspoons lemon juice
3 cups sugar
1/2 teaspoon cimmamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a large pot. Stir and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir occasionally for about 15 minutes.
Once boiled, use an electric blender or a potato masher to reduce peaches to prefered size and texture. Continue to boil for 10 minutes.
Reduce heat and ladle into hot sterile jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Wipe rims with a clean damp cloth, and seal jars with rings and sterile lids.
Turn all jars over, lid side down; for about 1 minute. After one minute return jars right side up for a proper seal. Let stand for up to 12 hours, or until all jars have been sealed.
