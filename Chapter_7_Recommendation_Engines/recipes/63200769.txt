Description: 
This is the best cold Rhubarb desert recipe I’ve found, and it's so easy. I have to give thank's to Nikki for adapting this recipe! Even my son who dislikes Rhubarb loves this one. Adapted from the diabetic/weight watcher version (Rhubarb Rumble). I like to make this in a 11 X 7 -  2 Qt. glass pan, making my own Graham Cracker Crust. The addition of fresh Strawberries adds an extra layer of lusciousness. It ends up being a very PRETTY IN PINK desert. The hard part is waiting for it to chill.
