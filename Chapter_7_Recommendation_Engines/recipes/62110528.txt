Ingredients:
1 package of lean ground chicken breast
1/2 medium onion chopped
1 large clove of garlic minced
1/4 c. romano cheese
1/4 c. Italian style bread crumbs (or more if needed)
1/2 tsp. dried oregano
1/2 tsp. dried basil
15 fresh basil leaved chopped
pepper to taste
2 tsp. olive oil

Directions:
In a small pan sautee onion and garlic in olive oil until tender about 5-7 minutes. Set aside and let cool. Meanwhile in a large bowl combine lean ground chicken, grated cheese, bread crumbs, dried oregano and basil, chopped fresh basil leaves and pepper to taste. Add cooled onions and garlic and fold them in. To avoid this mixture from sticking to your hands, I suggest you wet both hands first, then form into 4 patties. Spray a heated grill with non-stick cooking spray and place patties on grill. Cook on each side for about 5-6 minutes or unitl meat is no longer pink. Serve with or without the bun, top with grilled veggies or extra cheese. Enjoy!

Description: 
While this burger is healthy, it is huge on flavor. The fresh basil makes this burger a hit. I enjoy this with grilled red peppers on top, my daughter loves hers dipped in my homemade spaghetti sauce! Anyway you top it, you will be sure to love it, puts a whole new spin on ground chicken.
