Ingredients:
salt
1/2 small celery root, peeled and cut into chunks
1 large parsnips, peeled and cut into chunks
3 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
3 red-skinned potatoes, or as desired, peeled and cut into large chunks
1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained and rinsed
3 hard-boiled eggs, cooled and cut into 1/4-inch pieces
2 dill pickles, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1/2 cup reduced-fat olive oil mayonnaise
1/2 cup fat-free Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place celery root, parsnips, carrots, and potatoes in a saucepan; cover with water and add salt. Bring to a boil; cook until vegetables are fork-tender but still firm in the center, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove smaller pieces so they do not overcook. Drain and allow to cool until safe to handle, 5 to 7 minutes. Cut vegetables into 1/4-inch pieces.
Combine cooked root vegetables, peas, eggs, pickles, in a large bowl. Add mayonnaise, yogurt, and mustard. Mix gently, taking care not to crush the peas. Season salad with salt and pepper.
Refrigerate salad at least 8 hours to overnight.

Description: 
This is a great alternative to potato salad or coleslaw, an unexpected combination of ingredients that create a depth of flavor that will please any palate! Even with some healthier modifications, it sill tastes just like the one my Polish grandmother used to make. Serve with Polish sausage and some rye bread for a delicious lunch. Garnish with paprika and serve cold. Enjoy!
