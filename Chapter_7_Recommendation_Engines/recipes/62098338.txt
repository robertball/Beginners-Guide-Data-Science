Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons olive oil
4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
2 tsp. Italian herb mix
2 tsp Morton Nature's Season salt
1 medium onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 cups chicken stock or broth
8 ounces cream cheese
1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated
2 cups whole milk
1 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced or quartered
1 cup fresh broccoli florets
1/2 pound dry fettucini
4 quarts water

Directions:
In a large pot, start your water for the pasta.
While heating a large saute pan, season you chiken with seasoning salt and Italian herb mix. Add olive oil to your hot pan and sear your chiken. Let the chiken cook until golden brown. After the chicken is browned set aside. Drain some of the oil from your pan.
Add onion, garlic and mushrooms to the pan and saute for about 5 minutes. Add your chicken stock or broth and let reduce by half.
Add your cream cheese, parmesan cheese and milk. Whisk until smooth. Add your chicken (and any juices that have collected) back to the pan. Coat chicken with sauce, add your broccoli and cover. Let simmer on low heat. The sauce will continue to thicken a bit.
Cook your pasta according to directions.When it's done, add your pasta right to your pan. Any water on the pasta will help thin the sauce. Stir together and serve with a nice hot pan of dinner rolls or garlic bread.

This is a family favorite for a fancy midweek meal. As a new mom, I love recipes that please everybody and require little prep. For a fancy variation, add a little white wine to your sauce.
