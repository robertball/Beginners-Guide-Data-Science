Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 onion, cut into small dice
1 red bell pepper, cut into small dice
1 green bell pepper, cut into small dice
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/2 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 3/4 cups water
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans
1 (15.5 ounce) can kidney beans
1 (15.5 ounce) can chickpeas
Sour cream, shredded Cheddar cheese, fresh cilantro leaves (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a heavy 6-quart pot over medium heat. Cook onion, bell peppers, jalapeno, garlic, and salt, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in chili powder, cumin, oregano, tomato paste, tomatoes, and water and simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 20 minutes.
