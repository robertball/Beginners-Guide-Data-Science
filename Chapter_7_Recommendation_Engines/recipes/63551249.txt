Ingredients:
3 cups White Whole Wheat Flour or Whole Wheat Flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons sugar
2 large eggs
3 cups lukewarm milk
2/3 cup melted butter or vegetable oil
2 tablespoons wheat germ (optional)
2 tablespoons flax meal (optional)

Directions:
Preheat your iron while you make the waffle batter.
Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and wheat germ/flax meal if desired.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and butter or oil.
Mix together the wet and dry ingredients, stirring just until combined. The batter will be a bit lumpy; that's OK.
Cook the waffles as directed in the instructions that came with your waffle iron.
