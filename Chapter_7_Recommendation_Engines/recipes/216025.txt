Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 cups raw whole pumpkin seeds, washed and dried
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter, then stir in the seeds. Cook, stirring constantly, until the seeds turn slightly brown in color, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Drain off any excess butter, and stir in the cinnamon, nutmeg, and maple syrup until the seeds are thoroughly coated with spices. Spread the seeds out onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until crisp and golden brown, stirring every 10 minutes, for 30 to 45 total minutes of baking time.
