Ingredients:
1/2 gallon fresh apple cider
1 cup apple brandy (optional)
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch salt
10 thin strips orange zest
10 small cinnamon sticks

Directions:
Combine apple cider, apple brandy, 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, and salt in a pot over medium-high heat. Simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
Pour apple cider mixture into heat-proof mugs. Twist orange zest strips between your fingers to release the essential oils; drop 1 into each mug. Add 1 cinnamon stick to each mug.
