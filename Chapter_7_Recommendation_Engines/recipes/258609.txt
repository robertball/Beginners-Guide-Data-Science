Ingredients:
2 (14.5 ounce) cans Del Monte® Diced Tomatoes, not drained
1 (8 ounce) can Del Monte® Tomato Sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can Del Monte® Cut Green Beans, drained
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano, divided
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
3 cups dry rotini pasta
4 (6 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup finely crushed garlic croutons

Directions:
Combine diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, green beans, 1 tsp. oregano, garlic powder and 3/4 cup water in a deep 12-inch skillet. Bring to a boil; add pasta, stir and reduce heat to a simmer.
Place chicken breasts over pasta. Cover and simmer on medium-low heat 10 minutes. Turn chicken and stir pasta. Sprinkle chicken with Parmesan and remaining oregano. Cover and simmer an additional 5 to 10 minutes or until pasta is done and chicken is no longer pink inside.
Sprinkle chicken with croutons before serving.  Gently stir pasta and season to taste with salt and pepper, if desired.
