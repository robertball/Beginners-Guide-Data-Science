Ingredients:
2 Cups Crunch Peanut Butter
2 Cups Powder Sugar
2 Cups Crispy Rice Cereal
2 Tablespoons Corn Syrup
4 Tablespoons Melted Buter
12 oz Plymouth Pantry Almond Bark (Chocolate Flavored coating) or 1 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips - Melted

Directions:
Mix Peanut Butter, Cereal, Powdered Sugar, Melted Butter and Corn Syrup until well blended.
I recommend that you mix with your hands as it provides the best texture.
Press into a 9X13 inch pan lined with plastic wrap or waxed paper.
Cover mixture evenly with melted Almond Bark
Let set until chocolate is solidified and cut into bars.
Enjoy!

Description: 
The local school district made these in all of the Jr. High Schools. They were $.25 each. My friends and I ate at least one per day.....
The schools are no longer permitted to make these due to peanut allergies and sugar content; however, after years of searching and asking we finally have the recipe which is good enough to share with all of you.

We from our family and childhood friends hope you enjoy them as much as we do.
