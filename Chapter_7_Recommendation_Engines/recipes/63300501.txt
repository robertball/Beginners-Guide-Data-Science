Ingredients:
1 cup yellow mustard
1 cup vegetable oil
2 1/2 cups dried chopped onions (8 oz by weight)
5 cups warm water
10 oz bottle Worcestershire sauce
1 cup catsup
6 Tbs tomato paste
3/4 cup chili sauce
6 Tbs sugar
1/4 cup margarine
2 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp Louisiana hot sauce
1 tsp chili powder

Directions:
Pour warm water over the dried onions in a bowl and allow to rehydrate for 30 minutes.
Into a pot of suitable size, put the all of the ingredients, including the onion water, and simmer for 2 hours or more, until the onions are very soft.
For basting sauce, take a portion of the sauce and add an equal amount of vegetable oil and heat. Use the top part of this mixture (the oil) for basting on the grill. The thicker sauce on the bottom can be painted on the meat during the last few minutes of cooking or served with the meat as a table sauce.
