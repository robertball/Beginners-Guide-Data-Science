Ingredients:
3 cans of pinto beans
5 slices of bacon, chopped
4 smoked sausage links, chopped (can substitute with hot dogs, but sausage adds more flavor)
1 onion, chopped
1 tomato, chopped
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3 jalapeño peppers, chopped and remove seeds (optional)
salt to taste
water as needed (about 2-3 cups)

Directions:
First, pour the beans and water into a large pot and set on low heat.
Chop your sausage, bacon and onion into small bit size pieces and put in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Once the meats are cooked through, add the chopped tomato, chopped jalapeño pepper and chopped cilantro to the skillet and let it simmer over low heat for five minutes.
Add all of the contents of the skillet to the pot of beans and stir.
The water should cover the beans at least two inches, if it is less than that, add more water.
Add salt to taste.
Serve hot, enjoy!

This is mother-in-law's original recipe she brought over from northern Mexico. It is absolutely fabulous and was the first authentic Mexican dish I fell in love with. If you are not comfortable with Mexican cooking, try this and get your foot in the door. It is so easy!
