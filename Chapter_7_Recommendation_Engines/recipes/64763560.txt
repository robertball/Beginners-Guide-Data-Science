Ingredients:
1 c Milk
2 tsp White Vinegar
2 c AP Flour
2 T White Sugar
1 tsp Cinnamon
Pinch Salt
1/2 tsp Baking Soda
1 tsp Baking Powder
1 tsp Vanilla
2 T melted Butter, cooled.
2 Eggs, lightly beaten

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine milk and vinegar.  Stir. Rest as is for 10 minutes.  Mixture will curdle, sour and thicken a little.
In a medium bowl, combine dry ingredients and stir well.  Set aside.
Add egg to milk mixture,  stir well.
Add butter to milk mixture,  stir well.
Add milk mixture to flour mixture.
*** Batter will be heavy, moist, though airy.
( It will not be runny or like typical pancake batter. )
If batter feels too heavy or dense to incorporate flour mixture, add 1 tsp milk at a time.  Batter should stay heavy.
Heat a non-stick skillet on low heat for 3 minutes, then coat with non-stick spray or 1 tsp butter.  Once melted,  use a 1/4 c measuring scoop to drop in batter-dough.  It will be thick and will not want to spread out. This is correct!
After 1 minute, or when bottom of cake is medium brown and toasty, turn over. Cake will be high.
Then use the back side of a spatula to press out dough to the height of an English muffin or scone.
Continue to toastl in skillet for another 1 or 2 minutes on low.
Once you can press lightly on top and cake springs back quickly, they are done.
Guests love them plain, but some love squeezed lemon juice and powdered sugar, preserves or just butter.

Description: 
Scone meets English muffin, meets pancake!
Made with soured milk, a hint of vanilla and cinnamon, these are tender, dense and just under an inch in height.  Moist??
Wonderful as-is, or with a drizzle of syrup and jam. Addictive??
