Ingredients:
parchment paper
6 bell peppers
2 cups prepared meat and tomato sauce
3/4 cup ricotta cheese
5 ounces freshly grated mozzarella cheese
aluminum foil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking dish with parchment paper.
Cut the tops off of the peppers and carefully remove the seeds and ribs.
Spoon 2 tablespoons meat and tomato sauce into the bottom of each pepper. Top with 1 tablespoon ricotta cheese and 2 tablespoons mozzarella cheese. Layer the remaining sauce between the peppers, then the remaining ricotta, and mozzarella. Place peppers into the prepared baking dish and tent with aluminum foil, making sure the foil is not touching any of the peppers.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese has melted and is slightly browned, about 20 minutes.

This is my favorite baked pepper recipe that is keto and quick to put together. The bell peppers are stuffed with store-bought meat and tomato sauce, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese and then baked in the oven. Super easy!
