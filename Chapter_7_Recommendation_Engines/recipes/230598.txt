Description: 
This recipe I revised from my grandma's Christmas angel roll-out cookies. They are sort of cakey, but this can be reduced by omitting half of the cream of tartar, though I prefer them thick and soft. Top with your favorite cream cheese or basic cookie frosting. I find it's best with almond extract and coconut on top. Enjoy!
