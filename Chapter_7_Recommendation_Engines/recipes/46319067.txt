Directions:
Mix together graham cracker crumbs, margarine, and sugar in a bowl until well incorporated and crumbly.  Press into a pie plate, going up the sides as much as possible.
Beat together the cream cheese, sugar, lemon juice and vanilla in a bowl until smooth and spreadable. Mix Cool Whip into cream cheese mixture until smooth.  Pour into prepared crust.  Smooth the top with a spatula, and refrigerate until firm, about 2 to 3 hours.  Spread the cherry pie filling over the top, and refrigerate until serving.
