Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) pie pumpkin, halved and seeded
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups unsweetened applesauce
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
3 unbaked pie shells

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray cut sides of pumpkin with cooking spray. Place cut-side down on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Let cool, about 20 minutes.
Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Scoop cooked pumpkin into a bowl. Add sugar, applesauce, coconut milk, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, salt, and ground cloves; beat with an electric mixer until smooth.
Divide pumpkin mixture among pie shells.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees (175 degrees C) and continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes more. Let cool completely on a wire rack, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a modification of my mother's from-scratch pumpkin pie recipe. I'm not vegan myself, but I made this variant for some vegan friends and loved it so much that I don't make the original recipe any more.
