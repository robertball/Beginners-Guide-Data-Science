Ingredients:
½ cup butter
½ cup shortening (or butter)
1 cup granulated sugar
½ cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 Tbsp. vanilla
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
½ salt
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F.
In bowl, beat butter and shortening; gradually beat in granulated and brown sugars until smooth. Beat in eggs and vanilla. In separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda and salt, and stir into butter mixture. Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls, about 2 inches apart, onto parchment paper-lined or greased rimless baking sheets. With fork, flatten to ½-inch thickness. Bake in oven for 15 minutes or until edges are golden and centers are still slightly underbaked. Let cool on pans on racks for 5 minutes. Transfer to racks; let cool completely. (Make ahead: Layer between waxed paper in airtight container and store at room temperature for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 2 weeks.)
