Ingredients:
1 can ready to spread frosting, any flavor
1 large bag chocolate chips, any flavor
nuts if desired
Assorted garnished and decorations of your choice

Directions:
Pour frosting and chips in a pan or double boiler or in a pan over hot water.
Heat and stir until the chips are completely melted.
Line a baking dish with foil trying to smooth all the wrinkles. Make sure the foil comes up above the top of the dish; this will be your handles to remove the fudge from the pan.
Stir in lightly toasted nuts if you are using them stir quickly to blend.
When your pour the fudge mixture into the dish you want it to be about 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick.
Place dish in refrigerator until firm. Remove from frig and sit it on the counter.
Gently lift the fudge from the pan using the foil sticking up and place on a flat surface such as a cutting board. Fold the foil down so it is now flat and the sides of the fudge are exposed.
With a clean, sharp, wet knife cut fudge into desired pieces.
Before the fudge goen into the fridge to harden you can decorate many ways; top each piece with a whole toasted pecan, crushed candy cane, Junior Mints, Junior Caramels (same as Junior mints except they have caramel in them). You could sprinkle the top with crushed mixed nuts. Just let your imagination run and make something that will really WOW them. You could drizzle the top with a pretty glaze.
