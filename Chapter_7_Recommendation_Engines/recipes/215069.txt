2 tablespoons lemon juice

Description: 
I hate mayo, but I love hummus and tahini. People are always asking for the recipe. The tahini gives it a Middle Eastern feel and the lemon, garlic, and ginger flavors really give it a kick! Easy to make, just needs a blender or a food processor. Experiment by adding a bit more lemon or a bit less garlic, or adding ground mint. Works well on anything, especially on simple salads.
