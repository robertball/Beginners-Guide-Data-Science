1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup dark brown sugar, or to taste (optional)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups.
Mix bananas, 3/4 cup brown sugar, milk, butter, egg, and vanilla extract together with a stand mixer; add baking mix, pecans, xanthan gum, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt and mix on Low until just combined into a batter. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle additional brown sugar over the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
These dessert muffins are moist and flavorful. Perfect for tea time. You would never guess they are gluten-free! They taste best served warm, but you can also reheat cakes in microwave before serving after they cool.
