Title:
Ham Salad with a Schmear Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 Cups cooked ham (leftover is best but boiled or chopped works too)
1/2 onion
3 or 4 cloves garlic
1 package Cream Cheese
1 1/2 cups Mayonnaise
Sweet Gherkin relish to taste
Stone Ground mustard to taste

Directions:
The easiest way to do this is use a food processor.  That's how I do it.  A regular knife and mixing spoon work too...
Place ham in food processor (or finely chop) with onion and garlic.  You want a nice meaty consistency with no big chunks.  Place in mixing bowl and set aside.
Add cream cheese, relish, mustard and mayo to processor.  Blend well.  (Or just add them to the ham and mix with a spoon.)
Adjust ingredients to taste, serve with crackers or make sandwiches.
