Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
4-1/2 tsp white sugar
1-1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
4-1/2 tsp shortening
1-1/2 tsp salt
3-1/4 cups all purpose flour
8 tbsp butter (softened)
2/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Stir in shortening, salt and two cups of the flour.
Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil, cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough into a rectangle 1/4 inch thick.
Beat the butter until creamy and light, about 3 minutes. In a small bowl mix the sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon.
Spread the butter on the dough and sprinkle with the sugar mixture.
Starting with the long side, roll the dough into a log. Cut the log into 12 pieces and place cut side up 1 inch apart on a baking sheet.
Let them rest for 30 minutes, Bake on 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes.
