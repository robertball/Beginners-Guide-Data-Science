Ingredients:
Dough:
2 Cups Water
1 Tbsp Salt
4 Tbsp Vegetable Oil
2 Lbs Flour
Filling:
2 Tbsp Oil
2 Onions, Minced
1 Lb Beef Stew Meat, finely chopped
1 Bunch Scallions, minced
1 Tbsp Crushed Black Pepper
1 tsp Cumin
2 Hard-Boiled Eggs, coarsely chopped
2 Tbsp Paprika

Directions:
Dough:
Combine water, salt, and oil in saucepan and bring to boil. Transfer to bowl and let cool. When cool, incorporate flour slowly, in 4 parts, until doughy. Transfer to flat surface, knead as needed so dough does not stick to work surface. Dough should be hard and dry. Let rest 30 minutes, then flatten with rolling pin. With round mold, cut out 5-inch disks from dough.
Filling:
Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute about 1 minute. Add beef and saute about 1 minute. Remove from heat and transfer to bowl. Stir in scallions, pepper, cumin,eggs, paprika, and salt to taste. Refrigerate until completely cool.
Preheat oven to 375F. To form empanadas, put dallop of filling in middle of each disk. Moisten with water, fold over and seal empanadas around edges with fork or fingers. Bake until empanadas are lightly toasted, about 15 to 20 minutes.
