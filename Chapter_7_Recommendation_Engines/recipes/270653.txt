Ingredients:
4 ounces spaghetti, or as needed
Sauce:
2 cups very cold ice water
1/2 cup white vinegar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons sambal oelek (chile paste)
1/2 teaspoon salt
Garnish:
1 cucumber, cut into matchsticks
1/2 cup kimchi
1/4 cup roasted peanuts
1 hard-cooked egg, halved (optional)
2 slices deli ham, cut into bite-sized pieces (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine ice water, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, and sambal oelek in a bowl. Refrigerate sauce to chill until spaghetti is cooked.
Rinse cooked spaghetti in cold water until totally cooled off; drain well.
Divide sauce between 2 chilled servings bowls. Add equal amounts of spaghetti, cucumber, kimchi, peanuts, egg, and ham to each bowl. Serve immediately.

Description: 
A Korean dish, popular in northern China. I ate this for lunch every day for an entire year when I lived in Jinzhou, China. The cook was certain that eating this cold dish during the cold northern winter would be bad for my stomach, but it never was!

 This makes a wonderfully refreshing lunch during the hot summertime.
