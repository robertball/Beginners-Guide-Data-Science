Description: 
This delicious smoothie is for the foodie who loves fruit and good health. It can replace a meal. It's easy, delicious, and inexpensive. Add or replace ingredients to give it your own unique touch! I usually just eyeball the ingredients, so adjust them to your preference, although I feel the amounts are fairly accurate. In other words, don't sweat the measurements. Have fun and be healthy!
