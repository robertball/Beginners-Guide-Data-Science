Description: 
I love Asian flavours and slow-cooked pulled pork. On a whim, I decided to combine these two loves without a recipe. I just picked my favourite Asian sauces and spices and created an amazing fork-tender Asian pulled pork that goes great over rice, quinoa or in a lettuce wrap! You have to like spice for this one!
