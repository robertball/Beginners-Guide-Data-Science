2 c. water
1 lb lean ground beef (80/20; next time use 1.5 lbs beef)
2 c. onion, chopped
6 oz. tomato paste
1/2 c. ketchup
2 T. Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Heat water and ground beef in a large pot over high heat.  Once boiling, add onion.  Break meat into small pieces.
Add tomato paste, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and the spices and stir together, making sure all meat is broken up into small pieces.
Stirring occasionally, simmer over low heat until chili is very thick, about 15-20 minutes.
Serve over hotdogs and garnish with cheddar cheese.
