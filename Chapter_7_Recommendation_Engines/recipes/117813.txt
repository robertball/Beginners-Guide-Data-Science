Ingredients:
2 pounds pork tenderloin, cut into 1 inch cubes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can reduced-sodium chicken broth
2 pounds red potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 cup sliced fresh carrots
1 cup sliced celery
1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 teaspoons sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons dried tarragon
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup fat-free milk
1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet, cook pork in oil until no longer pink; remove and keep warm. In the same pan, saute onion and garlic until crisp-tender. Add the broth, vegetables, vinegar, sugar, tarragon and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 25-30 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
Combine flour and milk until smooth; gradually stir into vegetable mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add pork and heat through. Reduce heat; stir in sour cream just before serving.

Description: 
This thick, creamy stew is one my family requests often. It does an especially good job of warming us up on cold winter days. --Janet Allen of Decatur, Illinois
