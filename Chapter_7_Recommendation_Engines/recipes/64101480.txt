Ingredients:
8 C uncooked rice
16 C water
1 1/2 lb. bacon, chopped
2 lb. liquid eggs
3 C peas
3/4 C soy sauce
3/4 C sesame oil
seasoning mix, to taste

Directions:
In 4" hotel pan, cook white rice for about 45 minutes.  This needs to be done the night before, as the rice needs to be cold.
Cook bacon on flat top grill until the fat is rendered.  Fry eggs in the bacon grease until slightly browned, then cut and flip over to other side.  Set eggs aside.
Put 1/4 C vegetable oil on the grill with the bacon.  Cook on 400 degrees, stirring for about 5 minutes.  Add peas, soy sauce, and sesame oil.  Stir until mixed well and color is consistent.  Season with seasoning mix to taste and place in the steam table.
Chop egg into small pieces and mix in.
