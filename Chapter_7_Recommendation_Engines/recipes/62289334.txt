Ingredients:
24 large clams
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup minced onion
1/4 cup chopped red pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup dried bread crumbs
4 slices bacon
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Soak clams in cold water for 20 minutes to help remove any sand or salt. Rinse thoroughly and discard any chipped clams. Meanwhile,in a small skillet, cook bacon until crisp over medium heat.  Crumble, and set aside.
While clams are soaking prepare the filling.
Add 2 tablespoons oil and butter to a small skillet, and place pan over medium heat.  Add onion, pepper, and garlic; saute until tender. Remove from heat, and cool.
Place cleaned clams in a pot of simmering water 2 to 4 minutes, or until clams open.  Discard any that do not open.  When cool enough to handle break shells in half and loosen the clam.
In a medium bowl mix together, bacon, oregano, cheese, sauteed vegetables.  Mix well.  Place a spoonful of mixture over clams in shells, and place on baking sheet.  Sprinkle with bread crumbs parsley and paprika.  Drizzle with olive oil.
Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 7 minutes.  Serve.

Description: 
Used only 1/3 cup of bread crumbs and added to the top instead of mixing with the other ingredients and substituted red pepper for the green. Also boiled the clams to open rather than baking and kept whole rather than chopping.Modified from: Clams Casino
