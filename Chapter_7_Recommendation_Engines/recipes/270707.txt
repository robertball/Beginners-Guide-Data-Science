Ingredients:
½ cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon preserved lemon, peel only, rinsed and minced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon preserved lemon brine (from jar)
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 pinch crumbled saffron
2  egg whites, lightly beaten
½ cup dukkah
1 pound chicken tenderloins

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine mayonnaise, lemon peel, garlic, lemon brine, cayenne pepper, and saffron in a mini food processor; blend until smooth, scraping down sides once or twice. Refrigerate aioli until ready to use.
Place egg whites into a dish or bowl. Place dukkah into a second dish. Dip chicken tenders first into egg whites, letting excess drip off, then coat with dukkah. Place tenders on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, turning over halfway through, 12 to 15 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
