Ingredients:
2 pounds beef oxtail
2 onions, diced
2 cups diced carrots
1 head cabbage, diced
1 cup diced celery (optional)
1/2 cup pearled barley
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 bay leaf
4 cups water, or enough to cover
1 bunch beets with greens - scrubbed, beets diced, and greens chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Place oxtail, onions, carrots, cabbage, celery, barley, onion soup mix, dill, cinnamon, bay leaf, and water in a large slow cooker. Cook on low until meat is tender, about 5 hours.
Remove meat and bones from slow cooker; cool on a plate until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Cut meat into small pieces; return meat to the soup and discard bones. Skim off any fat from soup; remove bay leaf.
Stir beets and beet greens into soup; cook on low until beets are tender, about 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper; top each bowl with about 1 tablespoon sour cream to serve.

Description: 
My friend's mom used to make 'garden' soup every Sunday. She would go through her fridge and any unused veggies would be thrown into the soup pot. This is my version; hearty, thick, and chock full of veggies. It is important to add the diced beets at the end to keep the colour appealing. My daughter goes crazy for this soup; it is very tasty and filling, best served warm.
