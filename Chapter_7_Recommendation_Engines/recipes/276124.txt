Ingredients:
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup oyster sauce
3 tablespoons packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon ketchup
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 (3/4 pound) pork tenderloins

Directions:
Combine honey, soy sauce, oyster sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, ketchup, onion powder, cayenne, and cinnamon in a large, strong, zip-top bag. Close the bag and squish to combine. Add pork to marinade and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove pork from bag and reserve marinade for basting.
Cook pork on the preheated grill for 10 minutes, basting with reserved marinade and turning every 3 minutes. Discard excess marinade.
Continue to grill pork, turning every 3 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 10 minutes more. Let pork stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
