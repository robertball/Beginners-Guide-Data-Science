Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 white onion, chopped
1 tomato, chopped
6 basil leaves, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (20 ounce) package ground turkey
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon oregano
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1/2 (6 ounce) can tomato paste, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion, tomato, basil, and garlic in hot oil until the onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes.
Break ground turkey into small pieces and add to pot; season with Italian seasoning and oregano. Cook and stir mixture until turkey is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir tomato sauce into the turkey mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly, 20 to 25 minutes.
Stir tomato paste into the turkey mixture until evenly colored; season with salt and pepper. Cook until the liquid is reheated, 1 to 2 minutes more.
