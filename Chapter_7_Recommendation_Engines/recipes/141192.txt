Ingredients:
6 (1 inch thick) pork chops
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups bread crumbs
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 cups tomato juice
1 cup unpacked brown sugar
2 tablespoons vinegar
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Dip pork chops into eggs then into the bread crumbs, coating evenly. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place coated pork chops in the skillet in a single layer, and cook until golden brown on each side, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Cook them in batches if skillet isn't large enough. Place the pork chops in a large baking dish in a single layer.
In a saucepan, bring to a boil the tomato juice, brown sugar, vinegar, cloves, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 5 minutes. Pour mixture evenly over the pork chops.
Bake in preheated oven uncovered for one hour.

Description: 
Delicious pork chops the entire family will love. You can use corn flake crumbs instead of bread crumbs, and season the crumbs to your personal taste. I sometimes add a teaspoon of garlic powder. The longer cooking time ensures moist chops.
