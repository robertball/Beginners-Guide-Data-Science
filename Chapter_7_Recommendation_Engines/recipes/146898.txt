Description: 
I use this recipe quite often on a spiced pound cake it compliments quite well. My grandparents love it; I make it with cake every time I visit them. This is a basic buttercream recipe with rum extract and a few extra spices added to it. I prefer a stronger rum flavor, so you should adjust the amount of rum extract to your liking.
