Ingredients:
Vegetable oil____________________¾ cup
Yellow onion, peeled, julienne___4 each
Garlic, minced___________________1 ½ cups
Butter___________________________1 cup
Water, warm______________________2 ½ cups
Olive oil________________________½ cup
Yeast, active dry________________1 ½ Tablespoons
Bread flour______________________6 ½ cups
Salt, kosher, coarse_____________1 Tablespoon
Sugar, granulated________________½ cup
Rosemary, fresh, minced__________1 ½ Tablespoon
Parsley, fresh, minced___________¾ cup
Marjoram, dry____________________½ teaspoon
All purpose flour________________As needed
Blue cheese, crumbled____________1 ½ cups
Vegetable oil____________________As needed

Directions:
Gather all ingredients and equipment.
On high heat, heat the vegetable oil to sauté the onions, making sure to stir them throughout the cooking process, until they caramelize to a golden brown color.
Once the onions are caramelized, add the butter and the garlic, and continue to sauté until the butter is fully melted; remove the mixture from the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature.
Add the water and oil to a mechanical mixing bowl and set aside.
Combine the bread flour, yeast, salt, and sugar together, then sift the contents into the mechanical mixing bowl.
Attach a dough hook to the mixer, add the rosemary, parsley, and marjoram, then mix the dough on medium high speed for 5-8 minutes.
Remove the dough from the mixer and knead until it becomes somewhat firm to develop the gluten; divide the dough into 6, 10 ounce portions.
Roll each dough into a 12 inch rectangle; dusting with flour as needed.
Fill each of them with equal quanities of the onions mixture, and a ¼ cup of blue cheese.
Roll each rectangle into a cyclic baguette making sure to pinch the edges closed.
Generously brush the bottoms of each baguette with water (this will help prevent the bases from burning) and transfer then to an oiled sheet pan; brush the baguettes with oil, and allow them to proof for two hours before baking them in the oven at 375F.
Once two hours have passed, bake the bread in the oven at 375F until a golden brown consistency is achieved; be sure to rotate the loafs as needed to achieve an evenly browned product.
