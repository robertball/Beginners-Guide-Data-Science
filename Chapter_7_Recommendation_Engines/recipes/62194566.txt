Ingredients:
1 48 ounce can chicken broth
2 medium onions, diced
1 tablespoon garlic, minced
3 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon white pepper
3 (4 ounce) cans diced mild green chilies, not drained
2 (15 ounce) cans white corn, drained
4 (14 ounce) cans navy beans, not drained

Directions:
Place chicken broth, diced onion, and minced garlic into a nonstick soup pot on high heat. Bring to a boil and cook until onions are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add cubed chicken, stirring to separate the pieces, and boil until chicken is no longer pink. Reduce heat to medium and cook until liquid is reduced to level of chicken.
Add cumin, pepper, chilies, corn, and beans. Once chili returns to a simmer, reduce heat to low and cook 15 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Description: 
Navy beans and boneless skinless chicken breasts are used in this tasty chili that I modified from a coworker's recipe. I entered this recipe in the annual chili cookoff at my work this year (2010) and took first place in the Judges' Pick and the People's Choice.
