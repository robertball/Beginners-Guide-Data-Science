Ingredients:
8 oz. elbow macaroni
8 oz. processed cheese, cubed (e.g. Velveeta)
1/2 c. cheddar cheese, shredded (any level of sharpness)
1/2 c. sour cream
1/2 c. milk

Directions:
Cook macaroni according to package directions.
Don't rinse macaroni as you want it hot enough to melt cheeses.  Place macaroni back into pot you cooked it in.  Add cubed processed cheese.  Stir until melted.  Add cheddar cheese.  Stir until melted.  Add sour cream and milk and stir until blended.  Enjoy!

Description: 
I modified this recipe to suit our tastes.  The best part about it is you don't need to make a cheese sauce or bake it in the oven!  The flavor is mild and very creamy due to the sour cream!
