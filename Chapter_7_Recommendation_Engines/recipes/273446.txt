Ingredients:
4 cups water
1 dash salt
1 cup steel-cut oats
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup raisins
2 tablespoons agave nectar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Bring water and salt to a boil in a pot. Pour in oats and return to a boil while stirring. Reduce heat and let simmer until water is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove oats from heat and immediately stir in walnuts and raisins. Stir in agave nectar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon.
Divide oat mixture into 4 portions in bowls. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight, up to 5 days.
When ready to prepare, add 2 tablespoons milk to each portion. Heat in a microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds, stirring halfway through cook time.

Because steel-cut oats take so long to cook, I came up with this recipe to make ahead and refrigerate overnight in 4 portions. It's very hearty, delicious, and wholesome!
