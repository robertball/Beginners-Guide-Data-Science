Description: 
A delightfully rich-tasting soup. My husband likes this soup so much he refers to all butternut squashes as soup now. I recommend this with the silken tofu instead of milk - it adds protein to a fiber-rich soup, and no one will know it's there if you don't tell them! Serve warm with a sprinkling of grated Parmesan or Romano and some crusty toasted bread on the side.
