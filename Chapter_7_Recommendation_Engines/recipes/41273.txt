Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees), divided
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
2 eggs
1/4 cup instant nonfat dry milk powder
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup sugar

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/2 cup water. Add butter, eggs, milk powder, salt, 3 cups flour and remaining sugar and water. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes or until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours.
Punch dough down. Divide into 27 pieces; shape into balls. Place 18 balls in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan and remaining balls in a greased 9-in. square baking pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees for 17-20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks.
