Ingredients:
2 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic, divided
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pound lean skirt steak or flank steak
8 cups packed torn romaine lettuce or mixed salad greens
1 large tomato, seeded, chopped
1 ripe avocado, peeled, seeded, diced
1 1/4 cups Sargento®Shredded Reduced Sodium Mild Cheddar Cheese or Sargento® Artisan Blends Shredded Double Cheddar Cheese, divided
1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion (optional)
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice or white wine vinegar
2 teaspoons pureed chipotle chlies in adobo sauce (optional)

Directions:
Rub 2 teaspoons garlic and pepper over steak. Grill over medium-hot heat on a covered grill 3 to 5 minutes per side for medium doneness depending on thickness of steak. Transfer steak to a carving board; tent with foil and let stand 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine lettuce, tomato, avocado, 1 cup cheese and red onion in a large bowl. Combine oil, lemon juice and remaining garlic in a small bowl; mix well. For a spicier dressing, add chipotle chilies. Add mixture to bowl; toss with lettuce mixture. Transfer to four serving plates.
Carve steak crosswise into thin slices; arrange over salads. Top with remaining cheese.
