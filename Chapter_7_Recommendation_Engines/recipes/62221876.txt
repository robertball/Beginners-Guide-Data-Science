Ingredients:
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon water
5 drops food coloring

Directions:
Mix egg yolk and water. Divide into dishes for as many colors as you want to make. Add food coloring to get shade desired (e.g., 2 Red plus 2 Yellow for Orange; 3 Blue for Blue).
Paint on unbaked cookies and bake as you normally would. Cookies will come out with shiny color finish. However, the icing must be painted on the cookie very thinly to not run off while baking.

Description: 
This makes a shiny gloss finish on most any cookie. Works best on light color cookies, like sugar cookie cutouts.  Depending on the color you are going for, you will probably need between 2 and 8 drops of food coloring.Modified from: Egg Yolk Tempera
