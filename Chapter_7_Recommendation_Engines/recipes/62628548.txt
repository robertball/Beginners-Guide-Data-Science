Ingredients:
Shells and small legs from two lobsters (no bodies)
Salt/Pepper
Tarragon
Red Pepper
Onion
Celery
Butter
Lobster tail/claws or both, cooked and chopped
Can of crab or shrimp (optional)
Milk
Cream
Flour

Directions:
Put lobster shells and legs in enough water to cover, season with salt, pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice.  Bring to boil then simmer until reduced-this is your stock-set aside.
Chop onion, red pepper and celery finely.
Saute in butter til softened.
Add about 1 cup stock and simmer.
Whisk flour into small amount of milk, add this and lobster meat and cook until heated thru and thickened-do not boil.
You can also add a can of crab meat or small shrimp if you wish at this point.  If you're patient you can also pick the meat out the small legs and add in.
Remove from heat and let cool.  When ready to serve add 1 cup cream and heat through while stirring, again making sure not to boil it.  Season to taste with salt, pepper and tarragon....or whatever herbs you like.
*Keep in mind prep/coking times reflect making the stock....whch isn't really work haha!

Not submitting this officially as I am terrible for measuring, I just get to cooking-so be warned now!  This is a good use for the aftermath of a lobster dinner (my inspiration), just buy an extra tail.  My friends all LOVE this :)
