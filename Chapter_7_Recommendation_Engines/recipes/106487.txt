Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons steak sauce
1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon steak seasoning
1/2 small onion, diced
2 (1 pound) beef ribeye steaks, cut 1 inch thick

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
In a medium bowl, mix olive oil, steak sauce, soy sauce, rosemary, garlic powder, steak seasoning and onions.
Prick steaks all over on both sides with a fork. Put steaks into marinade and leave to marinate for 20 minutes.
Place steaks on hot grill. Cover and cook until grill marks form, about 8 minutes per side for medium or until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from grill and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice each steak in half and serve.
