Ingredients:
14 ounces broccoli
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.
Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, about 18 minutes.
