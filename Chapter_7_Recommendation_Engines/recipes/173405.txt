Ingredients:
1 bunch beets, trimmed, leaving 1 inch of stems attached
1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice

Directions:
Place the beets into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the beets are tender when pierced with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry until cool enough to handle. While the beets are boiling, whisk together the vinegar and sugar until the sugar has dissolved; set aside.
Once cool enough to handle, remove the skins from the beets and cut the tops off. Cut the beets into cubes or wedges, and add to the vinegar mixture. Season with the dill, clove, and allspice; toss until coated. Cover the bowl, and refrigerate the beets overnight before serving.
