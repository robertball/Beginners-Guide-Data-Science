Ingredients:
5/6 frozen chicken breasts (or approx. 2.5 -3lbs of chicken)
3 Tbsp of butter/margarine
1 Tbsp of Olive oil
3 Tbsp of minced garlic
1 Tbsp of onion salt
1 tsp of garlic powder
1/2 tsp of seasoned pepper
1 can of cream of chicken soup
1 can of cream of mushroom soup
2.5 cups of water
1.5 cups of uncooked white rice
1 cup of sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350, and grease a 9x13 casserole dish.
Heat olive oil in large skillet, then add butter before placing frozen chicken breast in skillet to brown, adding garlic after chicken is thawed.  Continue to cook on medium heat, until both sides of chicken breast are browned.
In a medium bowl, mix soups, water, garlic powder, seasoned pepper, and onion salt. Combine until well blended and smooth. Stir in rice, and pour soup/rice mixture into the casserole dish.
Once the chicken is just browned, place on top of rice/soup mixture, being sure to include all of the garlic and butter in the pan.  Stir gently, just to combine and evenly spread the butter.
Cover with foil, and bake for one hour.  After 1 hour, remove from oven, and take off the foil.  Add cheddar cheese, and then return to oven, uncovered, for approximately 15 - 30 minutes, depending on how brown you like your cheese topping.

Description: 
I modified a few recipes to suit what I had on hand, and ended up with this casserole that my VERY picky son loved and asked for more!  I didn't precisely measure each of the ingredients, so tweak it a bit as needed.
