Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups half-and-half
1 1/2 cups coconut milk or Coconut Cream (canned)
2 eggs (or 3 egg yolks)
3/4 cup white sugar
1/3 to 1/2 cup cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 package frozen coconut, thawed
1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract
1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked (or use graham cracker crust)
Top with:
1 pint whipping Cream
2 Tablespoons powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Whip cream on low; adding sugar and vanilla.  Beat on higher speed until proper consistency is reached.
If desired, 1/3 cup toasted shredded coconut may be sprinkled on top instead of fresh coconut.

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine half-and-half, coconut milk/cream, eggs, sugar, cornstarch and salt. Bring to a boil over low heat, stiring constantly. Remove from heat, and stir in 3/4 of the coconut and the extracts. Pour into pie shell and chill 2 to 4 hours, or until firm.
Top with whipped cream and remaining 1/4 package of coconut (or toasted coconut).
Note: To toast coconut, spread it in an ungreased pan and bake in a 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 5 to 7 minutes, or until golden brown, stirring occasionally.
