8 cloves garlic
3 tablespoons olive oil

1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed

Cook potatoes and yams in a large pot of salted water until tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain, reserving 1 cup liquid.
Place potatoes in a mixing bowl.  Add milk, butter or margarine, rosemary, garlic, and reserved olive oil.  Mash until smooth as desired, adding reserved cooking liquid as needed.
