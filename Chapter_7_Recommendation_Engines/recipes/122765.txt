In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder and baking soda.  In another bowl, whisk the applesauce, milk, egg substitute and vanilla until smooth.  Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.  Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray; fill three-fourths full with batter.  Sprinkle with almonds.
