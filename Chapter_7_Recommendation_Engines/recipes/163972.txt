Ingredients:
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons minced fresh jalapeno chile
1/2 cup peeled and thinly-julienned seedless cucumber
1/4 cup minced fresh Thai basil leaves
1/4 cup minced fresh mint leaves
1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro
1 1/2 tablespoons minced lemon grass
1/2 cup ground peanuts
1/4 cup fish sauce
3 tablespoons lime juice
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon peanut oil
16 rice paper wrappers
16 leaves red leaf lettuce

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Season the chicken with salt and cook in the boiling water until no longer pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large platter and allow to cool completely in refrigerator. Shred into small pieces once cooled.
Combine the shredded chicken, ginger, jalapeno pepper, cucumber, basil, mint, cilantro, lemon grass, and peanuts in a large mixing bowl; toss until evenly distributed. Whisk together the fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, sesame oil, and peanut oil in a small bowl; add to the chicken mixture and mix with your hands until evenly coated.
Fill a shallow pan with hot water. Dip the rice paper wrappers in the hot water until soft one at a time. Spread the rice paper onto a clean, flat surface. Place 1 leaf of lettuce into the center of a sheet of rice paper; spread about 1/3 cup of the chicken mixture onto the lettuce leaf. Fold the bottom end of the rice paper over the top of the mixture and then roll into a cylinder. Repeat until all ingredients are used. Cut into halves to serve.
