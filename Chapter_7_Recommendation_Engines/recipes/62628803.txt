Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon white sugar
2/3 cup butter
1-1/2 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
Use a large fork to cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
Stir in the buttermilk until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.  You may not need all of it, or you may need to add a little more.
Turn out the dough onto a floured surface, and knead 15 to 20 times.  DO NOT OVERKNEAD!!!
Roll the dough out to about 1 inch thick and cut biscuits with a biscuit cutter or glass dipped in flour.
Place biscuits onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake for 12-14 minutes or until the tops are brown.
