Ingredients:
1 packet of bacon (5-6 rashers)
1 carton of sour cream
1 onion finely chopped
2 heaped tablespoons curry powder
1-2 cups of shredded cheese
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cobb loaf

Directions:
1 - Chop bacon and onion into small pieces and start to brown in a frying pan with oil.
2 - When bacon starts to turn brown and crispy, add curry powder to mix.
3 - Add sour cream and most of the cheese and stir until the dip becomes creamy and thick.
4 - Slice the top off the cobb loaf of bread and proceed to remove some bread from the inside - Be sure to leave enough bread around the edges so your loaf doesn't collapse. Break the removed bread into small pieces.
5 - When ready to serve the dip, spoon it into the empty cobb loaf and recover with cobb lid if necessary.
Can be refrigerated and reheated.
