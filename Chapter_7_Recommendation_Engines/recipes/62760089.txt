Ingredients:
3 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, 2 packages yeast, 1 cup warm water, 3 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon honey, 1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine flours and yeast in large bowl. In another small bowl combine water, oil, honey and salt. Gradually add liquid into dry mixture until it forms a soft ball. Knead 5 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Add flour as needed. Shape into a ball and place in a greased bowl. Cover and let rise 45-60 minutes. Punch down and cut into 8 equal portions. Cover and let rise 10 minutes. Work into 6 inch discs. Stack between wax paper and freeze at least 30 minutes. To grill: take directly from freezer, brush one side with oil and grill with that side down. Oil the top side and when bottom is done grilling flip onto a plate with grilled side up. Put toppings on grilled side then put back on the grill for about 3 more minutes. Enjoy!
