Ingredients:
1t baking soda
2C oatmeal
1C flour
1C brown sugar
1C butter

Directions:
Put all ingredients in a bowl and squeeze with hands to mix.  (This is how you take out your agressions!!)
Roll into small balls and bake at 325 for 15 min.
Note: We almost never bake these.  Since there are no eggs, we almost always eat these as cookie dough.  The recipe can also be used as a crisp topper.
