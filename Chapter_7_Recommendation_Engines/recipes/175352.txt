Ingredients:
2 cups buttermilk
2 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup mashed bananas

Directions:
Whisk together the buttermilk and eggs in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside. Stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate large bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and stir in the buttermilk mixture and mashed bananas, being careful not to over mix the batter (the batter will be lumpy). Let the batter sit for at least 1 minute before using.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side.

Description: 
Banana pancakes can be totally awesome if you know what you are doing. The reaction between the bananas and the buttermilk combined with the dual action baking powder makes these super fluffy. Huzzah for science!
