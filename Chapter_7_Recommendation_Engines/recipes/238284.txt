Ingredients:
6 cups cold water
2 1/4 cups dried pinto beans
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 pound bulk pork sausage
2 cups peeled tart apple slices
1 1/2 cups tomato juice
1 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 cloves garlic, mashed
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon coarse black pepper
1/4 cup Jamaican rum
1/4 cup sour cream, for topping

Directions:
Combine cold water and beans in a pot; let stand 8 hours to overnight.
Stir butter into the pot with the beans and water; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer until beans are tender, about 2 hours.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and reserve 2 tablespoons sausage drippings.
Stir sausage and reserved drippings, apple slices, tomato juice, onion, brown sugar, garlic, salt, chili powder, mustard, and black pepper into beans. Bring bean mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer until flavors blend, about 2 hours.
Stir rum into beans, ladle beans into bowls, and top with sour cream.

Description: 
Fantastic recipe given to me by a Texas rancher. Pinto or red beans are cooked with pork sausage. Great blend of spices and flavorings and doubly yummy with a little Jamaican rum and sour cream. Easy and the best beans ever to serve as your main dish with cornbread. You can substitute red beans for the pinto beans.
