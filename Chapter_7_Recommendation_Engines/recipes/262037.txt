Ingredients:
1 (7 pound) bone-in ham
1 cup pineapple juice, divided
1 cup brown sugar, divided
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 cup water
1 pinch ground ginger
1 pinch ground cloves

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place ham in a large baking pan and score the surface with a knife. Mix 1/4 cup pineapple juice, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and butter together in a bowl. Inject the mixture into the ham; pour any remaining liquid over the ham. Pour an additional 1/2 cup pineapple juice and water into the pan. Rub 1/2 cup brown sugar onto the ham.
Mix remaining pineapple juice, remaining brown sugar, ginger, and cloves in a small pan over medium heat. Cook until the mixture comes to a boil; simmer until glaze is reduced and dark brown, about 10 minutes.
Bake ham in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the ham and not touching the bone reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 2 hours.
Continue baking, brushing glaze onto ham every 10 minutes, about 30 minutes more. Remove from the oven and allow to sit 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This pineapple baked ham recipe is one that I have adapted to my liking through trial and error. It makes a sweet ham with a nice brown sugar crust. I serve it with asparagus and potato salad or mashed potatoes.
