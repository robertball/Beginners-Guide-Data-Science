Ingredients:
4 pork chops (3 ounces each, bone on)
salt and pepper
2 tablespoons mint, chopped
1/2 teaspoon dried red chili flakes
4 ripe, fresh Chilean nectarines, sliced
1 cup mixed fresh Chilean blueberries and raspberries
1/3 cup apricot jam
1 tablespoon champagne vinegar

Directions:
Rub chops with salt and pepper, mint and chili flakes.  Grill just to
brown the outside on a preheated grill, about 3-5 minutes per side.
Remove chops to a cutting board and cut a horizontal slice to make
a pocket in each chop. Set aside.
In a mixing bowl, toss together sliced nectarines, berries, jam and vinegar. Arrange chops in a 9” x 12” baking dish. Gently stuff the chops
with the nectarine mixture.  Add any remaining nectarine  mixture and sauces on top of the chops. Place chops in apreheated 400 degree
oven for 20 minutes, or until chops reach an internal temperature
of 145-150 degrees.
