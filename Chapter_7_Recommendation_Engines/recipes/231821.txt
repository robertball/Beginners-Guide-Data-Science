Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup brown sugar replacement (such as SplendaÂ® Brown Sugar Blend)
3/4 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups pureed cooked butternut squash
1 cup old-fashioned oats
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Prepare 24 muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners.
Beat eggs, flour, brown sugar replacement, olive oil, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl until smooth. Add squash, oats, and rosemary; stir until you have a smooth batter. Divide batter between prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I wanted a quick bread that I could actually eat while on a low-carb diet. They are so moist! The rosemary and brown sugar makes them savory and sweet. My husband and I eat them for dinner and breakfast.
