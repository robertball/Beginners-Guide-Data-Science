Ingredients:
1 medium head cabbage
1 1/2 cups uncooked white rice
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1 (46 fluid ounce) can tomato juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Grease a 2 quart casserole dish.
Steam the whole head of cabbage until it is al dente.  Meanwhile, in a saucepan bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat.  Saute onion until translucent; stir into cooked rice.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Cut the leaves off of the cabbage and cut the larger leaves in half.  Spoon 1 tablespoon of rice into a leaf and roll tightly.  Place rolls in prepared casserole dish, stacking in layers.  Pour tomato juice over the rolls, using enough just to cover.
Cover and bake in preheated oven for 2 hours.

Description: 
My parents are Ukrainian and this is a recipe we always made when I was growing up. These cabbage rolls have no meat in them.  Sometimes they used salt pork in them, but I didn't care for it.
