Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) boneless beef sirloin tip roast, cut in half
1 cup water
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon reduced sodium soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 large tart apple, quartered
1 large onion, sliced
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons cold water
1/8 teaspoon browning sauce

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, brown roast on all sides. Transfer to a 5-qt. slow cooker. Add water to the skillet, stirring to loosen any browned bits; pour over roast. Sprinkle with seasoned salt, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder. Top with apple and onion. Cover and cook on low for 5-6 hours or until the meat is tender.
Remove roast and onion; let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. Strain cooking liquid into a saucepan, discarding apple. Bring liquid to a boil; cook until reduced to 2 cups, about 15 minutes. Combine cornstarch and cold water until smooth; stir in browning sauce. Stir into cooking liquid. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve over beef and onion.

Description: 
Rely on your slow cooker to help prepare this moist pot roast. I thicken the juices to make a pleasing apple gravy that's wonderful over the beef slices and onions.                            --Rachel Koistinen of Hayti, South Dakota
