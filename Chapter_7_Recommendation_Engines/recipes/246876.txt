Ingredients:
2 heads cabbage, shredded and cut into pieces smaller than 2-inches
20 red potatoes, cut in 1-inch cubes
5 sweet onions, sliced
2 pounds carrots, sliced
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup minced garlic
8 teaspoons sea salt
4 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
2 teaspoons dried parsley
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons ground white pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
Arrange cabbage, red potatoes, onions, and carrots evenly on the baking sheets. Drizzle olive oil over vegetables.
Combine garlic, sea salt, cumin, turmeric, parsley, ginger, white pepper, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl; sprinkle over the vegetables and mix until evenly coated.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 20 to 30 minutes, until potatoes and cabbage are softened an evenly coated with spice mixture, about 1 hour 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
