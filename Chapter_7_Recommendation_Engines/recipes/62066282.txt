Ingredients:
1 box of chocolate cake mix of your choice ( I prefer Betty Crocker Super Moist Chocolate Cake Mix.
3 boxes of Jiffy fudge frosting mix.
1-1/2 cups of milk
1-1/2 cups of butter
1-1/4 cups water (Depending on cake mix)
1/3 cup of vegetable oil (Depending on cake mix)
3 eggs (Depending on cake mix)
2 cups of chopped pecans (optional)
Whipped Cream for topping (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Grease the bottom of a 13 x 9 pan. (The deeper the pan the better)!
Spread the chopped pecans over the bottom of the pan.
Prepare the cake mix according to the directions on the box and pour into the greased pan.
In a large, heavy bottomed saucepan, combine the 3 boxes of Jiffy fudge frosting mix, the butter, and the milk over medium / low heat and stir until all ingredients are melted. Remove from heat. (You do not want to bring this to a boil).  Pour over the cake mixture and proceed to bake the cake according to the directions on the box.
To serve this cake, cut into pieces and flip them over into a bowl.  There will be a gooey fudge sauce that has accumulated on the bottom of the pan.  If necessary, spoon this back onto the cake after it has been flipped into the bowl (this is the best part).  We serve this with a dollup of whip cream on top!
Recipe is just as great without the pecans!  But for the nut lovers, I highly recommend them.
