Ingredients:
12 eggs
6 slices bacon
3 avocados - halved, pitted, and mashed
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
1/2 garlic clove, minced
salt and pepper to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
Cut each egg in half lengthwise. Scoop egg yolks out; place 3 to 6 egg yolks in a bowl, reserving remaining egg yolks for another use.
Mash the 3 to 6 egg yolks with a fork; stir in avocado, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper.
Arrange egg whites cut-side-up on a serving platter. Spoon avocado mixture into egg whites.
Chop bacon into 1/2-inch pieces; place bacon and paprika in a small bowl and toss to coat bacon. Top deviled eggs with bacon pieces.
