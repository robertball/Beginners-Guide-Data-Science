Description: 
This is a recipe thrown together based on what I had on hand. My husband loved it and told me to write it down, so here it goes. Let me know what you think. It's a savory little pastry that's fairly hearty and can be spiced a thousand different ways. The base is the turkey, potatoes, and pastry and the cook can make up the rest! I just threw this together without measuring so the measurements are just guesses. Prepare it to taste.
