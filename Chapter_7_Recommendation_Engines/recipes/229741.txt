Ingredients:
1 Cornish game hen, thawed and giblets removed
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Season hen with salt and black pepper; place in a roasting pan.
Roast hen in the preheated oven until partially cooked, 25 to 30 minutes.
Mix orange juice concentrate, honey, and ketchup in a saucepan; bring to a boil and cook until syrup consistency, 5 to 10 minutes.
Baste hen with orange glaze; continue roasting, basting every ten minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone reads 180 degrees F (82 degrees C), 35 to 40 more minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
