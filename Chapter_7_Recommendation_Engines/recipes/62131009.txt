Ingredients:
12 ounces lemon-lime soda
2 ounces peppermint schnapps
1 ounce fresh lime juice (about one lime)

Directions:
Combine all and stir gently. Do not pour over ice, it will only dilute it. Share with a friend or drink it all yourself.

Submitter: 
Eula Thompson
Description: 
Very cooling for summer. Keep all ingredients in the fridge so they are chilled when you're ready to make it. If you want a harder drink, use DeKuyper's 100 proof schnapps.
