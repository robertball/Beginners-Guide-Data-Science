Ingredients:
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp. salt
3/4 tsp. baking powder
1/2 cup virgin coconut oil - room temperature
1 1/2 cups plus 1 tbsp. sugar
3 large eggs
1 tsp. vanilla
2/3 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup unsweetened coconut flakes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325.
Grease an 8x4 loaf pan and line with parchment paper, allowing some to hang over sides.
Whisk flour, cocoa powder, salt and baking powder together and set aside.
Beat oil, butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar until pale and fluffy - about 5-7 minutes.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each egg.
Beat mixture until it has doubled in volume and is very light then add vanilla and mix well.
Reduce mixer to low speed and slowly add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with buttermilk.
Do not over mix when adding dry ingredients and buttermilk - it will cause cake to buckle and split.
Scrape batter into prepared pan.
Run a spatula through the center of the batter, creating a canal.
Sprinkle with coconut and 1 tbsp. of sugar.
Bake cake about 70-80 minutes or until cake tests done in the center.
Coconut should get very dark and toasted, but if it starts to brown too much, tent cake with foil.
Cool cake in pan for 20 minutes before removing to cool completely.
