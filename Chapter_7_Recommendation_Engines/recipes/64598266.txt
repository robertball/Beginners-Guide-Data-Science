1/2 TSP SALT
1 1/2 TSP CHILI POWDER

Directions:
Combine salt, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Sprinkle over both sides of chicken tenders.
In large saute pan, melt half of the butter over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken tenders until done, about 8 minutes.
Pour the cream and remaining butter into the skillet. Low heat and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes. Serve chicken and sauce over pasta or mashed potatoes if desired.
