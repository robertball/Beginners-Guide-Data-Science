Ingredients:
2 nectarines, pitted and chopped
1/4 medium red onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried cilantro
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:

In a skillet over medium heat, cook and stir the nectarine mixture 10 minutes, until onion and nectarines are tender and lightly browned.

Description: 
A refreshingly sweet and tangy blend. Especially good when cooked on the grill and served with a mild fish such as tilapia. If you are grilling fish, the salsa can be cooked on the grill at the same time and served over the fillets.
