Directions:
Preheat oven to 400ยบ. Cut butternut squash into cubes and dump into a large bowl. Mix in the remaining squash ingredients and toss well. Spread onto a lined baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, or until cubes are softened and carmelized looking.
Make the pesto. Place sage, walnuts, garlic, salt, pepper and parmesan into a food processor. Pulse several times then slowly drizzle olive oil in while the processor is running, until a thick paste forms.
Slice French bread into thin slices (1/4 inch) and place on a baking sheet. Drizzle lightly with olive oil then bake at 400ยบ for 10 minutes or until golden. Spread with sage pesto and place a heaping tablespoon of squash on each slice. Dot with about 1 teaspoon of goat cheese. Put back in the oven for 3-5 minutes or until goat cheese has melted.
