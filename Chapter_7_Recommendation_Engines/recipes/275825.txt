Ingredients:
cooking spray
8 roasted whole green chiles, or more to taste
7 eggs
1/2 cup chopped onions
3 tablespoons heavy cream
3/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 pound sharp Cheddar cheese, cubed
2 tomatoes, sliced, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a pie plate with cooking spray.
Cut chiles lengthwise into strips. Line strips over the bottom of pie plate to form a crust, placing pointed ends toward the center.
Beat eggs in a bowl and mix in onions, cream, garlic salt, cumin, and pepper. Fold in Cheddar cheese. Layer tomatoes over the chile 'crust,' and pour egg mixture on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until quiche is set, 30 to 35 minutes.
