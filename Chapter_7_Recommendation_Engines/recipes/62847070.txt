Description: 
Using fewer habanero peppers can reduce the spiciness in this extremely hot habanero hot sauce.  The sauce works wonders as a pick-up for Bloody Mary drinks.  Flavors meld wonderfully and the sauce keeps nicely for a long time.  Warning: A dash is all you need and it is best to use gloves when handling the habanera peppers.Modified from: Bob's Habanero Hot Sauce - Liquid Fire
