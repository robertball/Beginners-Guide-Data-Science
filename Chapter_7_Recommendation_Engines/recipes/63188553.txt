Ingredients:
2 Tbsp dried minced onions
1/2 c water
1 (28oz) can crushed tomatoes
1 roasted red pepper, chopped
1 Tbsp sweet marsala wine
2 tsp sugar
2 tsp granulated garlic
1/4 tsp salt
1/8 tsp pepper
2 pinches cayenne pepper
3 Tbsp heavy cream
1 Tbsp snipped parsley (optional)
2 c chopped cooked chicken
1/2 lb rigatoni pasta, cooked
reserved pasta cooking water (optional)

Directions:
Cook the dried minced onions in water over low heat to rehydrate. When all the water is absorbed, add tomatoes, red pepper, marsala, sugar, garlic, salt and peppers. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about an hour.
When the sauce has reduced and onions are soft, add cream, parsley, chicken and pasta. Thin with pasta water, if desired.

Description: 
I took suggestions from a few different recipes and we LOVED it! I used fresh parsley only because I had it on hand, but it was great tasting even before i added it in. For me a pantry sauce is such a bonus. Also, I served this with rosemary bread, and zucchini roasted with fresh rosemary. The rosemary flavor really complimented the sauce, and would be a great addition, if you prefer.
