Description: 
My husband loves this recipe I adapted from a TASTE OF HOME recipe (Slow-Cooked Flank Steak) by Michelle Armistead (Keyport, New Jersey) which used to be on ALLRECIPES. He raves about it. I make it for him. My major change is to use fresh jalapeno peppers (not canned) and to leave them whole (not chopped) so my husband (a.k.a. fire breather) can mash them on his portion and have it spicy. I make this with all different kinds of hot peppers (not just jalapeno peppers).
