Ingredients:
12 ounces vegan ground beef (such as Gimme Lean Veggie Beef)
11 ounces vegan beef crumbles (such as Beyond Beef)
1 small or 1/2 large sweet onion, chopped
2 flax eggs (store bought or homemade-recipe is found below*)
2 tablespoons Tamari
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon salt
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 teaspoons prepared Dijon mustard
1 Tablespoon olive oil
1 cup corn flakes, crushed into medium coarse crumbs
1/3 cup soy or flax milk (you may use plain unsweetened cashew or almond milk)
4 ounces tomato sauce
1/4 cup ketchup
1 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
Glaze:
1 cup ketchup
1 1/2 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard
2-3 tablespoons brown sugar, firmly packed (to taste)
1/2-1 teaspoon Tamari (to taste)
Homemade flax eggs:
2 tablespoons ground flax seed
5 tablespoons water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Line a shallow baking sheet or pan with foil. Lightly grease the foil with vegetable oil. Mix all the meatloaf ingredients together well in a large mixing bowl. Turn out onto prepared foil lined pan; using hands press meat mixture together and form into an 8 inch loaf. In a small bowl mix together all the glaze ingredients. Spoon glaze over meatloaf spreading to cover top and all sides. Bake for 60 minutes. Cover loosely and let rest 5  minutes before slicing.
*Homemade flax eggs - In a small dish (cup) mix 2 tablespoons ground flax with 5 tablespoons water. Let rest 5 - 15 minutes until thickened and egg like consistency.
NOTE: To serve more you may double this recipe, however I suggest you make 2 meatloaves vs 1 really large one.

Description: 
A fabulous alternative for any vegan craving good old comfort food! It's not for vegans only, but a great healthy alternative to tradition full fat meatloaf. My meat-eating husband even said it was pretty good! Great served with Healthier Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes by MakeItHealthy on AR. Comfort food at it's finest and healthiest!
