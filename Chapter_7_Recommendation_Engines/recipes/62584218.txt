Ingredients:
3 boxes or Jiffy Cornbread
2 tablespoon EV Olive Oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 Large onion, chopped
2 cups of celery, chopped
12 oz of sliced mushrooms
2 tsp of good Italian Seasoning
2 chicken breasts, cooked
Salt & Pepper to taste
1 Quart of chicken stock

Directions:
The night before, make the cornbread according to package directions. Crumble in 1/2 inch cubes and place in a large bowl or on paper towels overnight to dry out and get stale.
Heat the EVOO in a skillet over med heat. Brown the onions, celery, garlic, mushrooms for about 7-8 minutes. Add the Seasonings and continue to stir.
Meanwhile, with the cooked chicken breasts, put in a food processor and shred. Add to the bowl of cornbread along with the sauteed vegetables.
Stir to combine. Add chicken stock slowly, you don't want it to be mushy, but you do want it to look wet. You probably won't use the full quart, unless you like your stuffing extra moist.
Transfer to a baking dish and bake at 350 for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Until brown on top.
