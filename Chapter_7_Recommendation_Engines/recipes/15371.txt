Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked
1/2 cup cold water
7 tablespoons cornstarch
1 1/2 cups hot water
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 egg yolks, beaten
1 lemon, juiced and zested
1 tablespoon butter
3 egg whites
6 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a small bowl mix cold water and cornstarch to a thin paste. In a medium saucepan bring hot water and sugar to a boil, then add cornstarch paste. Transfer this mixture to a double boiler.  Cook until thick and smooth, stirring constantly, about 15 minutes. Whisk a small amount of this mixture into egg yolks, then whisk egg yolk mixture back into double boiler.  Cook everything together for a few minutes longer, continuing to stir. Mix in juice and rind of 1 lemon along with butter. Set custard aside to cool.
In a medium glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites while gradually adding sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. When egg whites hold a stiff peak, beat 1 teaspoon lemon juice into meringue.
Pour filling into baked pie shell. Spread meringue over lemon filling.
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes or until delicately browned.
