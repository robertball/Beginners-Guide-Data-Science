Ingredients:
6 tbsp. unsalted butter
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
2/3 cup brown sugar
2 tbs. & 1/2 tsp. corn starch
2 eggs plus 1 egg yolk, lightly beaten
4 scoops vanilla ice cream
Chocolate syrup, optional
Powdered sugar, optional

Directions:
Spray 4 small ramekins with non-stick spray and place the ramekins on a cookie sheet.  Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.
In small sauce pan over low heat, melt butter and chocolate.  Mix in brown sugar and corn starch.  Remove from heat and add eggs and yolk.  Stir well.  Pour mixture in even portions into ramekins.
Bake at 375 for 20 - 25 minutes.  Toothpick inserted in center should come out not quite clean (not wet, though).  Souffles should be slightly hard around the edges and softer in the middle.
Cool for 5 to 10 minutes.  Top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and place ramekins on plates. Drizzle with chocolate syrup and sprinkled with a little powdered sugar to serve, if desired.
