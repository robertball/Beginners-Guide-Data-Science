Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds boneless chicken thighs
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or more as needed
2 teaspoons ground cumin, divided
2 teaspoons ground coriander, divided
2 teaspoons garam masala, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package fresh spinach
1/4 tablespoon butter
1 onion, diced
5 cloves garlic, minced
3 fresh red chile pepper, minced
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
5 fresh curry leaves
5 cardamom pods
1 teaspoon mustard seed
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 (8 ounce) can tomato paste
2 (6.5 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 teaspoon honey
12 ounces paneer, diced
1/4 cup heavy cream, or more to taste

Directions:
Drizzle chicken thighs with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season with 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon coriander, 1 teaspoon garam masala, salt, and pepper.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until nicely browned and only slightly pink in the centers, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from the pan.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Add spinach and season with salt; cook, covered, until spinach is wilted, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Heat butter in the same skillet used for chicken over medium-high heat. Saute onion with salt in the hot pan until softened, stirring to pick up crust left by chicken, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, chile peppers, and ginger, cook for 1 to 2 minutes, adding olive oil if necessary. Add curry leaves, cardamom pods, mustard seed, and turmeric; cook and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in tomato paste and continue to cook, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tomato sauce, honey, and sauteed spinach; reduce heat to low.
Blend sauce mixture in the skillet using an immersion blender until smooth. Continue to let simmer, 10 to 20 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in paneer and heavy cream. Serve.
