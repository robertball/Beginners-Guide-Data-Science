Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups warmed pineapple juice
2 teaspoons yeast
2 teaspoons Splenda Â®(2 packets)
1 egg
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon coconut extract
3 cups bread flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Pour warmed up pineapple juice in a large mixing bowl & sprinkle with yeast. Allow to rest 5 minutes. Mix in the Splenda, egg, butter, salt, & coconut extract. Stir in the bread flour a cup at a time until it's all mixed in and firms a soft dough. Cover bowl and set in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.
Punch down the dough, then recover and let rise again.
Break off 3" size pieces of dough and roll into a ball. Place it in a 9x13 greased pan, and fill with dough balls touching. Cover and let dough rise until doubled in size.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
