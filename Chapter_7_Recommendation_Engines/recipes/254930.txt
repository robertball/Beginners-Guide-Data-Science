Ingredients:
1 eggplant, cut in half
1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
3 cups water
1 1/2 cups quinoa
3 large heirloom tomatoes, sliced
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh basil
1 lemon, juiced
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a pie pan; place eggplant in pie pan. Sprinkle onion on top and around eggplant.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggplant is soft and browned, about 1 hour.
Bring water to a boil in a 2-quart pot. Stir in quinoa; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Combine heirloom tomatoes, basil, lemon juice, and sea salt in a large bowl. Stir in the warm quinoa, a little at a time, until salad is combined.
Scoop out warm eggplant, in chunks, from the skin with a spoon; discard skin. Stir eggplant chunks and onion into salad. Cover with plastic wrap.
Place salad into the refrigerator; chill until flavors combine, about 4 hours.
