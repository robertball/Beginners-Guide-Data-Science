Ingredients:
TOPPING:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
PIE:
6 cups peeled, sliced baking apples
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (9 inch) unbaked pastry shell
28 caramels
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk

Directions:
Combine flour, brown sugar, butter and cinnamon; spread into an ungreased 8-in. square baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 6-8 minutes or until golden brown. Cool; crumble and set aside. Sprinkle apple with lemon juice. Combine sugar, flour and cinnamon; toss with apples. Place apples in pie shell. Cut a circle of foil to cover apples but not the edge of pastry; place over pie. Bake at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F; bake for 35 minutes or until apples are tender.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan over low heat, melt caramels with milk, stirring frequently. Remove foil from pie. Pour caramel mixture over apples. Sprinkle with topping; return to the oven for 5 minutes. Serve warm.

Description: 
I was raised on a small farm, the youngest of eight children and the only girl. My mom taught me how to make all kinds of pies from scratch, and this is one of my favorites. Caramels and apples are a delicious combination.
