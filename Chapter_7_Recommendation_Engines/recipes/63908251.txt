Ingredients:
1/2 cup finely diced onion
2 cloves finely diced garlic
2 tsp salt
1 cup cooked rice
1/2 cup crushed "hint of lime" tortilla chips
1/2 cup mild curry powder
1 tsp dried tarragon
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 lbs ground turkey
small amount of butter or olive oil for sautéing

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together all ingredients except for the turkey and the butter/oil for sauteing.  Add the turkey and mix until thoroughly combined.  Form into 1 inch balls.
Heat a large non-stick sauté pan and add 2 tsp of butter or oil.  Put about a dozen turkey balls into the pan and lightly press each one into a small patty of about 1/2 inch thick.  Saute the patties for 2 - 3 minutes per side until all pink is gone.
Put the cooked balls on a plate in a 140 degree oven to keep warm while the rest are being sautéed.
