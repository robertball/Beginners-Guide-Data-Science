Ingredients:
3-4  cups diced leftover ham
8 Potatoes boiled and cut
1 large can cream of mushroom soup
1 Beef bouillon cube
1 tablespoon seasoned salt
1 tablespoon pepper
milk

Directions:
First peel and boil potatoes, drain excess water.  Dice the potatoes into meduim sized squares.  Place them back into the pan, add the ham, beef bouillon cube, cream of mushroom soup, seasoned salt and pepper.  Then pour milk over until almost covered.  Then place back on stove on medium-low heat.  Stir often as it will stick to the bottom and burn.  Cook for about 45-60 minutes, if the soup is to thick just add more milk to the mixture, if it is not thick enough you can mash some of the potatoes to make it thicker.  Dish into bowls and enjoy.
