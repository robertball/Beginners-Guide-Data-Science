Ingredients:
2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup margarine, melted
12 ounces cream cheese, softened
3 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup white sugar
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
3 eggs, separated
1/2 cup milk
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon salt
2 (.25 ounce) packages unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup cold water
1/4 cup boiling water
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
3 tablespoons ground walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease one 9x13 inch pan.
In a medium bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs and margarine. Evenly press into prepared pan to form a crust.
Blend together the cream cheese, eggs and sugar; evenly spread over crust and bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Set aside to cool.
In a 2 quart saucepan, combine the pumpkin, egg yolks, milk, 3/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Set aside to cool.
Combine gelatin and cold water in a small bowl and allow to soften for 5 minutes. Mix in boiling water to dissolve. Stir into the pumpkin mixture.
In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites until frothy. Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar; beat until stiff. Fold into pumpkin mixture and pour over cream cheese layer. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours, and cut into squares. Top with whipped topping and sprinkle with walnuts.
