Ingredients:
1 can green beans (or 1.5 cups fresh/frozen)
1 lemon's juice (depending on taste may only need 1/2)
1/4 cup slivered almonds (optional-but very tasty)
1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil (vegetable oil works too)

Directions:
For Fresh/Frozen Green beans: Defrost and steam before completing other steps. Note: with frozen or fresh green beans, they taste just as good but have more of a crisp factor then canned green beans.
Let the olive oil (or vegetable oil) heat up on med heat for about 1-2 minutes, or until warm, not sizzling hot. Reduce heat to medium-low. Then add in almonds to cook for about 2 minutes, or until golden.
Next add in the garlic and let the almonds and garlic cook for another 1-2 minutes.
Finally add in the drained green beans and the lemon juice. Cook for 8-10 minutes on medium heat(you do not want them to be too mushy). If you need to you can put on lowest heat to keep warm until the rest of dinner is ready. Enjoy!
