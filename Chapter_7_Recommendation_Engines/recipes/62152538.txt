(This depends on you, i like to season liberally) season the pot with salt, pepper, oregano thyme, LIGHT on curry, sage, (depends on if you like spice), cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, cumin, bay leaves and garlic cloves. Discard deer from marinate and place into the pot. Place pot in the middle of the oven and let deer cook for 2 1/2 hours. Then with the flour, mix the flour with liquid from the pot and stir back into the pot to thicken into a gravy and pour in the pinto beans into the pot and place the oven back into the oven to cook for another 2 1/2 hours.
