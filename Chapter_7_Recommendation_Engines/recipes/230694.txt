Ingredients:
4 cups chicken broth
2 cups orzo pasta
1 1/2 pounds lean ground turkey
4 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
4 cups fresh spinach leaves
4 cups frozen broccoli florets
1 pint cherry tomatoes
2/3 cup frozen peas
2/3 cup frozen carrots
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring chicken broth to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling broth, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat; do not drain.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir turkey in the hot skillet until crumbly and evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir garlic and red pepper flakes into turkey; cook for 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium. Add spinach, broccoli, tomatoes, peas, carrots, orzo, and broth to the turkey mixture and cook, stirring often, until spinach is wilted and tomatoes begin to split, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.

Description: 
This dish is fast, easy, colorful, healthy, and delicious! Don't skip the chicken broth; it adds essential flavor to the dish. I like mine extra garlicky and go for the full 6 cloves, but it's plenty flavorful with less. You can use just about any veggies or meat in this recipe and it will still be great. I use all frozen veggies so I only need to shop for tomatoes, and even those I could use canned if I feel lazy, making this a true from-the-pantry meal with no shopping required.
