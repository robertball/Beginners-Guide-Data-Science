Ingredients:
8 Oreo cookies
4 oz. cream cheese
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 tsp. powdered sugar, for dusting

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place the cookies in a food processor, and pulse into fine crumbs. (Or put cookies in Ziploc bag and crush.) Add the cream cheese and pulse until just mixed. Use a teaspoon to scoop the cookie mixture into small balls. Place the cookie balls on the baking sheet, cover with plastic freeze until firm, about 1 hour.
Microwave the chocolate chips for 1 minute and stir. Then nuke for 30 more seconds and stir again. Dip the cookie balls into the chocolate using a toothpick or fork and place back on baking sheet. Put the powdered sugar in a sieve and lightly dust the truffles. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Serve cold.
