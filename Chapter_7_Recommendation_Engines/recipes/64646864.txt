Ingredients:
6 Chicken Thighs (skin-on and bone-in)
Salt
Pepper
Garlic Powder

Directions:
Pre-heat your oven to 475°F .
Dry your chicken pieces very well.
Carefully loosen the skin from the chicken without removing it. You want to put salt, pepper and garlic to your taste on the skin of the chicken under the skin, then apply the salt, pepper and garlic to the skin itself and the underside of the thighs. Make sure the skin is covering the seasoned meat.
Arrange pieces on a broiler pan or baking pan with a rack.
Bake for 20 minutes at 475°F then lower the temperature to 400°F and bake 30 minutes more.
Let rest for 5 minutes, then serve.
