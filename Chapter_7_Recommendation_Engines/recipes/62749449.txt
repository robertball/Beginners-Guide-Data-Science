Ingredients:
2 package little smokies, with or without cheese
1 (10 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Drain smokies, cut each cresent roll triangle in half (making 2 triangles-16 per container).  Wrap 1 little smokie link in each triangle.  Put on cookie sheet with the overlap of biscuit faced down, so you don't have to use tooth picks.  Can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer at this point.
Bake in preheated oven until biscuits are brown, about 10 to 15 minutes.
Serve with ketchup, barbacue sauce and/or mustard.
