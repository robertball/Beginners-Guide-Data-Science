Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 spaghetti squash, halved and seeded

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil.
Place spaghetti squash, cut-side down, on the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until skin can easily be pierced with a fork and spaghetti squash is tender, 40 to 60  minutes, depending on size of spaghetti squash.
Remove from oven and allow to rest until cool enough to handle. Scrape out flesh with a fork and discard skins.

Description: 
Spaghetti squash is easily prepared in the oven--just cut it in half and bake it until the skin is easily pierced with a fork. You can then use it as a low-carb pasta substitute or turn it into salads. I often just eat it simply with some Parmesan cheese and olive oil. If you want you can season it before you bake it, but I usually spice it up later.
