Ingredients:
1 package Bob Evans® Frozen White Dinner Roll Dough
1 pound Bob Evans® Original Recipe Roll Sausage
8 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar Cheese (medium or sharp)

Directions:
Thaw dough at room temperature 45 minutes to 1 hour, or place rolls on microwave-safe plate and microwave on defrost setting for 4 to 5 minutes or until thawed. Do not allow dough to begin rising. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Crumble and cook sausage in medium skillet over medium heat until browned. Drain off any drippings. Whisk eggs, salt and pepper in medium bowl. Add egg mixture to sausage in skillet and cook until eggs are firm, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and set aside.
Flatten each dough ball into 6-8 inch oval with rolling pin on floured work surface. Place equal amount of sausage mixture in center of each oval. Sprinkle evenly with cheese. Fold dough over to create half moon shape and tightly crimp edges with fork. Place calzones in greased baking sheet; bake 15-20 minutes or until browned. After baking, brush tops of calzones with butter. Refrigerate leftovers.
