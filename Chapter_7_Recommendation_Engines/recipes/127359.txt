18 OREO Chocolate Sandwich Cookies, crushed
1/4 cup butter, melted
3 (8 ounce) packages PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup BREAKSTONE'S or KNUDSEN Sour Cream
3 eggs
12 (1 ounce) squares BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate, divided
1/2 cup whipping cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F if using a 9-in. silver springform pan (or to 325 degrees F if using a 9-in. dark nonstick springform pan.) Combine crumbs and butter. Press firmly onto bottom of pan.
Beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add sour cream; mix well. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed after each addition just until blended. Chop 8 of the squares of chocolate; stir into batter. Pour over crust.

Chop remaining 4 squares of chocolate. Bring cream to simmer in small saucepan on low heat. Remove from heat. Add chocolate; stir until completely melted. Cool slightly. Pour over cheesecake. Refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight. Remove side of pan before serving. Store leftover cheesecake in refrigerator.
