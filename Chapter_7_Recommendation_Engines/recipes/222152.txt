Ingredients:
2 cups small dried bread cubes or plain croutons
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 teaspoons finely chopped mint leaves
1/2 cup HeinzÂ® Chili Sauce
1 (3 pound) boneless, butterflied leg of lamb, trimmed
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Toss bread cubes with cheese, mint and chili sauce until well combined.
Lay meat fat side down and sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Spread evenly with bread mixture, leaving a 1-in (2.5-cm) border at one end. Starting at the narrow end, roll up meat jellyroll style.
Tie rolled roast together with kitchen string. Transfer to a rack set in a roasting pan and roast, basting occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer inserted in centre of meat registers 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for rare or 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) for medium doneness. Rest roast for 10 minutes. Slice thickly. Makes 8 servings.
