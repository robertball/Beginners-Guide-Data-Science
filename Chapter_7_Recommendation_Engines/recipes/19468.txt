Ingredients:
1 medium sugar pumpkin
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups evaporated milk
4 eggs, beaten
2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cut out top of pumpkin and clean out all seeds and strings from inside. Slice pumpkin vertically into 3 inch wide strips. Place strips onto a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven for about 1 hour. Once done, scrape the pumpkin from the skins, then beat with a mixer or puree in a food processor until smooth.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Mix the nutmeg, ginger, salt, evaporated milk and eggs with the pumpkin puree. Pour mixture into two 9 inch pie crusts.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for an additional 35 to 40 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Cool and refrigerate.
