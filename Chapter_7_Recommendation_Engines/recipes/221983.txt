Description: 
I don't know how this recipe came to be, but we know my great-grandmother made this. It is made with diced ham in the oven and covered in bread crumbs. After shaping them, you can put cheese or anything you want into the middle for a filling. I personally like cream cheese or Cheddar cheese in mine but you can put whatever you want in the middle.
