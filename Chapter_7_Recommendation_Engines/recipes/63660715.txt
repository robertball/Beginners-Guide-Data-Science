Description: 
Husband is on heart diet and is an avid hunter, so was looking for a good low fat healthy way to fix some of the venison we have in our freezer. Found recipe on Food Network for Swiss steak, but instead of higher fat fried steak version I re-vamped it for lower fat version. Also, added a few ingredients of my own and adapted it to slow cooker since summer time and didn't want to heat up kitchen.
