Ingredients:
Paula's Stove Top Pot Roast
1 Boneless Chuck Roast
1/2 cup wesson oil (cover bottom of dutch oven but not too much)
1 Chopped onion
1 pkg of Dry Beefy Onion soup
2 cans beef broth
2/3 c white or red wine
4 shakes of Worchestershire sauce
2 bay leaves
1 tsp marjoram
salt (to taste)
black pepper (to taste -- but lots)
1 pkg baby carrots
2-3 peeled and quartered potatoes

Directions:
Heavily salt, pepper and flour roast. Put in hot oil in large dutch oven. Brown roast on both sides. When brown, add flour to absorb remaining oil and let cook to get the raw flour taste out and brown. Stir around frequently while flour is browning. Add chopped onion, soup mix, wine, broth, seasonings and some water to cover very well. Cover and let simmer on med/low heat for about 2 hours or until tender. Add carrots and peeled potatos into liquid. Cook until veggies are tender --- about 1 more hour! If gravy is too thin, remove cover and continue to simmer for another 20 minutes or so while liquid evaporates and gravy thickens. Remove bay leaves from gravy when serving (they tend to get stronger if left in the gravy)
