Ingredients:
1/4 cup half-and-half
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon dried sage, crumbled
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped celery
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
4 cups herb-seasoned stuffing mix
2 cups chopped, unpeeled apples
1/2 cup dried cherries
1/2 cup chopped pecans, divided
6 chicken cutlets
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
olive oil cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk together half-and-half, egg, and sage in a bowl.
Melt butter in a 12-inch nonstick, oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Add onion, celery, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until onion begins to soften, about 4 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and then stir in stuffing mix. Add chopped apples, dried cherries, and 1/4 cup chopped pecans, then remove from heat. Stir in half-and-half mixture and gently even out the contents of the skillet.
Season chicken cutlets with paprika, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Place on top of the stuffing mixture and press down into the skillet contents until the tops of the chicken are even with the other ingredients. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup chopped pecans over the top and lightly spray chicken with cooking spray.
Place skillet in the preheated oven and bake until chicken juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve warm.

Description: 
Is it a sweet and savory bread pudding? Or, is it a casserole? Perhaps it is a chicken and stuffing skillet--you decide.  At any rate, this dish only needs a 12-inch nonstick, oven-proof skillet, a spoon, a knife, a cutting board, a whisk, and some measuring cups. It comes together fairly quickly, too!
