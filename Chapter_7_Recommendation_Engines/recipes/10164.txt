Ingredients:
6 3/4 cups white sugar
4 cups shortening
8 eggs
2 cups milk
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 ounces anise oil
21 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Cream sugar and shortening, add eggs one at a time. In a separate bowl mix milk, baking soda, and anise oil. Add to cream mixture. Mix well.  Gradually add the flour, mixing well.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Refrigerate long enough to clean up mess. Leave dough in refrigerator. Take small amounts to roll out, 1/8 inch thick. Cut out in any desired shapes.
Bake  10 to 12 minutes until edges begin to brown. Allow to cool, and frost with Easy Creamy Icing.
