https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 tbsp Olive Oil
2 tbsp Butter
1/2 tbsp Lemon Juice
1 Egg (lightly beaten)
1-2 cups Italian Breadcrumbs (or plain if you like)
1/2-1 cups Bay or Sea scallops (I used Bay, but Sea is also good)
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine bread crumbs and salt/pepper in a ziploc bag.  Set aside.
In a seperate bowl, lightly beat egg and dip scallops in egg.
Put scallops in ziploc and shake bag to fully coat and cover the scallops with the Bread Crumbs.
In a large skillet, cook Olive Oil, Butter and Lemon Juice on medium high until simmering.
Add scallops and fry for only a couple of minutes until starting to brown.  Shake pan instead of turning with a utensil to avoid breading from coming off if using small scallops to brown all the way around.
Serve!
