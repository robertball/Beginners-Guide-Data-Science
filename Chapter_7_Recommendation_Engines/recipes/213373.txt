Description: 
This is a wonderful dish that I had while on the coast of Spain. It should be enjoyed with a good white wine or sangria, and warm crusty bread.  I could not find a recipe that came close to what I had in Spain so I came up with this recipe myself. It is a big hit with family and friends. Enjoy. This can be made ahead of time and the recipe can doubled.
