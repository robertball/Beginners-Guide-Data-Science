Ingredients:
½ cup all-purpose flour
8  bone-in chicken pieces, such as breasts, thighs, and drumsticks
½ cup vegetable oil for frying
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed French onion soup
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a heatproof glass mixing bowl or a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.
Place flour in a resealable plastic zipper bag, and place 2 or 3 chicken pieces into the bag. Seal bag, and shake to coat chicken with flour. Tap off excess flour. Repeat to coat all chicken with flour.
Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat, and pan-fry the chicken until golden brown on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes. Fry in batches if necessary. Place the chicken pieces into the prepared dish. Mix the soups together in a bowl, and pour over the chicken. Cover dish with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken meat is no longer pink at the bone, the juices run clear, and the sauce is bubbling, about 1 hour. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into a thick chicken piece should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
Super easy chicken entree using only a few ingredients baked in one dish, the Yellow Bowl (a large oven safe mixing bowl made by Pyrex(<sup>&reg;</sup>)). Of course you can use any large oven proof mixing bowl, but the recipe was passed to me with that name attached for that reason.
