Description: 
Made this one up on a whim. Had to feed several kids/teens and need to get use up tortllias I had. They loved it. Been making this for years now. I use leftover taco meat and tortillas to make a 2nd day of mexican dinner. (easy cheat because meat already cooked) I like to add sides of refried beans, spanish rice and a salad (when I have lettus and tomatoes leftover). Makes a full meal for the whole family. Also, you can feed more people, if you have several sides. Freeze leftovers, in single servings.  Recipe source: Christy Rogers Newton (Nauntie)
