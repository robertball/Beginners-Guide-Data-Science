Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed
1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken stock (or vegetable stock if you want it to be vegan)
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapeno pepper, diced (remove seeds if you don't like it spicy)
1/2 medium red onion, diced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup fresh or frozen corn (optional)
1 mango, peeled and diced
1 avocado, peeled, seeded, and diced
2 tablespoons cilantro, finely chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice

Directions:
Measure one cup of quinoa and rinse well in a colander to remove the bitterness from the grain.
In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat and add garlic.
Once garlic is browning, add onion, jalapeno, and salt.  Saute just until onions become slightly tender.
Add quinoa and cook for 1-2 minutes, just to slightly brown quinoa.
Add chicken stock and stir.  Bring mixture to a boil.  Once boiling, drop heat to low and simmer until cooked and all water absorbed, 15-20 minutes.  Fluff with a fork.
Stir in corn (optional), mango, and avocado, followed by the lime juice.
Adjust seasonings to taste (lime juice, salt, pepper).
Serve immediately warm, or chill and serve cold.
