Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups water
1 1/4 cups white vinegar
2 1/2 teaspoons pickling salt
1 teaspoon whole Tellicherry peppercorns
1 teaspoon yellow mustard seeds
1/2 teaspoon brown mustard seeds
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste
6 pickling cucumbers
1/4 small white onion, sliced
8 sprigs fresh dill
1 clove garlic, slightly crushed

Directions:
Combine water, vinegar, salt, peppercorns, yellow and brown mustard seeds, sugar, and crushed red pepper flakes in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until sugar and salt have dissolved, 5 to 7 minutes. Allow mixture to cool, about 30 minutes.
Cut cucumbers into even spears and pack into a 1-liter, large-mouthed glass jar. Add onion slices, dill sprigs, and garlic. Pour cooled vinegar mixture over cucumbers in the jar to cover completely. Seal with a lid and refrigerate for 24 hours before serving.

Description: 
A truly piquant pickle that will satisfy those of us who have a loose sweet tooth. I have been looking for a truly flavorful pickle recipe, not sweet, but not just spicy, either. The key is the variety of ingredients, not just cutting down on the sugar. Only 24 hours in the refrigerator, and they're ready for snacking. Pucker up!
