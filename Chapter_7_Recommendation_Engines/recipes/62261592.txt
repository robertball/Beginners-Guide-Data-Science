Ingredients:
3 tbls olive oil
5 carrots, chopped
2 onions, chopped
10 cloves garlic, chopped
3 apples (I used Red Delicious), seeded and chopped
10 cups vegetable or chicken broth
1 lb lentils
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons cumin
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon  pepper, or to taste
1 tbls sugar
1 29oz can pumpkin
1 14.5 oz can coconut milk

Directions:
Using a large, heavy pot, heat the oil, add carrots, garlic, onion, and apples; saute about 10 mins, until softened and a bit browned.  Add broth, lentils and seasonings.  Bring to a boil, lower heat, cover, and simmer until lentils are soft, about 1 hour.  Add pumpkin and coconut milk; use a submergable wand blender to puree. Adjust seasonings; thin if needed with more broth.  Serve with a dollop of plain yogurt or sour cream.

Something I came up with to use what I had on hand. A tasty, thick blend that's just right for a chilly night. Omit the coconut milk and make it low-cal.
