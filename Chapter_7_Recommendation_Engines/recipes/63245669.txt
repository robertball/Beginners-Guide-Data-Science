Ingredients:
4 cups crushed strawberries
1 vanilla bean (split with insides scraped)
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 (2 ounce) package powdered fruit pectin
7 cups white sugar
1/4 cup amaretto or any almond liqueur
8 half pint canning jars with lids and rings

Directions:
Place the crushed strawberries, Vanilla bean scrapings, lemon juice, and pectin into a large saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Once simmering, stir in the sugar until dissolved, return to a boil, and cook for 1 minute. Remove from stove top and allow to rest one minute add the 1/4 cup amaretto stir well.
Pack the jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top.  Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any jam residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large canning pot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Bring the water to a boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.
Remove the jars  and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart. Allow to cool overnight.  Once cool, check the lids to make sure they have sealed properly. Store in a cool, dark place for up to 12 months.

A Delicious way to use up extra u-pick berries. We love the vanilla bean punch this recipes has. Way better than plain old strawberry jam!
