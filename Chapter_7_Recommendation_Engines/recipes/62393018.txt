Description: 
This classic recipe comes from my mom's grandmother and has been in the family for at least 100 years.  Growing up, my mom would make this while we were at school.  I loved coming home to the smell of this wonderfully moist and flavorful bread!  These days I like to add my own touch and add a couple of teaspoons of cinnamon.
