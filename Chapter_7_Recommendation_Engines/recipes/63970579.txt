Ingredients:
1 pound lump crabmeat
8 saltine crackers, crushed
1 egg
1 tablespoon mustard
1 tablespoon mayo (or greek yogurt for a healthier version)
pinch of cayenne pepper
salt & pepper to taste
1 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a bowl except oil and stir until thoroughly combined.
Heat a skillet on medium heat and add olive oil.
While it’s heating, form the crab mixture into small patties – you will get about 5 to 6 cakes.
Place them in the skillet and cook until lightly golden brown, about 3-4 minutes on each side.
