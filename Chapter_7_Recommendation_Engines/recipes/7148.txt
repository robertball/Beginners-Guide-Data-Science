Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup margarine
1 cup milk
1/3 cup margarine
1 cup packed brown sugar
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/3 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 12-cup muffin pan.
In a large bowl combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in the 1/4 cup of the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the middle and pour in the milk. Mix until blended.
Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead 8 to 10 times. Roll dough out into a rectangle 12 inches long and 1 inch thick, trim off any uneven edges.
Cream the 1/3 cup butter and the brown sugar, stir in the raisins and ground cinnamon. Drop small amounts into the greased muffin pan. Spread the remainder over evenly over the dough.
Starting at the short end roll the dough up (jelly roll style) and cut into 12 pieces. Place 1 each in the muffin pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes. Let sit in pans for 10 minutes then invert to remove. Glaze with a milk a confectioners' sugar mixture, if desired.
