Ingredients:
1 Cup White rice flour?
1 Banana’s (Mashed)
1 tsp baking powder
½ Cup Carob Powder
½ Cup Oats
¾ Cup Fat Free Milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease 2 large baking sheets.  (I used my large Pampered chef stoneware bar pans)
In a large bowl, combine together all the dry ingredients and mashed banana. Slowly mixing in the milk.
Mix together on a medium speed until the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
Turn the dough onto a floured surface (I used extra carob powder, just to keep the deep brown colour of the biscuits) and kneed for approximately one minute until its no longer sticky.
Roll out the dough to ¼ inch thickness and cut into mini size shapes with your favorite cookie cutter.  Should make approx 75 bite size cookies.
Bake for 25 minutes at full heat, then turn the oven off and leave the cookies in the oven for a further 30-40 minutes.
Leave cookies in the baking tray for 10 minutes before cooling on a wire rack.
Storing - This recipe, as well as other recipes for pet treats, can be stored for later enjoyment. Since they are baked quite hard, you can keep them in an air tight container for approximately 2 weeks
