Ingredients:
1 cup butter, melted
1 cup creamy peanut butter; resist the temptation to use more ;-)
1 cup Splenda
1 cup Xylitol
1 tsp molasses
1 eggs
1 egg yolk
2.5 low carb flour mix: alt 1: 1-1/2 cup vital wheat gluten, 1/2 cup oat flour, 1/2 cup almond meal
1/2 cup spent brewing grains
1.5 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
2 cups dark chocolate chips
1-1/2 cups blanched hazelnuts - CHOPPED

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix butter, peanut butter, sugar substitute, molasses, and eggs. If you use a mixer, blend on medium.
Separately, mix together flours, baking soda, and salt. Add to other mixture. If you use a blender, start on low speed (don't want to poof flour everywhere!)
Mix in chocolate chips and nuts.
I love recipes that you can freeze - this freezes great! If you're going to freeze, make large tablespoon-sized balls and lay them out in a Tupperware container separating each layer with parchment or wax paper.
If you're going to cook right away, preheat oven to 400F and place the the tablespoon-sized balls onto a cookie sheet lined with Silpat pad or parchment paper.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes from room temp, or 12 - 14 minutes from frozen. Time depends a lot on just how big you make them - what you're looking for is a nice golden doneness. With this low carb recipe, it helps to tap down the cookies halfway through - they don't melt down like the regular version.
Let cool on the cookie sheet
