Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable oil, plus more
1 1/4 cups plus 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour; plus more
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped
3  large eggs
1 cup granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
8 ounces carrots, coarsely grated (about 2 cups)
2 tsp light brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. Lightly oil and flour 12 cups in your muffin tins. Whisk baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and 1 1/4 cups flour in a small bowl. Toss raisins, walnuts, and remaining 1 Tbsp. flour in another bowl.
Beat eggs and granulated sugar in a medium bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.  While still beating, gradually drizzle in 1 cup oil, then add vanilla. Fold in dry ingredients, raisin mixture, and carrots; scrape batter into prepared cups. Sprinkle with brown sugar.
Bake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 minutes. Let cool slightly in pan, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
