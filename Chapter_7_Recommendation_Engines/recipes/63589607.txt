Ingredients:
1.5 pounds ground turkey
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp oregano (dried)
1/4 tsp thyme (dried)
2 tbsp basil (dried)
7 garlic cloves, minced (1 tbsp)
1/2 tsp fennel, crushed
1/2 tsp paprika
1 tsp sea salt
1 shallot, finely minced (or 1 tsp dried onion)
15 oz can tomato sauce
8 oz water
12 oz tomato paste
2 tbsp ground chia seeds
6 tbsp warm water
3 cups cottage cheese
3 cups (packed) fresh spinach
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tbsp parsley flakes
1/2 tsp pepper
8 oz mozzarella cheese, grated
4-5 zucchini (aprox size of a fat banana)

Directions:
In a large skillet or pot, combine the turkey and all of the spices. Cook turkey on medium high heat until browned. (If excess oil remains, drain the oil and return meat to the pot). Add the tomato sauce, water and tomato paste and stir to combine. Simmer, uncovered for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Chop spinach into tiny pieces.
In a large bowl combine spinach, cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, parsley flakes & pepper.
Mix ground chia seeds with 6 Tbsp warm water until just combined but before lumps form. Mix in with spinach and cottage cheese mixture.
Slice the zucchini into long 1/8" thick slices.
In a 9x13 baking dish, spread a tiny bit of the meat sauce on the bottom of the dish to prevent the zucchini from sticking to the pan and to help it cook. Place a layer of zucchini on top of the meat, followed by 1/2 the cottage cheese mixture, 1/2 the shredded/grated mozzarella cheese and followed by 1/2 th meat sauce. Repeat with the next layer then bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Cleaning up the family favorite recipe for lasagna by making our own Italian spiced turkey sausage instead of store-bought, sugar-infused pork sausage using zucchini instead of pasta, ground chia seeds instead of eggs (to bind the cheese layer) while reducing the amount of mozzarella, allows this dish to be more healthy while keeping the comfort and taste that we know and love in tact.
