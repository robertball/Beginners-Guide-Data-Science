Ingredients:
1 stick butter
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
6-8 slices canned pineapple
6-8 maraschino cherries
1 (18.25 oz.) package white cake mix

Directions:
Melt the butter on medium high heat in the microwave. Pour the melted butter evenly into the bundt pan and sprinkle with the brown sugar to cover the butter. Sprinkle nuts over brown sugar. Next, arrange pineapple rings around the bottom of the pan, one layer deep. Place a maraschino cherry into the center of each pineapple ring.
Prepare the cake mix as directed on the box, substituting pineapple juice for some of the liquid in the directions. Carefully pour the batter over the pineapple layer.
Bake as directed by the cake mix directions. Cool for 10 minutes, then carefully invert onto a plate. Do not let the cake cool too much or it will  stick to the pan.
Serve with a dollop of fresh whipped cream.
