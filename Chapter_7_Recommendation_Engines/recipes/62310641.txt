2  cans (15.5 ounces each) pinto beans, drained and rinsed
1/2  cup dry fine bread crumbs
1/2  cup bottled salsa
1  egg
1  teaspoon chili powder
1/2  teaspoon ground cumin

Prepare charcoal grill with medium-hot coals or heat gas grill to medium-high (or heat oven broiler). Lightly coat grill rack or broiler-pan rack with nonstick cooking spray.
Reserve 1 cup of the pinto beans. Whirl remaining beans in a food processor or mash with fork in large bowl until smooth.
In large bowl, combine the reserved 1 cup beans, the pureed beans, bread crumbs, the 1/2 cup salsa, egg, chili powder and cumin. Stir in crushed chips. Shape into six patties. Coat both sides of each patty with nonstick cooking spray.
Grill or broil about 4 inches from heat, turning once, about 10 minutes or until instant-read thermometer inserted in centers registers 160Â°F. Serve in pita pocket halves with lettuce and tomato slices. Serve with additional salsa.
