Description: 
Spring is the season for greenhouse vegetables, and to celebrate their abundance Foodland Ontario created this soup featuring two of the major crops, sweet peppers and tomatoes. While greenhouse peppers are always ready to enjoy, tomatoes, picked firm for safe transport, profit from a little ripening before slicing into salads or roasting as for this vivid soup. Plan on leaving them on the counter for 3 to 4 days until good and red.
