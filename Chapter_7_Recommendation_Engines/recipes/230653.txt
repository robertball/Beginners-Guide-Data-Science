Ingredients:
4 cups whole wheat flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups applesauce
3/4 cup peanut oil
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir applesauce, peanut oil, and water into flour mixture until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Drop golf ball-sized spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are browned, 10 to 12 minutes.
