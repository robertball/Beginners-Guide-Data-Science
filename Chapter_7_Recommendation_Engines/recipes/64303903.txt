Ingredients:
5 eggs
4 slices bacon
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, or to taste
1 cup mayonnaise
2 pounds small potatoes
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bake the bacon @375* for 30-40 minutes. Place the potatoes in a pot with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cook for about 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain and cool.
Meanwhile, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, and place in a bowl of cold water to cool.
Peel the eggs, and place 3 of them into a large bowl. Reserve the rest for later. Slice the eggs with an egg slicer. Stir in the mustard, mayonnaise, salt and pepper. Set aside.
Crumble 2 of the bacon slices into the mayonnaise mixture. Reserve the rest for garnish.
Peel and chop the potatoes, and stir into the bowl until evenly coated. Slice the 2 remaining eggs, and place on top of the salad. Crumble the remaining bacon over the eggs, then sprinkle parsley over the top.
