Ingredients:
1 6-oz package of cherry gelatin
1 large pomegranate
3 cups water

Directions:
Prepare gelatin per package instructions and add pomegranate seeds as directed to add fruit or, my technique:
In a four-cup Pyrex bowl, pour in two cups of water
Bring to an almost-boil in the microwave oven...about four minutes.
Remove from microwave, add cherry gelatin and stir until dissolved (probably one to two minutes)
Add one cup of cool water or enough ice cubes to bring the water level up to three cups.
Place the Pyrex bowl (or the contents poured into a shallow glass pan) in the refrigerator for one hour
During the hour of refrigeration, remove the seeds from the pomegranate
Remove from the refrigerator and add pomegranate seeds to the cherry gelatin, making sure that all seeds are submerged
Allow to gel for about four hours.
