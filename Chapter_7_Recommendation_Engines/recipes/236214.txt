Description: 
After searching the web for recipes that include carrot juice (had too much and nobody at home drinks it), I found two that used it with chicken. I decided to combine them both and got one of the best kitchen experiments in my life. Apricots can be substituted for dates if desired. Served it with saffron rice. Worth a try!
