Ingredients:
2 large egg whites
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4  teaspoon salt
1 package (7 ounces) sweetened shredded coconut
1/2 cup sliced almonds or chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. Coat a standard (12-cup) nonstick muffin tin with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, whisk egg whites, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt until combined. Add coconut; mix with a fork until coated. Dividing evenly, spoon mixture into prepared tin, and pat in gently with moistened fingers; sprinkle with almonds, and pat on gently.
Bake until almonds are golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool  at least 10 minutes in tin or it will break apart when you remove them. Run a thin metal spatula around macaroons to loosen them from pan; turn out onto rack, and cool completely. Cookies keep in an airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days.
