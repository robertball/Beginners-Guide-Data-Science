Ingredients:
3 cups palm sugar
2 cups water
1 1/4 pounds almost ripe kai bananas, peeled
1/2 cup coconut cream
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Mix sugar and water in a wok or large skillet and heat until the syrup starts to boil. Lower heat and cook syrup until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes.
Place bananas gently into the syrup and cook until they are shiny and orange in color, about 5 minutes. Flip the bananas to cook on the other side, about 5 minutes. Transfer bananas and syrup to a serving dish.
Mix coconut cream and salt in a small saucepan over low heat; simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes. Drizzle coconut cream mixture over bananas to serve.

Description: 
Kai bananas are nice and firm for cooking in a syrup. These bananas are slightly smaller than most bananas, about the size of your palm. In this recipe, the bananas are gently cooked in a sugar syrup and topped with a coconut cream.
