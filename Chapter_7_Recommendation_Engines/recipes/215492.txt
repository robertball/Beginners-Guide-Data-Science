Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup white sugar
2 cups grated zucchini
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup shredded coconut
1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Beat the eggs in a large bowl until frothy. Stir the vegetable oil, sugar, and zucchini into the eggs.
Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into the zucchini mixture until combined. Fold the coconut and chocolate chips into the resulting mixture; pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
