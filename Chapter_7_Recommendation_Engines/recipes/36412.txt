Ingredients:
6 pork chops
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic salt
1 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves, crushed
1/2 teaspoon dried basil leaves, crushed
1 orange, thinly sliced
1 lemon, thinly sliced
1/2 cup coffee flavored liqueur
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons chopped green onion

Directions:
Trim excess fat from chops. Heat skillet over medium heat, and rub a piece of fat over the bottom of the pan. Cook chops, turning occasionally, until browned on both sides (4 to 6 minutes).
Season chops with garlic salt, rosemary, and basil.  Arrange slices of orange and lemon over meat, and pour coffee liqueur and 1/4 cup water over all. Cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, or until meat is tender.
Blend cornstarch with remaining 1/4 cup water, and stir into pan liquid; cook until thick. Sprinkle with green onions, and serve.
