Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
1 small onion, minced
2 stalks celery, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs
1 egg
1/4 cup milk
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Mix the ground turkey, onion, celery, garlic, basil, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, egg, and milk together in a large bowl. Shape the mixture into a loaf and place into prepared pan. Pour the tomato soup over the meatloaf. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
