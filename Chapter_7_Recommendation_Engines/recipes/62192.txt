Description: 
They don't sell Strawberry Nectar in my town, so I make my own. The apple juice is for sweetness. Be careful: not all brands have a good aftertaste even frozen. Fresh juiced apple is better. Thawed frozen strawberries may be used when fresh is not available. Be sure to use unsweetened ones.
