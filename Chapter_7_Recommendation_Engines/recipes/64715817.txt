Ingredients:
2 cups water
12 ounce can beer
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 pound corned beef brisket with season packet

Directions:
1. Add water, beer, and garlic to the Instant Pot. Place trivet inside.
2. Place corned beef on top of the trivet and sprinkle season packet over the brisket.
3. Secure the lid, lock, seal, and select the manual setting. Set for 90 minutes. Allow an extra 10 minutes for your Instant Pot to come up to pressure.
4. Do a quick release. Transfer brisket to a baking sheet and cover with foil for 15 minutes to rest.
5. Cook's note: If you'd like to do a complete Irish feast, remove the trivet while your brisket is resting and place baby carrots, quartered red potatoes, and cabbage wedges in the bottom of the Instant Pot. Secure the lid, lock, seal, and select the manual setting. Set for 5 minutes. Do a quick release.  The rested brisket and vegetables are ready at the same time.

Description: 
Corned beef used to be a weekend only treat for me due to how long it took to cook until I discovered the Instant Pot. Save yourself time and hassle by letting your Instant Pot do all of the work for you, and in a fraction of the time. You can have it and all of the fixings on your table in 2 hours. If you decide to fix cabbage, be sure to keep it in large wedges so that it does not overcook.
