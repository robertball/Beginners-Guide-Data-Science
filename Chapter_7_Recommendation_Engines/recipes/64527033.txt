Ingredients:
Graham Crackers
1 C.  butter
1/2 C. sugar
4 oz. slivered almonds

Directions:
1.  Place 1 layer of Graham crackers in a foil lined jelly roll pan.
2.  Melt butter and add sugar. Boil hard for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. The mixture will resemble thick honey. Be sure it doesnâ€™t caramelize, but it does need to thicken a bit.
3.  Evenly spread mixture all over graham crackers.
4.  Sprinkle with almonds.
5.  Bake at 350 degrees about 8 minutes until top bubbles. Watch carefully as it burns easily.
6.  Cool completely.
7.  Pull foil and cookies out of pan and cut into rectangles (a pizza cutter along graham perforations works great).
