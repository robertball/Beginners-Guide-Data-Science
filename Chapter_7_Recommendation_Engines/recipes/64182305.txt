Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil.

Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Place noodles in a large bowl.
Mix margarine into the noodles until melted. Stir in the eggs, sugar, applesauce, raisins, vanilla extract.
Pour noodle mixture into a 9x13 inch greased baking pan, then sprinkle with cinnamon mixture. Cover baking pan with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover the kugel and bake until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
