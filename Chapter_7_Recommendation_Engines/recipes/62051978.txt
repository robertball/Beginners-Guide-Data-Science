Ingredients:
3 1/2 - 4 lb beef brisket, trimmed of fat
1/4 cup butter
2 large onions
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 - 2 cloves garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons Kitchen Bouquet
1 teaspoon Beau Monde (this is the "secret" ingredient, so don't omit)
1 package dry onion soup mix
8 buttered sour dough French rolls

Directions:
Saute the onion in butter until transparent.  Set aside.  In blender, combine soy sauce, oil, garlic, Kitchen Bouquet and Beau Monde.  In a large bowl, mix the onion soup mix with 5 cups water.  Mix in onion and blender mixture.  Place meat in roaster with lid.  Pour liquid over meat.  Cover and bake in a 350 degree oven for 3 - 5 hours.  (I inadvertantly let it cook for over 8 once and it was still wonderful)  Remove meat from pan, cover to keep warm.  Add ice cubes (about 2 cups) to liquid to congeal fat; skim off. Re-heat. Taste for seasoning.  If too strong for your taste, add a little water. Slice meat thin against the grain.  Halve rolls, butter and broil until brown.  Top rolls with meat and serve cups of broth on the side for dipping.
Note:  My Grandma always chilled the meat and broth together and then scraped fat off the broth.  I think that this takes too long, so I use the ice-cube method.  It still tastes the same to me and saves hours!

Description: 
Brisket slow cooked in a flavorful broth.  Easy and delicious!  The bread you choose to serve this on is important!  A firm crusted bread really holds the broth well.
