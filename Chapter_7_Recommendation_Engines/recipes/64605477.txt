Ingredients:
4 lbs spare ribs
1Â½ Tbsp brown sugar
1 Tbsp smoked paprika (regular is fine if that's what you have)
1 Tbsp garlic powder
1 1/2 tsp ground cumin
1 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp coarse salt
1 tsp chili powder
barbecue sauce

Directions:
Pat ribs dry, and cut them into sections so they'll fit in the slow cooker.
Combine seasonings in a bowl, and rub mixture all over ribs.
Place ribs in the slow cooker, meat-side down.
Cook for 8-10 hours on low, or for 4-5 hours on high.
Before serving, brush with barbecue sauce if desired.

Description: 
Slow cooker spare ribs? I was skeptical. Until  I modified a recipe that called for a dry rub and NO LIQUID. Boom. Easy and delicious. One of the best things about this recipe is that it is easily modified. Use the spices you have on hand, and serve with or without barbeque sauce. I would recommend chasing these ribs with a cold beer, but that's up to you, too.
