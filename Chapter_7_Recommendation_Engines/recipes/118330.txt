Ingredients:
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons reduced fat peanut butter
4 teaspoons lime juice
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into thin strips
2 teaspoons canola oil, divided
2 small zucchini, sliced
1 medium sweet red pepper, julienned
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
In a blender or food processor, combine the first 10 ingredients; cover and process until smooth. In a large nonstick skillet, stir-fry chicken in 1 teaspoon hot oil for 5-7 minutes or until juices run clear. Remove chicken and keep warm. In the same skillet, stir-fry vegetables in remaining hot oil until crisp-tender. Return chicken to pan. Stir sauce and add to the pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Serve over rice if desired.
