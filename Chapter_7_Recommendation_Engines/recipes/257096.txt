Ingredients:
Filling:
5 tablespoons butter, divided
2 tablespoons canola oil
3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into chunks
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1/3 cup finely chopped onion
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
2 cubes chicken bouillon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup sour cream
3 tablespoons dry sherry
2 teaspoons dried parsley, divided
Crepes:
1 cup milk
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Melt remaining 1/4 cup butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup flour and cook for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add 2 cups milk, chicken bouillon cubes, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until thickened into a sauce, about 5 minutes. Stir in sour cream and sherry.
Scoop 1 cup sauce into a bowl; keep warm. Stir chicken and 1 teaspoon parsley into remaining sauce in the skillet. Simmer until chicken is heated through, about 5 minutes.
Beat 1 cup milk, 3/4 cup flour, egg, 1 tablespoon melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and baking powder together in a bowl to make crepe batter.
Grease a 7-inch skillet lightly; heat over medium heat. Pour 2 tablespoons batter into the skillet, swirling to spread evenly. Cook crepe until golden brown, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer crepe to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter, separating crepes with waxed paper and covering to keep warm.
Scoop 1/4 cup chicken mixture onto each crepe and roll up. Spoon reserved 1 cup sauce over filled crepes. Garnish with remaining 1 teaspoon parsley.

I remember eating chicken and mushroom crepes at my favorite crepe franchise that has since gone out of business. I was finally able to duplicate the recipe and I wanted to share it with everyone. Very easy and delicious!
