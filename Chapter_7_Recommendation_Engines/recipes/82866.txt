In a medium bowl, mix the eggs, celery, onion, salmon, and mayonnaise. Season with dill, salt, and pepper. Refrigerate at least 2 hours to allow flavors to combine.
Spread 8 slices of bread with equal amounts of the salad. Top with lettuce and cucumber, and remaining bread slices to make 8 sandwiches.
