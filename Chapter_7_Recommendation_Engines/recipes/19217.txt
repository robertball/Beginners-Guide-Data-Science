Ingredients:
Dough
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/8 cup shortening
2 eggs
2 tablespoons dry white wine
Filling
1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese
1 egg
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together 2 cups of the flour, sugar and salt. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Make a well in the center and pour the eggs and white wine into it. Stir with a fork, gradually bringing the dry mixture into the center until a dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead in remaining flour until smooth. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes.
In a small bowl, stir together the ricotta cheese, egg, sugar and vanilla until well blended. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut out 3 inch circles using a cookie cutter or a glass. Place 1 tablespoon of the ricotta cheese mixture in the center of each circle. Fold edges over into a half-moon shape and press to seal. Raviolis can be frozen at this point and saved for later. It seems to help keep the filling from oozing out while frying.
In a large heavy skillet, heat oil, one inch deep, to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Place the ravioli into the hot oil so that they are not crowded. Fry on both sides until golden. Drain on paper towels. If you like, dust with confectioners' sugar or drizzle with honey before serving.
