Directions:
took Melissa1979's great transcript and edited into a recipe format. Thanks Melissa. Our fish tacos are spiced with cumin, coriander, and chili peppers. For a party, set up a platter and have your guests assemble them as they wish. First, pre heat the grill to medium-high. Next, cut the fish, we're using tilapia, (length-wise) into equal slices. You can also use grouper or any other firm fish like sword fish or sea bass. In a small bowl , combine • 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil • 3 tablespoons of lime juice • 3 teaspoons of chili pepper • 1 teaspoon of ground cumin • 1 teaspoon of ground coriander • 1 teaspoon of minced garlic • Salt to taste, then stir. Coat the fish with the marinade and place in a grilling basket over direct heat for about 2 minutes. When cooking a delicate fish, it's a good idea to grill it in a basket so your fish doesn't fall apart. Flip it and then grill about 1-2 minutes longer. Place flour tortillas on the grill for 15 seconds eac
