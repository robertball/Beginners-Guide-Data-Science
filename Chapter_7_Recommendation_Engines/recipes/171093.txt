Ingredients:
2 cups water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 cup baking soda

Directions:
Pour the water, lemon juice, and baking soda into a spray bottle. Be careful, the lemon juice and baking soda will foam up. To use, spray on vegetables, and let sit for 5 minutes. Rinse the vegetables under cold, running water using a scrub brush.
