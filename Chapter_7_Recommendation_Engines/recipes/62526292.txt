Description: 
This is the 'secret' Greek dressing recipe from the pizzeria at which Danielle M worked; she published it on Allrecipes.com and I modified it slightly. It travels very well and is great for picnics since it doesn't need to be refrigerated.  This is the best dressing I have ever tasted!Modified from: Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing
