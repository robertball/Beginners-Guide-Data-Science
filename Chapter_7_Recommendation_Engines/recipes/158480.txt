Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoons chilled butter, cut into tiny pieces
1/3 cup dried tart cherries, chopped
1/3 cup dried cranberries, chopped
1/4 cup dried wild blueberries
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 teaspoons finely shredded orange peel
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons unbleached all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 egg white, beaten
Glaze:
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon orange juice concentrate diluted with
1/2 teaspoon water
1/2 teaspoon orange extract
1/4 teaspoon water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.
In a medium bowl, stir together 1 1/2 cups all-purpose and the whole wheat flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture is the consistency of course cornmeal. Stir in cherries, cranberries, and blueberries. Set aside.
In a small bowl, stir together egg, buttermilk, orange peel, and vanilla.
Make a well in center of flour mixture and pour in buttermilk mixture. Using a fork, stir just until flour mixture is moistened. (Do not over mix.) Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10 to 12 times with floured hands. Place dough on sprayed baking sheet.
Sprinkle with as much of the 3 teaspoons of flour as necessary, and pat into a 9-inch round. Cut through to form 8 wedges, but leave in a circle. Brush the beaten egg white over the tops of the wedges with a pastry brush.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through.
Remove from oven and re-cut wedges. Cool scones on baking sheet for 5 minutes. Remove scones from baking sheet and cool on wire rack.
Glaze: In a small bowl, stir together powdered sugar, orange juice-water mixture, and orange extract. Stir in enough of the water to make a desired drizzling consistency. Drizzle glaze over cooled scones.
