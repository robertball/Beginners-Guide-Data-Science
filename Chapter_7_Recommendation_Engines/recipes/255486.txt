Ingredients:
3 pounds turnips, peeled and cubed
water to cover
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more to taste
4 leeks, white portion only, thinly sliced
4 stalks celery, sliced
4 cups chicken stock, divided
6 strips cooked crispy bacon, or more to taste
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
2 cups whole milk
2 green onions, sliced, or more to taste

Directions:
Place turnips in a pot and add water until covered by 3 to 4 inches; bring to a boil. Cook, stirring every 5 to 10 minutes, until soft, about 30 minutes. Drain.
Heat oil in the pot over medium heat. Add leeks and celery; cook and stir until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
Blend leek mixture, 1 cup chicken stock, bacon, cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a food processor until smooth. Pour back into the pot.
Blend half of the turnips and 1 cup chicken stock in the food processor until smooth; pour into the pot. Repeat with remaining turnips and 1 cup chicken stock.
Pour remaining 1 cup chicken stock into the pot; stir in milk. Simmer, without boiling, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Ladle into bowls; garnish with green onions.

Description: 
This is a lower-carb version of potato soup that I created with my 7-year-old daughter for her mother. Both of my children, who eat healthy but can be notoriously picky, loved it. You are replacing potato with turnip, which makes this a very healthy and delicious low-carb, diabetic-friendly meal.
