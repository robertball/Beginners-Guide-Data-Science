Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup diced onion
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 cup ale
1 1/2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon honey
1 tablespoon coarse-grained mustard
1 link bratwurst (4 to 6 ounces; may substitute cooked chicken sausage)
1/4 head green and/or purple cabbage (1 to 2 cups shredded)
Kosher salt

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Add the onion and stir to coat evenly, then add the garlic powder and cook for a few minutes, until the onion is soft but not quite brown. Add the ale, cider vinegar, honey and mustard; cook for about 5 minutes, stirring. Add the sausage (whole) and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 15 to 18 minutes, reducing the heat to medium-low if necessary to keep the liquid from evaporating too quickly.
Meanwhile, cut the cabbage into 1/2-inch dice and place in a colander set in the sink. Sprinkle liberally with kosher salt and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then rinse thoroughly with cool running water. Squeeze dry and place in a bowl.
Once the sausage is cooked, pour the warm juices from the skillet over the cabbage. Cut the warmed bratwurst crosswise into 1/4-inch slices and place them on the salad. Season with pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Basically, this is a hot German wurst in salad form. The cabbage represents the sauerkraut, the honey-mustard-beer dressing is a doctored-up version of our yellow condiment friend, and, of course, the chopped-up sausage is the dog itself.. From The Washington Post 2/27/08.
