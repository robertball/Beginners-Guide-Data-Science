Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
2 cups chicken broth
2 cups milk
1 cup quick-cooking grits
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon ground cumin
4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, minced
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies
1 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and milk. Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat to low. Slowly whisk in the grits, then cover the saucepan, and cook for 5 minutes.
Once the grits have cooked, stir in the salt, pepper, cumin, chipotle peppers, green chiles, and 1 cup of Cheddar cheese until the cheese has melted. Pour the grits into the prepared 9x13 inch dish, and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is bubbly, and has begun to brown, 30-45 minutes.
