Ingredients:
2 T. butter, melted
3 medium apples, peeled
1/2 c. flour
1 tsp. baking powder
2 large eggs at room temp.
1/3 c. sugar
pinch sea salt
2 tsp. vanilla extract
6 T. whole milk, room temp

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Slice apples 1/16 inch thick (food processor works nicely).
Whisk eggs, sugar and salt in a large bowl for about 2 minutes, till the sugar has just about dissolved and, eggs are pale. Whisk in vanilla, then milk and butter. Add flour and baking poser to the bowl and whisk till smooth.
Fold in apples, turning gently till each thin slice is coated in batter. Scrape mixture into an 8-inch square greased baking pan, smoothing the top as evenly as you can.
Bake for 40-50 minutes till golden brown and puffed -- make sure the middle of the cake has risen -- and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
Variations: Add a couple T. of dark rum or a drop of almond extract to better. Use pears or a combo of apples and pears, or a couple mangos.
