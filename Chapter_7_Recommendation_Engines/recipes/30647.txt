Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup barbeque sauce
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢)
1 (7.5 ounce) package refrigerated biscuit dough
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat. As soon as it begins to brown a little, add the onion. Cook and stir until beef is evenly browned. Drain off grease, then stir in the barbeque sauce and hot pepper sauce. Set aside.
Peel the biscuits apart in round layers, and use them to line the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread the ground beef mixture over the biscuits, then top with shredded cheese.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the biscuits are cooked through, and cheese is melted.
