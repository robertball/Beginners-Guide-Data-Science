Ingredients:
24 graham crackers
2 full-size Hershey bars
48 mini marshmallows
about 1/2 c. creamy peanut butter

Directions:
Carefully break each graham cracker in half.
Break each Hershey bar into individual squares (12 squares per bar).
Thinly spread peanut butter on 24 of the graham cracker halves and set aside.
Put 6 or 8 of the remaining graham cracker halves on a microwave-safe plate and place one square of chocolate on each in the center of the cracker.
Microwave on high for 20 seconds to soften the chocolate slightly.
Remove the plate from microwave and place two mini-marshmallows on top of each cracker/chocolate.
Microwave again just until marshmallows beging to puff and melt, about 15-20 more seconds.
Remove plate from microwave and top with peanut buttered graham cracker halves, peanut butter side down. Press slightly to meld the marshmallow, chocolate and peanut butter.
Repeat until all s'mores are done.
Serve warm, or refrigerate until set.
