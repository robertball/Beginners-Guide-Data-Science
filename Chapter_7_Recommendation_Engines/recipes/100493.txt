Ingredients:
4 serrano chile peppers, or to taste
2 cloves garlic
1 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves
1 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 cup olive oil

Directions:
Place the chile peppers, garlic, cilantro, salt, and egg into the bowl of a blender. Puree until smooth, then, with motor running, slowly pour in the olive oil. Continue blending for a minute or two until the sauce acquires a mayonnaise-like texture.

Description: 
This is a popular and extremely easy salsa in Mexico. More to the fashion of a mayonnaise, Salsa Chilena (I wouldn't know where the name originates, because it translates as Chilean Sauce) is an elegant alternative to serve with broiled steak or chicken. Serve the same day preferably, but it will keep well for a couple of days
