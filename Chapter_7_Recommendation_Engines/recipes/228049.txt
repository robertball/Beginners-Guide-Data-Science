Ingredients:
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons yellow miso paste
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
1 (1 1/2-pound) skirt steak, cut into 4 pieces
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine vinegar, miso paste, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, and garlic in a small bowl. Stir until smooth.
Spread miso mixture generously on both sides of skirt steaks. Sprinkle with black pepper. Allow to rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes.
Prepare a charcoal grill for medium-high heat. Place steak on the grill and cook without moving for about 2 minutes. Turn steaks 180 degrees to create cross-hatch grill marks, and cook another 2 minutes. Flip steaks and continue cooking until medium-rare to medium on the inside, and shiny on the outside, about 4 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 135 degrees F (57 degrees C). Allow to rest for 5 minutes.
