Description: 
An old friend of mine, Mike, taught me how to make the SLAMMIN'-EST wing sauce on the face of the Earth! He is and was from Bethlehem, therefore the name :)
Believe me, you will NOT regret this sauce at all!!!! It's a thick rich yummy sleeper sauce. By Sleeper I mean that it doesn't seem like much at first, but then it wakes up in your mouth. Also, as quickly as it shows up, the fire dies out just enough for you to go... yeah... I want more of that! :)
