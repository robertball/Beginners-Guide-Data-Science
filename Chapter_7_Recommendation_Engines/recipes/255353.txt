Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/4 cup maple syrup
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups almond flour
3 tablespoons coconut oil, melted and cooled
1 cup shredded carrots
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Mix maple syrup, cinnamon, almond extract, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl with an electric mixer. Add almond flour 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until combined. Mix in coconut oil 1 tablespoon at a time. Fold carrots and coconut into the batter with a spatula.
Drop 12 portions of the batter onto the baking sheet using an ice cream scoop. Flatten gently with the palm of your hand.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack.
