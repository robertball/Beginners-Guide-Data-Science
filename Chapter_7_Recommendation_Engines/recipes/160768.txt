Ingredients:
1 pound beef oxtail, cut into pieces
1 large onion, chopped
1 green onion, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1 scotch bonnet chile pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 sprig fresh thyme, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup canned fava beans, drained
1 teaspoon whole allspice berries
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
Toss the oxtail with the onion, green onion, garlic, ginger, chile pepper, soy sauce, thyme, salt, and pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the oxtail in the skillet until browned all over, about 10 minutes. Place into a pressure cooker, and pour in 1 1/2 cup water. Cook at pressure for 25 minutes, then remove from heat, and remove the lid according to manufacturer's directions.
Add the fava beans and allspice berries, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons water, and stir into the simmering oxtail. Cook and stir a few minutes until the sauce has thickened, and the beans are tender.
