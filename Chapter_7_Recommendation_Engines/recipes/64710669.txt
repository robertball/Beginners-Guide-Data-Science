Ingredients:
2 cups Almond or cashew milk
3 cinnamon sticks
1 tablespoon coconut oil, optional**
114-ounce can full-fat canned coconut milk
¼ cup raw honey (*or powdered stevia or zylitol for low-carb)
¼ cup spiced rum
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a heavy medium saucepan, bring 2 cups almond milk and cinnamon sticks to a simmer for five minutes.
Cover, remove from heat and add coconut oil if using; allow to steep and cool for 30 minutes.
Remove lid and strain out cinnamon sticks, and whisk in coconut milk, honey, rum, and vanilla.
Chill for one hour; pour into an ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer’s directions.
Serve immediately for soft “ice milk” style or let set overnight for firm texture.**
*If using powdered sweetener, I recommend using a stick blender to fully combine coconut milk with sweetener before adding steeped cinnamon mixture.
**The coconut oil and rum both help keep ice cream from becoming rock solid; if frozen, let soften for 10 minutes to be scoopable.
