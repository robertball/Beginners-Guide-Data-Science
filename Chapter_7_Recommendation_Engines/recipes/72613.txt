Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½ cup spicy brown mustard
½ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
¼ cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons water
paprika to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.
Brush the chicken breast halves on all sides with the mustard. Place the bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Press the chicken into the bread crumbs to evenly coat. Arrange the chicken breasts in the prepared baking dish.
In a bowl, mix the butter, lemon juice, and water. Drizzle about 1 tablespoon of the mixture over each chicken breast. Pour the remaining mixture around the breasts in the dish.
Cover, and bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Uncover, season with paprika, and continue baking 15 minutes.
