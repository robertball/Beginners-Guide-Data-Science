Ingredients:
2 tablespoon butter
4 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
2 cup chicken broth, divided
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup whole milk
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt, pepper, and olive oil to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
8 ounces dry fettuccine or linguini pasta
Fresh parmesan cheese for garnish.
Crusty bread for eating

Directions:
In a large saucepan over low heat, melt butter; add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and 1 and 1/2 cup of the chicken broth; increase to medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes or until the tomatoes are tender. Add the cream and bring to a boil; stirring. Simmer over medium heat until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
Sprinkle the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder on both sides.
In a large skillet over medium heat, warm oil and saute chicken. Press on chicken occasionally with a slotted spatula. Cook for about 4 minutes per side or until the meat feels springy and is no longer pink inside. Transfer to a board; cover and keep warm.
In the same skillet, over medium heat, bring remaining 1/2 cup chicken broth to a boil; stirring the pan juices. Reduce slightly and add to the cream sauce; stir in basil and adjust seasonings to taste.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10  minutes or until al dente; drain, transfer to a bowl and toss with desired amount of the sauce.
Cut each chicken breast into diagonal slices. Reheat the sauce gently if needed. Transfer the pasta to serving plates; top with chicken and coat with the cream sauce; serve.
Garnish with Parmesan cheese.
