Description: 
For years, we enjoyed baked cinnamon apples at Christmas when my great-grandmother made them. When she passed away, no one could find the recipe. I eventually came across this stovetop version and have continued her tradition.                                           --Angie Marquart, Mt. Gilead, Ohio
