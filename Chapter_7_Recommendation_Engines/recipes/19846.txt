Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups crushed pretzels
1/2 cup white sugar
3/8 cup butter, melted
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 1/2 cups milk
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1/2 cup lime juice
1 teaspoon rum flavored extract
2 teaspoons grated lime zest
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
lime zest, garnish
2 limes, thinly sliced (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
To Make Crust: In a medium bowl, combine pretzel crumbs, sugar and butter. Press mixture into the bottom and 1 3/4 inches up the side of a 9 inch springform pan.
Bake in preheated oven for about 10 minutes, or until firm and lightly browned. Remove from oven and let cool completely.
To Make Filling: Allow cream cheese to reach room temperature. In a large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. In a separate bowl, combine pudding mix and milk, then mix in with cream cheese. Beat in lime juice, rum extract and lime and lemon zest.
Fold 1/2 of the whipped topping into the mixture, then pour into cooled crust. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. Garnish with remaining whipped topping, lime zest and slices, if desired.
