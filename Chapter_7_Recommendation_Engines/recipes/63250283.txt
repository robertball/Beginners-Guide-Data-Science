Description: 
I put this recipe together out of necessity to make Raspberry Cheesecake Cookies.  The raspberry chips were not available in my local stores.  Any flavor chips you desire are capable by changing the extract and food coloring.  This recipe allows you to have as many flavored morsels as there are extracts for a fraction of the cost.   Enjoy!
