Ingredients:
BREAD PUDDING
3 tablespoons butter or  margarine, melted
3 c  Whipping cream
10 oz White chocolate chopped
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
8    Egg yolks
1    Loaf day old french bread, sliced into 1/4 inch slices and dried in the oven
Milk chocolate shavings for garnish
SAUCE
8 oz White chocolate
1/3 cup Heavy cream

Directions:
Preparation:  Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.  Pour butter into a 13x9 dish and coat the bottom and sides.
Bread Pudding:  Heat the cream in a double boiler and add the white chocolate.  When the chocolate is melted, remove from heat and set aside.
In a double boiler, heat the milk, sugar, eggs and egg yolks until warm. Blend the egg mixture into the cream and chocolate mixture.
Place the bread slices in a baking pan. Pour 1/2 of the mixture over the bread and let settle for a while (about 20 minutes), making sure the bread soaks up all the mixture. Top with the rest of the mixture. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes until the top is golden brown.
For the sauce: Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler over barely simmering water.   Remove from heat and mix in heavy cream. Spoon over bread pudding.
Garnish with shaved chocolate
This dish is best served hot.
