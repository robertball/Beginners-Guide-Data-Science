Ingredients:
Avocado Dressing:
1 avocado, peeled and pitted
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon water, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Salad:
4 slices bacon
2 eggs
4 cups fresh mixed greens, rinsed and dried
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1/2 cup cucumber, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices

Directions:
Combine avocado, lemon juice, Greek yogurt, olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, salt, and black pepper in a small food processor. Pulse until mixture is smooth. Add water or milk to thin out dressing to desired consistency. Set aside.
Cook bacon in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Allow to cool; crumble into small pieces.
Remove all but 1 tablespoon of bacon grease from the skillet. Add eggs; cover and cook until whites are set and yolks are barely set, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Divide mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumber slices, and bacon crumbles between 2 plates. Drizzle in desired amount of avocado dressing. Top each salad with an egg. Serve immediately.
