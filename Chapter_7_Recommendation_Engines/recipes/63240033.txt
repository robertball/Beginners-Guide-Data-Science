Ingredients:
3 pounds beef chuck roast
2 (1 ounce) packages dry Italian salad dressing mix
1 cup water
1 (16 ounce) jar pepperoncini peppers
8 hoagie rolls, split

Directions:
Place the roast into a slow cooker, and season with Italian dressing mix. Pour in the water. Cover, and cook on High for 6 to 7 hours. During the last hour, shred the meat with two forks - if it does not shred easily, cook longer. Add the peppers, and as much of the juice as you like for additional flavor. Serve on buns.
