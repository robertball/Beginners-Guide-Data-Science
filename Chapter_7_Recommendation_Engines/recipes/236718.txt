Ingredients:
2 cups cooked wild rice
2 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons tapioca
1/2 cup chopped green onion

2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or more if needed

Directions:
Stir rice, eggs, tapioca, green onion, and salt together in a bowl.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat.
Spoon about 1/3 cup of the rice mixture into hot oil; fry until well-browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat until all batter is used.

My family doesn't care for leftover wild rice, but this one left them wanting more! Like potato pancakes, but with wild rice instead of potatoes.
