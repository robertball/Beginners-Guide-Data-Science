Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
1 cup milk
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1/2 cup raisins
3 tablespoons chopped walnuts (optional)
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Process oats in a food processor until finely ground. Mix oats, flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl.
Whisk buttermilk, milk, sugar, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, and egg in a separate bowl until smooth; mix into oat mixture until batter is well-mixed, about 30 strokes. Fold raisins and walnuts into batter.
Lightly oil a skillet or griddle and place over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
