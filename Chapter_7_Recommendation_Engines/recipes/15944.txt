Ingredients:
4 cups Concord grapes
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 recipe pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a foil-lined sheet pan on a lower oven rack.
Wash and stem the grapes. Squeeze the pulp out of the skins into a saucepan, saving the skins in a bowl.
Cook the pulp in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the seeds are beginning to come out.
Strain the pulp into the skins, using a spoon to rub the pulp off the seeds. Add sugar, flour and lemon juice.
Fit pastry into a 9-inch pie pan. Pour filling into crust. Use remaining pastry to make a lattice top.
Bake in the preheated oven on the sheet pan for about 50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly.

This is one of my favorite pies my mother used to make at least 50 years ago. I have 6 quarts of fruit in the freezer for this winter!
