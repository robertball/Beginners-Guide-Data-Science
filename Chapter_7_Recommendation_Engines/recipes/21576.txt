Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup shortening
2 eggs
1 teaspoon rum flavored extract
3/4 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8x4 inch loaf pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and ginger; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together sugar, butter, and shortening until light and fluffy. Blend in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the rum extract. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 65 to 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
