Ingredients:
1 cup wheat berries
4 cups water
2 carrots, diced
1 stalk celery, diced
1/4 white onion, diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon tahini
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon honey, or more to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Place wheat berries in a pot and cover with water; soak for 3 to 6 hours.
Drain wheat berries and add 4 cups water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until wheat berries are tender yet firm to the bite and water is absorbed, 1 to 2 hours. Remove pot from heat and cool.
Mix carrots, celery, onion, and parsley into wheat berries.
Whisk lemon juice, soy sauce, tahini, olive oil, honey, and salt together in a bowl until smooth; stir into wheat berries mixture.

Description: 
A local deli inspired me to attempt making this at home! A honey-lemon dressing complements the flavor and textures of this salad. Serve immediately or let stand in fridge for 12 hours to allow the flavors to meld.
