Ingredients:
8 eggs
1/4 cup ginger ale
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
can sliced mushrooms
8 oz. cream cheese
1 cup Provolone cheese (shredded)
small jar salsa
sour cream

Directions:
Preheat skillet and add oil or spray with Pam.
In a blender, combine eggs, ginger ale, baking soda, salt, and pepper. Blend on high until mixture is frothy - about 30 seconds.
Pour one quarter of it into hot skillet, and cook until sides are done. Carefully flip over omelet and cook 2 minutes. While in the skillet, spread 2 Tbsp. cream cheese onto one half, and top with a few spoonfuls of mushrooms.
Fold omelet over the filling, and remove from pan onto plate.
Sprinkle about 1/4 cup Provolone onto top of omelet, and top with 1/4 cup salsa, and dollop of sour cream.
To serve all four omelets at once, make omelets first and add only the shredded cheese. Then place omelets onto a platter and place in a warm oven as you make them. When all omelets are done, top with salsa and sour cream, and present the omelets on the platter. A pie server is great for getting them from the platter to the plates.
