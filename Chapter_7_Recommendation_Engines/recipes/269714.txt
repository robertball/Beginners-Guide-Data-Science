Ingredients:
Vinaigrette:
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed blood orange juice
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon maple syrup
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
Salad:
1 cup water
1/2 cup pearled farro
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 cups cubed butternut squash (1/2-inch)
1 cup chopped red onion (1/2-inch)
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons toasted pecans
3 tablespoons dried cranberries
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Whisk blood orange juice, vinegar, mustard, maple syrup, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Slowly drizzle in olive oil while constantly whisking. Set vinaigrette aside.
Combine water, farro, and salt in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer over low heat until water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine butternut squash, onion, garlic, olive oil, and salt on the prepared baking sheet and toss to coat evenly.
Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, stirring halfway through. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Transfer farro to a medium-sized bowl to cool.
Combine cooled farro, butternut squash, pecans, cranberries, and parsley in a large bowl. Drizzle with vinaigrette and toss to combine. Refrigerate salad for 20 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This nutty farro salad is loaded with roasted butternut squash, cranberries, and toasted pecans, all topped with a tangy blood orange vinaigrette. It pairs perfectly with roasted chicken or pork, yet it's hearty enough to eat on its own for lunch.
