Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin
16 ounces apple juice
4 potatoes, sliced and quartered
3 carrots, peeled and sliced
2 apples - peeled, cored, and sliced

Directions:
Combine pork, apple juice, potatoes, carrots, and apples in the bottom of a slow cooker.
Cover and cook on High until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 6 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
Nothing goes better with pork tenderloin than apple! Easy to throw in the slow cooker, go to work, and have a great meal ready as soon as you are home. I like to make a gravy out of the broth after I am done by mixing in a cup of flour. Great flavor.
