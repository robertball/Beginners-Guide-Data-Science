Ingredients:
Filling:
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup uncooked orzo pasta
2 1/2 cups chicken broth, or as needed
1 tablespoon prepared demi glace
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups chopped cooked chicken
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
2 portobello mushroom caps, gills removed
4 slices smoked mozzarella

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium high heat and cook bell pepper until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic during the last 30 seconds and saut√© until fragrant. Stir in orzo and add 1 cup chicken broth, demi glace, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and chicken. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup chicken broth. Cook and stir until liquid is absorbed and add the next 1/2 cup chicken broth, about 5 minutes. Repeat until orzo pasta is tender - you may not need all the chicken broth. Add spinach during the last minute of cooking.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Place mushroom caps on a rimmed baking sheet. Add equal amounts of orzo filling to the mushroom caps. Top with smoked mozzarella cheese and broil until golden brown and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
Quite some time ago I tried an incredible stuffed mushroom dish at an Italian restaurant. This version takes advantage of precooked chicken for faster prep. There really is no substitute for the demi glace, although homemade is an option, I purchased mine at a local kitchen store. The quantity below will full two large mushroom caps or four medium mushroom caps.
