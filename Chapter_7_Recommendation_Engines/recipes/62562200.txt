Ingredients:
1 lb Italian turkey sausage links
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped
16 oz fresh sliced mushrooms
1/2 large onion, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 14.5 oz can of beef broth
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)
1 lb cooked whole wheat pasta (rigatoni, bowtie, etc.)
1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan or romano cheese

Directions:
Remove casings from individual sausage links. Crumble and brown in large skillet over medium high heat until no longer pink. Add chopped bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, and garlic. Cook until onions are translucent and mushrooms have released their liquid and become tender.
Add white wine and cook for 5 minutes. Add beef broth and Italian seasoning. Simmer on medium heat for 15 minutes or until volume of liquid has been reduced to half. Add crushed red pepper and simmer for 5 more minutes.
Serve over cooked whole wheat pasta. Top with grated cheese.
