Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef chuck
1 pound ground pork
1 pound ground lamb
1 cup chopped button mushrooms
1 cup bread crumbs
3 eggs
3 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons dried thyme
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon mushroom-flavored soup base
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried sage
1 pound bacon strips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Thoroughly mix beef, pork, lamb, mushrooms, bread crumbs, eggs, garlic, thyme, soy sauce, soup base, parsley, and sage in a large bowl; shape into 2 loaves. Wrap bacon strips around the loaves to cover completely. Place loaves on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the loaves are no longer pink in the center, 90 minutes to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
Moist and juicy comfort food. Great for family dinners, but tasty enough for company. Great with colcannon or other mashed potato dishes. Pairs well with carmenere or chianti. 
Caution: This is NOT a low-fat dish. Enjoy in moderation. You can use ground turkey instead of the beef without losing much flavor, if you must. Try venison or veal in place of the lamb for a change.
