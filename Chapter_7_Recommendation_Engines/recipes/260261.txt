Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds bacon
1 (28 ounce) package frozen hash browns
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms (optional)
1 cup milk
4 eggs, or more to taste
1 1/2 cups grated sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
Place frozen hash browns in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan; season with salt and pepper. Spread onion and bell pepper over the hash browns; layer mushrooms slices on top. Add bacon.
Beat milk, eggs, and salt together in a bowl. Pour mixture over the bacon, pressing lightly with a spatula to distribute. Spread Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until egg mixture is set, 30 to 40 minutes.
