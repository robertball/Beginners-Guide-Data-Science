Ingredients:
3 cups bread purpose flour
1 packet (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)

Directions:
Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl and mix to combine. Add the water and mix well. The dough will be very sticky and shaggy-looking. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature (70 degrees) for 4 hours.
Lightly oil work surface and place dough on it; fold it over on itself once or twice.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let it rest 30 minutes more.
At least half-hour before dough is ready,preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place a lidded Dutch oven or deep heavy duty casserole dish (with lid) into the oven to preheat.
Carefully remove the hot baking dish from the oven. Remove the lid and gently turn the dough ball into the ungreased baking dish, seam-side up; shake the dish so the dough is more evenly distributed.
Cover and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and bake until the crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the loaf from the baking dish and let it cool on a rack before slicing.
