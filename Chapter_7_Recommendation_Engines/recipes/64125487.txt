Ingredients:
1 cup cream of wheat (rava/semolina)
1-1 1/2 cups sugar
3-4 TBSP clarified butter (ghee)
3-4 cardamoms (de-skinned and crushed)
8-10 golden raisins (kismis)
1 tsp orange food color (kesari)optional

Directions:
1. add 1 TB ghee in a wok with a thick bottom. when its hot, add raisins and de-skinned, crushed cardamoms. once the raisins become plump, add cream of wheat and roast in the ghee along with raisins and cardamom, till the rava gets a faint pink color. set aside.
2. in the same wok, add 3 cups water (and color if wanted) and let it boil. when it comes to a boiling point, add cream of wheat slowly, constantly stirring, mix well. Allow the cream of wheat to be cooked at medium heat. the trick is that the cream of wheat has to cook well. keep covered and cook for a while.
3. when cream of wheat is fully cooked, add sugar and stir well. sugar makes it watery, so stir well. when the sugar is fully dissolved, add remaining ghee. keep stirring until the cream of wheat starts leaving the sides of the pan. IT'S READY!
