Ingredients:
½ pound bacon
3 heads broccoli, or more to taste, chopped
1  red onion, diced
¾ cup raisins
¾ cup chopped salted cashews
1 cup mayonnaise
½ cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar

Directions:
Cook bacon in a large skillet and over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and crumble once cooled.
Mix bacon, broccoli, red onion, raisins, and cashews together in a large bowl.
Whisk mayonnaise, brown sugar, and red wine vinegar together in a separate bowl; drizzle over the broccoli mixture in small amounts, tossing the salad between additions to coat somewhat evenly.
