Ingredients:
1/4 cup slivered almonds
1/2 (15 ounce) can pear halves, drained
12 raisins

Directions:
Stick slivered almonds all over pear halves so they resemble spikes, leaving the pointy side of the pear empty for the face. Stick 2 raisins in the face part for eyes and one on the front for the nose.

A cute little snack for a kid's birthday or in the afternoon during a play date. I feel whenever I present my kids food in a fun and cute way, they eat whatever I give them.
