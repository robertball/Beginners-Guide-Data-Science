Ingredients:
4 1/2 pounds baby back pork ribs
12 fluid ounces chili sauce
10 ounces plum sauce
1/4 cup soy sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Prepare a shallow roasting pan with foil and spray the foil with non stick cooking spray.  Place ribs on foil and bake uncovered 45 minutes.
While ribs are baking, heat chili sauce, plum sauce and soy sauce in a 1 quart saucepan to boiling; stirring constantly.  Set aside.
After ribs have cooked for 45 minutes brush them with 1/2 cup of the sauce and place back in oven and bake until tender; 45 to 60 minutes. While ribs are baking, brush them 2 or 3 times with the remaining sauce.
