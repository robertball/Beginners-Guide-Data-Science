Ingredients:
10 ounces 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Chips - I used Ghirardelli - there are other options
2 cups heavy cream
1/4 cup coffee, hot
4 eggs - WHITES ONLY, room temperature
2 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
Whip the cream to form light peaks. Set aside in the refrigerator.
Melt the chocolate chips in a large mixing bowl set over barely simmering water.
Meanwhile, whip the egg whites with the sugar until very fluffy and thick, about 10 minutes.
Stir the hot coffee into the melted chocolate chips. The mixture will start to thicken, so work quickly.
Quickly stir in the beaten eggs, then fold in the whipped cream.
Pour or spoon mixture into cups or bowls, and chill until firm, about 2 hours.
