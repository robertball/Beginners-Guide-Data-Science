Description: 
My family recently went on a vacation to Finland. In addition to enjoying the food and scenery, many of us fell in love with the lonkero, or long drink. This is a strictly Finnish drink made by combining cheap gin with citrus. The most common flavor is grapefruit, which is reproduced here. Lonkero is not sold in the US so I decided to try to copy it by referring to web sites from other tourists who tried to copy it and reading the ingredients on the company's web site.
