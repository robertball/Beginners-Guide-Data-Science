1 pie pumpkin*
1 piecrust
1 cup chopped pecans
3T butter melted
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
1 8oz pkg cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 large eggs
2T all purpose flour
1 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)**
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp ground allspice
1/4 tsp freshly ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Peel pumpkin with a vegetable peeler.
Remove stem, cut in half, gut, and de-seed the pumpkin.
Save the seeds for roasting if you like.
Chop remaining pumpkin in 1-2" chunks.
Steam pumpkin chunks until tender and break easily with a fork. ~30min
Reserve 2 cups of pumpkin puree for this recipe and store any remaining for future use.
Line a 9 inch pie plate with pie crust.  Crimp edges.  Prick bottom and sides of crust with a fork.  Set aside.
Arrange pecans in a single layer in a shallow pan lined with parchment paper.
Bake 8-10 min or until toasted and fragrant, stirring occasionally.  Remove from oven
Increase oven temp to 425
Bake empty piecrust at 425 for 6-8 min until lightly brown.
Combine pecans, butter, vanilla, and 1/2 cup brown sugar and set aside.
Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until creamy.
Gradually add remaining 3/4 cup brown sugar, beating well
Add eggs and pumpkin, beating well
Combine flour and next 4 ingredients
Add to cream cheese mixture, beating until blended

Reduce oven temp to 350F
Bake 30-35 min more or until pie is set.  Pie is set when gently shaken the pie filling will jiggle a little but not look liquidy.

Description: 
This is *the* best pumpkin pie I and my friends and family have ever eaten.  The praline style pecans give it a textured crunch and Southern taste you won't forget.  To make it extra good, try my foolproof pie crust.
