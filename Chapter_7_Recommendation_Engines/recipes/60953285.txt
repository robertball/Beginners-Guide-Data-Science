6 pork chops
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 (10.75 ounce) cans  condensed golden mushroom soup
1 cup crushed cheese crackers
1 slice cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with seasoned salt and pepper.  Place them in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Spoon soup over the chops and sprinkle crackers on top.
Cover, and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes. Uncover, and bake for 15 more minutes. (Note: Time could be less or more depending on the thickness of the chops.) Pork chops are done when their internal temperature has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Cut cheese into a triangle and using toothpick attach to pork chop.

Description: 
My kids are really picky and when it comes to chicken they don't tend towards sauce or mushrooms being visible on top. I cut the mushrooms out of this and exchange them for crackers and a cheese flag. We call it pork ships.Modified from: Golden Pork Chops
