Ingredients:
3 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 pound thick sliced bacon, cut in half
3 cups all-purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Whisk together the eggs and milk in a bowl until smooth. Separate the bacon strips, and soak in the milk mixture for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk together the flour, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl. Remove the bacon from the egg mixture, and toss with the flour to coat. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Fry the bacon strips 3 to 5 slices at a time until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Once all of the bacon has cooked, place onto the prepared baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until crispy, about 7 minutes.

Description: 
Battered and fried bacon that is even better after cooking in the oven for 7 minutes. My husband and I saw the idea of fried bacon on the travel channel where they just battered and fried it and we decided to make it.  It was so good. But then we cooked in the oven and it was even better. Serve with white gravy and it is a heart attack waiting to happen but tastes so good!
