Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
4 tablespoons lime juice, divided
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
8 flour tortillas, warmed

Directions:
Combine Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons lime juice, soy sauce, chili powder and garlic in a small bowl; add chicken and marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When wisps of smoke start to rise from the pan, add chicken and saute until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a cutting board, slice, cover and keep warm.
Increase heat to high and add onions, green pepper and remaining lime juice to the skillet; saute until crisp/tender, about 3 minutes. Serve with warmed tortillas.
