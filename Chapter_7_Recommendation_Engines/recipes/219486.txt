Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1 1/3 tablespoons lemon juice
6 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1 1/3 cups margarine
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk together the milk and lemon juice in a small bowl; set aside a few minutes to sour. Meanwhile, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl.  Beat the margarine and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the margarine mixture until completely blended, then beat in the vanilla with the second egg.  Mix into the flour, then stir in soured milk mixture until just incorporated. Wrap cookie dough in plastic, then freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.
Roll dough out on a heavily floured surface, then cut with cookie cutters. Alternatively, the cookies can be rolled into balls, then pressed down with a fork. Arrange cookies onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, about 10 minutes.
