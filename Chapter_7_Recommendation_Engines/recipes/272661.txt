Description: 
These chicken tenders are coated in a honeyed cornbread coating and air-fried to perfection. I used homemade cornbread when I developed this recipe, but prepared store-bought cornbread is perfectly fine. The spices I use are sold by Savory Spice(<sup>&reg;</sup>) shop and I can't guarantee results with substitutes. Serve with your preferred choice of sauce.
