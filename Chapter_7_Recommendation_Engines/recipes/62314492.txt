Ingredients:
2 lbs. ground pork
3 limes
1 bunch mint, chopped
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
3 shallots or 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
1 cucumber, medium slice
1 head cabbage
2 tsp. garlic powder
2 tbl. soy sauce, I prefer low-sodium
1 tbl. hoisin sauce
1 tsp. shiraca (Asian hot sauce), more or less to taste
1 tsp. red pepper flakes, more or less to taste

Directions:
Juice two limes over the ground pork and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes.
In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, heat the pork and add garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  Cook pork until thorougly cooked (about 10 minutes) and drain.  In a large bowl mix the pork with soy sauce, hoisin sauce, 1/4 of the mint, 1/4 of the cilantro, shiraca and onion.
Serve pork with lime wedges, cilantro, mint and condiments (sauces).  Roll the pork up in cabbage like a lettuce wrap or scoop up with cumcumbers.

Description: 
This is my twist on a traditional thai dish that makes a delicious and quick weeknight meal.  You can adjust the seasonings easily for more or less heat.
