Ingredients:
6-8 chicken parts (your choice)
3-4 cans cream of mushroom soup (depending on how much chicken you use and the size of each piece)
1 package dry onion soup mix

Directions:
Rinse chicken and place in crock pot.
Combine soups and pour over chicken.
Cover and let cook. I prefer to cook on low all day so that the flavors have a chance to blend. This incredibly tender chicken will literally fall of the bone.
