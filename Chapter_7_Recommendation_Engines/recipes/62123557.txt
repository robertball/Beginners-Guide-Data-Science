Title:
Balsamic Pork Chops with Caramelized Onions Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1/2 Sweet Onion (sliced thin)
1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
1 Tablespoon Sesame Oil
2 Large Center-cut Pork Chops
1/2 Cup Balsamic Vinegar
2 Small Cloves Garlic (finely chopped)
Salt
Pepper
Chili Powder

Directions:
In a saucepan on medium heat, toss onions and olive oil so onions are evenly coated. Toss every few minutes. The onions take 30-40 minutes, so start them earlier than the other steps.
Rub both sides of the pork chops with salt, pepper and chili powder to taste.
In a separate pan, heat sesame oil on high. When hot, place pork chops in the pan for 2-3 minutes on each side, then turn down to medium.
Add more salt, pepper and chili powder on chops, if desired, then add garlic and pour on half the balsamic vinegar (enough to cover the bottom of the pan). After about 5 minutes, flip the chops and add the rest of the vinegar. Flip two more times in 4-5 minute intervals.
When onions are soft and transparent, place in pan with pork chops for a few minutes. Be sure to flip the chops at least once with the onions.

Description: 
Easy and delicious recipe. The sesame oil adds a different flavor, but can be swapped for olive oil. I've made it many times with and without the onions.
