Ingredients:
1 quart apple cider
2 tablespoons mulling spices, or to taste
12 scoops vanilla ice cream

Directions:
Heat apple cider and mulling spices in a saucepan over low heat. Bring to a simmer and steep until flavors blend, about 15 minutes. Divide cider between 12 mugs and add a scoop of ice cream to each mug.

Description: 
Had my first hot apple cider float at a fall festival here in western New York. Warm, creamy, and frothy. The mulling spices make it taste like you're drinking a hot cup of apple pie. Once you try it you can't put it down. Vanilla or pumpkin ice cream work best.
