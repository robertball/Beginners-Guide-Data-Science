Ingredients:
1 tablespoon cocoa powder (for dusting the pan)
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup mashed sweet potato
3 eggs
1 3/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1/2 cup quick oats
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups peeled, cored, and cubed Granny Smith apples
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
preheat over to 300 degrees; grease a 9x5 bread pan and dust with cocoa powder.
In a large bowl, whisk the sugar with the oil.  One at a time, beat the eggs into the sugar mixture.  Beat in the mashed sweet potatoe and vanilla.
In a medium bowl, mix together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Sift. Pour oats on top of sifted mixture - do not stir together.
Little by little, stir in the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until just blended.  Fold in the apples and walnuts (and if desired, 2 cups chocolate chips).  Spread mixture into greased pan.
Bake for 70 minutes, then turn heat up to 350 degrees and let bake for 20-30 more min, until a toothpick comes out NEARLY clean (the apples keep the loaf moist, so there will still be some of the loaf still sticking).
Note: Since loaf is dark, it is hard to tell when the top is starting to over-cook. A good idea is to put foil over the loaf for the last 10 or 15 minutes of baking.
