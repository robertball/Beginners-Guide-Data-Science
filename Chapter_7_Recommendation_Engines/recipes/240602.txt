Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 1/2 cups milk
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant pistachio pudding mix

Directions:
Mix sweetened condensed milk, milk, and pudding mix together in a bowl; transfer to an ice cream maker and process according to manufacturers' instructions.

Submitter: 
Sweet Apron
Description: 
This is a simple way to make ice cream with three ingredients. Pistachio is my favorite flavor, but any pudding flavor will do. I used skim milk with great results but am certain that fuller fat milk would result in an even creamier product.
