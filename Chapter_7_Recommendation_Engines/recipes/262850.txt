Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) top sirloin, rib-eye, or T-bone steak, 1-inch thick
salt to taste
2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns, coarsely ground
oil, or as needed
1/2 shallot, minced
1/4 cup brandy
1/4 cup beef stock
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Season both sides of the steak with salt. Press peppercorns onto both sides of the steak to form a crust.
Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add steak and cook for 4 minutes on each side. Remove steak and let it rest. Discard oil from the skillet.
Return skillet to heat and add shallot. Cook and stir shallot for 1 minute. Pour in brandy. Reduce heat slightly; add stock and heavy cream. Cook until liquid has reduced to a creamy consistency, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt. Serve steak with the sauce.

Description: 
A twist on the usual steak with peppercorn sauce, this steak is first encrusted in crushed peppercorns and pan-fried, then finished with a creamy peppercorn and brandy cream sauce. This is great for two, or for one hungry person!
