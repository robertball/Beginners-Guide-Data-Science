Description: 
So you'd rather hang with your brunch guests than stand over a hot oven flipping flapjacks? Gather everyone around for a giant baking sheet pancake, instead!  When you set this hot cake in the center of the table, everyone can add their own toppings and slice at will! A great choice for busy moms, too: just give the kids cookie cutters to make their own fun and you'll both have a great breakfast!
