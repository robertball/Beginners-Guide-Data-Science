Ingredients:
1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup white wine vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
4 tablespoons salt-free garlic and herb seasoning blend
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 head romaine lettuce- rinsed, dried and chopped
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
1 cup chopped fresh broccoli
1 cup chopped baby carrots

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium-high heat.
In a bowl, whisk together the orange juice, vinegar, olive oil, seasoning blend, and sugar. Set aside about 1/2 cup for basting.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, basting frequently with the reserved portion of the dressing, or until juices run clear. Cool, and cut into strips. Discard basting sauce.
In a large bowl, toss together the lettuce, oranges, broccoli, and carrots. Top the salad with grilled chicken strips, and drizzle with remaining dressing to serve.
