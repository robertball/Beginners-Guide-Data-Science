Ingredients:
1 box strawberry cake mix
2 eggs
1/3 cup veg. oil
5-6 Oreo cookies
1/2 tub whipped cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275, and combine cake mix, eggs, and veg. oil in a large bowl. Form the dough into 1 inch balls, and place on a cookie sheet. Flatten the dough with the palm of your hand. Bake for 6-8 minutes, and allow to cool thoroughly.
Crush up your Oreo cookies in a plastic bag (I just used a rolling pin).
When the cookies are cool, add whipped cream to one side of each cookie, working in pairs. On one cookie, top whipped cream with Oreo crumbles, then sandwich the other cookie with whipped cream on top of the cookie with Oreo. Repeat with all cookies, wrap each cookie with plastic wrap, and place in a gallon bag. Freeze for at least an hour, and enjoy!

Description: 
Not knowing what to do with some strawberry cake mix, and not wanting to make a boring cake, I came up with this recipe using some other odds and ends in my kitchen. Not only was it surprisingly tasty...it was surprisingly quick as well!
