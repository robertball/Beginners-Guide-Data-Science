Ingredients:
4 cups strawberries, hulled and halved
2 cups whipped cream
3/4 lb chocolate chips
1/3 cup crispy rice cereal
2/3 cup peanut butter, creamy
2 quarts vanilla ice cream, softened

Directions:
Combine chocolate chips and peanut butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Simmer 5-10 minutes, stirring frequently, until melted and smooth. Place cereal in a large bowl and cover with melted chocolate mixture. Toss gently to combine. Spread onto a cookie sheet to cool. Once firm, break up into small pieces. Reserve 1 cup of this mixture for topping. Fold remaining cereal mixture into softened ice cream. Transfer to a 10 in. springform pan. Sprinkle reserved cereal mixture over top and freeze cake until hard. Remove cake from springform pan and garnish with whipped cream and strawberries.
