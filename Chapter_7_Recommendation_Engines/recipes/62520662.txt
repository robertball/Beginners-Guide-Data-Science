Ingredients:
3/4 lb ground beef
1/4 lb ground pork
6 cups water
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup Flour
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/4 cup chili powder (McCormick)
1 1/2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon dried onion flakes
1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons cumin
1/4 teaspoon Cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Brown ground beef and ground pork in a large saucepan over medium heat, breaking up the ground meat into small pieces.
When the meat is completely browned cover saucepan reduce heat to low and let meat simmer in own juices for about 10 minutes.
After ten minutes, remove the ground meat from the heat and drain off most of the fat, but keep a little in the pan.
While the meat is still off the heat, mix the water, the cornstarch and the flour. Whisk the cornstarch thoroughly as it's added until it's dissolved into the water. Do the same for the flour.
Add water mixture to the pan.
You can now set the pan over medium heat and add the remaining ingredients.
Bring mixture to a boil stirring often.
When chili begins to boil, reduce heat and simmer for 35 minutes. Stir well and scrape bottom of pan every 5-minutes to prevent burning.
When chili is done it will be much thicker and darker, like the real deal. For best results, place chili in refrigerator over night to let those flavors marry.
You can use this chili sauce on hot dogs, hamburgers, french fries, etc.
