Mom's Famous Baked Beans Recipe

Ingredients:
-28 Oz can of maple cured bacon baked beans
-28 Oz can of red kidney beans
-2 cups chopped onions
-8 medium slices of regular bacon (can substitute lean bacon or turkey bacon but the flavor isn't nearly as good)
-1/2 cup low-sugar Ketchup (regular can be substituted)
-1/2 cup barbecue sauce
-6 tablespoons of light maple syrup (can use regular-this recipe's nutritional information was made using the light syrup)
-2 tablespoons light corn syrup (again regular can be used)
-3 tablespoons of fresh minced garlic
-3 tablespoons liquid smoke
-1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
-1/3 teaspoon crushed red pepper

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in medium-large pot over medium heat. Stir frequently until beans are heated. Serve and eat.
This can also be prepared in a crock pot, the time will vary depending on how long it is before you plan to eat the beans, but the beans are all ready cooked in the cans so all you really need to do is heat them up and let the flavors blend together.
Something else one can do to really kick up the beans is to add 3/4 cup of shredded pork, beef, or chicken to the mixture. This is always a hit! (Not included in the current recipe though).
This recipe makes approximately twelve 3/4 cup servings.

Description: 
These are a take on my mom's baked beans. She makes amazing baked beans but doesn't even like them, but they're still amazing. These beans are great for a cook-out, picnic, pot-luck or a side dish.

They aren't particularly 'light' in comparison to some other baked bean recipes out there so they are to be enjoyed in moderation. This side dish is still low-fat and within a reasonable calorie range with a nice punch of fiber.
