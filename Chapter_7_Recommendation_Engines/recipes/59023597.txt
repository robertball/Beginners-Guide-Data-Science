Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
4 large, very ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2  teaspoons baking soda
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease two 7x3 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, using a whisk mix together mashed bananas, eggs, sour cream, sugars, and spice.  Whisk in melted butter.  Add flour, baking soda, and salt all at once, and using a spatula fold all of the ingredients together, being careful not to over-mix.  The batter should be lumpy. Pour into prepared pans.
Bake for 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. If the top of the loaves start to brown too much cover loosely with foil for the remaining bake time.

Description: 
If you don't have any over-ripe bananas handy, ask your produce manager at the local grocer for any browned bananas he may have in the back.  These are usually free or sold at a significantly reduced price. Using store brand baking and dairy products and substituting pumpkin pie spice for traditional cinnamon allow you to produce a fantastic tasting loaf of bread at an astonishing low price!Modified from: Banana Sour Cream Bread
