Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Mix together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.  Cream margarine, both sugars, and vanilla until creamy.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time, beating 11/2 minutes after each addition.  Beat in the flour mixture.  Stir in the chocolate chips.
Drop by tablespoon onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until puffy.  Centers will be soft.  Let stand on cookie sheets for 2 minutes, then remove to wire racks to cool completely.
