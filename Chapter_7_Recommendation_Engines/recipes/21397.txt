4 cups uncooked white rice
1/2 cup butter
4 green onions, chopped
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (4 ounce) jar sliced mushrooms

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large saucepan bring 8 cups water to a boil.  Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and saute green onions.  Stir in soup.  Combine soup mixture with cooked rice and stir in mushrooms and almonds; mix well.  Spoon half of the mixture into a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish.  Sprinkle half of the cheese over the mixture, then repeat the layers.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
