Ingredients:
1 pound pork sausage
1 pound ground beef
1 large onion, chopped
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TELÂ®)
1 (16 ounce) can chili beans
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
9 tablespoons chili powder
3 tablespoons masa harina (instant corn masa mix)
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon ground paprika
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Place the pork sausage, beef, and onion into a large skillet over medium heat, and cook, stirring frequently, until the meat is browned, about 15 minutes. Break the meat up into crumbles as it cooks. Drain off excess fat, then place the meat into a soup pot. Mix in the diced tomatoes with green peppers, chili beans, tomato sauce, chili powder, masa harina, cumin, salt, paprika, oregano, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Bring the chili to a simmer, reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour.
