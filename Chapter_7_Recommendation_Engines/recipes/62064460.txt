1 cup sugar
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup butter
3 tbsp cocoa powder
1/2 tsp vanilla
1 1/2 cups quick oats
1/2 cups coconut

Directions:
Rip a 1 1/2 to 2 foot strip of waxed paper and place on counter.
Combine oats and coconut in a bowl and set aside.
Put sugar, milk, butter and cocoa into a pot and bring to a rolling boil stirring constantly.
Add vanilla and quickly mix into oat and coconut mixture.
Drop by teaspoonful onto waxed paper quickly as it will set very fast. Be careful touching it as it will be very hot.
Let cool, then enjoy.
