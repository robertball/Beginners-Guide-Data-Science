Ingredients:
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
5 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2/3 cup white sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
3 egg yolks, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons butter
1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked
3 egg whites, slightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
10 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
In 2 quart saucepan, sift and mix together flour, cocoa, 2/3 cup sugar and salt.  Whisk in milk.  Over medium heat, and stirring constantly, cook until it reaches pudding thickness.  Remove from heat.
Very quickly beat in egg yolks,  1 teaspoon vanilla and butter; beating briskly until completely mixed and smooth.  Cool in pan.
Pour into baked, cooled pie shell.  Top with meringue.
Meringue:  chill beaters and bowl. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
With electric mixer on high, beat 3 egg whites and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to stiff peaks.  While still beating egg whites, add 10 tablespoons sugar, one tablespoon at a time.
Spread meringue over pie, and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 minutes or until meringue turns pale brown.  Remove from oven.  Place on level, draft-free area at least 30 minutes to cool before serving.
