Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
4 eggs, beaten
2/3 cup water
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 large bread pans.
Beat sugar, pumpkin, eggs, water, applesauce, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a large mixing bowl.
Whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, cloves, and ginger together in a separate bowl; stir into the pumpkin mixture until just combined. Fold walnuts into the resulting batter; pour into prepared bread pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Wrap tightly in aluminum foil to store.
