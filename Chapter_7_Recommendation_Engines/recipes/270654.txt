Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 cup buna-shimeji mushrooms
2 cups shredded daikon radish
2 cups lettuce, rinsed and torn
1/4 cup dried wakame, soaked and drained
2 tablespoons bonito shavings (dry fish flakes)
1 teaspoon tamari, or to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and cook until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Allow to cool slightly.
Place shredded radish in a large salad bowl. Layer lettuce on top. Arrange mushrooms and wakame on top of lettuce. Sprinkle bonito flakes on wakame. Drizzle with tamari just before serving, making the bonito flakes "dance."

Description: 
I first ate this simple salad in an Osaka 7-11 store and I fell in love. I hope you and your family will find this recipe as delightful and satisfying as I do. The bonito flakes add a smokey flavor and look lovely dancing as the salad is presented. Silken tofu and toasted sesame oil can be added to turn this side dish into a dinner salad. Hijiki could be a delicious substitution for wakame, and shredded nori could be used in a pinch.
