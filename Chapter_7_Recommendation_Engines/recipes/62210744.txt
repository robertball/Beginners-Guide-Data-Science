Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup butter (2 1/2 sticks)
1 egg
1 cup sugar
2 cups fine cornmeal (Goya brand is perfect!)
1 cup flour
1 tsp baking soda
Zest of 1 fresh lime
1/2 cup shredded coconut
1/4 tsp salt
1 tbsp Bacardi Coco rum (coconut flavored rum)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Cream butter and sugar, add the egg until creamy.
Add cornmeal, flour slowly.
Add the rest of the ingredients until well mixed.
Drop cookies 2 inches apart and bake until done.
Be careful when removing them, they will be very fragile when warm. I carefully separated them from the pan but left them there until cool.

Description: 
These cookies are delicate and crispy, like biting into a crunchy slice of sweet cornbread. You can add vanilla instead of the rum, I just did that to compliment the shredded coconut and it worked like a charm.
