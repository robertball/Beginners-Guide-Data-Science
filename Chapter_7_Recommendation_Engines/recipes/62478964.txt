Description: 
This Dressing came about as a combo of My Dads favorite tomato salad vinegar dressing and a french vinaigrette.. when ever we go to Friends for dinner or have friends over they all want this dressing. its great on all salads (I love to add chopped apple and dried cranberries... When I make jerked pork or chicken , I add a little Helens jerk seasoning to some of my base dressing and pour it over cucumbers and onions ... or if I'm grilling meat.. I might use this base dressing to make a mango salsa with mango's, onions, jalapenos ... its a great base vinaigrette. this recipe is for 3 cups
