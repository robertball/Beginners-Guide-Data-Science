Ingredients:
1 0.6 ounce Fresh yeast (refrigerated)
1 cup warm water
1 cup beer room temp and flat
4 1/2 cups sifted flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 beaten eggs
1 cup raisins soaked to get plumped (optional)
1 cup apples-Granny Smith peeled and finely chopped (optional)
1 qt Vegetable oil for deep frying
2 cups powdered sugar for dusting

Directions:
Tear the yeast into small pieces and stir into the warm water, add beer when dissolved. Let stand for a few minutes. Mix flour and salt into a large bowl. Stir the yeast mixture and beaten egg into the flour and mix into a thick batter. Stir in the raisins and apples if desired. Cover the bowl, and leave the batter in a warm place to rise overnight.
Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or deep pan to 350 degrees. Using 2 metal teaspoons shape scoops of dough into balls, and drop them carefully into the hot oil. They should be about golf ball size
Fry the dough until golden brown, about 7-8 minutes. If they turn a dark brown before this time your oil is too hot.  Drain finished donuts on paper towels and dust with powder sugar. serve them hot with more sugar dusted on them.
My father always said the key to this recipe is to let it rise overnight and cook first thing New Years morning.  I only add apples but make sure they are chopped fine.
