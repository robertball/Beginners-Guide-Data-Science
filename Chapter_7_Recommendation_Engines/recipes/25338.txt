Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package extra firm tofu
3 tablespoons cornstarch
oil for frying
2 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce

Directions:
Cut tofu into 12 cubes.  Place cornstarch on a plate or in a shallow bowl and dredge tofu in it, coating thoroughly.
Heat enough oil so that tofu will be half-way submerged.  Fry tofu in hot oil for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or until crispy.  Drain on paper towels.
Sprinkle green onions over tofu and drizzle with hoisin sauce.  Serve immediately.
