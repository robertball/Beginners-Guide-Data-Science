Ingredients:
1/4 cup light corn syrup
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/8 cup peanut butter
1 pinch salt
3 cups confectioners' sugar
35 individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped
1 cup dry-roasted peanuts
2 cups milk chocolate chips

Directions:
In a mixer, beat corn syrup, butter, vanilla, peanut butter and salt until smooth.  Beat in confectioners' sugar a little at a time until fully incorporated and mixture forms a thick dough.  Press into a 9x9 inch pan.  Chill in refrigerator.
In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt caramels.  Stir in peanuts.  Pour over chilled layer and return to refrigerator until firm, 15 to 30 minutes.
In a small saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate chips.  Cut chilled mixture into bars and dip in melted chocolate with a fork.  Let cool on waxed paper at room temperature, or for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
