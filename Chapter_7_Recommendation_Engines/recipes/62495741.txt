Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 butternut squash (about 3 lbs.)
3 slender or 1 1/2 larger leeks, white parts only, split lengthwise, washed, and cut into 1-inch long pieces
3 cups whole milk
3 cups water
Salt & freshly ground pepper
Fresh grated nutmeg
Optional garnishes: 1 tart apple, diced; 1/3 cup chopped, toasted hazelnuts or walnuts; 1/2 cup creme fraiche or heavy cream

Directions:
Peel the squash. Remove the seeds and string, then cut into 1"-2" pieces.  Toss into a large Dutch oven or soup pot. Add the leeks, milk, and water; salt generously and bring to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer and cook 25-35 minutes or until the squash is soft enough to mash when pressed lightly with the back of a spoon.
Using a blender or food processor, puree the soup in batches until it is very smooth.  It may be thick: thin to your liking with milk or water. Season to taste with salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Reheat if necessary.
