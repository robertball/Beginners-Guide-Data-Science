Ingredients:
8 oz. small sized pasta of your choice.
3 c. water
3/4 c. milk
1 1/2 c. home style creamed soup mix*
salt and pepper to taste
1 Tbsp. dried bell pepper flakes
1/2 c. parmasean cheese

Directions:
Into your pan, add the water, milk, pasta, soup mix and seasonings.
Over a medium heat, bring this all up to a boil.
Reduce heat and add the parmasean cheese.
Cover and let simmer til pasta is done to your liking. About 9 minutes for an egg noodle. That is what I use most often.
Remove from heat.
Sauce will thicken as it cools. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
