RE: Recipes Using Canned Spinach
Here's a great recipe I learned at a Pampered Chef party. Use as much or as little as you want with this recipe. You chop into cubes, lunch meat of ham and turkey. I usually use 2 parts turkey to 1 part ham. Mix with 1/2 can of spinach, 1/2 bag of shredded fiesta blend cheese and enough mayo to hold together, usually 2 large tablespoons. Mix well. Take 2 cans of Pillsbury crescent rolls and lay each piece in a circle on a pizza stone, with tips on outside. Take your meat ingredients and put a spoonful in each large side or roll, bring the tail up to the mound and tuck under, repeat. Now it looks like a wreath when finished. Cook until crescent rolls are browned about 25 minutes at the temperature the crescent rolls state. It has a great taste and there are never any leftovers. My daughter loves this and even asks for more spinach in it.
