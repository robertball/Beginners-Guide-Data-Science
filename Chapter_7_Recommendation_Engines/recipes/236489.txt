Ingredients:
2 slices bacon, chopped
2 onions, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 clove garlic
3 cups water, or as needed
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen okra, thawed
1 (10 ounce) box frozen chopped spinach, thawed
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (6 ounce) cans crab, drained (optional)

Directions:
Heat bacon in a saucepan over medium heat until fat begins to render, about 2 minutes; stir in onions, green bell pepper, celery, and garlic. Cook and stir mixture until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.
Pour water into bacon mixture; stir in okra and spinach. Bring soup to a simmer; cook for 30 minutes. Season with hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper.
Blend soup until smooth using an immersion blender. Alternatively, pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
Return soup to a simmer in saucepan over low heat; stir in crab. Simmer until crab is heated through, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is made with callaloo leaves in the West Indies, but in Canada we often have to use spinach leaves, which is just as tasty.
