Description: 
A family recipe for how Alaskans make a delicious salmon dish, originally it combined mayonnaise  and mustard with thyme, oregano, basil, and dill weed. I made it healthier by subbing yogurt for the mayo, per suggestions in reviews of the original.Modified from: Salmon Fillets with Creamy Dill
