Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 (4 pound) pork roast, fat trimmed
1/3 cup dry white wine (such as Chardonnay)
1 tablespoon honey, or more to taste

Directions:
Whisk salt, garlic powder, celery salt, ginger, mustard, black pepper, basil, oregano, and thyme together in a small bowl.
Cut 1/4-inch deep slits in the fat-side of the roast about 1 1/2-inches apart. Rub spice mixture all over prepared roast to cover completely. Place roast in a slow cooker, pour wine over the top and drizzle with honey.
Cook on High until tender, 3 to 4 hours.

Description: 
This is a great savory pork roast that is excellent when paired with a sweet squash dish, greens, and Jasmine rice.  Pair with your favorite Chardonnay.

 Cut into 3/8-inch slices, serve over rice, and don't forget to pour drippings over the pork and rice. Absolutely delicious. You can use any white wine in place of the Chardonnay.
