Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups low-sodium beef broth (such as Swanson®)
1 (10.5 ounce) can gluten-free cream of mushroom soup (such as Great Value™)
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (12 ounce) package gluten-free spiral pasta (such as Ronzoni®)
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Coat the pot with cooking spray. Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. Add beef broth, cream of mushroom soup, salt, and pepper; stir together. Stir in pasta.
Close and lock the lid. Select low pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 8 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Allow steam to release naturally for 5 minutes. Carefully switch to the quick-release method for remaining pressure. Unlock and remove the lid. Add sour cream and mix in thoroughly. Serve immediately.
