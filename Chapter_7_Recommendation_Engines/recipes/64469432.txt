Ingredients:
1 stick butter
1 c. water
dash of salt
1 c. flour
2 eggs
½ c. kale
4 oz. cream cheese
Water

Directions:
Bring butter, water and salt to a rolling boil. In a separate bowl, mix in 1 cup flour very well (by hand).
Break in 1 egg at a time and beat well with wooden spoon. Beat until eggs disappear. Remember to add one egg at a time and beat until
smooth after each addition.
Pipe through a pastry bag onto cookie sheets into 1.5 inch circles, or puffs, making sure they won't touch while baking or else they might cook together.
Bake at 400­-425 degrees until puffed and golden and they look dry, though the center will still be soft.
While those are baking chop the kale and use a skillet with a bit of water to wilt it a bit.
Mix the softened cream cheese with the kale until it is smooth.
Using a bag and a metal tip insert the filling from the bottom of the pastry.
