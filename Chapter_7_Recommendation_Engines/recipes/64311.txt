Ingredients:
1 halved lengthwise and seeded
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
cooking spray
1/4 pound lean ground beef
1/4 pound ground pork sausage
vegetable oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 ounces Cheddar cheese, cubed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sprinkle squash with salt and pepper, and lightly spray with cooking oil. Place in a baking dish flesh side down, and cover with plastic wrap.
Microwave on high for 10 to 15 minutes, or until flesh is fork-tender.
Meanwhile, cook beef and pork in 1 tablespoon of oil on medium high heat until well browned, stirring frequently to crumble. Drain, and set aside. In the same skillet, cook the onion and garlic until onion is translucent. Combine beef and pork with cheese and onions, and spoon mixture into squash halves.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and squash is lightly browned. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot.
