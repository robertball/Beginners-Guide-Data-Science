Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package prepared pizza dough
cornmeal, or as needed
1 cup marinara sauce
1 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese
1/3 cup shredded smoked Gouda cheese
1/3 cup shredded smoked Jarlsberg cheese
1/3 cup shaved Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup shredded fresh basil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) with a pizza stone or inverted sheet tray on the middle rack.
Allow dough to come to room temperature, covered, on the counter.
Lightly dust a pizza peel or inverted sheet tray with cornmeal. Roll dough into a 16-inch circle on top. Top dough with marinara sauce, mozzarella, Gouda, Jarlsberg, Parmesan, and basil. Transfer pizza directly on to the preheated stone.
Bake in the preheated oven until preferred level of browning is attained, 14 to 16 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing into 6 slices.

Description: 
For when Buzz steals the last slice, make your own! Serve with a glass of milk, Kevin McAllister-style. The smoky cheese blend provides a distinct flavor reminiscent of a wood-fired pie from a standard in-home oven and the pre-heated cooking surface doubles down on the difficult-to-attain-at-home crusty crunch.
