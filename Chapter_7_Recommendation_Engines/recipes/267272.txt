Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) bag tortilla chips, or to taste
1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 (12 ounce) can corned beef
2 cups shredded lettuce
1 1/2 cups shredded purple cabbage
1 tomato, diced
1/4 cup diced onion (optional)
1/2 cup guacamole
1 tablespoon sour cream, or to taste
1 tablespoon chopped green onions, or to taste
1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread tortilla chips on a baking sheet and sprinkle shredded cheese over chips.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, about 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add corned beef and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Pile corned beef, lettuce, cabbage, tomato, and onion on top of the chips. Add guacamole, sour cream, and green onions. Sprinkle seasoned salt on top. Toss lightly at the table.
