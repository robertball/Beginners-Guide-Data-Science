Ingredients:
CHEDDAR COUNTRY SCONES
1 3/4 C. all purpose flour
1 Tbsp. sugar
1 Tbsp. baking powder
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
1/4 C. cold butter
1 C. shredded light cheddar cheese
1 C. plain one percent yogurt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
In large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Stir in cheese.  Add yogurt all at once; stir with fork to make soft, slightly sticky dough.  On lightly floured surface, knead dough gently six times or until smooth.  Gently pat dough to 1 inch thick round.  Using round cookie cutter, cut out rounds.  Bake on ungreased baking sheet in 425 F (220 C) oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until puffed and golden.  Serve hot or transfer to racks and let cool.
Note: When serving for breakfast, may mix first 5 dry ingredients together the night before to save preparation time in the morning.
