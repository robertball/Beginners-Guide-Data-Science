Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup margarine
2 cups heavy whipping cream
2 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon dried parsley
4 egg yolks
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon cornstarch, or as needed (optional)
4 cooked chicken breasts, broken into chunks

Directions:
Mix flour and margarine together in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the flour and margarine form a paste.
Whisk cream into flour mixture about 1/2 cup at a time until smoothly combined; whisk in chicken broth and parsley. Bring sauce to a simmer, whisking constantly until thickened.
Whisk egg yolks and lemon juice together in a bowl.
Whisk egg yolk mixture slowly into cream mixture, about 1 tablespoon at a time, until the sauce barely comes to a simmer and coats the back of a spoon. Do not boil.
If thicker sauce is desired, whisk cornstarch and 1/4 cup of sauce in a small bowl; stir cornstarch mixture back into sauce until thickened, about 2 minutes.
Stir chicken breast pieces into sauce until chicken is heated through.

Description: 
This was my Grandma's secret family recipe from her French ancestors. I have never seen a recipe like this on any site. It's a rich creamy sauce over chicken...great with mashed potatoes. A great dish for Easter or Christmas.
