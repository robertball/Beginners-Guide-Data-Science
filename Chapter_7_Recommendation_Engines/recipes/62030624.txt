Ingredients:
14 cups water
1 whole chicken or 4 split breasts
4 tbsp powdered chicken bouillon
16 oz package orzo pasta
2 tsp ground black pepper
5-6 cloves fresh garlic, minced
1 cup lemon juice
4 whole eggs
salt to taste

Directions:
In a large pot, boil chicken with water and bouillon until done.  Remove chicken from broth and separate from bones and skin (or use boneless, skinless breasts) then cut or shred chicken into bite sized pieces.  You may pour broth through a strainer to improve clarity, if desired.  Return chicken to broth and bring to a boil.
Add orzo and black pepper, then cook the soup until the pasta is at desired firmness, stirring occasionally.  This might take longer than package directions indicate.
While the orzo is cooking, thoroughly mix the eggs with the lemon juice in a separate container and set aside.
Just before orzo is done, add the garlic to the soup.  Cook for 1-2 minutes (longer for a milder flavor) and remove soup from heat.
Slowly add egg and lemon mixture, stirring gently and evenly blending mixture into the soup.  Then stir the soup for 2 to 3 minutes more while the heat of the soup cooks the eggs.
Serve and enjoy!  Some experimentation (amount of water, quantity of chicken, amount of garlic, etc.) may be required to achieve desired consistency and flavor, as with any recipe.

Description: 
A local Greek restaurant served this spicy, delicious soup.  With experimentation, this is a close approximation of the flavor and all who eat it seem to love it!  It is best served with tsatziki dipping sauce and soft hearty bread.
