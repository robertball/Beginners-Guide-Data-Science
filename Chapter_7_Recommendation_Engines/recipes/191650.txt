Ingredients:
2 slices applewood smoked bacon
2 slices whole wheat bread
2 tablespoons peanut butter
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Place the bacon in a skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.
Toast the slices of whole wheat bread in a toaster, and spread a toasted slice with peanut butter and honey. Place the bacon on the honey, top with the remaining toasted bread slice, and serve.

Description: 
Toasted whole wheat or multi-grain bread really makes the difference with this bizarre yet delicious savory/sweet combo. Try apple- or maple-smoked bacon for the best flavor.
