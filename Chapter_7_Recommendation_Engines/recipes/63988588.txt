Ingredients:
2 thin chicken breasts ( I used turkey breasts)
1/4 cup pickle juice
1 egg
1/8 cup milk
1/2 cup flour
1 tablespoon powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/4 cup peanut oil
2 buns
1 teaspoon paprika
Salt and pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Put the chicken breasts in a plastic bag of pickle juice. You heard me right. The secret is pickle juice. Let it marinate for an hour.
Beat together an egg, oil, and milk and add to bag.
Mix together the flour, sugar, garlic salt, celery salt, basil, salt and pepper.
Coat each chicken piece in the egg mixture. Coat again with the flour mixture
Bake in the over for 60-70 minutes at 350.
