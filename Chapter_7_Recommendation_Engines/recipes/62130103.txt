Ingredients:
2 lb. fresh collard greens
2 quarts water
1 1/2 c chicken broth
1 Tbsp butter
2 leeks, chopped
1 package thick-sliced turkey bacon
2-4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp black pepper
1 Tbsp sea salt
pinch each of: cumin, cayenne pepper, celery seed, dill weed
red chile pepper, to taste

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a large pot with chicken broth, salt, pepper, and spices.
As water heats, sautee garlic and leeks in a small pan with the butter. Once garlic is lightly browned, add the garlic and leeks to the pot of water.
Wash and dry greens, cut off the dry ends, and cut leaves in half.
Once water has reaches a boil, add greens and stir.
In a fry pan, brown the turkey bacon (I used Godshall's wood-smoked turkey bacon). Once browned, add to the pot of greens.
Keep on high heat for about 1/2 hour, then reduce the heat and simmer for a good hour or so, stirring occasionally.
Serve hot with or without some of the juice, adding more salt and pepper to taste.
