Ingredients:
6 ears freshly shucked corn
4 eggs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Remove all silk from corn and cut raw corn from the cob over a large bowl. Scrape the juice from the cobs into the bowl as well. Discard cobs. Stir in the eggs, flour and salt to form a batter the consistency of thin pancake batter.
Heat oil in an electric skillet to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). If using a large skillet on the stove, preheat oil to medium high heat. There should be enough oil in the pan to cover the fritter.
Use a large serving spoon to make 4 pancake sized fritters at the same time. Fry for about 5 minutes on each side or until golden  brown. Drain on paper towels and serve warm.
