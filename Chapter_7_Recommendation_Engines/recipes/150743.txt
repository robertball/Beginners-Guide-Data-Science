Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) boneless pork loin
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1/2 cup water
3 onions, halved
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Pat the pork roast dry with a paper towel and perforate the meat at 1 inch intervals with a knife or fork. Insert leaves of rosemary in the perforations.
Place the onion halves into a glass 9 or 10 inch pie plate. Set the meat on top of the onions so they act as a roasting rack. Pour the water over the meat and season with salt, pepper, thyme, and cumin.
Cook in the microwave at full power for 16 minutes (or about 8 minutes per pound). Turn the roast over and cook for an additional 6 minutes or until the internal temperature of the roast has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let the roast rest for about 15 minutes before carving and serving.
