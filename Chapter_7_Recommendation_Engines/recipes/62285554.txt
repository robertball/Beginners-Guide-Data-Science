Ingredients:
2 cups cold mashed potatoes (prepared with milk and butter)
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 T flour
1 teaspoon any seasoning you choose: Italian seasoning, dill weed, curry, Sage,
I like onion chopped
Green onion and a red pepper add color
Shredded veggies, Cabbage, zuke, broc, dried toms, sky's the limit, just watch the liquid content
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder or to taste
1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil

Directions:
Combine all ingredients; mix well.
In a small skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.
Add potato mixture; press with a spatula to flatten evenly.
Cover and cook for 8 minutes or until bottom is crispy. Invert onto a serving plate.
I like to turn to brown the top.
Can be converted to baking.

Description: 
These delicious Potato Cakes are just as delicious now as they were when my mother was making these in the 40s. WWII made saving everything for another use was carried on after the depression of the 30s. From what someone's DH said, this idea is probably close to Bubble and Squeak from the British Isles. Who knows how old it is.Modified from: Crispy Mashed Potato Pancake
