Ingredients:
4 pieces turkey scallopini (or boneless turkey breasts pounded out as thin as you can)
1/2 cup flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 tbsp lemon zest
2 tbsp butter
2 tbsp olive oil
1-2 shallots, diced
1/2 cup white wine
juice of half a lemon
1 tbsp capers
parsley for garnish

Directions:
Combine the flour with salt, pepper, garlic powder and lemon zest. Dredge each piece of turkey in the flour. Shake off excess.
Heat the oil and the butter over medium high heat. Brown the turkey pieces well on each side, ensuring it's cooked through (2-3 minutes per side for very thin scallopini). Remove to a plate and keep warm.
Turn heat down slightly and add the diced shallot to the pan and sautee until translucent. Deglaze the pan with the wine and add the lemon juice. Simmer until slightly thickened and stir in capers.
To serve, spoon sauce over turkey and garnish with parsley if desired.

A version of the classic dish using turkey instead of chicken. Very quick and easy, suitable for a bit of a fancier weeknight dinner.
