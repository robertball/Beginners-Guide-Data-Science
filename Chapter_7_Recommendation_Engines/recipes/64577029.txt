Description: 
I cannot eat cinnamon and there are times I miss the spice and aroma. I came up with this cinnamon sugar substitute. Enjoy this yummy sugar by sprinkling it on hot cereal, sliced fruit or pastries. Preground cardamom could be substituted but the finished product will be less aromatic.
