https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 stick butter
2/3 cups (5 1/3 oz) evaporated milk (1 small can)
20 large marshmallows
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla
12-oz package (2 cups) semi-sweet real chocolate chips (I use Nestle's)
Optional: coarsely-chopped walnuts

Directions:
Combine sugar, butter, milk, marshmallows, and salt in a microwave-safe, 4-qt mixing bowl (I use a glass bowl).
Cook on normal setting in microwave until mixture boils, stirring several times.
Continue boiling for 3 minutes, stirring down mixture periodically so it does not boil over.
CAREFULLY remove bowl from oven.
Stir to make sure that marshmallows have broken down.
Stir in vanilla, chocolate chips (and nuts).
When chocolate chips melt, turn mixture into buttered 8-by-8-inch pan.
Cool to room temperature.
Cut into squares & store in covered container in refrigerator.

Description: 
I have made this fudge for almost 30 years, & it turns out rich, creamy, & PERFECT.  [One exception on consistency - although taste was great - was when I substituted off-brand chocolate morsels that simply wouldn't fully melt. Stick with Nestle's tried-and-true.]
