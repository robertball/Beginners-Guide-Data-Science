Ingredients:
Gnocchi:
5 lb. bag of potatoes
2 eggs
Salt
2 c. flour
Sauce: aka salsa
1 small onion, diced
1 small red pepper, diced
1 large (29 oz) can crushed or diced tomatoes
small bit of sugar to preference

Directions:
Gnocchi's:  In large pot add peeled potatoes and boil until cooked.  Only fill pot one half to 3/4 of the way full. Mash potatoes and cool slightly before adding eggs (as not to cook the eggs).  Add eggs, whip well.  Add flour.  Mix and knead.  Roll on lightly floured surface, and roll into long rolls about and inch around.  Cut into 1 inch pieces.  Flour a fork and roll each piece of dough on fork away from you off of the fork.  This makes them flatten a bit and has the prong indentations in them. Dry on floured surface.  When all gnocchi's are dry, heat a large pot of water and cook small batches at a time.  Cook 5-10 minutes, or until each gnocchi floats to top.  Remove gnocchis as soon as they float to the top.  Do not overcook or they will be mush.
Sauce:  In a medium size saucepan saute onion and red peppers. Cook until onions are translucent.  Add crushed tomatoes and a teaspoon or two of sugar.  Simmer on low 30 minutes.  Pour over warm gnocchis, or put a serving of gnocchi's on each plate and put a little sauce on top.

Description: 
A wonderful homemade dish that will warm any soul.  These potato dumplings with homemade sauce is an authentic recipe from my Argentine family.  There are generations of Argentin/Italian's living in Argentina and Uruguay.  The cuisine from these countries is fabulous. The sauce is a basic Italian sauce past down many enerations.
