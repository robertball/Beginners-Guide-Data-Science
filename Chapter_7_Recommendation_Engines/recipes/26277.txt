Ingredients:
3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 lemon, quartered
2 teaspoons garlic powder, divided
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 (8 ounce) package rotelle pasta
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Place chicken in a lightly greased baking dish.  Squeeze lemon over both sides of the chicken breasts and season both sides using 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder and 3/4 teaspoon pepper.  Bake for 40 minutes, or until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink inside.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, season the chicken broth with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Bring to a boil and add lemon juice and pasta.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until all liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes.
Cut cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces and stir into cooked pasta, along with the cream and lemon zest.  Cook, stirring, over low heat for 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes.  Stir thoroughly before serving.

Description: 
This deliciously different dish incorporates a classic combination of flavors: lemon, chicken, and garlic. A nice change of pace from the usual pasta fare.
