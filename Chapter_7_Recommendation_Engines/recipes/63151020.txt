Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups unbleached All-Purpose Flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pats
8 ounces sharp or extra-sharp cheddar, grated; about 2 cups, plus reserve 1/3 cup
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
1 large egg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease an 8? square or 9? round pan.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Add the butter, working it into the flour until the mixture is crumbly. Toss in the grated cheese.
Mix the buttermilk and egg, and add to the dry ingredients, stirring just until everything is moistened.
Scoop the sticky dough into the pan, using your wet fingers to spread it to the edges of the pan.
Scatter reserved cheese on top.
Bake the bread for 40 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Its internal temperature at the center will be close to 200°F.
Remove the bread from the oven, and loosen the edges with a table knife. Wait 5 minutes, then gently turn it out onto a rack to cool. Wait about 20 minutes before cutting the bread.
