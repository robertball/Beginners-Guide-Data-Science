Ingredients:
1/2 tablespoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
1/2 small onion(s) chopped
1/2 stalk(s) celery finely chopped
1 clove(s) garlic smashed and peeled
1/4 teaspoon basil, dried

1/8 teaspoon salt
7 1/2 ounce(s) beans, cannellini drained and rinsed

Directions:
In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, garlic, basil, rosemary, thyme, and salt; reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes, or until vegetables are softened.
Add beans and stir to combine. Using a large metal spoon, transfer about 3/4 of the bean mixture to a blender. Add broth and pur√©e until smooth. Return mixture to the saucepan, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer just to heat through. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm.
