Ingredients:
4 Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts (1.25lb package)
4 Stalks Celery, divided
1 teaspoon Salt
1/4 teaspoon Pepper
1/2 Cup Mayonnaise
1/4 Cup Granulated Sugar (more for sweeter chicken salad)
1 Tablespoon Cider Vinegar (more for tangier chicken salad)
1/3 Cup Craisins / Dried Cranberries
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Cut 2 stalks of celery into large pieces.  Add salt, pepper and celery to large saucepan with 2-3 cups water (or enough to cover all chicken completely), bring to a boil.  Add chicken and simmer for 20-25 minutes or until internal temperature of chicken reaches at least 170 degrees.
2. While chicken boils, finely chop remaining celery, set aside.
3. In a large bowl, mix mayonnaise and sugar.  Slowly whisk in vinegar.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
4. Chop cooked chicken into desired size pieces (or process in food processor to desired consistency).
5.  Mix chopped warm chicken with dressing, celery and craisins.
Refrigerate overnight for best results.
