Ingredients:
2 cups grated zucchini, squeezed to remove liquid
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
salt to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the zucchini, eggs, onion, flour, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, and salt. Stir well enough to distribute ingredients evenly.
Heat a small amount of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Drop zucchini mixture by heaping tablespoonfuls, and cook for a few minutes on each side until golden.

Description: 
Get out your grater or food processor, you'll need to grate up a bunch of zucchini. But this is what makes these patties fry up so wonderfully. A nice change from potato pancakes. Serve with a bit of tomato sauce or sour cream dabbed on top.Modified from: Zucchini Patties
