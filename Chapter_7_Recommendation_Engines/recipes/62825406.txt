1/8 teaspoon ginger

1 teaspoon vanilla

Pour the apple mixture into a food processor and blend into a smooth apple puree. Reserve the apple puree.
In a large mixing bowl combine all of the ingredients from the flour to the pinch of salt. Mix well ensuring that there are no lumps.  Do not sift. The finished product will be to crumbly and soft.
Make a well in the dry ingredients and add the pureed apples, the egg and vanilla. Stir to combine ensuring that there are no lumps. Toss in the pecans.
Prepare a 9 X 5 loaf pan by spraying butter flavor cooking spray and shaking cinnamon-sugar (mixture of 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon with 1/4 cup white sugar).
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and put it in the preheated oven. Bake approximately 45 to 60 minutes. Insert a toothpick test.  If toothpick does not come out clean but top appears cooked, then cover with foil until cooking is complete.
Remove the pan from the oven and let cool for 20 minutes. Remove the loaf from the pan and cool completely on a wire rack.
