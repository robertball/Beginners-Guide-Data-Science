Ingredients:
1 1/3 cup dried garbanzo beans
6 cups hot water
1 small white onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 tbsp. olive oil
1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper
dash salt
1/4 tsp. black pepper
1 tsp. dried parsley
3 cups chicken broth
5 cups vegetable broth
1 tsp. marjoram
1/2 tsp. oregano
2 tsp. Italian seasoning
3/4 cup brown rice
1 (14.5 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes, undrained
1 cup frozen french cut green beans

Directions:
To prepare the beans, rinse dried beans and place in 2 quart saucepan with the 6 cups of hot water. Boil uncovered for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for at least an hour. Drain the beans in a colander and rinse again.
When the beans are just about done soaking, heat olive oil in a large soup pot. Saute the onion and garlic, seasoned with the crushed red pepper, salt, black pepper and parsley.
When the onion and garlic are tender, stir in the chicken broth and vegetable broth, marjoram, oregano and Italian seasoning. Add the rice and garbanzo beans. Bring to a boil. Then, reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for at least 2 hours.
During the last 30 minutes of simmering, add the tomatoes and green beans. Bring back to a boil and then return to a simmer. The tomatoes are added at the end because the acid they contain can slow the cooktime for dried beans. When the beans are tender enough for your taste, serve.

Description: 
This is a thick soup that seems creamy, even though it is broth-based. Healthy and filling too! Using dried garbanzo beans may be a bit labor intensive, but you can always soak them overnight and go straight to the simmering.
