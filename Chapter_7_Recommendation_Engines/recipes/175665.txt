Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 tablespoons minced onion
7 ounces vermicelli pasta
4 cups chicken stock
2 cubes tomato-flavored bouillon

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large sauce pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onion in the hot oil for 1 minute. Stir in the vermicelli and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add the stock and bouillon cubes; cover. Simmer until the vermicelli is tender, 10 to 11 minutes.

Description: 
This fideo is simple, quick and delicious. It's great as a light meal or side dish. There are many ways to prepare fideo but for me, this is the quickest. You can add some tomato sauce and a dash of cumin when you add the chicken stock for extra flavor. Add less water if you want drier pasta.
