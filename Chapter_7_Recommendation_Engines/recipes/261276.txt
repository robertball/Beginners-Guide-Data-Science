Ingredients:
1/2 cup red potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary, or to taste
1 pinch sea salt, or to taste
cooking spray
1/2 onion, diced
1 1/2 cups chopped kale
1/2 cup halved cherry tomatoes
8 large eggs
1/4 cup nonfat Greek yogurt
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix potatoes, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, rosemary, and sea salt together in a bowl. Place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and tender, stirring once, about 35 minutes.
Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add kale and tomatoes; cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Pour onion mixture into a bowl. Add the roasted potatoes, eggs, Greek yogurt, milk, water, feta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; whisk until combined, adding more water if needed. Pour into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until center is solid, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
I love using leftovers and hate throwing away veggies. So when my father-in-law gave us more farm-fresh eggs than we could eat, I decided to make a breakfast casserole. This was everything I had on hand in my fridge, but feel free to make it your own.
