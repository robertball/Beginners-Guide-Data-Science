Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup cornmeal
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (14.5 ounce) can cream-style corn
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup applesauce
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 18 muffin cups.
Mix flour, sugar, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add cream-style corn, eggs, applesauce, and 1/2 cup milk to the flour mixture and beat with an electric hand mixer for 1 minute. Pour remaining milk into the batter and beat until just blended. Fill muffin tins 3/4 full of batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
