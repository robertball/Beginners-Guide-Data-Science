Ingredients:
2 cups water
1/2 cup wild rice
2 zucchini, grated
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup soft bread crumbs
1/2 onion, minced
1/2 cup chopped toasted hazelnuts
2 eggs
1/4 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon baking soda (optional)
2 extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
salt and coarsely ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring water and wild rice to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Drain excess liquid. Cool rice to room temperature.
Toss zucchini with 1 teaspoon salt in a sieve; drain until liquid has been released, about 10 minutes. Squeeze out excess liquid and transfer zucchini to a bowl. Mix wild rice, bread crumbs, onion, and hazelnuts into zucchini.
Whisk eggs, milk, and baking soda together in a separate bowl until blended. Mix egg mixture into zucchini mixture  until batter is wet but not runny.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Scoop batter, about 2 tablespoons per fritter, into hot oil. Flatten fritter with spatula and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer fritters to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; season with salt and pepper.
