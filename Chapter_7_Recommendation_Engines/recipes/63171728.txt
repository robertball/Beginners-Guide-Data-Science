Ingredients:
One 18.25-oz. box moist-style devil's food cake mix
One 15-oz. can pure pumpkin

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with foil baking cups or spray with nonstick spray.
In a large bowl, mix cake mix with pumpkin until completely smooth and uniform. (Don't add ANYTHING else!)
Evenly distribute batter into the cups of the muffin pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Enjoy!

Description: 
Think you need to add oil and eggs to your cake mix? Think again. Canned pure pumpkin (NOT pumpkin pie filling) does the job for less fat... plus, it's packed with fiber! And the texture is like a delicious, cake-y brownie. Fool your friends and family with this swap.
