Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Description: 
I know this sounds strange but if you like mint and chocolate you should give this a try. It's not an overpowering mint flavor. I've never seen or had anything else quite like this. I alway's requested my Mom to make this for my b-day when I was a kid and I couldn't get enough of it.
