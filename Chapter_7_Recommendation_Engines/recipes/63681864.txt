4 baking potatoes (about 2 pounds)
2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese (optional)

3. Sprinkle with olive oil, salt, thyme, and pepper. Using a spatula, stir until they are evenly coated with seasonings.
4. Place pan into oven for 15 minutes. Turn potatoes and cook for an additional 15 minutes.
5. Potatoes are done when they are soft and tender.
6. Sprinkle with cheese (optional).

Description: 
This is a great recipe to get kids started learning how to cook. Take a day, take a week, teach them new things each day. We used this for our at-home camp week. Taught the kids how to cook one new thing each day for an entire week.
