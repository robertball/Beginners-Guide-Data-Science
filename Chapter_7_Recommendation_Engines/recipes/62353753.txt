Ingredients:
2 cups warm water
1 cup warm milk
3 tablespoons active dry yeast
3 teaspoons salt
4 tablespoons melted butter
1/2 cup white sugar
8 cups all purpose flour

Directions:
In a 4 cup measuring cup, combine yeast and water and set aside to proof, about 5-10 mins. In a large bowl, combine 4 cups flour, sugar and salt, mix well on Speed 2 of stand mixer.  Add wet ingredients and mix well.  Change to a dough hook and add flour 1/2 cup at a time until dough begins to pull away from the side of the mixer, but remains sticky. Knead until smooth for about 5-7 minutes.  Place dough in a greased bowl, and turn several times to coat.  Cover with a damp cloth.  Allow to rise until doubled.
Punch down the dough, let it rest a few minutes.  Divide dough into three equal parts.  Shape into loaves, and place in three 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch greased bread pans or shape two of the loaves and use the third batch of dough and roll out for cinnamon rolls.  Let rise until almost doubled.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes. The loaves may need to be covered for the last few minutes with foil to prevent excess browning.
Brush lightly with melted butter and let cool on a wire rack.
