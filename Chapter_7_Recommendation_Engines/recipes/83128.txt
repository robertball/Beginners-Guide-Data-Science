Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds boneless pork single loin roast
1 1/2 tablespoons paprika
1 1/2 tablespoons dried crushed chipotle chile
1/2 cup sweet sherry (cream sherry or other oloroso sherry)
1/4 cup olive oil
3 crushed garlic cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
ROASTED PEPPER VINAIGRETTE
2 (7 ounce) jars roasted sweet red peppers, drained
3 shallots, peeled and thinly sliced
2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
2 tablespoons sweet sherry
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup minced parsley

Directions:
Place roast in large self-sealing bag. In small bowl, whisk together remaining ingredients, pour over pork. Seal bag and toss gently. Refrigerate 8-24 hours, turning bag occasionally.
Prepare a medium to medium-low, banked fire in covered kettle-style grill (for gas grill, heat only one side). Remove pork from marinade, reserving marinade. Grill pork over indirect heat, basting occasionally with reserved marinade, until internal temperature (measured with a meat thermometer) is 150-155 degrees F., about one hour. Remove pork from grill (discard any remaining marinade) and let roast rest 10 minutes before slicing to serve.
Roasted Pepper Vinaigrette: Slice drained peppers 1/4-inch thick; toss with shallots in medium bowl. In small bowl, whisk together vinegar, sherry, oil, salt and pepper; drizzle over peppers, toss, add parsley and toss gently. Set aside.
