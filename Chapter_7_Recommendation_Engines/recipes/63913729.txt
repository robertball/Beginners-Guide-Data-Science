Ingredients:
2.5 lb Pork Tenderloin (or BLSL chicken breasts)
Olive oil cooking spray
1 20 oz can pineapple cubes or 1 whole pineapple, cored, peeled, and cut into 1/2 - inch pieces
2.5 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
2.5 Tbsp real maple sugar
1/4 tsp sea salt
1/4 tsp ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 375F. Rinse thawed meat under cool running water and lightly dab dry with paper towel.
Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Place meat in skillet and sear on each side until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes total.
Remove tenderloin and place in a greased baking dish.
Immediately put pineapple chunks into the hot skillet and saute for about 3 minutes, stirring once or twice as pineapple browns slightly. Meanwhile, stir together vinegar and maple syrup in a small bowl, and add to pineapple. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 minute.
Pour pineapple-syrup mixture over tenderloin;then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in preheated oven and bake for 40-45 minutes for tenderloin or 20-25 for chicken, until juices are only slightly pink in the middle.
Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut into 1-inch slices and serve with roasted pineapples and brown rice.
