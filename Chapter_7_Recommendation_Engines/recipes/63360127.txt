Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Ricotta cheese
1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
1 package of yeast risen pizza dough
12 Al Fresco Tomato & Basil Chicken Meatballs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Mix Ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese together in a medium size bowl.
Divide pizza dough into four equal size balls.
Roll each ball out into circles approximately 8 inches in diameter.
Divide cheese mixture into four equal parts.
Place cheese mixture on one half of circle, keeping edges clear in order to fold other half over to seal.
Quarter three meatballs and lay into calzone cheese.
Repeat for other calzones so each has three quartered meatballs.
Gently fold over the calzone half that doesn't have the cheese laying on it, and seal the edges shut by pressing edges down and pinching together.
Lay calzones on a cookie sheet sprayed with a non-stick cooking spray.
Bake for 20 minutes or until top of calzone is browned.
Serve with marinara or other tomato sauce if desired.
