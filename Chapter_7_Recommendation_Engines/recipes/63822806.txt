Ingredients:
2 T olive oil
1lb ground beef
1 celery stalk, sliced
1/2 onion, diced fine
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 t salt
1 32-oz carton chicken broth + more if needed
1 8-oz can tomato sauce
1 14.5-oz can diced tomatoes with garlic & olive oil
un-drained
1 can red kidney beans, rinsed & drained
1 can white kidney beans, rinsed & drained
3/4 cup tube pasta
1/4 t cayenne pepper
1/2 t garlic powder
1 t Italian seasoning
2 t sugar
2 t Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Heat the olive oil, add ground beef and cook until no longer pink; add vegetables & salt and reduce heat.  Cook until vegetables are soft.
Drain.  Add everything but pasta, cover and simmer on low for 40 minutes.
Add pasta and bring to a boil stirring occasionally; lower heat and simmer for 6 minutes.  Turn off heat, cover and let sit for 15 minutes before serving.  (pasta will continue to expand and thicken soup)
Add more broth before serving if needed.
Good served with French bread and butter.

I love this beefy tomato pasta soup served a little thick like a stew or add more broth for soup.
