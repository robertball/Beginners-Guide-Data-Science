Ingredients:
2 Large Honeycrisp or similar apples
2 Large Sweet Potatoes
2/3 C Water
2 TSP Cinnamon
1/2 TSP Nutmeg
2 TBSP of Butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F
Dice apples and sweet potato.
Place in 8.5 X 4.5 X 2.5 or similarly sized glass loaf pan.
Sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg.
Pour water over everything - there should be enough water that it's about an 1/2 inch deep in the bottom of the pan.
Microwave uncovered for about 8 minutes - until apples and sweet potatoes are softened.
Pour off any excess water - be careful it's hot!
Dice butter and distribute evenly on top of apple/sweet potato mixture.
Bake for about 10 minutes.  This will ensure that the apples and sweet potatoes are completely softened and possibly a little crispy if you want them that way.
