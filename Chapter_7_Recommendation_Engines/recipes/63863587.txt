Description: 
Molasses is the secret ingredient, that gives the cookies a darker color, with a nice crunch on the outside, with a chewy inner layer. Quick oats, plus wheat germ and oat bran make for a chewy and nutty cookie with lots of healthy fiber. Made with simple ingredients most have on hand. This recipe was developed through years of trying, and ending up with cookies that were too cakie, too brittle and crunchy, or too soft. These are crunchy outside, chewy inside, as they should be.Modified from: Mama's Chewy Oatmeal Cookies
