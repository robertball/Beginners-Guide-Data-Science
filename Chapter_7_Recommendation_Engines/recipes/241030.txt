Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups sweet soy sauce (Indonesian kecap manis)
1 cup sake
1 cup pineapple juice
1 cup mirin
1/2 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1/4 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon chopped scallions (green onions)
1 tablespoon chile paste (optional)
1 (1 pound) skirt steak

Directions:
Whisk sweet soy sauce, sake, pineapple juice, mirin, reduced-sodium soy sauce, cilantro, sugar, ginger, garlic, scallions, and chile paste together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add skirt steak and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove meat from marinade, and shake off excess. Pour marinade into a saucepan; bring to a boil and cook until sauce is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Strain sauce into a bowl.
Cook steak on the preheated grill until it begins to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 4 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer steak to a plate and let rest, about 5 minutes. Serve steak with sauce.
