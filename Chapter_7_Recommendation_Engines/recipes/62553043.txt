Royal Icing IV Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 cups confectioners sugar
1/4 cup water, warm
1 tbsp light corn syrup
1/4 tsp extract

Directions:
Put sugar in large mixer bowl. Measure 1/4 cup warm water in a larger-size cup. Add corn syrup and extract (almond, orange, lemon, whatever you prefer) to warm water. Stir to dissolve. Pour syrup mixture into sugar and mix on low speed until a smooth glaze is formed.
For thick icing, which you will need for outlining and details, add more sugar until icing is quite thick.
Icing can be thinned with a few drops of water to make a glaze for filling in outlines or dipping cookies.
Icing hardens into a shiny glaze quickly -- keep stirring your bowl of icing as you work with it.
Can be stored in a plastic covered container for up to a week. Stir it thoroughly before using (you may need to microwave for a few seconds to soften it up).

Description: 
I received this recipe from a professional baker, Jane Singleton of Pelham NH. I prefer to use this instead of a regular royal icing recipe with egg whites. It hardens nicely and is glossy rather than matte like regular royal icing.
