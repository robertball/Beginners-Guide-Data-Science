Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
2 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
2/3 cup water
4 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda, sifted
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 7x3-inch loaf pans.
Mix together pumpkin puree, sugar, oil, water, eggs, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until well blended. Whisk together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and ginger in a second bowl. Sift flour mixture on top of the pumpkin mixture and fold in with a spatula until just blended. Pour into the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.

Description: 
This is my go-to pumpkin bread and I always get rave reviews. It's quick and easy to make and wonderfully moist. Plus you'll end up with 3 loaves! Perfect for entertaining or to freeze one for later use. Don't skip the sifting of the dry ingredients--it really adds to the texture.
