Description: 
Enjoy this fall spiced homemade pumpkin ice cream and graham cracker crust. You can top this with anyway you prefer. I have had tried this with chocolate and caramel sauces with whipped cream and chopped Reeseâ€™s Cup on top. You can keep it simple with whipped cream piped on, caramel sauce, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
