Ingredients:
3 medium carrots, peeled and quartered lenthwise
2 large tomatoes, quartered
1 large onion, cut into 8 wedges or 4 or 5 slices
1/2 small butternut squash, peeled, seeded, cut lengthwise into 1/2 inch thick wedges
2 medium Yukon Gold potatoes
6 garlic cloves
1 Tbsp olive oil
6 cups or more of vegetable broth
4 cups of finely chopped kale
3 large fresh thyme sprigs
1 bay leaf
1 15 oz can of Garbanzo beans, drained
1 15 oz can kidney beans drained
4 links sweet Italian sausage ***
2 links hot Italian sausage ***
*** based on your spicy scale,you can use more hot sausage. We like a bit of heat that's not overpowering

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°F (reduce heat by 25°F if using convection oven). Brush rimmed baking sheet with a thin coat of olive oil. Arrange carrots, squash, tomatoes, potatoes, onion, and garlic on sheet. Drizzle with more olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Roast vegetables until they are brown and tender, stirring occassionally, about 30 minutes (start checking after 20 minutes).
Meanwhile, remove Italian sausage from casing and put into frying pan. Cook over medium heat with 1/4 cup broth, breaking sausage apart while cooking until crumbled and cooked, about 7-9 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside  on paper towel.
Cut squash and carrots into 1/2 inch pieces; set aside. Peel garlic cloves; place in food processor. Add tomatoes and onion to garlic; puree until almost smooth. Pour 1/2 cup broth onto the baking sheet; scrape up any browned bits. Transfer broth and vegetable puree to large pot. Add 5 1/2 cups broth, kale, thyme and bay leaf to pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat. Simmer uncovered until kale is tender, about 30 minutes.
Add sausage,  carrots, potatoes, beans, and squash to soup. Simmer 10 minutes to blend flavors, adding more broth to thin soup if necessary. Season with salt and pepper. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf.
Can be made a day ahead. Serves six.

Description: 
Roasted vegetables, puréed and then cooked with broth, kale, and a nice mix of Italian sausages make up this hearty soup. This soup brings out the rich flavors of kale, and leaves out its typical bitterness. This soup is a winter staple in our family.
