Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, cubed
8 medium carrots, cut into 1-inch chunks
4 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 cup chopped onion
4 2/3 cups water, divided
2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed beef consomme
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups cubed cooked turkey
2 cups frozen cut green beans
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
Dumplings:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons minced parsley
1/8 teaspoon poultry seasoning
3/4 cup 2% milk
1 egg

Directions:
Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Saute carrots, celery, and onion for 10 minutes. Add 4 cups water, consomme, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cover. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
Add turkey and beans to the vegetables. Cook for 5 minutes. Mix flour and Worcestershire sauce with remaining water in a bowl until smooth; stir into turkey mixture. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer soup until thickened, about 5 minutes.
For the dumplings, combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in parsley and poultry seasoning. Combine milk and egg in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until just moistened. Drop mixture by tablespoons onto the simmering soup. Cover and simmer until a toothpick inserted into a dumpling comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This soup is a perfect recipe for Thanksgiving leftovers. My husband and I love dumplings, and this mild-tasting, homey dish has flavorful dumplings floating on a tasty turkey and vegetable stew. It really hits the spot on chilly fall and winter days.
