Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Progresso® panko crispy bread crumbs
1 cup mayonnaise or salad dressing
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon finely chopped chives
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2 drops red pepper sauce
2 egg yolks
3 (6 ounce) cans lump crabmeat, well drained
1 cup Progresso® panko crispy bread crumbs
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 1/2 teaspoons seafood seasoning

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees F. In medium bowl, mix 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs, the mayonnaise, parsley, chives, lemon juice, mustard, pepper, pepper sauce and egg yolks. Using rubber spatula, gently fold in crabmeat, keeping pieces as large as possible.
Shape mixture by 1/4 cupfuls into 18 patties, 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
In medium bowl, mix remaining ingredients. Dip crab cakes into crumb mixture, coating both sides. Place in 2 ungreased 15x10-inch pans with sides.
Bake both pans on separate oven racks 12 to 15 minutes, turning patties once after 6 minutes, until golden brown. Serve warm.
