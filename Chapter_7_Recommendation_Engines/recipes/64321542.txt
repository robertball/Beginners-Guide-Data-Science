Directions:
In a medium pot over high heat, bring the quinoa, water and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to a rolling boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the quinoa has fully absorbed the water, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.
Add the olive oil and onion to a large saut√© pan over medium heat, stirring occasionally. When the onions become translucent, about 4 minutes, add the garlic and the kale (in bunches if necessary). As the kale begins to wilt and reduce, continue to stir, and add 1/4 cup water if the kale sticks to the pan. Salt and pepper to taste, mix well, then remove from the heat.
In a large serving bowl, toss the cooked quinoa with the kale and onions. If the mixture is dry, add a tablespoon of olive oil. Salt and pepper to taste and serve.
