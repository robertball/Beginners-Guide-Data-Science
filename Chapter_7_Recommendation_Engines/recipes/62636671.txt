Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
8 oz. part-skim ricotta
8 oz. neufchatel
8 oz heavy cream
8 oz fat-free half and half
2 cups Parmesan, grated by hand
3 TB garlic, minced
1 tsp. black pepper
1/4 tsp. Italian seasoning (optional)

Directions:
1. Fry garlic in butter until golden.
2. Add cream cheese; melt.
3. Add cream, half and half, pepper, Italian seasoning, ricotta, and Parmesan.
4. Stir constantly until Parmesan has melted enough to lose its shape. Be careful with the heat, as both garlic and cream burn easily. Salt to taste.
5. Allow to set for 15 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I combined everything I loved about various alfredo sauces together years ago and created this sauce, which has about a billion million calories. I make it only on special occasions, every year or two.
