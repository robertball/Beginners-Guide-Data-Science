Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley
1/8 teaspoon ground thyme
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
1/4 cup shredded white Cheddar cheese
6 tablespoons butter
1 cup 2% milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Using olive oil, grease a baking sheet.
With a fork, mix together the flour, baking powder, parsley, thyme, salt, sugar, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, and white Cheddar cheese together in a bowl. Cut the butter into the flour mixture in coarse chunks, then use the fork to further cut the butter into the flour-cheese mixture until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Lightly stir in the milk just until the dough holds together.
Drop the batter by heaping 1/8-cup measuring cup onto the prepared baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until risen and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
These biscuits have an amazing aroma and taste that will turn any grump into a jolly lad!  They are crispy on the outside, yet soft and puffy in the center.  They freeze well too, for making large batches. This recipe is best when hand made, so try not to be tempted by your mixers. Trust me, it will pay off in the end.  Buy block cheese and grate it by hand for best quality.  I use a medium size grate.  I do NOT recommend using fine grated cheeses.
