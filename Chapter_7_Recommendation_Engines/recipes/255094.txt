Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups oats
1 1/2 cups quinoa
1 cup slivered almonds
1/3 cup chia seeds
1 cup crunchy peanut butter
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup coconut oil, warmed
1/2 cup flaxseed meal
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups dark chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread oats, quinoa, almonds, and chia seeds on a baking sheet.
Toast in the preheated oven, stirring halfway through, until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Mix peanut butter, honey, and coconut oil together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Mix in oat mixture, flaxseed meal, and salt until well combined. Press granola mixture into a 12x18-inch baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until bars set, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven; sprinkle with chocolate chips. Bake until chocolate is just melted, about 5 minutes. Spread melted chocolate evenly over bars with a rubber spatula.
Place in the freezer until chocolate is firm, about 20 minutes; cut into bars.
