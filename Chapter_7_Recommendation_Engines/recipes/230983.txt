Ingredients:
Salad:
12 slices bacon, diced
1 head broccoli, cut into florets
1/2 cup sliced green onion
1 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as CraisinsÂ®)
Dressing:
1 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoons cider vinegar

Directions:
Cook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on a plate lined with paper towel.
Toss broccoli, cranberries, and green onion together in a large bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, honey, and vinegar together in a small bowl. Add bacon to broccoli mixture and toss. Drizzle dressing over the salad; toss to coat.
Refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Delicious variation of this favorite deli salad. Honey is absorbed more slowly than cane sugar, so this may be better tolerated by those who are more sensitive to 'sugar highs.'  Also, for those who find white or red onions just too strong of a flavor, I've used green onion for a milder yet still 'onion-y' layer.
