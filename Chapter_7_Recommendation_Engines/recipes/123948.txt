1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon instant coffee granules

1/2 ounce unsweetened chocolate
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add vanilla. Combine coffee and flour; stir into creamed mixture and mix well. Chill. Shape into 3/4-in. balls and place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes. Meanwhile, for glaze, melt butter and chocolate together. Add melted mixture to sugar along with milk; beat until smooth. Frost cookies while still warm.

Description: 
When I first sampled this unique cookie, I decided it was the best cookie I'd ever tasted! The coffee flavor and chocolate icing make it a delightful treat at buffets and church socials. I plan to share it with my out-of-state granddaughters next time they visit.
