Ingredients:
5 raw, firm-fleshed potatoes (I like Yukon Golds, but use what you like, sliced about 1/8" thick
1 onion, sliced
2 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 TB or so olive oil
salt and freshly-ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Spread a piece of aluminum foil on your counter.  Place potatoes, onion, garlic and bacon on the foil, sprinkle with salt, pepper and olive oil, and toss.  Wrap the foil into a packet with the potato mixture on the inside and grill on the barbecue for 15 minutes over medium-high heat.  To serve, simply slice open the packet.

Description: 
Packet cooking is an excellent idea: by using your barbecue to prepare even your side dishes, it keeps your kitchen cool during hot weather and cleanup's a cinch :)  I hope you enjoy this simple, easy side dish!
