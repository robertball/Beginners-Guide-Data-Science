2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt

Sift dry ingredients together(flours, baking powder and salt) and set aside.
Add vanilla to milk. Set aside.
Beat room temperature butter and remainder of sugar until light and fluffy.
Add in eggs one at a time
Beginning with flour mixture, alternate adding in the dry ingredients with the milk/vanilla ending with the flour.
Add ground Pistachios all at once and mix just until well blended. About 15 seconds.
Fill lined cupcake tins 2/3 full and bake in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for 15 - 18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Cool for 5 minutes in tins, then remove and cool completely before frosting.
