Ingredients:
6 Tbsp milled flax seed
5 Tbsp water
1 cup coconut oil (or butter, at room temperature)
1/2 cup applesauce
3/4 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
1 egg
2 egg whites
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
5 Tbsp brewers yeast
3 cups oats
1 cup dark chocolate chips
1 cup coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
In small bowl combine flax seed with water. Set aside.
In medium bowl microwave coconut oil for about 30 seconds to soften. Skip this step if using butter.
Cream coconut oil (or butter), applesauce, peanut butter, white sugar and brown sugar together.
Add egg, egg whites, vanilla and flax seed/water combo. Mix well.
In separate bowl, sift flour, baking soda, salt and brewers yeast. Slowly add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and continue to mix well.
Stir in dark chocolate chips and coconut (or other add-ins of your choice). Dough will be thick; you may need to use your hands to make sure all ingredients are mixed well together.
Roll into 1 or 1.5 inch balls, flatten with palm of hands and place on cookie sheet.
Bake for 12-14 minutes. Let cookies rest on cookie sheet for 2 minutes, transfer to cooling rack.

Description: 
Brewer's yeast, flax seed and oatmeal are combined with your typical ingredients to create a yummy cookie that may help increase milk supply for lactacing women. I incorporate other healthy ingredients to cut calories and boost nutritional value. Feel free to leave out peanut butter for those with nut allergies. I like dark chocolate chips and coconut in mine; customize add-ins to your liking.
