Ingredients:
1/3	cup  finely chopped fresh parsley
2	tablespoons  minced fresh thyme
1	shallot , minced
1	tablespoon  Dijon mustard
2	tablespoons  olive oil
4	tablespoons  unsalted butter, softened
1	(4-pound) top sirloin roast , fat trimmed to 1/4 inch thick
1	tablespoon  salt
1	tablespoon  pepper

Directions:
1. PREP HERBS Combine parsley, thyme, and shallot in bowl. Transfer 2 tablespoons herb mixture to another bowl and stir in mustard and 1 tablespoon oil until combined. Add butter to remaining herb mixture and mash with fork until combined.
2. PREP BEEF Following illustrations 1 and 2 at left, butterfly roast and rub inside and out with salt and pepper. Spread herb-mustard mixture over interior of meat and tie securely with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.

Description: 
Pricey cuts of meat like prime rib and beef tenderloin are the main attraction at many a holiday table. We wondered if we could get an equally enthusiastic reaction from guests with a top sirloin roast
