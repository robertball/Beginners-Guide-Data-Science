Ingredients:
2 T butter
1 T olive oil
8 oz brussel sprouts
1 tsp minced garlic
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
8 oz pasta(fettucini, egg noodles, angel hair)
grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Clean and thinly slice the brussel sprouts, set aside. Cook pasta to aldente. While pasta is cooking, heat a skillet to medium and add butter and olive oil. Add brussel sprouts, saute for 3-4 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper. Continue sauteing for another 3-4 minutes. When pasta is done, add about 1/4 cup of the pasta liquid to the brussel sprouts (this will make a good sauce). Drain pasta and add to the brussel sprouts. Toss together and top with parmesan.
