Source: There's nothing quite like Chocolate Chip Cookies and a big glass of milk! Go aheadpour yourself a big glass while your cookies are baking so you can enjoy them right out of the oven. But try not to keep the refrigerator door open too long. Pouring a glass of milk (or juice or water or anything!) with the door open wastes energy.
