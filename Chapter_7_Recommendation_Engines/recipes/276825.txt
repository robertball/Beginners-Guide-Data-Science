Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen pizza crust
6 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon chopped fresh garlic
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1 (8 ounce) ball fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced
1 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup thinly sliced yellow bell pepper
1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion
1 (14 ounce) package Hillshire Farm® Smoked Sausage, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices
2/3 cup cherry tomatoes, halved

Directions:
Thaw and let pizza crust rise according to package directions.
Spread 3 tablespoons oil over the base of an 11x17-inch sheet tray. Stretch the dough to meet all corners and edges of the sheet tray. If the dough is difficult to stretch, let rest for 10 minutes, then begin to stretch again.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 3 tablespoons oil, chopped garlic, and fresh oregano. Drizzle evenly and spread over the top of the crust.
Top with fresh mozzarella slices, then shredded mozzarella, yellow bell pepper, red onion, smoked sausage slices, and cherry tomatoes.
Place on the bottom rack of the oven. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until the crust is golden. Let cool 5 minutes, then serve.
