Ingredients:
2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
6 green-onions. thinly sliced
1 Tbsp drained capers
1 Tbsp chopped dill, plus more for garnish
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
8 large eggs
1 cup crumbled Feta

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees.
Stir together oil, tomatoes, green-onions, capers, dill, salt, and pepper in a 12 cast iron skillet.
Bake in oven until tomatoes and green-onions are softened and starting to caramelize, 13 to 15 minutes.
Whisk eggs in a bowl and add Feta.  Add egg mixture to skillet.  Use wooden spoon to distribute tomatoes evenly, if necessary.  Lower temperature to 375 degrees and return skillet to oven.
Bake until frittata is set in the middle, 10 to 12 minutes.  (It may puff in the middle and then sink as it cools.)
