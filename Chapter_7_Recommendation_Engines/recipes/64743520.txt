Ingredients:
2 (28 oz) cans Crushed Tomatoes
6 oz can Tomato Paste
3 tablespoon Olive Oil
1/2 cup Dry White Wine
1 Onion, diced
4 Cloves Garlic, minched
1 tablespoon Crushed Red Pepper
1/4 cup Flat Parcely, finely chopped
1 tablespoon Italian Seasoning
1 tablespoon White Sugar
2 teaspoons Salt
1 teaspoon Black Pepper

Directions:
1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
2. Add onions, garlic and red pepper, sautee for 10 minutes stiring occasionally.  You want them translucent.
3.  Pour in white wine and simmer for another 10 minutes.
4. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, parcely, Italian seasoning, sugar, salt and pepper.  Stir.
5. Simmer for at least one hour, stiring occasionally.
6. Combine with your favorite fresh or boxed pasta.
I personally will let this simmer for at least three hours as the flavors will improve over time.  It is also amazing to add assorted meats or meatballs and cook all day for Sunday gravy.

This is my go to tomato sauce.  It is adapted from my grandfather's recipe. It is even better to add assorted meats and let simmer all day for Sunday gravy.
