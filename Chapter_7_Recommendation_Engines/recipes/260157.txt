Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 large onions, chopped
3/4 pound pork shoulder, cut into cubes
1 cup water, or as needed
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon ground sweet paprika
1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds
salt to taste
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
Sauerkraut:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
18 ounces sauerkraut, drained
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat and cook 2 chopped onions until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add pork and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add about 1/4 cup water, tomato paste, paprika, 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds, and salt; simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated and meat is cooked through, about 1 hour.
Sprinkle flour over goulash and add remaining 3/4 cup water to create a thick sauce. Simmer for another 10 minutes.
Heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat while pork is simmering. Cook 1 chopped onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sauerkraut, 1/2 cup water, and 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauerkraut is heated through and flavorful, about 20 minutes. Season with salt. Drain off some of the cooking liquid.
Mix sauerkraut with goulash before serving.
