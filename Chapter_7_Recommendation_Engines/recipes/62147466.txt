Description: 
I asked AR members for ingredient suggestions for a stir fry. The food suggested was chicken, onion, garlic, carrots, red pepper, ginger, soy sauce, snow peas, baby corn, and bean sprouts. In the 2 stores I went to, there were no bean sprouts, not fresh or canned, so I substituted cabbage.
