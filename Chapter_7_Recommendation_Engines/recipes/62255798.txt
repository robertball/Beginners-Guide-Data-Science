Ingredients:
2 pounds ground chuck
1 pound ground sausage (mild or hot)
1 large diced onion
1 cup crushed saltine crackers
2 eggs beaten
3 tablespoon cajun seasoning
2 cups of ketchup
Halfling decorations (optional)
corn kernels
olives
peppers
pickles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Mix all of the ingredients together very well the ground chuck, sausage, onion, crackers, eggs, and cajun seasoning. Form into desired shape.  Bake in oven for approximately an hour or until almost done.
For traditional meatloaf, spread ketchup over entire meatloaf, return to oven and bake an additional 10 minutes.
For the pictured "halfling" place ketchup around meatloaf and make a "blood" trail to look like it is coming out of a puncture wound.  Decorate the meatloaf as desired, return to oven and bake an addition 10 minutes.
Let meatloaf rest for about 10 minutes before scaring your guests.  For the halfling, insert knife into the puncture wound.

Description: 
This is a great tasting and scary meatloaf.  Our guests got a big kick out of it.  I prefer to bake my meatloaf on a slotted broiler pan to let the grease drip off. You can use spicy sausage but I prefer a mild sausage.
