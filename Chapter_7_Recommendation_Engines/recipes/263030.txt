Ingredients:
Socca:
2 3/4 cups chickpea flour
2 3/4 cups lukewarm water
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Toppings:
1 avocado, peeled and sliced
1 tomato, sliced
1/4 cup pitted black olives

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine chickpea flour, water, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in bowl; whisk until smooth. Let sit for 15 minutes.
Heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and swirl around to coat skillet. Pour batter into skillet and cook until edges are golden, about 2 minutes.
Place skillet in the preheated oven and bake until socca is set, about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with avocado, tomato, and black olives. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Return to the oven and bake until golden and crispy, about 5 minutes.
