Ingredients:
1 large smoked whitefish
1/4 cup mayo
5 t tartar sauce
Squeeze of lemon
1/4 cup heavy cream
Pepper to taste
1/3 cup red onion, finely diced
2 stalks celery, finely diced
1/2 T capers, chopped
Couple of drops Tabasco and 1 T fresh dill.

Directions:
Remove head, tail, skin and bones from whitefish. Place fish in a food processor with next 5 ingredients. Remove to a bowl and add remaining ingredients.  Allow flavors to meld at least 1 hour. Serve as a spread on crostinis or on cucumber rounds or as a stuffing for hardboiled eggs. Makes 2-3 cups.
ps my special crostinis:
1 baguette cut into 1/2 inch slices
your very best virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon Herbes de Provence. (I use Spice Hunter brand).
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place bread slices on large cookie sheet in a single layer. Drizzle with olive oil and generously sprinkle with herbes de Provence. Bake 17 minutes. Allow to cool.

Description: 
This spread is great on crostini or as a dip with assorted vegetables. Because it is made in the blender all those pesky little bones are no longer a nuisance.
