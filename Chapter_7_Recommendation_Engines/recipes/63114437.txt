Ingredients:
1 pound fish filets, preferably a mild white fish such as cod, haddock or tilapia (whatever is on sale)
1/3 cup flour
2 Tbsp Crisco shortening or vegetable oil + 1 Tbsp butter for pan frying the fish
Salt, pepper and Old Bay seasoning
Cucumber Dill Sauce For Fish
1/3 cup + 2 Tbsp plain yogurt (6 ounces)
1/4 cup chopped cucumber (peeled and seeded first)
1/2 tsp dried dill weed
Sea salt to taste
Mix all ingredients in a small non-reactive bowl (do not use stainless steel or aluminum bowls), cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour before using.
A shake of Old Bay seasoning
3 thinly sliced fresh lemon slices

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F.
Rinse the fish under cold running water, pat dry with towels, dredge in the flour and set aside. Melt the shortening and butter in a skillet over high heat till hot. Quickly fry the fish till golden brown on both sides while seasoning them with salt, pepper and Old Bay seasoning.
Transfer to a baking dish and lay the lemon slices over the fish. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 – 30 minutes or till the fish easily flakes with a fork.
Discard the lemon slices and serve immediately with a cucumber-dill sauce on the side.
Au-gratin potatoes and sliced ripe red tomatoes make nice accompaniments to this entrée, therefore plan ahead.
