Ingredients:
1/2 cup finely chopped shallots (2 large)
1/4 cup finely chopped peeled ginger
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup red-wine vinegar
2/3 cup soy sauce
1 cup apricot preserves (12 ounces)
16 chicken drumsticks (4 1/2 pounds)

Directions:
Cook shallots and ginger in oil in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in vinegar and boil until reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Add soy sauce, preserves, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes.
Purée sauce in a blender until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids), then cool to room temperature.
Divide chicken between 2 large sealable bags and pour marinade over chicken. Seal bags, pressing out excess air, and marinate, chilled, turning bag over occasionally, at least 8 hours.
Preheat oven to 425°F with rack in middle.
Line a 17- by 12-inch shallow heavy baking pan with 2 slightly overlapping sheets of foil, then lightly oil foil. Arrange chicken (with marinade) in 1 layer in pan. Roast chicken, turning once, until deep brown, cooked through, and glazed, about 40 minutes total.

Description: 
The overnight marinade means you just have to pop these deliciously sticky drumsticks in the oven when you're ready. It also means that they're packed with classic Asian sweet-and-sour flavors that appeal to younger palates
