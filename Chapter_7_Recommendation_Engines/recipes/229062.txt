Ingredients:
27 pounds tomatoes, cored
9 carrots
2 cups green peas
3 large onions
1/2 head cabbage
3 cups fresh spinach
1 green bell pepper
1 red bell pepper
2 1/2 cups broccoli florets
1 acorn squash - halved, seeded, and cut into chunks
1 bunch celery, ribs separated
5 cloves garlic, peeled
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup sea salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
14 1-quart canning jars with lids and rings

Directions:
Cook tomatoes in a large stock pot over medium heat until tender, about 20 minutes.
Juice carrots, peas, onions, cabbage, spinach, red and green bell peppers, broccoli, acorn squash, celery, and garlic in a vegetable juicer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stir the juice and vegetable pulp into the tomatoes and bring mixture to a boil. Mix in lemon juice, sea salt, and black pepper, stirring to dissolve salt. Process the mixture through a food mill to strain out all seeds, skins, and pulp.
Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the vegetable juice into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.
