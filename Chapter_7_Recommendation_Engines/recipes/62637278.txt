Description: 
My kids and I love this recipe! Very tasty and the variations are endless! Because this is like pizza; you can add whatever pizza ingredient you love! I add a little brown sugar to the sauce to cut back on acidity and I like to add minced garlic. I received this through a recipe swap in 2000 from Sharon S. Runyan.
