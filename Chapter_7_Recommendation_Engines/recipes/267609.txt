Ingredients:
Fried Cauliflower:
oil for deep frying
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons cornmeal
1/3 cup water
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
15 cauliflower florets
Manchurian Sauce:
3/4 cup vegetable stock, divided
1 tablespoon cornmeal
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®)
salt to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 green chile pepper, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger
1 green onion, chopped, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.
Mix flour, cornmeal, water, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl to make a thick batter. Toss in cauliflower florets and mix until coated.
Deep fry cauliflower a few florets at a time until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
Mix 1/4 cup vegetable stock with cornmeal in a bowl. Add soy sauce, ketchup, chile-garlic sauce, and salt.
Heat oil in a wok or frying pan over high heat. Add onions, chile pepper, garlic, and ginger and stir-fry for a few seconds. Add cornmeal mixture and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining vegetable stock and cook until very thick, about 10 minutes. Remove sauce from heat.
Spoon sauce over fried cauliflower and toss slightly. Garnish with green onions and serve.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite gobi (cauliflower) recipes, and available at many Indian restaurants. A spicy Asian dish that's sure to leave your family wanting more!
 Occasionally, I even love to bake the cauliflower to lower the calories.  Keep in mind, baking will take away from the crispiness of fried cauliflower.
