Ingredients:
1 cup mashed potato flakes
1 cup boiling water
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
6 cups water
any well-tolerated pasta sauce (smooth/strained)

Directions:
Place potato flakes in a large bowl and stir in boiling water. Add egg and stir in flour and seasonings.
On a lightly floured surface, knead 10-12 times, forming a soft dough.
Divide dough into four portions. On a floured surface, roll each portion into 1/2-inch thick ropes; cut into 3/4-inch pieces.
Press and roll each piece with a lightly floured fork.
In a large saucepan, bring water to a boil.
Cook gnocchi in batches for 40-60 seconds or until they float. Remove with a slotted spoon and serve with sauce.
