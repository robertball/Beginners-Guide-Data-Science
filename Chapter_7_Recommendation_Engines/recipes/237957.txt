Ingredients:
3 3/4 cups gluten-free flour blend
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 very ripe banana
1 cup freshly brewed coffee, cooled to room-temperature
1/3 cup canola oil
1 1/2 tablespoons almond milk
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Whisk together gluten-free flour blend, sugar, cocoa powder baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
Mash banana in a bowl. Add cooled coffee, oil, almond milk, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla extract. Whisk until combined. Pour into flour mixture. Stir slowly until just combined; batter will be thick and gummy.
Ladle batter into the lined muffin tin, filling cups 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
Finally, a vegan and gluten-free cupcake that is moist and tasty! Add your favorite vegan or gluten-free icing! I used an OreoÂ® icing, so it was vegan but not gluten-free.
