Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
2 cups lard
4 eggs
2 cups buttermilk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 tablespoons baking powder
3/4 tablespoon baking soda
1/2 tablespoon salt
7 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream sugar and lard together. Add eggs and vanilla, mix until smooth. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk. Dough should be soft but not soupy. Chill for at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut with cookie cutters and place onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cookies to cool on wire racks. Frost with Butter Icing for Cookies.
