Ingredients:
1/4 cup pine nuts
3 garlic cloves, unpeeled
1 pound large red potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
Salt and pepper
12 ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch lengths
2 cups fresh basil leaves
(1/2 cup)Nutritional yeast opt
7 tablespoons thickened broth*
1 pound gemelli or penne
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces and chilled
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 cups potato - pasta cooking water

Directions:
Put diced potato into large pot of cold water to cook until tender about 9 to 12 min. Toast pine nuts and garlic in a pan. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. Start green beans cooking in same pan and cook until just tender, about 5 min. Set aside on platter. When potatoes are done, remove with slotted spoon and put on the platter. Start the same water boiling again and cook the pasta el dente. Save the cooking water when pasta is done. While pasta is cooking, process basil, yeast, thickened broth, pine nuts, garlic, about 1/4 cup of potatoes and ½ teaspoon salt in food processor until smooth, about 1 minute.
Set colander in large bowl. Drain gemelli in colander, reserving cooking water in bowl. Return gemelli to pot. Add lemon juice, potatoes and green beans, pesto, 1¼ cups reserved cooking water, and ½ teaspoon pepper and stir vigorously with rubber spatula until sauce takes on creamy appearance. Add additional cooking water as needed to adjust consistency and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
