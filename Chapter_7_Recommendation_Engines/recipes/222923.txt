Ingredients:
1 large egg
1/2 cup milk
1 cup white cornmeal
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley RanchÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup vegetable oil, or as needed
1 green tomato, cut into 1/4-inch slices

Directions:
Whisk egg and milk together in a bowl. Mix cornmeal, ranch dip mix, black pepper, and salt in a separate bowl.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Oil should be about 1/2 inch deep.
Dip tomato slices in egg mixture; coat each slice with the cornmeal mixture. Place tomatoes in the hot oil; fry until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Season with salt and black pepper.
