Ingredients:
1 orange, peeled
1/2 cup water
1 leaf kale, torn into several pieces
2 ripe bananas, peeled

Directions:
Blend the orange in a blender until mostly juice.
Add the water and kale; blend again on High speed until kale is liquefied.
Break the bananas into chunks and add to the blender. Start blending on a lower speed until the banana is incorporated. Increase speed to blend the mixture into a pudding-like texture.

Description: 
Sometimes it tastes like Fruit LoopsÂ® cereal, but, of course, this is actually good for you. My 14-month-old loves this for breakfast. Furthermore, he can feed himself (with a sippy cup) while I make breakfast and lunch for the older kids. The texture is similar to pudding. If runnier texture is desired, add ice or milk.
