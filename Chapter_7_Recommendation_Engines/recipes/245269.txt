Ingredients:
1/2 pound unsalted butter
1 1/3 cups honey
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups cornflakes, lightly crushed
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups whole wheat flour
2 cups amaranth flour
1/2 cup sprinkles, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter and honey together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat one egg at a time into the butter mixture, beating on low speed after each addition. Add crushed corn flakes, baking powder, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt; mix well to combine.
Beat amaranth flour and whole wheat flour into corn flakes mixture, 1 cup at a time, on low speed, until a semi-soft dough forms. Test the dough by rolling a small piece into a ball; add more flour if it sticks to your fingers.
Roll dough into tablespoon-size balls using your hands. Flatten slightly and press one side into sprinkles. Place cookies 1-inch apart on baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is slightly golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer immediately to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Naturally sweetened by honey, this delectable treat is definitely a must-have! Amaranth flour gives it a special nutty taste, but please note this is not a crunchy cookie: it'll turn out cake-like, with a soft-dough texture. It's easy to make and adds simple pleasure to life! Serve them with milk or simple enjoy them on their own!
