Ingredients:
1/2 cup dry lentils
1 cup water
1/2 pound ground turkey
1 cup water
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 head iceberg lettuce, chopped
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced
1 tomato, diced
1 (15 ounce) can pitted black olives, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1/3 cup Catalina salad dressing

Directions:
Place lentils and water in a pot. Bring water to boil, reduce to simmer. Cook for 30 minutes or until tender.
Cook the turkey in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink, 8 to 12 minutes. Stir the cooked lentils, 1 cup of water, and the taco seasoning mix into the turkey. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until liquid is nearly gone, about 5 minutes.
Combine the lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, olives, kidney beans, lentil-and-turkey mixture, and Catalina dressing in a large bowl and toss until combined.

Description: 
This is my health-oriented twist to my Aunt Linda's recipe. Lentils add fiber and protein without fat and without compromising the taste! For additional texture, sprinkle in some crushed corn chips.
