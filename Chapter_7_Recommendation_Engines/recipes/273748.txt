Ingredients:
2 pounds thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/4 cup water
3 bunches green onions, diced
1 (16 ounce) package golden brown sugar
1 (12 ounce) bottle tomato-based chili sauce (such as Heinz®)
3 (15 ounce) cans pork and beans in tomato sauce (such as VanCamp's®)
3 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans, drained
3 (15 ounce) cans lima beans, drained

Directions:
Place bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Saute, turning occasionally, until slightly crispy, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; reserve 3 tablespoons bacon grease and discard the rest.
Add a 1/4 cup of water to the pan and bring to a boil, scraping up all browned bits until water has evaporated. Add the reserved bacon grease, along with the green onions. Saute until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in brown sugar, about 1/4 cup at a time, cooking until sugar begins to brown, about 5 minutes.
Stir chili sauce into the pot and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in pork and beans, kidney beans, and lima beans; stir until beans are well coated in the sauce.
Return bacon to the pot and stir well to combine. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, until flavors combine, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Description: 
This is my version of a family recipe. You can't go wrong when you serve these beans at a potluck, barbecue, family gathering etc. These are a great accompaniment to burgers and hot dogs. My family even loves these during the holidays with spiral ham and potato salad and or macaroni salad. The secret to this recipe is following the directions and using brand names mentioned. All who try these beans rave about them and typically ask for the recipe.
