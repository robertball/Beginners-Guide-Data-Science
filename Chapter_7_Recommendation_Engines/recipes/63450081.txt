Ingredients:
4 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon finely chopped onion
salt and pepper to taste
Corn canned or frozen (defrosted)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound lean ground beef
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ketchup
3/4 cup beef broth

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash. Mix in butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.)
Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onion and cook until clear. Add ground beef and cook until well browned. Pour off excess fat, then stir in flour and cook 1 minute. Add ketchup and beef broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
Spread the ground beef in an even layer on the bottom of a 2 quart casserole dish. Next, spread a layer of corn. Top with the mashed potato mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
