Description: 
This is a traditional Scot's Recipe for a rich, moist and delicious cake.
Can also be used as a Fruit Cake or as a Christmas Cake:

The origins of Dundee Cake are thought to date back to a time when fruit cake was popular during the 19th century and Keiller's of Dundee sold a version of the cake but with almonds on top. This gave the fruit cake a new distinctive look and flavour and was named Dundee Cake.
