Ingredients:
2 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1/4 cup minced white onion
2 tablespoons green bell pepper, chopped
2 cups whole kernel corn, drained
1 tablespoon chopped pimento peppers
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium heat, stirring until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate, leaving the grease in the skillet. Stir the onion and bell pepper into the skillet, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the corn, pimentos, and reserved bacon. Cook and stir until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper before serving.
