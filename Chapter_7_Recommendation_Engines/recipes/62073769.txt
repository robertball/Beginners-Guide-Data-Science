Ingredients:
2  	cups   heavy cream
1 	cup half-and-half (or milk)
1 	cup granulated sugar
4 	ounces pastuerized egg substitute (such as Egg Beaters) or 2 eggs
1 1/2 	teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 	cups purchased raw refrigerated chocolate chip cookie dough, cut into small chunks

Directions:
1. Beat together egg substitutes, sugar, and vanilla well.
2. Add cream and half-n-half (or milk) and beat well.
3. Pour into a covered pitcher and set in fridge chill well.
4. Pour chilled liquid into an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions.
5. While the ice cream machine is running, go ahead and chop up the cookie dough chunks- stir them into the ice cream once the ice cream maker has completed the freezing process.
6. Ice cream will still be fairly soft at this point- transfer to an airtight freezer container and freeze until firm.
7. Plan to eat up quickly as this only keeps fresh a few days.
