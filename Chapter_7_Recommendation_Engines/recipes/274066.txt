Melt butter over medium heat in a large wok; pour in olive oil. Add chile peppers, garlic, peppercorns, cardamom pods, cinnamon, turmeric, and cumin. Add chicken; stir-fry in the mixture until fully covered and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add potato, pepper, and onion; continue to stir-fry for 5 minutes more.

Description: 
A variation on a Thai green curry, this is a spicy dish that my boyfriend said 'tastes as good as a take-away.' Best served with rice, naan, and mango chutney.
