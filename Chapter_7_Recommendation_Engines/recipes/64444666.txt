Mustard Potato Sala Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cubed, cooked in salted water until just falling apart, drained well in a colander, add back to hot pan to dry out some*
5 eggs, hard-cooked, peeled and smashed
¾ cup celery, diced (I use more, but I love the crunch)
½ cup onion, minced (I used red onion this time, but Vidalia works nicely)
½ cup dill salad cubes (or dill pickle relish)
2 tablespoons dill pickle juice
2 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard (may vary to more)
½ cup + 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
salt and ground black pepper, to taste
1 teaspoon celery seed

Directions:
Place the potatoes, eggs, celery, onion and dill salad cubes into a large bowl.
Gradually add the mustard and mayonnaise, stirring between additions.
You don't want it too creamy, and you don't want it dry.
Add salt and pepper, adjusting to taste.
Refrigerate until ready to serve. If you want it REALLY good, make it a day ahead...it gets better overnight.
