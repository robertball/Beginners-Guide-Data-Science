Ingredients:
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups milk
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 teaspoon grated orange peel
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons confectioners' sugar
2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine eggs, milk, sugar and salt. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until custard is slightly thickened and coats the back of a spoon, about 18 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add vanilla, peels and nutmeg; mix well. Cool for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a small mixing bowl, whip the cream and confectioners' sugar until stiff. Fold two-thirds into the custard. Layer custard and blueberries in parfait glasses. Garnish with remaining cream. Chill for 1 hour.
