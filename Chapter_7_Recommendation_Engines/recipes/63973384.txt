Ingredients:
1 cup nuts, chopped
1 1/4 cups sweetened coconut flakes
1 box German chocolate cake mix, prepared as directed
1/2 cup margarine
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 pound powdered sugar (3 1/2 cups)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9-by-13-inch cake pan.
Cover the bottom of the pan with the nuts and coconut.  Pour the prepared cake batter on top.
To make the icing, melt the margarine in a bowl, add the cream cheese and powdered sugar; stir to blend.  Spoon over unbaked batter.  Bake 40 to 42 minutes.  You cannot test for doneness with a cake tester, as the cake will appear sticky even when it is done.  The icing sinks into the batter as it bakes, forming a white ribbon inside.

Description: 
I found this recipe in our newspaper years ago.  It instantly became a family favorite and is always requested when we get together.  I often call it mud pot cake since the filling often doesn't sink all the way to the middle, but it always delicious.
