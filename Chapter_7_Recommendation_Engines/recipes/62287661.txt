Ingredients:
1/2 c canola oil
1 c granulated sugar
1/4 c molasses
1 egg
1 3/4 c whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
2 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp lemon zest
Lemon glaze:
1 c icing sugar
1 tbsp canola oil margarine
1/2 tsp lemon zest
1 tbsp lemon juice
2-3 tbsp 1% milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the oil and sugar. Add the molasses and egg. Beat until fluffy. Stir in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, ginger and lemon zest. Mix well. Using a small cookie scoop (1 tsp size), measure out dough and place on an insulated cookie sheet. Or place on a parchment lined cookie sheet and flatten slightly. Bake 12-15 minutes or until edges just start to brown. *Don't overbake. Remove from oven and let cool 1 minute, then transfer to wire racks. Let cool and prepare glaze by thoroughly mixing all ingredients together. Drizzle cookies with glaze once they are completely cool.

Description: 
A new twist on an old classic. All of the tender texture and good flavor, with added goodness. These are chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside.
