Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked white rice
1/2 cup water
2 (14.75 ounce) cans salmon, drained and flaked
1/2 cup grated carrot (optional)
1/4 cup chopped onion
2 eggs
salt and pepper to taste
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Bring the rice and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cover; simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Fluff with fork, and allow to cool.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 11 x 9 baking pan with cooking spray.
Remove the skin from the salmon (and bones if you prefer). Combine salmon, optional carrots, onions, eggs, cooled rice, and salt and pepper in a large bowl. Mix well with your hands. Form into 8 (tennis ball sized) balls, using about 3/4 cup salmon mixture per portion. Arrange balls in the prepared pan, allowing room for them to expand. Mix the soup and 1/2 cup water together in a small bowl; pour over the salmon balls.  Cover with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.  Allow salmon balls to rest for a few minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is something my mom used to make when I was growing up.  It's easy, inexpensive and filling!  I always make sure my canned salmon is wild caught for a healthier fish.  I also like to leave the bones in for the calcium - just crush them up between your fingers (they are really soft) as you come across them when you are mixing everything with your hands.  This is a nice recipe to have children help out with and they love to get their hands messy and be able to eat what they made for dinner.
