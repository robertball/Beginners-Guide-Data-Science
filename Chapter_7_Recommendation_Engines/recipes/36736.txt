Description: 
A Cooking Light reader asked us to lighten one of her favorite recipes--a homey melange of pasta, diced ham, and fresh veggies. We did it by using reduced-fat sour cream, mayonnaise, and cheddar, plus lean ham. The result was so good, it stumped our crackerjack taste-testers when it was served next to the original heavy version.
