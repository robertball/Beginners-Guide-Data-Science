Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/3 cup 1% buttermilk
1/4 cup golden raisins
GLAZE:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and cinnamon; cut in shortening until crumbly. Stir in buttermilk just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle raisins over dough; knead 2 or 3 times. Pat to 3/4-in. thickness. Cut with a floured 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter.
Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over biscuits. Serve warm.
