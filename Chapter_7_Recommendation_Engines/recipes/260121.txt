Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen spinach, thawed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (10 ounce) package frozen artichoke hearts, thawed
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 small shallot, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
2 large eggs
1/2 cup tapioca flour
1/4 cup almond meal
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Wrap thawed spinach in a paper towel and squeeze out water.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add spinach and artichoke hearts; season with kosher salt and black pepper. Cook and stir until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Add shallot and garlic; cook until softened, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
Transfer spinach mixture to a food processor; pulse until broken down into small pieces. Add eggs and pulse 3 to 4 more times. Transfer mixture to a bowl.
Mix tapioca flour, almond meal, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes into the spinach mixture until well combined. Use an ice cream scoop to portion the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
I love keeping frozen vegetables handy in the refrigerator. We were invited to a friend's house and came up with these to bring. I had all of the ingredients. Enjoy! 

I made these, packed them up, and they vanished. I totally forgot to take a photo of the finished balls. Next time!
