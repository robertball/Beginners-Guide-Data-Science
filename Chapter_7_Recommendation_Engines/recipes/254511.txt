Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups elbow macaroni
1/2 cup cauliflower florets
cooking spray
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 cup milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Place cauliflower in a blender or food processor; blend until smooth.
Coat a large saucepan with non-stick cooking spray; place over medium heat. Add oil and flour; cook, stirring constantly, until a thick paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Add milk; cook and stir until mixture thickens, 3 to 4 minutes.
Mix cauliflower, Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, salt, and pepper into milk mixture; stir until sauce is smooth. Fold macaroni into sauce.
