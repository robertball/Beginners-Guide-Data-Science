Ingredients:
4 cups sweet potato, cubed (or 5 md sweet potatoes)
1/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup milk or evaporated milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg, if desired
1/4 tsp clove, if desired
1 cup packed brown sugar
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
5 tablespoons butter, softened
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake whole sweet potatoes for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until soft. (Boil over md high heat until tender, if in a hurry. Baked is better!) Peel and mash. Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees.
In a large bowl or food processor, mix together the sweet potatoes, white sugar, eggs, salt, butter, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. Mix until smooth. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In medium bowl, mix the brown sugar and flour. Cut in the butter until the mixture is coarse. Stir in the pecans. Sprinkle the mixture over the sweet potato mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until the topping is lightly brown.
