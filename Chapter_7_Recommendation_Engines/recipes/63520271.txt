Ingredients:
8 Lg Potatoes, (Grated)
2 Medium Yellow Onions, minced or diced
2 Medium Yellow Onions, grated
8 slices bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
2 eggs
3 slices of white bread soaked in milk (cubed)
1/4 Cup of Flour
1 Tablespoon Sugar
1 Tablespoon Parsley (dried)
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Peal potatoes and place in lightly salted water to keep from turning dark.  Grate them one at a time with standard kitchen grater and place into a bowl. You may pace the grated potatoes in water to keep from turning color but they should then be drained well before mixing.
Saute the onion (both diced and grated) with bacon.  Drain off bacon grease.  Add onion and bacon mixture to the drained and grated potatoes.
To the Potato mixture add the milk soaked bread, flour, sugar, salt, pepper and parsley.  Mix well.
Empty the potato batter mixture to a baking dish of your choice.  Glass Pyrex work best but you may use any casserole style dish or baking pan you like.
Bake for 1 hour in a preheated 350 degree oven or until golden brown.
Slice and serve warm, then refrigerate remaining dish.  Refrigerated and sliced pieces may be fried in lard or vegetable oil and served at a later date. Good accompanied as a Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner side item.
