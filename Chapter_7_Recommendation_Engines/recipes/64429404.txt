Ingredients:
One Potato. Three Eggs. Sriracha Sauce, Coconut Oil, Vegenaise, Salt, Onion, Garlic Pepper, Tomatoes, Rosemary, Mushrooms, Veggie Parmesean Cheese, Veggie Refried Beans.  Whatever else you'd like to put in there.

Directions:
Throw the Potato in the microwave and cook it until it is baked thoroughly. While that's happening, get out your skillet, put a little coconut oil in the bottom, then add fresh garlic if you have it, otherwise throw in the tomatoes cut however you'd like, then a few onion slices, then cut up and throw in the mushrooms. Then salt and garlic pepper. Then the three eggs. Then the refried beans. Then the Sriracha and Veganaise. Then whatever veggie cheese you have available. Then get the potato out, smash it up, and put it in there. There are no specific directions here really because you can't screw it up. Just cook it however you like for as long as you like; in my experience cooking a little longer is better to savor the flavors.
