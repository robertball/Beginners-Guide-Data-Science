Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 1/2 cups flaked coconut
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup almonds, chopped

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt the butter in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir in the sugar and graham cracker crumbs. Spread the mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly firm, about 10 minutes.
Stir the coconut and condensed milk together in a bowl; spread over the baked crust and return to oven for 12 minutes more. Set aside to cool at least 10 minutes.
Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Stir the almonds into the melted chocolate; spread evenly over the cooled coconut layer. Allow to cool until the chocolate sets.
