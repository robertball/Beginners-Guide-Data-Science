Ingredients:
3 large Yukon Gold potatoes, baked, and skins removed
½ cup frozen peas
¼ cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon curry powder, or more to taste
½ cup gluten free flour blend
¼ teaspoon salt, plus a couple dashes for the gluten free flour
? teaspoon pepper
3 Tablespoons vegan buttery spread
2 Tablespoons canola oil

Directions:
In a small pan, cook the peas and onions in one tablespoon of buttery spread over medium heat until onion softens, about 5 minutes.
Place the baked potatoes with the skin off in a large bowl. Once the peas and onions are cooked, add them to the potatoes. There will be a little liquid in the pot, go ahead and add that to the potatoes, too.
Add the curry powder, salt, pepper, and one tablespoon of buttery spread to the potato mixture. Use a potato masher to mash it all up.
Place the gluten free flour and a few dashes of salt in a small bowl, set aside. Line a plate with paper towels.
Heat the remaining tablespoon of buttery spread and the two tablespoons of canola oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
Form the potato mixture into small patties and dredge them in the gluten free flour. Once the oil and buttery spread is sizzling, place a few patties in the pan. Cook until golden brown, about three minutes on each side.
Once they are cooked, place them on the paper towel lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining patties.
Serve warm. Makes 8 small patties.
