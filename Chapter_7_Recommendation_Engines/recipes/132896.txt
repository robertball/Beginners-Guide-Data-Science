Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 onion, chopped
1 1/4 cups uncooked instant rice
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook and stir the chopped onion until browned, about 8 minutes.
Stir in the rice, tomatoes, cilantro, and chicken broth, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the rice is cooked and most of the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.
