Description: 
This delicious, creamy dressing is  non-dairy and gluten-free. My meat-and-potato husband loves it on his grilled chicken, steak, and spread on his burgers. I love it as a substitute for mayonnaise in tuna sandwiches. This will be spicy! If you omit the adobo and chipotle, this makes a great recipe base for other creamy dressings. Rice milk can be used for the soy milk. Use your favorite fresh herbs in place of the dill. You can make sauce thinner with the addition of more soy milk.
