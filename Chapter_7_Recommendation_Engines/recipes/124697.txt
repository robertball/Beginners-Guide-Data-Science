Ingredients:
4 medium baking potatoes
1 tablespoon milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon onion salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 pound fresh asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces and cooked
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
Bake potatoes at 400 degrees F for about 1 hour or until done. Cut a thin slice off the top of each potato and discard. Carefully scoop out pulp while leaving shell intact. In a mixing bowl, mash pulp with milk, sour cream, onion salt and pepper until smooth. Fold in asparagus. Stuff shells; place in an ungreased shallow baking dish. Sprinkle with cheese and bacon. Return to the oven for 20-25 minutes or until heated through.

Description: 
You can make this side dish anytime and for any occasion, although I have to say it tastes best when I use fresh asparagus grown here in my backyard!
