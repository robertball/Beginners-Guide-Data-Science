Ingredients:
2 (7.5 ounce) packages refrigerated buttermilk biscuits
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg

1/2 cup chopped nuts
1/2 cup maple syrup

Directions:
Cut each biscuit into quarters. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Dip biscuits in butter, then roll in sugar mixture. Layer half the biscuits in a 10-in. fluted pan; sprinkle with half the nuts. Repeat layers. Pour syrup over top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately invert onto a serving platter. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
The dear friend who shared this recipe has since passed away, but I think of her every time I prepare this sweet bread. Maple syrup provides a saucy caramel flavor. I enjoy developing original recipes or altering others to suit my tastes.
