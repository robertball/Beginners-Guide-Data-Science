Ingredients:
3 eggs
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup milk
1/2 tsp. salt
2 3/4 cups all purpose flour
salad oil for deep-frying
confectioners sugar

Directions:
About 4 hours before serving or up to 1 week ahead:
In a medium bowl, with a wooden spoon, mix eggs, sugar, milk, salt, and 1 cup flour until well blended. Stir in remaining flour.  Wrap dough in plastic wrap; refridgerate 2 hours or until dough is easy to handle.
On a lightly floured surface, with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough, one half at a time, until paper thin.  With a sharp knife, cut dough into 4" X 1 1/2" rectangles.  Cut a 1" long lengthwise slit in the center of each rectangle; thread one end of the rectangle through the slit in center and pull gently through the slit to make a bow tie.
In a 12" skillet over medium heat, heat about 3/4" of salad oil to 350 degrees F. on a deep-fat thermometer (or heat oil to the manufacturer's directions in a deep-fat fryer set at 350 degrees F.)
Gently drop several bow ties at a time into the hot oil and fry for about 1 1/2 min. or until golden.
Drain bow ties on paper towels: let cool.  Store in a tightly covered container.  Just before serving, lightly sprinkle bow ties with confectioners' sugar.

My Grandmother gave me this recipe a little over 30 years ago.  She used to make these for us at Christmas time.  But, these are good anytime throughout the year!
