Description: 
On Sundays, friends and neighbors would stop at my Auntie Rae and Uncle Gene's house. Auntie Rae never cooked on Sundays, so she'd make this coffee cake on Sunday evening, from her own special 'receipt', as she called it. The next day, she'd serve it from the warming closet of her cast-iron kitchen range.
