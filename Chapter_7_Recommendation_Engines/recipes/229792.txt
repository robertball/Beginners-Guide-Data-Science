1 1/4 pounds lean ground turkey breast
2 tablespoons corn meal
1/4 cup egg substitute

1/2 teaspoon chili powder
4 (1 ounce) slices Monterey Jack cheese
4 tablespoons low-fat plain yogurt
4 tablespoons salsa
4 thick slices red onion
Arugula or lettuce
4 hamburger buns, toasted

Directions:
Mix turkey, corn meal, egg substitute, seasoned salt and chili powder in a medium bowl.   Divide mixture evenly into 8 patties.   Top four patties with a slice of cheese and cover with remaining 4 patties.  Press edges together to seal in cheese.
Grill burgers over medium-hot coals for about 5 minutes on each side.
Mix yogurt and salsa together in a small bowl.  Place a burger on each bun and top with onion, arugula and salsa mixture.

Description: 
A fun spin on the traditional burger with a creamy, cheesy center. Made with nutrient-rich, low-fat yogurt and try reduced-fat Monterey Jack cheese. The cheese does contain a small amount of lactose, and the live and active cultures in yogurt help digest lactose, making this recipe a friendly option for those who are lactose intolerant.
