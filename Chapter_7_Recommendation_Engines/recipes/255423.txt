Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 small onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup cooked wild rice
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/3 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup evaporated milk
Sauce:
1 tablespoon butter
8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup dry white wine
2/3 cup water
1 (10.75 ounce) can low-sodium cream of mushroom soup
1/4 teaspoon dried sage
1 (9.74 ounce) package Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine beef, onion, rice, seasoned salt, garlic salt, bread crumbs, and evaporated milk. Shape into 1 inch meatballs. Place meatballs on rimmed baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until brown, about 15 minutes.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and sprinkle with salt; saute until mushrooms release their moisture and soften, about 10 minutes. Add the wine, water, soup, salt, and sage to saucepan; stir to combine.
Transfer meatballs to the sauce and simmer until cooked through and hot, 30 minutes.
Prepare Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes according to package instructions. Serve with the meatballs and mushroom sauce.
