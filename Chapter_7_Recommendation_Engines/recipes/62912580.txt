Ingredients:
1 can crescent roll dough
1/4 c cream cheese
2 jalapeno peppers, minced
2 slices cooked bacon

Directions:
Combine cream cheese & minced jalapeno peppers together
Roll out crescent rolls and cut each in half so you have 16 triangles instead of eight
Divide cream cheese mixture between triangles and top each with a piece of bacon
Bring corners of the dough together and twist at the top
Press edges together so the insides dont gush out while cooking
Bake 15 min at 350
Enjoy!
