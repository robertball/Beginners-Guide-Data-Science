Ingredients:
STRONG tea
You can use sweet tea if you prefer but read the note below.
1 large can of undiluted lemonade concentrate
1 750 ml bottle of good vodka
1-2 cups of Maraschino Cherry Liqueur (they have it at BevMo)
**If you cannot find the Ligueur you can use the regular Maraschino Cherries and the bottled red juice but since this is already sweentened you will not want to use sweet tea if you have to use this substitution**
Sugar to dust rims (optional)
Cherries for garnish.

Directions:
Make a batch of STRONG tea -- sweet tea if you prefer (see note)
Let Cool
In a large pitcher or punch bowl add:
the lemonade concentrate
the strong tea
the bottle of vodka (you can adjust to your strength preference but an entire bottle in a large pitcher or medium punch bowl is just about right)
Add the 1-2 cups of Maraschino liqueur (or the substitute)
Serve over ice in a tall glass.  If you want you can dust the rims in sugar.  Drop in a cherry and drink up.
