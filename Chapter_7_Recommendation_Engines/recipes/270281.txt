Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
2 cups broccoli florets, chopped
2 cups cauliflower florets, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
1 tablespoon sour cream
1 pinch garlic powder
1 pinch dried basil
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Chop and set aside.
Combine broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, and green onions in a large bowl.
Combine mayonnaise, vinegar, and sour cream in a separate bowl. Beat until smooth. Season with garlic powder and basil.
Pour dressing over vegetables and toss to coat evenly. Chill until flavors meld, about 1 hour.
Serve salad garnished with Cheddar cheese and cilantro.
