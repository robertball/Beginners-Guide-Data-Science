Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup margarine, chilled
1/2 cup currants
1 egg
2/3 cup milk
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease one baking sheet.
Combine the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, white sugar, baking powder, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg and salt in a bowl and mix well. Cut in the butter until crumbly and stir in the raisins. Make a well in the center.
In a small bowl beat the egg until frothy. Mix in the milk and pour into the well made in the dry ingredients. Stir to make a soft dough.
Turn dough out on to a lightly floured surface. Knead gently 8 to 10 times. Pat dough into two 6 inch circles and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Brush tops with milk and sprinkle with sugar. Score each top into 6 pie shaped wedges.
Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 15 minutes or until well risen and browned. Serve hot with butter. Maple butter goes very well with these scones.
