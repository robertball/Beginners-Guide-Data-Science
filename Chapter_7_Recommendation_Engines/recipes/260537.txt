Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons milk
1 large egg
1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter
1 tablespoon unsalted butter

Directions:
Combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl.
Whisk 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, egg, and 1 tablespoon melted butter together in a separate bowl. Mix into the flour mixture until batter is fully combined.
Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Drop batter, 1 tablespoon at a time, onto the heated skillet. Cook until bubbles form, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until brown, about 1 minute more. Lay on plate lined with a paper towel to help soak up excess butter. Repeat with the remaining batter.

Description: 
I love these bite-sized pancakes because they make perfect appetizers. Top blini with smoked salmon, creme fraiche, or even caviar. Add a sprig of dill and they are sure to impress. My children also love eating these plain too!
