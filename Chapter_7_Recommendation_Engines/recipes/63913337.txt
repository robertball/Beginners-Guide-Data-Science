Ingredients:
1 lb. green split peas
4 cups chicken broth
4 cups water
1 meaty ham shank
1 cup diced celery
1 cup diced carrots
1 cup diced onion
1 large or 2 small bay leaves
2 teaspoons beef bouillon granules
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
1/8 teaspoon thyme
salt to taste, if needed

Directions:
Sort peas, rinse with cold water and add to a large soup pot.
Add the chicken broth and water.   Cover and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and set aside for one hour.
Return the pot to the heat.  Add the ham shank, celery, carrots, onion, bay leaf, bouillon granules, pepper and thyme.  Cover and gently simmer for about two hours, stirring periodically.
Remove and discard the bay leaf.  Remove the ham shank, and when cool enough to handle, chop the ham into bite size pieces.  Add the ham back to the soup, discarding the bone.
Salt to taste, if needed.  Heat through and serve.

I have been making this split pea soup since 2007 and itâ€™s still one of our favorites!  It freezes well too, which is always a bonus!
