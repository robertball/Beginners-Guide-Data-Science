Ingredients:
1 T dried minced onion
1 tsp. jarred minced garlic
2 1/2 cups cooked chopped chicken (could use more)
2 14 1/2 oz. cans chicken broth (if it seems dry, can add more)
1 T chili powder
1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 cup quinoa, rinsed
2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 15 oz can black beans, drained and rinsed
2 16 oz. cans red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 28 oz can petite diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil (this is different than the original recipe and added so much flavor)
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix everything in the crock pot, and then let it simmer on low all day about 8 hours). Serve with a hunk of crusty bread.
