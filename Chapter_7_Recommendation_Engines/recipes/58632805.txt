Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
garlic salt to taste
18 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn in half
1 (28 ounce) can green chile enchilada sauce
1 (16 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 (8 ounce) container reduced fat sour cream

Directions:
Place the chicken breasts in a slow cooker along with 19 oz of enchilada sauce. Cook on High until tender and no longer pink, about 3 hours. Shred using two forks and return to the slow cooker.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.
Mix the sour cream into the chicken and chile from the cooker.
Pour about 1/2 inch enchilada sauce in the bottom of a medium baking dish, and arrange 6 tortillas in a single layer.
Top with 1/2 of the chicken/sour cream/chile mix, 1/3 of the cheese, and 1/3 of the remaining enchilada sauce. Repeat with second layer of tortillas to use remainder of chicken mixt plus 1/3 of cheese and chile.
Coat remaining tortillas thoroughly with remaining enchilada sauce, and arrange on top of the layers. Sprinkle with remaining cheese, and top with any remaining enchilada sauce
Cover, and bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool slightly before serving.

I got my picture in the paper for this one! My friends' husbands always fall in love with this when I bring it to parties! My 4 picky kids eat it! If you want to skip the charring step, simply tear the tortillas into fourths so they absorb the sauce better.Modified from: Quick and Easy Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Casserole
