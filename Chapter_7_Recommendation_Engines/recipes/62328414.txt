Ingredients:
*  1 10-ounce box frozen cut or chopped spinach, thawed
* 1 12-ounce jar artichoke hearts, drained and roughly chopped
* 1/2 cup whipped cream cheese
* 3/4 cup sour cream
* 1 cup grated Cheddar
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* pita chips, tortilla chips, or sliced French bread
* 1 lemon, cut into wedges (optional)

Directions:
1.  Heat oven to 400Â° F.
2. Squeeze the spinach between paper towels to remove excess moisture. In a medium bowl, combine the spinach, artichokes, cream cheese, sour cream, and Cheddar. Season with the salt and pepper.
3. Scrape the mixture into a small oven-safe baking dish. Bake until lightly golden and heated through, about 15 minutes. Serve warm with the chips or bread and the lemon wedges, if desired.
