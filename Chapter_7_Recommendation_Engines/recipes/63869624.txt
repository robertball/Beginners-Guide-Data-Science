Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups cups sweet potatoes
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 tsp teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. vanilla
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups milk
2 Tbl butter, melted

Directions:
Peel and cut the potato into chunks before boiling or microwaving. Mix all wet ingredients with the potatoes in one bowl, then mixed all the dry ingredients in another bowl, putting them together at the end.
Preheat a lightly greased griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter mixture onto the prepared griddle by heaping tablespoonfuls, and cook until golden brown, turning once with a spatula when the surface begins to bubble.
