Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) can frozen orange juice concentrate
1 (12 ounce) can frozen lemonade concentrate
1 (46 fluid ounce) can pineapple juice
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 cups strong brewed black tea
2 cups bourbon whiskey
1 (2 liter) bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage

Directions:
In a large bowl or container, mix together the orange juice concentrate, lemonade concentrate, pineapple juice, sugar, tea, and whiskey. Transfer to shallow bowls or dishes, and freeze overnight.
Remove the frozen mixture from the freezer and let stand for about 10 minutes. Chop with a wire whisk or potato masher to make a slushy consistency. Place scoops of the frozen slush into glasses, and top off with the lemon-lime flavored soda.
