Ingredients:
1 lb sliced button mushrooms
1/2 large sweet onion- small dice
4 ribs celery- small dice
2 peeled carrots- small dice
2 Tb butter or olive oil
1/4 cup flour
2 Quarts water
1/2 cup sherry or white wine
1/2 tsp salt
pinch of thyme or marjaram
pinch of nutmeg
1 Tbs Hungarian Paprika
1/2 tsp black cracked pepper
1/2 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Saute carrots, celery, and onion in butter/oil until soft and starting to turn golden.  Deglaze with sherry and reduce until syrupy or gone.
Add flour to this until it starts to stick to the bottom of the pan, then quickly add the water and with a whisk, stir this thoroughly, scraping the bottom of the pot. Bring to a slow simmer.
Add the remaining ingredients to the pot and allow to simmer 30 minutes or until it has thickened to your desired consistency.

Description: 
My husband and guest's favorite winter soup which I offer after a day of sledding or skiing with a loaf of crusty bread and hot cider.  Discovered in a quaint Vermont deli, I've recreated it here exactly.  It's quick and easy, and allows me plenty of time to entertain guests while it's simmering on the stove.
