Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups water
1 1/2 tablespoons vegan "beef" soup flavoring
4 large carrots, diced large
4 stalks celery, diced large
3 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 large onion, chopped
1 cup peas
1 cup corn
1 teaspoon dried summer savory
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons water
1 (8 ounce) package cubed, beef-style seitan (such as GardeinÂ®)
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Mix water and "beef" soup flavoring in a large pot over high heat. Add carrots, celery, potatoes, onion, peas, and corn. Add summer savory, parsley, and black pepper and mix together well. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
Mix cornstarch and water together in a small bowl. Add to the pot and mix to combine. Bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, at least 1 hour.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add seitan pieces and cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
Pour stew into bowls and add a few pieces of seitan to each.
