Description: 
I don't know why she called them ice cream wafers, but I remember having these cookies whenever I got to go to my grandparent's house.  Grandma isn't able to do much baking anymore, so I make these for my dad every Christmas and give them to him in a cookie jar that gets passed back and forth just for these cookies!
