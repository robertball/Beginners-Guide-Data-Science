Ingredients:
2 cups fusilli pasta
3/4 cup broccoli florets
3/4 cup shredded cooked chicken
3/4 cup sweet corn, drained
8 cherry tomatoes, halved, or more to taste
3 green onions, finely chopped
Dressing:
4 tablespoons light olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons liquid honey
1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Transfer pasta to a large bowl.
Meanwhile, fit a deep saucepan with a steamer insert. Add 2 inches of water and heat to boiling. Place broccoli in the steamer, cover, and cook until just tender, about 4 minutes. Add to the bowl with the cooked pasta.
Add chicken, corn, tomatoes, and green onions to the bowl with the pasta.
Whisk olive oil, honey, soy sauce, lemon juice, and black pepper together in a bowl. Pour dressing over pasta salad and toss to coat.
