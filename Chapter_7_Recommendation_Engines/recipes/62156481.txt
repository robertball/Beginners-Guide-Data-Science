Ingredients:
2 TBSP of butter
6 Pork Boneless Pork Chops
1 8 oz Package of Fresh Mushrooms
1 small onion diced
4 strips of bacon cooked and crumbled
1 TBSP of minced garlic
1 can cream of celery soup
1 can of golden mushroom soup
1/2 cup of milk
Salt and Pepper

Directions:
In a large skillet melt the butter. Brown the pork chops for 2 minutes per side in the butter, remove from pan and set aside. Saute mushrooms, garlic, onion, and bacon in the pan for 5 to 7 minutes until onion is tender.
In a large 9x13 glass dish mix both soups and milk. Then add in mushroom, garlic, onion, and bacon mixture and stir until well mixed. Place pork chops on top of soup mixture and bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.
This recipe also works well without the mushrooms if your family doesn't like them. The key is the bacon and the golden mushroom soup.

Description: 
Tender pork chops baked with a mushroom and bacon gravy. My family can't get enough of this dinner which is great for me because it's so easy. I serve with mashed potatoes and put the gravy on the top. This has a lot more flavor than other baked pork chop and gravy dishes I've tried.
