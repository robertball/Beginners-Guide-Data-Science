If olive oil is used, the refrigerated dressing may need to be microwaved a few seconds to thin it to its original consistency.

Description: 
A Catalina-style dressing recipe that's been in our family for years.  I can't count the times I've been asked for this recipe; it's way better than boughten dressing.  Works well for taco salad or any lettuce salad.
