Oatmeal Raisin Cookies Recipe Recipe

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 pound (two sticks) butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar, packed
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 cups rolled oats (we use Quaker Quick or Old Fashioned. do NOT use instant)
1 1/2 cups raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
1. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Line two large cookie sheets with parchment or waxed paper.
2. Either by hand or with an electric mixer, beat butter until creamy. Add sugars; beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in eggs one at a time.  Add Vanilla.
3. Mix flour, salt, baking powder, and nutmeg together in medium bowl.  Stir dry ingredients into butter-sugar mixture. Stir in oats, raisins and optional walnuts.
4. Working with generous 2 tablespoons of dough each time, roll dough into 2-inch balls. Place balls onto parchment-lined cookie sheet, leaving a least 2 inches between each ball.
5. Bake until cookie edges turn golden brown, 22 to 25 minutes. Let cool at least 30 minutes before peeling from parchment.
notes:
if you prefer a less sweet cookie, you can reduce the white sugar by 1/4 cup, but you will lose some crispness.
The edges should be brown, but the rest of the cookie should be very light in color.
