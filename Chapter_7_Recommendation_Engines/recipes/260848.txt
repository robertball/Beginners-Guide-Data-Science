Ingredients:
2 boneless pork chops, trimmed of excess fat
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
oil for frying

Directions:
Place pork chops on a paper towel to absorb any excess moisture. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Whisk egg and soy sauce together in a small bowl.
Place flour on a small plate and panko in another. Dredge a pork chop in the flour, pressing it in using your fingertips to cover all crevices along the surface. Turn to evenly coat all sides.
Dip the pork into the egg mixture, coating completely. Transfer immediately to the bowl of panko, pressing in to evenly coat. Repeat process with the second pork chop.
Heat oil in a wide pan or wok on medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lower a pork chop into the oil. Fry until bottom side is golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn; cook until other side turns golden and pork is slightly pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Pick up the cutlet and hold it on its side for a few seconds to let the oil drip off. Drain on a paper towel. Repeat with the second pork chop.
