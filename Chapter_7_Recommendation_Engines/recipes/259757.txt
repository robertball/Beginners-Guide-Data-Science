Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons seasoned salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 3-inch strips
1 green bell pepper, cut into strips
1 red bell pepper, cut into strips
1 yellow pepper, cut into strips
1 red onion, cut into thin wedges
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
16 (8 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Whisk 1/4 cup oil, red wine vinegar, jalapeno pepper, oregano, garlic, seasoned salt, and cumin together in a large bowl to make marinade.
Divide marinade between 2 bowls. Place chicken strips in 1 bowl. Place green bell pepper, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and onion in the second bowl. Marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper-onion mixture; cook and stir until softened and blackened in spots, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same wok. Add chicken; cook and stir until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Return pepper-onion mixture to the wok; stir until heated through. Serve over flour tortillas.
