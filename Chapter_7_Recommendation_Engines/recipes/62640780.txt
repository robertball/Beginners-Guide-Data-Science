Ingredients:
6 large Red/White/ Spanish Onions (or a combination of them) - peeled and thinly sliced;
Extra Virgin Olive Oil - to taste re cooking the onions
¼ tsp Sugar  to taste
2 cloves Garlic - minced
1.8ltrs/4 pints/Beef Stock
125ml/4fl oz dry White Wine
1 Bay Leaf
½ tsp dried Thyme
Salt and freshly ground Black Pepper
8 slices Baguette  sliced and toasted
12oz/360g Swiss Gruyere Cheese plus 2oz/60g Parmesan Cheese - grated and mixed together

Directions:
In a large saucepan, add the oil, heat on a very low heat and sautée the onions, stirring often, for some 2 hours or so or until well, well browned but not burned,
Add the sugar about 15 minutes or so into the process to help with the browning (carmelization);
When satisfied re carmelization, add the garlic and sautée for about 1 minute then add the stock, vermouth (or wine), bay leaf, and thyme;
Bring to boil, partially cover and simmer about 30 minutes until the flavours are well blended;
Season to taste with salt and pepper;
Discard the bay leaf;
To serve, ladle the soup into individual oven-proof soup bowls or a large casserole dish; Cover with the toast and sprinkle on the cheese to cover the toast to taste;
Either place straight under a very hot grill for a few minutes or place into a broiler at 180c/350f/gas 4 for about 10 minutes until the cheese bubbles and is slightly browned.
Serve immediately.

Description: 
I found the basis of this years ago and have added a few, I think, refinements.
The major element is the proper Browning (caramelization) of the onions. 
An absolute delight anytime and well worth the effort. Magic.
