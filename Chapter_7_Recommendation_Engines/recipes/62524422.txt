2 cups whipping cream, divided

16 (1 ounce) squares semisweet baking chocolate
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar

RASPBERRY SAUCE:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries, thawed

Directions:
In a bowl, whisk 1/2 cup whipping cream and egg yolks; set aside.
In a 3-qt. saucepan, heat chocolate, butter and corn syrup over low heat until chocolate and butter are melted; remove from the heat.
Stir about 1 cup into the egg yolk mixture; return all to the pan.
Cook and stir over low heat until mixture coats the back of a metal spoon or reaches 160 degrees F.
Remove from the heat; cool.
In a mixing bowl, beat remaining cream with confectioners' sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form; fold into chocolate mixture until well blended.
Pour into a 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan that has been lined with plastic wrap.
Refrigerate for 8-10 hours.
For sauce, place raspberries in a blender; cover and puree.
