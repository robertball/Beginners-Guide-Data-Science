Ingredients:
1 cup fresh cranberries
1/2 cup cranberry juice
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup strawberry jam
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 (8 ounce) round Brie cheese, rind removed
2 ounces white chocolate, chopped
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
2 teaspoons sugar

Directions:
Combine cranberries, cranberry juice, and 1/2 cup of sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Cook until liquid is reduced almost by half, approximately 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove cranberry reduction from heat and let it cool for 10 to 15 minutes.
Once cranberry reduction has cooled, pour it into a food processor along with the strawberry jam and pulse until the mixture is roughly pureed.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Unroll puff pastry and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Slice Brie cheese into lengthwise pieces and layer on the puff pastry approximately 1/2 inch from the edges. Spoon cranberry reduction over cheese, followed by white chocolate and walnuts. Sprinkle remaining 2 teaspoons of sugar on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until puff pastry is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
