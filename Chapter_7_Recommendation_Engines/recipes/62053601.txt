Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 Tablespoon cinnamon
2 cups grated carrots
1/3 cup dried apricots
1/3 cup sunflower seeds
1/3 cup chocolate chips
1/3 cup coconut
1 banana, pureed
3 eggs
1 cup oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Grease a dozen muffin cups. Combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon,
carrots, apricots, sunflower seeds, chocolate chips, and coconut. Beat the
remaining wet ingredients (banana, oil, vanilla) together and add to the
dry. An ice cream scoop with a spring-loaded thumb works well for
transferring the batter to the muffin tins. Bake at 375 degrees for 15 to 20
minutes.
