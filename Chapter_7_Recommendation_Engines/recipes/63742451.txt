Ingredients:
2 Cups Frozen Blueberries
1 Lemon, zested and juiced
2 Tbsps White Sugar
2 Tbsps Unsalted Butter
2 Tbsps Brown Sugar
1/2 Cup Unsalted Butter, softened
1/2 Cup White Sugar
1 1/4 Cups All-Purpose Flour
1 3/4 Tsps Baking Powder
1 pinch of salt
2 Eggs
1 1/2 Tsps Vanilla Extract
1/2 Tsp Ground Ginger
1/2 Cup Milk

Directions:
1. Preaheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease six 4" ramekins and place them in a 9x13" pan.
2. In a small bowl, mix together the blueberries, lemon zest, and 2 Tbsps white sugar. Set aside.
3. In a microwave safe bowl, melt 2 Tbsps unsalted butter; mix in brown sugar. Spoon the brown sugar and melted butter mixture into the bottom of each ramekin--making sure that there is a thin, even coat of the mixture in the bottom of each ramekin. Then, spoon the blueberry/lemon zest/white sugar mixture into each ramekin; making sure that each ramekin has an even layer of blueberries.
4. In a large bowl, cream together 1/2 cup unsalted butter and 1/2 cup white sugar until fluffy. Add in eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract and squeeze in the lemon juice from the lemon that was zested earlier. Stir in baking powder, salt, ground ginger, and flour until combined. Mix in the milk.
5. Spoon the batter evenly over the blueberry mixture in each ramekin. Place the 9x13" pan, with the filled ramekins in it, into the preheated oven. Bake at 350 for 25-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the mini cakes to cool for 5 minutes in the ramekins. Run a knife around the edges of the mini-cakes before inverting onto a plate.
