Ingredients:
4 TBS dark cocoa powder, natural and NOT "dutched"
1/2 tsp stevia extract (available in health food stores)
A pinch of salt
A dash of cinnamon or nutmeg (optional, but a nice touch)
3 Cups milk
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Mix the cocoa, stevia extract, salt and cinnamon (if using)in a saucepan.  Add a generous 1/4 cup (maybe a bit more) of milk and work it into a paste with a wisk, then slowly wisk in the rest of the milk.  Heat over medium heat while stirring occasionally, then add the vanilla extract.  Though I haven't tried it, using a pinch of instant coffee might be good.

Description: 
A stevia sweetened cocoa with no sugar and no fat, save what might be in the milk and cocoa.  Since cocoa has twice the antioxidant content of red wine and three times that of green tea, I do this daily, primarily for the antioxidant blast, not to mention it's yummy.
