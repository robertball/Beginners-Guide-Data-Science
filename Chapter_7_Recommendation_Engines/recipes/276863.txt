Ingredients:
2 tablespoons salted butter
10 ounces top round steak, cut into strips
1 (6 ounce) package button mushrooms, sliced
1/2 large sweet onion, chopped
2 (10.5 ounce) cans beef broth
1 (10 ounce) package egg noodles
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon caraway seeds

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add top round strips and cook until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and onion; saute until mushrooms are soft and onions are translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add beef broth, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Mix together sour cream, flour, and caraway seeds in a bowl until well blended. Add a small spoonful of hot broth to the sour cream mixture, whisking quickly to avoid curdling the sour cream. Continue adding and whisking in small amounts of hot broth until you have added about 1/3 cup and the sour cream mixture is a much lighter consistency.
Transfer sour cream mixture into the saucepan, stirring constantly until stroganoff mixture is well blended. Increase heat to medium. Stir constantly as if making a roux, making sure mixture does not boil, until thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and serve over a bed of egg noodles.

Description: 
My grandmother has been making this recipe for decades, and while I don't know the original source, I can't find a stroganoff that I find nearly as good as this one. The heavy use of sour cream and caraway seed give a tangy anise flavor I just keep going back to! So for any fan of grandma's cookin', here's one of my favorites.
