Ingredients:
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons ground flaxseed
1 cup coconut oil
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup brewers' yeast
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups oats
1 cup cocoa nibs, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Mix water and flaxseed together in a bowl; soak 3 to 5 minutes.
Beat coconut oil, white sugar, and brown sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter until completely blended. Add vanilla with the second egg and beat until smooth.
Stir flour, brewer's yeast, and salt together in a separate bowl; add to the large bowl and mix until just incorporated into the coconut oil mixture forming a dough. Fold oats and cocoa nibs into the dough; roll into small balls, arrange onto baking sheets, and flatten slightly.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.

Description: 
Great cookies, healthy, and they work! For healthier version, cut sugar in half. I also like to add chopped walnuts and/or 1/4 cup cocoa powder.
