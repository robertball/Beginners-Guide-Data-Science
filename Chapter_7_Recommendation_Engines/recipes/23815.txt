Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 (8 ounce) container blueberry flavored yogurt
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 tablespoons butter, melted
2 cups blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Stir together flour, sugar, baking soda and baking powder. In a separate bowl, combine yogurt, egg, vanilla, butter and blueberries. Stir mixtures together just until combined; batter will be very thick. Scoop into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.
