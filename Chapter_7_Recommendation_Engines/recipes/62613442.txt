https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 Milk chocolate cake mix
1/3 cup Oil
2 Eggs
28 -30 Rolo Candies (1/3 bag)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 and grease a cookie sheet.
Mix the first three ingredients together by hand with a spoon (not mixer). The batter will be pretty thick.
Take a small amount of dough and flatten it in the palm of you hand. Place one Rolo candy in the center of the dough, and wrap the dough around the candy, forming a ball. It should be about the size of a walnut shell.
Place on a greased cookie sheet. Bake at 325 degrees for 6 1/2 to 7 minutes.
When you pull them out of the oven, use the flat bottom of a glass, and press down on each cookie to spread the caramel through out. Cool on a flat surface (otherwise the cookies will break in half over a wire rack).
