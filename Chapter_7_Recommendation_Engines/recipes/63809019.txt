Baked Fruit Buckley Recipe

Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
¼ cup oats
1/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 cups of sliced fresh plums, peaches, pears or
nectarines, whole blueberries,
strawberries, raspberries, blackberries
or a combination of fruits (or frozen berries) plus raisins if you like them
1 tablespoon cinnamon for the dry ingredients and 1/2 tsp for sprinkling over the top
1/3 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Prepare the fruit.
Set butter in an 8-inch square or 9-inch round pan; place in oven to melt while heating it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. While the butter is melting, whisk flour, 1/3 cup of sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, walnuts and salt in small bowl. Add milk and vanilla; stir to form a batter. Pour batter into pan over the melted butter. Place fruit over batter mostly in the middle in a pile. Sprinkle with more cinnamon.
Bake until batter browns and fruit bubbles, 45~50 minutes. Insert a knife into it and if no batter sticks to it, it’s done. The fruit might leave a little juice on the knife but that’s fine! Let it cool to warm or room temperature.

Description: 
Super easy way to make a baked fruit dessert. It makes a nice autumn treat. This isn't a fruit crisp, nor a buckle, nor a cobbler nor a betty, hence the name. It comes closer to the German Kaiserschmarrn.
