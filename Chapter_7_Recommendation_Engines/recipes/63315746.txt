Ingredients:
Banana Pudding Cake
1 box yellow cake mix
1 5.1 oz box of Instant Banana Cream Pudding
1/2 c. granulated sugar
1 T. light brown sugar
4 large eggs
1/2 c. mashed ripe banana OR applesauce
1/4 c. sour cream
1/3 c. veg. oil
5 oz. can of evaporated milk
1/2 c. water
Fudge Icing
1/2 c. (1 stick) salted sweet cream butter
3-4 T. heavy cream (or half and half, for less firm icing)
2 t. vanilla flavoring
1/3 c. cocoa powder
2-3 c. confectioner's sugar
**Once, I began making this frosting without realizing that I was out of cocoa, and I substituted 1/8 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2 a Hershey bar, and a Tablespoon of Nutella and it worked, so don't be afraid to substitute!!

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 F. Using vegetable oil or shortening, grease a Bundt or Tube pan. Mix the wet ingredients, then add the cake mix and sugar, saving the pudding mix for last. After all ingredients are thoroughly mixed, pour into the pan and bake for 45-50 minutes.
While the cake is baking, you can make the icing, and store in the fridge until the cake has cooled.
Icing Directions:
Add the room temp butter and cream to the bowl of your stand mixer. Mix on medium speed with the whisk attachment until the butter and cream combine. Increase the speed to high and mix for 3-5 minutes until the mixture is light and fluffy, stopping to scrape down the sides a time or two. Add the vanilla, cocoa, and 2.5 cups of the powdered sugar. Mix on low until combined and then increase speed to medium and whip for 1 to 2 minutes.
