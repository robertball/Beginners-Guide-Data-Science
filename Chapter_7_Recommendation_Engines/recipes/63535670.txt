Ingredients:
2-1/2 pounds pork tenderloin
---trimmed and sliced into 1-1/2 inch pieces
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 medium onions, diced
2 sweet peppers, diced (red, yellow or orange)
2 15 oz. cans of beans of your choice (kidney, black, red, etc.), drained and rinsed
4 10-1/2 oz. (or 3 14-1/2 oz.) diced tomatoes with green chilis
1 4 oz. can diced green chilis
1-1/2 cups beef broth
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 9 oz. bag frozen, shelled edamame
salt and pepper to season pork
olive or vegetable oil for browning pork
*****
optional - 8 oz. frozen yellow corn
optional - 8 oz. frozen sliced carrots
*****
Steamed white rice

Directions:
Trim fat from pork tenderloin and slice into 1-1/2 inch pieces. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
In a large dutch oven, brown pork in oil over medium-high heat.
Add garlic, onions, and sweet peppers and cook until slightly tender (about 10 minutes).
Add beans, tomatoes, green chilis, broth, chili powder, basil, and cumin, stirring until thoroughly mixed. Bring mixture to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low and cover.
Stirring every 15 minutes, cook until pork is tender and falling apart, usually about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
Add edamame (and any optional frozen vegetables, as desired) and stir thoroughly.
Using the flat edge of a wooden spoon, break up pork pieces, so pork is "shredded".
Serve over steamed white rice.
