Ingredients:
1 18.3 oz Betty Crocker Dark Chocolate Brownie Mix
2 3.9 oz instant chocolate pudding
2 cups cold milk (2% or whole)
1 cup chocolate liquer (e.g. crème de cocoa)
3 1.4 oz Heath Bars, crushed separately
1 16 oz container Cool Whip, thawed

Directions:
Prepare the brownie mix according to package instructions, using "cake-like" style directions in a 13x9x2 pan.  Cool completely.
Cut the brownie in half and then cut each half into small squares, about 3/4 - 1 inch, dividing evenly. Set aside.
Prepare pudding by pouring 2 cups cold milk and 1 cup chocolate liquer into a bowl.  Add the pudding mixes and beat on lowest speed for 2 minutes or use a whisk. Scoop about one cup of the Cool Whip and blend it into the pudding mixture until smooth.
Layer in a trifle bowl:  half the brownie squares, half the pudding mixture, one crushed Heath Bar, and half of the remaining Cool Whip.  Repeat layers.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours.
Sprinkle the last Heath Bar over the top of the Cool Whip when ready to serve.

Description: 
After trying a few Death By Chocolate recipes, I created this version, adding the liquer to give it an extra layer of sophistication.  I serve mine in a trifle bowl and it looks beautiful.  You can make many variations with different pudding and liquer flavors like Buttershots or Crème de Menthe!
