Layer tortillas, one on top of the other. Cut into eighths, but still keep in circle form.
Push back the top layer of tortillas so that half of each piece on the bottom layer is showing.
Pour 1/3 cup of oil in a measuring cup. Sprinkle all spices onto the oil. Mix together.
With a baster, brush the oil/spice mixture over the tops of the tortillas.
