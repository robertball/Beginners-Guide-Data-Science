Ingredients:
2 cups raw walnuts
2 cups packed pitted and roughly chopped dates
10 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Soak walnuts in cold water for 4 to 6 hours.
Drain walnuts and place in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until chopped. Add dates and pulse to chop, stopping frequently to scrape down sides. Add cocoa powder, vanilla and salt. Process until mixture is almost smooth, scraping sides as needed to keep mixture moving; the mixture will form a ball similar to dough with tiny bits of walnuts remaining.
Transfer to an 8-inch square baking dish and press down evenly with wet fingers. Freeze for 4 to 6 hours until well chilled. Cut into squares. Store in freezer until ready to serve.
