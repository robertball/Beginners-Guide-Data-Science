Combine the water, lentils, onions, potatoes. and garlic in a soup pot, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until everything is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat.
In a small saucepan on low heat, warm the oil until it is hot but not smoking. Add the cumin, turmeric, and salt and cook, stirring constantly for 2 to 3 minutes, until the cumin is fragrant. Take care not to scorch the spices. Set aside for about a minute or the oil may splatter when added to the soup. Stir the slightly cooled spices into the soup and add the cilantro.
Working in small batches, purÃ©e the soup in a blender until smooth. Add the lemon juice. Return the soup to the pot and reheat gently. Add salt and pepper to taste.
