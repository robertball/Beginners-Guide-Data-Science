Ingredients:
Filling:
4 medium yams, peeled and cubed
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup melted butter
Topping:
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart ovenproof casserole dish.
Combine mashed yams, brown sugar, eggs, milk, and melted butter in a bowl. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish.
Combine pecans, brown sugar, flour, and melted butter in a bowl and mix well. Sprinkle topping over yams.
Cover and bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 1 hour.
