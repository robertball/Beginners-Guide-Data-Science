Ingredients:
4 (8 ounce) packages reduced-fat cream cheese, softened
2 cups brown sugar
4 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 pound fresh strawberries, coarsely chopped
1 fresh pineapple - peeled, cored and chopped
1 pound seedless grapes, halved
1 pint blueberries
25 clear, plastic (10 ounce) cups
12 sugar cookies, crushed
2 kiwis, peeled and sliced

Directions:
Mix cream cheese, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth. Refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes.
In a separate bowl, lightly mix together the chopped strawberries, pineapple, grapes, and the blueberries.
Scoop about 3 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture into the bottom of each plastic cup to make a half-inch thick layer. Spoon enough mixed fruit on top of the cream cheese to make a 2-inch layer, about 1/3 cup. Top the fruit with a teaspoon or two of crumbled sugar cookies. Garnish each trifle with a kiwi slice. Refrigerate until serving time.

Description: 
These originated when I needed a way to take fruit pizza to an event on our Harley (fruit pizza doesn't fit so well in a T-bag).  I brainstormed with other cooks and came up with this individualized version which can be prepped ahead of time and assembled on site.  Good stuff, no matter how you travel to your destination!
