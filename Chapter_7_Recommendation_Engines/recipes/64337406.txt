Ingredients:
Chicken Pot Pie Filling
2 lbs raw chicken breast, cubed
16oz package frozen vegetables
2 medium potatoes, cubed
2 cans cream of chicken soup
1 can water
1 t garlic powder (or to taste)
salt and pepper (to taste)
Dumplings
2 cups bisquick mix
2/3 cup milk

Directions:
Crockpot Chicken
Layer bottom of crockpot with chicken cubes
Sprinkle frozen vegetables over chicken
Add potatoes on top of vegetables
Spread cream of chicken soup on top of veggies
Add one can of water
Season to taste with salt, pepper, garlic powder
Slow cook on high 5 hours or 6-10 hours on low
The mixture will be thin.  Don't worry the dumplings will soak up and thicken the broth nicely.
(If you prefer to skip the dumplings, you can prepare biscuits or something similar along side.  To thicken sauce without dumplings, mix separately 1/4 cold water and 1 tablespoon flour until smooth.  Stir flour mixture into crockpot and cook on high until sauce thickens.
Dumplings
Mix bisquick and milk together until it forms a pasty batter.
Drop batter in small drops into crockpot chicken.  They will expand.
Let cook for 5-10 minutes before serving

Description: 
Real pot pies are not gourmet, but we love them anyway.  This basic filling generously allows for adaptations over the basic variety, so experiment!  This is just the comfort food needed on a cold winter's day.
