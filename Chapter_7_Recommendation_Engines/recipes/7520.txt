Ingredients:
3/4 cup poppy seeds
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup nonfat dry milk powder
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
4 egg whites

Directions:
Soak poppy seeds in water for 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 inch round cake pans. Sift nonfat dry milk, flour and baking powder together, and set aside.
Cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy.
Add 1/4 of the flour mixture to the creamed butter mixture and beat well. Continue to add the flour mixture alternately with the poppy seeds and water, beating well after each addition.
Beat egg whites until stiff and gently fold into batter. Pour batter into prepared pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Cool, then fill and top with Almond Custard Filling before serving, if desired.

Description: 
This cake is moist and delicious; especially so if you love the flavoring of almond extract.  The cake is lovely and unusual to look at: white with black dots from the poppy seeds; filled and topped with yellow almond flavored custard.  It's easy to take to a picnic, potluck or gourmet dinner.  Just take the two cake layers and the bowl of custard.  Assemble at your destination. Always a hit.
