Ingredients:
½ cup chopped celery
½ cup chopped onion
1 (11 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 cup water or chicken broth
1 teaspoon salt
2  eggs, beaten
10 cups soft bread cubes
½ cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a saucepan over medium-high heat and coat with cooking spray. Add the celery and onion. Cook and stir until tender. Reduce the heat to medium and mix in the cream-style corn, water and salt. Remove from the heat and stir in the eggs and bread cubes. Form into balls about the size of baseballs, and place them on a cookie sheet. Brush melted butter onto the balls.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until heated through and the outside is lightly toasted.
