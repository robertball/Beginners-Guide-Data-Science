1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon crumbled dried oregano
3-4 garlic cloves, crushed
1 (4 pound) boneless pork shoulder roast
2 bay leaves
2 cups chicken broth
1 onion, sliced

Directions:
Cut pork into 2-3 pieces and place in crock pot.Add herbs, onion, and garlic.Pour the chicken broth around the sides of the pork, being careful not to rinse off the spice mixture.
Cover and cook on Low until the pork shreds easily with a fork, about 10 hours. Turn the meat after it has cooked for 5 hours. When the pork is tender, remove from slow cooker, and shred with two forks on a baking sheet. Use cooking liquid as needed to moisten the meat and place in 400 degree oven for 10-20 minutes until crispy on edges.

Description: 
Carnitas means 'little meats' and is traditionally fried then braised. This recipe is made much easier using the slow cooker but the results are just as tasty. This makes a great filling for tamales, enchiladas, tacos and burritos. This filling is also great combined with your favorite barbecue sauce and served on buns.Modified from: Slow Cooker Carnitas
