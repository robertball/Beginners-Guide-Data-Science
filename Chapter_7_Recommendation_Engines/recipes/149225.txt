Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup finely chopped green bell pepper
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground clove
1 bay leaf
Stuffed Peppers:
4 large green bell peppers, tops removed, seeded
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup minced onion
1/3 cup finely chopped celery
1 1/2 cups cold, cooked white rice
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 1/2 cup onion and garlic, and cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chopped bell pepper, tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, then season with salt, chili powder, sugar, black pepper, glove, and a bay leaf. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
While the sauce is simmering, microwave the peppers until tender, about 45 seconds. Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat, and add ground beef. Cook and stir until browned and crumbly, then stir in 1/4 cup onion, and celery. Drain off grease. Cook another 5 minutes, then fold in the rice and Parmesan cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
To assemble, stir about 1/2 cup of the Creole sauce into the beef mixture to moisten it. Stuff the peppers with the beef mixture, and place onto a 9x9 inch baking pan. Pour the remaining Creole sauce over the peppers.
Bake peppers, uncovered, until hot and beginning to brown, about 25 minutes.
