Ingredients:
2 cups cone-shaped corn snacks (such as Bugles®)
2 cups cheese-flavored crackers (such as Cheez-It®)
2 cups small pretzels
1 cup crispy corn cereal squares (such as Corn Chex®)
1 cup mini shredded wheat cereal squares (optional)
1 cup pecan halves
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
3/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Combine cone-shaped corn snacks, cheese crackers, pretzels, corn cereal squares, mini shredded wheat squares, and pecan halves in a large bowl. Whisk butter, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce, Cajun seasoning, and cayenne pepper in a separate bowl. Pour butter mixture over snack mixture and toss lightly to coat. Spread mixture into a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until snacks are lightly toasted and liquid has been absorbed, about 1 hour; stir every 15 minutes.
