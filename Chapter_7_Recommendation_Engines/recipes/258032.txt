Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 egg
1 cup panko bread crumbs
vegetable oil for frying
Sauce:
1/2 cup Japanese mayonnaise
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
3 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce

Directions:
Mix 1 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon honey, garlic, and ginger together in a bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
Whisk egg in a bowl until smooth.
Pour panko bread crumbs into a shallow bowl. Dip chicken pieces in whisked egg and roll in panko until coated.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook chicken in batches in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain excess oil.
Mix Japanese mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons honey, Dijon mustard, mirin, and 1 tablespoon soy sauce together to make sauce. Pour sauce over chicken.

Description: 
Very easy to make and my guests enjoy it a lot! It can be served as an appetizer, or over a bed of rice as a quick weekday dinner! I usually marinate the night before to give it more flavor, but if it's a last-minute meal you are preparing, no worries, because there's still dipping sauce! Serve hot with shredded lettuce and a lemon wedge.
