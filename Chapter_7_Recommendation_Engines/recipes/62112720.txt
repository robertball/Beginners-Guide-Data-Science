Ingredients:
2 - 3 cooked chicken breast halves, sliced thinly
3 cans cream of asparagus soup
1 cup milk
1/2 lb cooked pasta, any shapes
1 lb cooked asparagus, cut in half, with bottom of stem removed
8 oz  package of shredded cheddar jack cheese (you can used cheddar or swiss, too)

Directions:
Lightly spray bottom of 9 x 13 pan with canola oil spray.
In separate bowl, combine 3 cans cream of asparagus soup and 1 cup milk.
Spread cooked pasta on bottom of pan.
Pour some of the soup mixture over the pasta, just enough to get all the noodles wet.
Lay chicken slices over noodles, be sure to cover all pasta.
Lay asparagus pieces over chicken, cover all chicken.
Pour remaining soup mixture over top of asparagus, make sure to let it soak through all layers.
Top with shredded cheese.
Bake on 350 degrees for about 35 minutes or until cheese is browned and bubbly.
Enjoy!

Description: 
This easy to make casserole was a hit at my house! I used leftovers for part of it, which is always a plus and it all went together so well. As for the pasta, we had a mix of cooked bowties, elbows and spirals and they worked great! My 16 month old daughter loved it and the leftovers reheated beautifully the next day. Hope you like it as much as we did!
