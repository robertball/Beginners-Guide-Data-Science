Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup soy flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 cup silken tofu
3 eggs
1/2 cup honey
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup walnut oil
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 1/2 cups grated zucchini
1/2 cup crushed pineapple, drained
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup ground flax seed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together the all-purpose flour, soy flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon in a bowl until blended; set aside.
Place the tofu in a blender, and puree until smooth. Scrape into a bowl, and beat with the eggs, honey, brown sugar, walnut oil, and almond extract until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until just moistened, then stir in the zucchini, pineapple, walnuts, and flax seed until combined. Divide this batter between two 8x4 inch ungreased loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaves comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans on a wire rack before slicing.

Description: 
By using less sugar and oil, and adding flax seeds for some of the walnuts, I've created a better-for-you version of the usually fat-laden zucchini bread.  It's delicious!
