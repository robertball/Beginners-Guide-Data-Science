Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
3 eggs
1/2 cup cottage cheese
1/4 cup milk
1 cup chopped cooked broccoli
1/2 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a jumbo 6-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
Combine eggs, cottage cheese, and milk in a blender or Vitamix(R). Blend on low speed to combine, 1 to 5 seconds. Pour mixture into a medium mixing bowl.
Add broccoli, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, and bell pepper to cottage cheese mixture; add garlic salt and pepper. Stir to combine.
Divide mixture evenly between the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of a quiche comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
These crustless cottage cheese quiches are simple to make and vegetables can be interchanged with what you have. If you want a knock off of the pricey souffle sold at a local cafe chain, just add puff pastry to the bottom of a pie tin.
