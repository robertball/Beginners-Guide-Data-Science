Ingredients:
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1/4 cup unpopped popcorn
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Place popcorn and oil in a 3-quart pot over medium heat and cover the pot with a lid. Shake the pot constantly as popcorn pops. When popping slows to a few seconds in-between pops, after about 3 to 5 minutes, remove pot from heat and pour popcorn into a large bowl. Season with sea salt.
