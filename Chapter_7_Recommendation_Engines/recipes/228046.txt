Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 white onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon capers
1 tablespoon caper juice
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1/3 cup pitted, sliced green olives (such as Castelvetrano)
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 (7 ounce) red snapper fillets, cut in half
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
2 limes, juiced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook and stir until onions begin to turn translucent, 6 to 7 minutes.
Cook and stir in garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add capers and caper juice; stir to combine.
Stir in tomatoes, olives, jalapeno pepper, . Cook and stir until jalapeno pepper softens and tomatoes begin to collapse, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in oregano.
Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil into a small baking dish. Sprinkle in 1 tablespoon of the tomato-olive mixture. Top with 1 snapper fillet, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Top with more filling and juice from 1 lime. Repeat with remaining snapper fillet, seasoning, and lime juice in a second baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish is flaky and no longer translucent, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
I like red snapper for this, but any white, flaky fish will work. By the way, many Veracruz-style fish recipes call for pickled jalapenos, but I think there's plenty of acidity in this from the lime and tomatoes, so I like the fresh pepper a little more.
