Ingredients:
1 pound dried great Northern beans, soaked overnight
1 hambone
2 cups white wine or 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
water to cover
I also add any veggies I happen to have in the fridge, chopped onions, sliced carrots, chopped lettuce, tomatoes, whatever

Directions:
Combine the beans, hambone, onion powder, parsley, garlic salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a slow cooker. Pour enough water into the slow cooker to cover the mixture by about 2 inches. Set slow cooker to Low; simmer 12 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove hambone, and return meat still on it to the beans.  You may have to fish out and shred larger pieces of ham that have fallen off the bone while cooking.
