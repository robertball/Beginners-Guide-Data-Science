Ingredients:
1/2 cup pecans
20 frozen dinner rolls
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup instant butterscotch pudding mix
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Place the rolls in a lightly greased 13x9 inch cake pan. In a medium mixing bowl combine the brown sugar, pudding mix and cinnamon. Sprinkle the cinnamon mixture over the rolls and then the pecans. Pour the melted butter over the rolls, cover with a clean damp cloth and let stand overnight at room temperature.
In the morning, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake rolls for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes and then turn out onto a serving plate.
