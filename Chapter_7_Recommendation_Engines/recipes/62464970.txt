Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch strips
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (10 ounce) package frozen spinach, thawed and drained
1 (8 ounce) package cold cream cheese, cubed
10 cherry tomatoes, halved
1 (16 ounce) package dry penne pasta

Directions:
Bring large pot of water to a boil, and stir in penne pasta.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook chicken cubes in broth; simmering until done, about 10 minutes. Stir in cubed cream cheese and spinach. Return to simmer, and cook about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in cherry tomatoes, and cook about 3 minutes more.
In a large bowl, mix together cooked, drained pasta and sauce. Let stand a few minutes before serving.

Description: 
I used 3 freshly chopped tomatoes, and a can of Rotel to the mixture, came out great, but I also think either sun dried tomato, or more fresh tomatos would be even betterModified from: Laura's Unbelievable Chicken and Pasta
