Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons Oil
2 Cups Jasmine Rice
8 Ounces Sliced Mushrooms
1/2 Pound Frozen Cooked Shrimp, Thawed
2 Green Onions
3 Tablespoons Soy Sauce
1 Egg

Directions:
Rinse 2 cups of Jasmine rice in a strainer until the water runs clear of starch.
Add 2 cups rice to 2 1/2 cups water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20-22 minutes.
Check the doneness of the rice after 20 minutes. The water should be completely absorbed, and the rice should be soft to the touch. If still firm, recover and continue cooking on low for 3-5 more minutes.
In a Wok or large skillet, warm 2 tablespoons of oil on medium-high heat.
Stir-fry 8oz sliced mushrooms about 5 minutes, until golden brown and soft.
Add 1/2 lb thawed shrimp, and green onions. Continue cooking on medium-high heat for 4 minutes, stirring frequently.
Stir in 2 cups cooked rice, and 3 tablespoons soy sauce. Cook for 1 minute.
Break 1 egg over the top of your rice mixture. Stir in for 3 minutes, until the egg has completely set up in the rice.
