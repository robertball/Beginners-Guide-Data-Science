Ingredients:
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes
3 cups bread flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons rapid rise yeast
6 tablespoons olive oil
2/3 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon sea salt
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon fresh thyme

Directions:
Place sun dried tomatoes in a small bowl. Cover with warm water and let soak for 10 minutes. Drain, chop and set aside.
In a large bowl, sift together flour and salt; stir in yeast. Add olive oil, warm water, and chopped sun-dried tomatoes; mix well. Knead on a  lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover dough and let relax for 10 minutes.
Roll dough into a rectangle approximately 7x11 inches. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and make about 20 deep impressions in the dough with your fingers. Cover with plastic and leave in a warm place until doubled in size, about 40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Brush dough with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt, basil, and thyme. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
