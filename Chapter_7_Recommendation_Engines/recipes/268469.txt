Ingredients:
300 grams salmon
1/2 ActiFry spoon tandoori spice powder
3 cups plain yoghurt, divided, or to taste
30 leaves fresh mint, chopped
1 teaspoon minced green chilli, or to taste
1/2 ActiFry spoon ground cumin
Salt and pepper
1 small tomato
1/2 red onion
1/2 cucumber

Directions:
Trim the salmon into 12 cubes and coat with tandoori spice powder. Chill and leave to marinate.
Blend 1/4 of the yoghurt with the mint, chilli, cumin, salt, and pepper. Refrigerate and leave to steep.
Peel the tomato. Remove the seeds and cut into small dice. Peel and finely chop the onion. Peel the cucumber. Cut lengthwise to remove the seeds easily using a small spoon, then dice.
Right before serving, cook the salmon in the ActiFry for 5 to 6 minutes, adding seasoning but no fat. During this time, mix the flavoured yoghurt with the remaining yoghurt, diced tomato, cucumber, and onion.
Pour the sauce into small glasses or soup plates and top with the salmon. The salmon will be half-cooked after 5 to 6 minutes. If you prefer it more cooked, continue for another 4 to 5 minutes.
