Ingredients:
Crust...
1/2 cup cashews
1 cup shredded coconut
2 tablespoons agave syrup
Chocolate cake...
3/4 cup cashews (soaked for a couple of hours)
3 tablespoons cocoa powder
3 tablespoons agave syrup
3 tablespoons coconut oil

Directions:
Crust...
Put the cashews in a blender and mix until you have a smooth nut butter.
Add the shredded coconut and agave and stir with a spoon or mix with your hands until you have a smooth dough.
Press into the bottom of a small cake pan. I used a very small cake pan, 3,5 inches.
Chocolate cake...
Put the cashews in a blender and mix until you have a smooth butter.
Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well.
Pour onto your crust and let it set overnight or for at least a couple of hours.
