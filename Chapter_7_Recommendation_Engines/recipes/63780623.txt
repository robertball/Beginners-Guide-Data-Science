https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
Meat Sauce
1 lb browned ground turkey
2 garlic cloves, diced
1/4tsp oregano
1 16oz tomatoes
1 6oz tomato paste
1/4 cup parmesan cheese
1/2 chopped onion
1 tsp dried basil
2 Tsp dried parsley
Eggplant
2 Eggplants peeled and sliced into 1/4 inch thick rounds
2 eggs
2 Tbl water
1 cup Parmesan cheese
1 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs
The Rest
2 Tbl olive oil
2 cups shredded Mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F
Oil two cookie sheets with 1 Tbl olive oil
Whisk eggs and water together in dish
Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in bowl
Dip eggplant slices in egg mixture
Press eggplant slices into breadcrumb mixture
Arrange eggplant slices on cookie sheets
Bake 20 minutes per side or until the tops are browned
Turn the oven up to 400 degrees
While the eggplants are baking brown the ground turkey and drain. Then add the garlic, oregano, tomatoes, tomato paste, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, onion, basil, parsley and simmer for 30 minutes. I like to mash up the tomatoes because nobody in our house likes big chunks of tomatoes.
Oil a 9x13 baking dish with olive oil.
Layer 1/3 of the eggplants, 1/3 of the meat sauce, and 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese until you've used up all the ingredients.
Bake uncovered for 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbling.
Let it stand for 10 minutes.
