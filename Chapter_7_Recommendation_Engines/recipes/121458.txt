Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (4 pound) beef rib roast
1/2 cup butter or margarine, cubed

Directions:
Combine the first four ingredients; rub over roast.  Place roast, fat side up, in a roasting pan.  Dot with butter.  Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-3/4 to 3 hours or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).  Let stand for 10-15 minutes before carving.  Thicken pan drippings for gravy if desired.
