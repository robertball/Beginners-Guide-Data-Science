Ingredients:
1 large onion, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 large carrot, peeled and diced
2 stalks celery, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1 small green bell pepper, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 (4 ounce) jar whole mushrooms, drained
1 cup canned diced pineapple in juice, drain juice and reserve
2 1/2 pounds large boneless pork chops or cubed pork loin
1 cup reserved pineapple juice from the can
2 tablespoons sherry wine
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1/4 teaspoon mustard powder
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 dashes hot pepper sauce, or to taste
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste

Directions:
Place the onions in the bottom of a 5 quart slow cooker. Layer carrots over the onions, followed by layers of celery, mushrooms, and pineapple. Season pork chops with salt and pepper. Place them on top of the vegetables. If you like, you may brown them in a hot skillet first.
In a medium bowl, stir together the pineapple juice, sherry, cider vinegar, and soy sauce. Stir in the cornstarch until dissolved. Mix in the brown sugar, white pepper, ginger, mustard powder, garlic, salt, pepper, hot pepper sauce and tomato paste. Pour this over the pork chops and vegetables. The sauce will taste less sharp after a few hours in the slow cooker. Cover, and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours, or on High for 3 to 4 hours.

Description: 
Slow cooking is not a very traditional, but way less messy for these sweet and sour pork chops. It is an easy cold weather meal with some rice and crispy egg rolls, fried noodles, or fried wontons on the side.
