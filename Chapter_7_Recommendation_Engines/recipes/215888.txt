Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 medium zucchini, cubed
1 pinch red pepper flakes
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup Classico® Tomato and Basil Sauce
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
4 (6 inch) French or Italian sandwich rolls, split

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Fry the zucchini in butter until browned and slightly tender. Season with red pepper flakes, salt and pepper, and stir in the tomato and basil sauce.  Cook and stir until sauce is heated.
Spoon a generous amount of the zucchini mixture into each sandwich roll. Top with a handful of shredded mozzarella. Close the rolls, and wrap individually in aluminum foil.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until bread is heated through, and cheese is melted.
