Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) pumpkin, peeled and cubed
salt
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root
12 peppercorns
1/2 pound apples - peeled, cored and chopped
1/2 pound shallots, chopped
1/2 pound golden raisins
1/2 pound demerara sugar
1 1/4 cups malt vinegar

Directions:
Place pumpkin in a pan, cover liberally with salt, and leave overnight. The following day, drain and rinse under cold water.
Place ginger and peppercorns on a piece of muslin and tie together with kitchen twine to make a spice bag.
Combine pumpkin, apples, shallots, raisin, sugar, vinegar and spice bag in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook until pumpkin is soft and chutney has thickened, about 1 hour. Remove and discard spice bag.
Spoon chutney into sterilized jars, cover with lids, and allow to cool to room temperature. Store in the refrigerator.
