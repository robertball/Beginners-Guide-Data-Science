Ingredients:
Dersa:
4 cloves garlic, peeled and halved
1 small fresh red chile pepper, seeded and chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
Stew:
1 1/2 pounds new potatoes, halved
1 tablespoon tomato paste
water to cover
salt to taste

Directions:
Combine garlic, chile pepper, cumin, paprika, black pepper, cayenne, and salt in a mortar; grind with a pestle until it forms a paste. Add olive oil and mix dersa well.
Heat a large saucepan over medium heat and stir-fry dersa until fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Add potato halves and stir to combine with the dersa. Stir in tomato paste. Pour in enough water to just cover the potatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 40 minutes.
Ladle potatoes into a serving bowl. Spoon any remaining sauce over the potatoes.
