Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) boneless beef chuck roast
1 (16 ounce) jar whole dill pickles, undrained
1 bottle chili sauce
2 garlic cloves, minced
10 hamburger buns, split
sharp cheddar
horseradish

Directions:
Cut roast in half and place in a slow cooker. Add pickles with juice, chili sauce and garlic. Cover and cook on low for 8-9 hours or until beef is tender. Discard pickles. Remove roast. When cool enough to handle, shred the meat. Return to the sauce and heat through. Using a slotted spoon, fill each bun with about 1/2 cup meat mixture.

Description: 
'My younger sister, Jean, shared this recipe, which puts a twist of the traditional barbecue sandwich,' writes Donna Blankenheim of Madison, Wisconsin. 'As a busy mother of four, Jean never has much time to cook, but she does like to entertain. This crowd-pleaser, made in a convenient slow cooker, is perfect for our large family gatherings.'Modified from: Dilly Beef Sandwiches
