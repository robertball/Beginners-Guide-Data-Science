Ingredients:
1 (9 ounce) package cheese tortellini
1 tablespoon butter
1 shallot, minced
1 tablespoon curry powder, or to taste
1 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 tomato, chopped
2 pickled jalapeno pepper slices, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; stir in tortellini and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Heat butter over medium heat in a saucepan; stir in shallot and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add curry powder; cook and stir until a paste forms, about 1 minute.
Pour vegetable broth into curry paste mixture. Stir until curry is dissolved, about 1 minute; bring to a boil. Slowly pour in coconut milk; adjust heat to return soup to a simmer.
Stir tomato and jalapeno into soup, simmer 5 minutes more. Stir tortellini into soup; season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
We love this when coming home from work on a cold and rainy day, of which we have many in Vancouver, BC. It adds your favorite comfort foods - soup and pasta - together in an exotic combination! We serve it with bread sticks or garlic bread.
