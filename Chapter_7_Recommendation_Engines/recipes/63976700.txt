Ingredients:
Parchment paper; cooking spray
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup canola oil
2 ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 large eggs, beaten
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup yogurt (thinned with milk)
1/2 cup cold brewed coffee
1 cup chopped walnuts, divided

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat a 9x4-inch loaf pan with cooking spray and line with parchment.
Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.
Mix oil, sugars, and mashed bananas in a bowl. Beat in eggs. Stir in coffee, vanilla extract, and yogurt-milk mixture.
Stir flour mixture into banana mixture until just incorporated. Fold in 3/4 cup walnuts.
Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Tap pan on the counter to release any air pockets. Sprinkle remaining walnuts on top.
Bake in preheated oven for about 1 hour 10 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
Let the bread rest in the pan for 15-20 minutes; remove from pan, slice, and serve.
