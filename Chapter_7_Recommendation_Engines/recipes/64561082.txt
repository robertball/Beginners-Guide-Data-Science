Description: 
As you know, Lasagna sheets may not be easily available, so I have used the bread instead. Also, the authentic lengthy process of making Lasagna has been made easy.
This is a simpler way of making the lasagna. And since you don't actually make the sauce, it is very quick and easy to make. It's one of the BEST vegetarian recipe !
