Ingredients:
Two Green Zucchinis, chopped
Four Plum Tomatoes
One Clove Garlic, minced
½ Cup Panko Bread Crumbs
A Dozen Mozzarella Balls
Two Dozen Slices of Pepperoni
1 tsp Dried Basil
1 tsp Dried Oregano
1 Tbsp Water
3 Tbsp Olive Oil
One Egg
One Pot of Water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Put a small pot of water on the stove and get it boiling!
Rinse the tomatoes, and once the water is boiling, put them in the pot for blanching. After about one minute, strain them, let them cool slightly, and use your hands to peel (the skin should slip off easily).
In another small pot, sauté one minced clove of garlic in 1 Tbsp olive oil, and add the peeled tomatoes and herbs after about a minute or two. Cook tomatoes, breaking up with a wooden spoon, to create a sauce.
Chop the ends off of the zucchinis, and cut into half-inch slices.
In a small bowl, whisk egg with 1 Tbsp water until the mixture is consistent.
Put Panko bread crumbs into a shallow bowl, dip zucchini pieces into the egg/water mixture, and then coat both sides with Panko bread crumbs.
Sauté the Panko-coated zucchini pieces in the remaining 2 Tbsp olive oil, flipping them occasionally, until golden-brown.
Place them on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Top each piece with about a teaspoon of sauce, then one pepperoni slice.
Slice all the mozzarella balls in half, and put one half on each piece of zucchini.
Bake for ten minutes (or until mozzarella is slightly melted) and serve.
