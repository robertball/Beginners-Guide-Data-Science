Ingredients:
1/2 cup Mexican caramel sauce (cajeta)
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 (8 ounce) package PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, cubed, softened
7 large eggs, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup sugar
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix
1 cup water
1/3 cup oil
1/2 cup BREAKSTONE'S or KNUDSEN Sour Cream
1 cup thawed Cool Whip whipped topping

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.
Pour caramel sauce into 12-cup fluted tube pan sprayed with cooking spray. Blend evaporated milk, cream cheese, 4 eggs, vanilla and sugar in blender until smooth.
Beat cake mix, water, oil and remaining eggs with mixer until blended. Add sour cream; mix well. Pour over caramel in tube pan; gently ladle flan mixture over cake batter. Cover pan with foil sprayed with cooking spray, sprayed-side down. Place in larger pan. Add enough water to larger pan to come halfway up side of tube pan.
Bake 1-1/2 hours or until toothpick inserted near center comes out clean. Cool completely in pan on wire rack. Refrigerate 2 hours. Loosen dessert from side of pan; invert onto plate. Remove pan. Serve dessert topped with COOL WHIP.
