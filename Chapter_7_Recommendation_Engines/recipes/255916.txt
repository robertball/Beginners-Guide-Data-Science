Ingredients:
12 ounces broccoli florets
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 cup chopped kale leaves
2 (15.5 ounce) cans chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 large clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons lemon juice
3 Eggland's Best Eggs, large

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Add broccoli florets to a food processor and pulse until it resembles rice.
Heat 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat.
Add greens, broccoli, chickpeas, and tomato paste. Stir to combine.
Add in garlic, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and remaining olive oil. Stir to combine.
Cook for about ten minutes or until broccoli is tender.
Break three Eggland's Best eggs over mixture. Do so carefully so that the yolk stays in tact to the membrane.
Place skillet in the oven and bake for 15 minutes.
Remove and garnish with fresh herbs of choice - I used cilantro.
