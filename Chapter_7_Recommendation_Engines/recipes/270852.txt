Ingredients:
1/2 cup rolled oats
2 teaspoons flax seeds
1 ripe banana
1 egg
1/4 cup natural peanut butter
2 tablespoons honey (optional)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup finely grated carrot

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 6 cups of a muffin tin.
Mix together oats and flaxseeds in a small bowl.
Combine oat mixture, banana, egg, peanut butter, honey, flax seeds, vanilla extract, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a blender. Process until smooth. Fold in grated carrots. Divide batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 18 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
These carrot muffins come out fluffy and smell amazing. The riper the banana, the sweeter these will be. I've also made them using grated apples. Love how it's all done in a blender.
