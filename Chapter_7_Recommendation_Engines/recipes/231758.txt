Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons white sugar

3 cups water, more if needed

Directions:

Description: 
Delicious tomato juice for a fraction of the cost of store-purchased. Adjust lemon, salt, and sugar to taste. Almost 7 cups of juice for about $1.00! I prefer the natural tomato paste.
