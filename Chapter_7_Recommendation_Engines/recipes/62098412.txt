Description: 
This is a combination of my Granny M.E. and my husbands Granny White's homemade dressing recipes. This was taught to them by their mothers, which was handed down by their mothers, and so on. I thought my Granny M.E.'s was the best and my husband thought his Granny White's was the best so I combined the two. It's moist, and very delicious.
