Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package dry black beans
2 1/2 quarts water
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 large onion, chopped
1 tomato, cubed
1 carrot, cubed
1/2 pound bacon strips, diced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place beans in a pressure cooker with enough water to cover, and soak 12 hours, or overnight.
Add 2 1/2 quarts water to the beans, or enough to fill pressure cooker about 2/3 full. Cover, and cook 30 minutes at 10 pounds pressure. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and saute the garlic and onion until tender. Stir in the tomato and carrot. Cook about 5 minutes, and mix in the bacon. Cook and stir until bacon is crisp and evenly browned.
Mix the vegetable and bacon mixture into the pressure cooker with the black beans. Cover, and continue cooking approximately 10 minutes at 10 pounds pressure. Garnish with parsley, and season with salt and pepper to serve.
