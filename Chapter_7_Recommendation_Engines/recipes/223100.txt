Description: 
This shrimp lo mein is easy to prepare and tastes wonderful! Can double the sauce if you like more. Can add additional water or broth to sauce if you like it less thick. Use whatever combination of vegetables you like for about 4 cups total. You can also serve the vegetables and shrimp over the noodles, as opposed to tossing them together.
