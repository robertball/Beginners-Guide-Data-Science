Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon butter
3/4 cup applesauce
4 tablespoons molasses
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
Sift together the flour, ginger, allspice and baking soda, set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the margarine and 1 1/2 cups of sugar. Stir in the applesauce and molasses. Add dry ingredients to the molasses mixture and mix until just blended.
Roll tablespoons of dough into balls and roll the balls in the remaining sugar. Place the balls on the prepared cookie sheet, flatten slightly. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven for chewy cookies, 12 to 15 for crisp cookies. Cool on wire racks.
