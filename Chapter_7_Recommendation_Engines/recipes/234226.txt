Ingredients:
8 tablespoons reduced-fat peanut butter, or to taste
8 whole wheat tortillas
8 teaspoons honey, or to taste
8 bananas, peeled
1 cup high-protein crisp rice and wheat cereal (such as Kellogg's® Special K®), or to taste

Directions:
Spread 1 tablespoon peanut butter onto each tortilla. Place 1 banana in the center of each tortilla; drizzle honey over each banana. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons cereal over peanut butter and banana. Fold ends of each tortilla over the 2 ends of each banana and roll tortilla around banana. Cut in half or serve whole.

Description: 
This is totally packable for a lunchbox, and gives a little variety to the pb and j. I've taken these as hand-held breakfast foods for my staff and volunteers at events, as well as taken them to a bridal party brunch. They worked out great as we all got our hair and makeup done.
