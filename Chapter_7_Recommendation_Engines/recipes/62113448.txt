Description: 
This breakfast treat was based on the composition of a Take 5 candy bar. Lucky for me, this one is made with whole grain rice cakes, protein rich peanuts, and only a smidge of chocolate! Sweet and salty, and divinely easy! If you don't have any chocolate covered pretzels, chopped regular or whole grain pretzels and a small amount of mini chocolate chips works wonders! Have with a tall glass of skim milk.
