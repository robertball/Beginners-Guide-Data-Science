Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup molasses
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg yolk
2 cups all-purpose flour

1 cup salted peanuts
1/3 cup peanut butter
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and margarine. Stir in the molasses, vanilla and egg yolk. Add flour, mix until combined. Press dough into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown.
In a 2 quart saucepan, combine raisins, peanut butter and chocolate chips. Melt over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Spread evenly over the baked crust, and refrigerate until set, about 1 to 2 hours. Cut into 1x2 inch bars and serve.
