Ingredients:
6 lbs brisket
1 cup beef broth
1 beer of your choice
¼ cup black pepper
¼ cup garlic powder
¼ cup onion powder
2 tbsp mustard powder
½ cup sugar
2 tbsp 2 tbsp. salt
1 tbsp cayenne powder

Directions:
Trim any excess fat from the brisket and score in a crosshatch pattern (about 1 x 1") across the top.
Inject a bit of beef broth into the brisket to keep it from drying out.
Combine all the ingredients for the rub in a medium bowl and mix well.
Generously cover the brisket with the rub.
Transfer to the smoker and smoke at 225-250°F temp for 1-1 1/2 hours, until the internal temperature reaches 150°F.
Transfer to a large disposable pan and pour the beer around the brisket.
Cover tightly with a large piece of foil.
Transfer to the oven and cook at 225-250°F for another couple of hours, until it reaches an internal temperature of 195°F.
Transfer the wrapped brisket to a cooler and let stand for 1-2 hours.
After the brisket has rested, remove from the cooler, and slice it against the grain.
Serve and enjoy!!
