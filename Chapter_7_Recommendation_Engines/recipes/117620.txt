Description: 
'This rich cheesy dish is the only way I can get my kids to eat spinach,' writes Trish Nelson of Lynn Center, Illinois. 'It makes a lovely brunch bake, and traditionally, I always serve it on Christmas Eve. But because it's so light and yummy, my family asks for this crustless quiche year-round.'
