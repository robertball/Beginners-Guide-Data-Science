Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 cube chicken bouillon
8 ounces fresh broccoli spears
8 ounces cauliflowerets
1/4 pound fresh mushrooms, quartered
1/4 cup plain yogurt
1/4 cup SMUCKER'S® Low Sugar Apricot Preserves
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon curry powder
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a large saucepan, combine water and bouillon cube; heat until cube dissolves. Add broccoli, cauliflower, and mushrooms. Cover and cook until broccoli is tender-crisp, about five minutes. Drain.
In small saucepan, combine remaining ingredients. Cook and stir until sauce is heated to serving temperature. Pour over vegetables.

Description: 
Here's a fruit sauce that's just as good over freshly cooked vegetables as it is as a chilled fruit dip.
