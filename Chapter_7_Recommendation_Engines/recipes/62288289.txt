Brown ground beef with onion. Drain fat and add jalapeños, enchilada sauce, olives and cumin. Simmer 5 minutes.
Spray a 9 x 13-inch pan with no-stick cooking spray. Spread a thin layer of the meat mixture over the bottom of the pan. Place 4 tortillas on top. Pour one-third of remaining meat mixture on top and sprinkle with 1 cup cheese. Repeat layers two more times, ending with cheese.
Bake uncovered at 400° for 30 to 35 minutes. Let sit 5 minutes before serving. Cut into squares and top with dollops of sour cream.
