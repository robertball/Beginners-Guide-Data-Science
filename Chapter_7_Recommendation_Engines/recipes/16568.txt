Ingredients:
8 medium potatoes, sliced
1/2 pound sliced bacon
1 pound processed American cheese, sliced
1/2 onion, chopped
1 cup mayonnaise
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup black olives, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Put sliced potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender but still firm, about 10 minutes. Drain, and set aside.
At the same time, place bacon in a large deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly browned. Remove to paper towels to drain.
In a large bowl, stir together the potatoes, cheese, onion, mayonnaise, salt, and pepper. Spoon into prepared baking dish. Crumble bacon over the top, and sprinkle with olives.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
