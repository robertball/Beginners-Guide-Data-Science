Description: 
I created this basic, yet versatile recipe when I was looking for a bean rice side dish to serve with various meat dishes.  Goes well with grilled chicken or steak, corned beef, or even with stir fried shrimp and vegetables. Used in combination with fresh corn cut off the cob, finely diced onion, fresh diced tomato, (diced chilies - opt), 2 tsp cumin, 1/4-1/2 cup lime juice, fresh chopped cilantro, salt and pepper makes a tasty Mexican hot or cold side-dish or as appetizer scooped up with fresh crisp tortilla chips.
