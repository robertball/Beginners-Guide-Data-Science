Image:

Ingredients:
2 pounds small red potatoes
1 large avocado
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
½ teaspoon (or less) sea salt
1½ teaspoons maple syrup
Freshly ground black pepper
? cup fresh dill, packed and chopped
½ bunch green onions (green part), sliced
3 stalks celery, trimmed and sliced
½ white onion, diced

Directions:
Wash the potatoes and cut out any bad spots or eyes. Steam gently until fork just pokes through the center. Immediately run under cold water to prevent further cooking.
For best results, refrigerate the cooked potatoes for about an hour. (This ensures they don’t fall apart when slicing.)
Quarter the potatoes. Place in a large bowl.
Peel and mash the avocado in a small bowl. Add the lemon juice, mustard, paprika, sea salt, and maple syrup, and stir into the avocado to create a dressing. Season with pepper to taste.
Add the dill, green onion, celery, onion, and avocado dressing to the potatoes. Toss gently until everything is coated. Taste test and adjust seasonings if desired.
Serve the same day, or refrigerate and serve the next day (as the avocado darkens and breaks down quickly).

Description: 
A flavourful take on traditional potato salad. The avocado is a much healthier alternative to mayonnaise, that adds nutrient value and healthy fats, without sacrificing any of the creamy texture. 

A dish that healthy eaters will approve of and picky eaters will love!
