Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package rotini pasta
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
1 cup chopped bacon
salt and pepper to taste
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Heat oil in a large saucepan or skillet, add onion, bacon, salt, and pepper. Cook until bacon is crispy and onion is soft. Drain fat. Pour in tomato soup and stir; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; add 1 cup Cheddar cheese and the milk. Stir until cheese is melted.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Combine sauce with pasta in a baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining 1 cup cheese. Place under the oven broiler until sauce is thick and cheese browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
