2 tablespoons Splenda® no calorie sweetener, granulated
2 tablespoons Market Pantry™ flour
1/4 teaspoon apple pie spice
1 (15 ounce) package Market Pantry™ refrigerated pie crust, softened

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees F.
Combine apples and water in small saucepan. Cook over medium heat about 8 minutes or until apples are tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in sweetener and flour. Cook and stir an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until mixture is thickened; cool slightly.
On sprayed baking sheet unroll pie crust. Place apple mixture on half of pie crust, fold crust over to cover apple mixture. Seal with egg white and crimp edges. Brush egg white on top crust. Make 2 small cuts in top crust to vent steam.
Bake 11 to 13 minutes or until golden brown.
