Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 Cup Flour
1 Cup Milk
2 Tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
5 Tbsp. salted butter

Directions:
Add the 5 tbsp of butter to a 9x13 pan.
Put the pan in the oven and preheat to 425. by the time the oven is heated, the butter will be melted. While this is happening, make the batter.
Beat the eggs, add in milk, sugar, and flour and whisk until smooth.
When butter is melted and oven is preheated, tilt the pan so the butter coats the bottom evenly.
Pour batter into pan.
Bake 20 minutes or until edges are puffy and golden brown and middle has set.

Description: 
My sister and I have been making this ever since we learned it in home economics classes in the 1980's! This pancake is eggy, salty, and a bit sweet. The edges puff up and become crispy while the center bakes up deliciously. We serve with real maple syrup but you can serve with any type of syrup, or even top with fruit.
