Ingredients:
2 teaspoons cooking oil
3 pounds beef top sirloin, thinly sliced
2 pounds sweet Italian sausage, casings removed
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
20 ounces diced tomatoes
3 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1/2 cup honey
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
2 tablespoons cayenne pepper
6 tablespoons chili powder
3 tablespoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons salt
1/3 cup white sugar
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup masa (corn flour)

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook the steak, sausage, onion, green pepper, red, pepper, yellow pepper, and garlic in the pot until the onions and peppers are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken bouillon, honey, and kidney beans; bring to a boil. One at a time, stir in the cayenne pepper, chili powder, oregano, black pepper, salt, and sugar. Sprinkle the Cheddar cheese into the chili in small batches and stir to melt. Reduce heat to low and slow cook about 2 hours. Thicken by stirring the masa through the chili, and simmering for 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is the best chili you will ever have! It's not your ordinary chili with chopped meat! I make this and let it cook in a slow cooker. It's great for parties or cold winter nights.
