Fresh ground pepper to taste

1/2 medium onion, minced
1 garlic clove, minced

Directions:
Start with sauteeing the onion and garlic in the olive oil in your soup pot.  Cook over medium, stirring frequently until translucent.
Add the mushrooms and thyme to the pot, and cook for a few minutes.
Add the soup to the pot.
Pour the sherry into the can and then fill the can the rest of the way with water and add to the pot.
Bring to a low boil, then reduce to a simmer for 5 or 10 minutes for flavors to blend.
Add freshly ground pepper and serve.
