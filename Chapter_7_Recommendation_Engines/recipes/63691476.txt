Ingredients:
10 cups over-ripe satsuma plums, pitted
4 cups white sugar
2 cups plum juice

Directions:
In a food processor finely chop the washed and pitted plums. Strain and measure; reserve juice. If there is not enough juice for 2 cups you may add apple juice to the plum juice.
In a non-reactive pot, bring the plums, sugar and juice to a boil, stirring often. Scrap off and discard any foam that arises. Boil and stir until the preserves sheet from your spoon, about 2 hours.
Pour into sterilized jars and cool. Refrigerate.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me by my mother-in-law. She did not like the taste of pectin so this takes a little longer, but is well worth the effort.
