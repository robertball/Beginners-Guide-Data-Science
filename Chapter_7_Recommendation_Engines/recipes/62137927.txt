Ingredients:
8 oz green beans
1 egg, beaten
2 cups water
2 cups chicken broth
1 c. flour
1/2 c. plain breadcrumbs
1/2 c. crushed french fried onions
3/4 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
1/4 tsp. black pepper
8 cups vegetable oil to fry in
Cucumber Wasabi Dip
1/2 c. ranch dressing
1/4 c. cucumber, minced with seeds and peel removed first
1 Tbsp whole milk, though 2% will work in a pinch, just use 1 tsp less if substituting
1.5 tsp horseradish, prepared
1 tsp. white vinegar
1 tsp. japanese wasabi powder
1/8 tsp. salt
Cayenne pepper to taste

Directions:
Make the dip first by combining all ingredients in a food processor until smooth, then cover and chill.
Prepare the beans by boiling in the 2 cups of water and 2 cups of chicken broth - the mixture must be brought to a boil before adding the beans.  This will soften them up just a little bit and give them some flavor.  Boil for 10 minutes and then remove from broth.
In separate bowl, combine egg and milk.  In another bowl combine breadcrumbs, crushed fried onions, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.  The cup of flour goes in yet another separate bowl.
Coat the beans in the flour, then dip into egg/milk mixture, then coat with the breadcrumb mixture.  Be sure to shake off any excess flour before placing into the egg mixture.  Place beans on a plate or in a collander until they are all coated and ready to be fried.
Fry the beans for about a minute and a half in oil heated to 350 degrees.  Drain in collander lined with paper towels.  Serve with dipping sauce.
