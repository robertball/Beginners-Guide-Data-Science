Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
5 carrot, julienned
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 cup sultana raisins
4 cups uncooked basmati rice
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 cup water
1 pinch saffron (optional)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place rice in a large bowl, rinse, and then soak in cold water for 30 minutes.
In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Add carrots and 1 teaspoon sugar; cook, stirring frequently, until tender. Stir in raisins, and continue cooking until the raisins are soft and plump.  Remove from heat, and set aside to cool.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Strain rice, and then add to boiling water. Cook for about 5 minutes, then strain with a mesh strainer.
In a small saucepan,  heat 1/2 cup oil and 1 tablespoon sugar. Cook until sugar dissolves completely, making a syrup. Remove from heat , and cool. Once cool, add 1 cup water, and return to a boil.
Return the rice to pan. Stir in carrots and raisins, and then mix in oil and sugar syrup. Season with saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper, and cumin. Poke some holes with a spoon all over the rice. Cover, and cook over high heat until you hear crackling noises. Remove from heat.
Bake, covered, in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove from oven, and toss rice with a fork.
