3/4 cup SPLENDAÂ® Granular
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup whole wheat flour

1 tablespoon canola oil
2 teaspoons water
2 egg whites
1 teaspoon molasses
1 tablespoon flax seeds (optional)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, whisk together Splenda(R), oats, wheat flour, soy flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir in pumpkin, canola oil, water, egg whites, and molasses. Stir in flax seeds, if desired.  Roll into 14 large balls, and flatten on a baking sheet.
