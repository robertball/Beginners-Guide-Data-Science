Ingredients:
1 jar (15 ounces) crushed tomatoes (about 1¾ cups)
½ cup cider vinegar
¼ cup packed dark brown sugar
2 Tablespoons tomato paste
1 Tablespoon mustard powder
1 Tablespoon sweet smoked paprika
1 teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon celery seeds
½ teaspoon ground cloves
½ teaspoon hot red pepper sauce
1½ cups shredded carrots
1½ cups shredded yellow potatoes (no need to peel)
4 cups shredded savoy cabbage
1 bottle (12 ounces) dark beer, preferably a porter, divided
8 small challah rolls

Directions:
Combine the crushed tomatoes, vinegar, brown sugar, tomato paste, mustard powder, smoked paprika, oregano, celery seeds, cloves, and hot sauce in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, stirring until the brown sugar dissolves. Stir in the carrots and potatoes, then bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer slowly for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the cabbage and ¼ cup of the beer. Cover and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes, adding more beer as necessary to keep the vegetables from scorching. If you end up adding too much beer, simply cook uncovered for a couple of minutes, stirring almost all the while, until the mixture is fairly dry, not soupy at all.
Mound the vegetable mixture onto the bottom of the challah roll set on each of 8 serving plates. Top each with the bun's other half.

Description: 
By cooking shredded vegetables in an all-American, sweet-and-sour sauce of tomatoes, beer, vinegar, and brown sugar, we can morph them into a dinner-party version of the classic summer pulled pork sandwich.
