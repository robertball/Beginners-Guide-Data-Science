Description: 
Most vegetable-beef-barley soups are bland soups to help people that are ill, but I like vegetable-beef-barley soup to have more flavor, so I have worked at making this one have more flavor and more veggies then most. When I make this soup, I make my family a nice loaf of bread to serve them with it, plus I also give them a nice chunk of cheese. I also fix a light dessert or slice up some fruit.
