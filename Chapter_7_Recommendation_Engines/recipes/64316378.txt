2 cups chicken broth
1 cup water
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried thyme

1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 large onion, diced
2 large carrots, sliced
1 celery stalk, sliced
1 (11 ounce) package frozen egg noodles
1 cup frozen peas
1/2 cup milk

In a large stockpot, combine cooked chicken, chicken brother, water, bay leaves, dried thyme, salt, pepper, onion, carrots, and celery. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer until the carrots are tender.

In a small bowl, whisk together milk and flour. Stir into the noodles and cook, stirring the entire time, until the mixture has thickened considerably.
