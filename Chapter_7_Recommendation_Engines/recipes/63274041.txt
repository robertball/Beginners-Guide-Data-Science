Ingredients:
2 1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs
1/2 c. sugar
3/4 c. butter or margarine, melted
16 oz. cream cheese
2 c. powdered sugar
16 oz. cool whip
2 pkgs. Baker's German Sweet Chocolate
2/3 c. milk
1/4 c. sugar
6 oz. cream cheese
16 oz. cool whip
Mini chocolate chips
Chocolate syrup

Directions:
Mix the first three ingredients together. Pat firmly into a 9"x13" pan AND a 9" pie pan to make a crust.
Using a mixer, carefully blend first cream cheese and powdered sugar together until lump-free. Gently fold in the cool whip, and distribute between the two crusts.
Chop the sweet chocolate and microwave it with the milk, being careful not to scorch. Stir until smooth; let cool slightly.
Beat sugar and cream cheese together until lumpless. Add melted chocolate and milk slowly. Fold in whipped cream, and spread over top of previous spread.
For topping, sprinkle with mini chocolate chip and drizzle with chocolate syrup. Keep refrigerated until serving.
