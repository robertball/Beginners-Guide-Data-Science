Ingredients:
1 tablespoon unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder
1 packet Sweet'N Low granulated sugar substitute, or to taste
1 cup hot coffee
Skim milk
Cocoa powder, for garnish

Directions:
In a small mug or coffee cup, mix the cocoa and Sweet'N Low together. Add a few tablespoons of the coffee and stir until the cocoa is completely dissolved. Pour in the remaining coffee.
Foam the milk. Spoon a generous amount over the hot mocha. Garnish with a pinch of cocoa powder, if desired.

Submitter: 
Sweet'NLowÂ®
Description: 
This warming drink, a treat for coffee and chocolate lovers alike, combines the two under a layer of creamy foamed milk. Skim milk foams easily and makes a deceptively lean, yet rich topping. Enjoy it in the morning, as an afternoon break, and as a lean, luscious, liquid dessert.
