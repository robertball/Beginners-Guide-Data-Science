Ingredients:
1/2 cup raw unsalted almonds
2 cups fresh or frozen shelled edamame, thawed if frozen
4 cups firmly packed fresh basil leaves
1 cup fresh mint leaves
3 cloves roasted garlic, or more to taste
2 teaspoons finely grated fresh lemon zest
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon citric acid powder (optional)
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Place almonds in a small ungreased frying pan. Toast over medium-low heat, shaking frequently until evenly browned and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
Place almonds in the food processor and chop coarsely. Remove and set aside.
Place edamame beans in the food processor and chop to a paste. Add basil, mint, garlic, and lemon zest; process until smooth while slowly adding in 1/2 cup olive oil. Add Parmesan cheese, salt, and almonds; pulse to combine. Stir in citric acid.
Transfer pesto to a jar with a tight-fitting lid. Pour a layer of olive oil over the top and cover with the lid. Refrigerate until serving.

Description: 
A friend brought edamame pesto to a potluck last summer and I loved it. I tweaked her recipe a little bit by using roasted garlic instead of raw garlic, which makes it mellower. I also added citric acid to preserve it better and help the pesto maintain its color, but that's optional. 
I don't think anyone in my family wants to eat regular pesto again anytime soon! This keep pesto keeps in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
