Ingredients:
1 cup apple cider
1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries
1/2 cup orange juice
1/3 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Cook and stir apple cider in a saucepan over medium-low heat until cider is reduced by half, about 10 minutes.
Combine reduced apple cider, cranberries, orange juice, maple syrup, ginger, allspice, and cinnamon in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cranberries have burst and sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes.
