Ingredients:
1 can of premade biscuits (10 pieces)
20 cubes cheddar cheese (1/2" x ¾" x ¾") (approx 4oz total)
3 Tbsp butter
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
2 tsp dried parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Cut each biscuit in half and slightly roll out (don't worry about it being round). Place a cheese cube in the middle and wrap the biscuit dough around the cube ensuring the edges are sealed. Roll in your hands to make a ball shape.
Place butter & garlic in a small bowl and melt in the microwave about 12 seconds. In a separate bowl, combine parsley and parmesan cheese.
Dip each rolled biscuit into the butter mixture and then into the cheese mixture. Place on a parchment lined pan.
Bake 10-12 minutes or just until browned.

Description: 
These are the ultimate cheese buns!  An explosion of deliciousness…  They are small enough to serve as an appetizer but they also are PERFECT served along side any meal!  We’ve served these with pasta or chicken dishes and they’re always wonderful!

If you happen to have any leftover, the kids will love taking them for lunch!  There are lots of versions of cheese biscuits out there…  this is definitely my favorite!
