Ingredients:
2 lbs ground beef
1/2 lb bacon, chopped
48 oz (or so) of cream soup (I used 12 oz cream of mushroom and 36 oz cream of chicken)
milk
4 oz Velveeta, cubed
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Brown ground beef and bacon and drain off fat.
Add the soup and stir that stuff up.
Pour in enough milk to create your desired consistency.
Heat the mixture until it's simmering.
Drop in the Velveeta cubes and cook until they're melted, stirring occasionally.
Season as needed - ours only needed a little pepper.
Serve over mashed or baked potatoes (or rice, or toast, or...)
