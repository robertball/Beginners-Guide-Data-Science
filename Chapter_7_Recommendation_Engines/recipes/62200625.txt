Ingredients:
2 cups leftover mashed potatoes
1 cup leftover stuffing, diced
1 cup leftover turkey, diced
1/2 cup leftover cooked carrots or other vegetables, diced
2 eggs, beaten
salt and pepper to taste
leftover gravy, warmed up
Breading:
1/2 cup flour
2 eggs
2 Tbsp. water
1 cup plain bread crumbs
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
canola or vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together potatoes, stuffing, turkey, and vegetables.
Add beaten egg, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
In a shallow bowl, beat two eggs and water.
In a separate shallow bowl, mix bread crumbs, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.
Place flour in a third shallow bowl.
Using an ice cream scoop, scoop out potato mixture and form into patties about 1/2 thick.
Dredge each first in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs.
Pour about 1/4 inch oil into a large skillet and heat over medium heat. Fry patties 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Top with leftover gravy.

Description: 
In my quest to reinvent the old standard leftovers, I looked for a recipe for Croquettes. None that I found fit the bill, so I headed to the kitchen and made up my own. They're very tasty, and honestly taste almost nothing like the original, which is always a bonus with leftovers.
