Ingredients:
2 beef soup bones
2 tablespoons kosher salt
5 stalks celery
1 onion, quartered
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 'bouqet garni' spice balls
1/2 pound baby carrots
1/4 cup fresh parsley
11 cloves garlic, peeled
1 cup barley

Directions:
Place beef bones in a large size slow cooker.  Add salt, celery stalks, onion, bouquets garnis, pepper, carrots, parsley and garlic.  Fill slow cooker within 2 inches of  the top with hot water and cook for 6 hours, covered on high heat, stirring occasionally.
Add barley and cook for 2 more hours stirring occasionally or until meat can easily be removed from bones.
Remove and discard onion, bouquets garnis, celery, and parsley.
Transfer bones to a dish and remove meat from bones, being careful not to take off cartilage or gristle. Place meat back into soup, stir, and serve.

Description: 
We are remodeling the kitchen and getting very hungry for food again so I got out the slow cooker and made this soup.  It's perfect when you do not have a lot of time.  Since you can get soup bones that contain little fat, this soup is nearly fat-free.  When the soup is cooled there is no visible fat at the surface.
