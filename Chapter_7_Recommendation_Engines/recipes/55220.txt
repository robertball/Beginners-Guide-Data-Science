Ingredients:
2 1/4 pounds fresh lingonberries
7/8 cup water
1 cup white sugar

Directions:
Place lingonberries in a large pot with the water and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 to 10 minutes, and skim off any foam from the surface. Stir in sugar, bring to a rapid boil, and continue boiling for a few more minutes.
Ladle jam into sterile jars, leaving 1/4 inch of headspace. Cover with lids, and screw on rings. Process in a hot water bath for 10 minutes to seal. Refrigerate jam once the jar has been opened.

A sweet but still tart jam with Swedish lingonberries. This goes really well with classic Swedish meatballs or fried herring (Swedish style).
