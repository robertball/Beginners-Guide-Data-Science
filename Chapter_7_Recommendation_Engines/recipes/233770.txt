Description: 
I like meatloaf and have been working on this recipe for some time; I think I've got it pretty close. This is not a simple, easy, and inexpensive meatloaf like many are, but it sure is tasty. Be careful, my times are based on glass bread pans; don't overcook the meat if you are using tin.
