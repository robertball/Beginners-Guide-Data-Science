Ingredients:
3 pounds beef heel muscle, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
2 beefsteak tomatoes, sliced
4 carrots, sliced
1 onion, sliced
4 slices fresh ginger, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons beef seasoning
3 cups water
1 cup soy sauce
1 cup beef broth
1 cup ketchup
1 cup Chinese rice wine
28 ounces raw ramen noodles
1 cup cold water
1/2 head Chinese white cabbage, or to taste, cut into chunks
1/2 cup diced garlic
1/2 cup sliced scallions

Directions:
Place beef cubes in a large pot of cold water; bring to a boil. Drain and pat dry.
Arrange beefsteak tomatoes, carrots, onion, and fresh ginger in the bottom of a slow cooker. Lay beef cubes on top. Sprinkle beef seasoning over beef cubes.
Mix 3 cups water, soy sauce, beef broth, ketchup, and rice wine together in a bowl. Pour into the slow cooker.
Cook on High until beef is tender, 2 to 3 hours.
Bring 2 quarts water to a boil in a large pot. Add ramen noodles; cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 cup cold water; bring back to a boil. Transfer noodles to a large bowl with a slotted spoon. Cook cabbage in the boiling water until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain.
Stir beef mixture and cabbage into the bowl of noodles. Garnish with garlic and scallions.

Description: 
Beef stew cooked with onions, carrots, and tomatoes in a slow cooker, paired with ramen and veggies. This is my mom's recipe for the famous Taiwanese beef noodle soup. I don't eat beef noodles anywhere else because I can't find anything like this anywhere!
