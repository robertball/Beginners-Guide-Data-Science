Ingredients:
2 cups seedless red grapes, halved
1/3 cup stuffed Manzanilla olives
1 small onions, sliced thin
2 tablespoons thinly sliced celery
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 (8 ounce) tuna steaks
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix grapes, olives, shallot, and olive oil together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper.
Brush lemon juice over tuna steaks.
Cook tuna on preheated grill until the flesh flakes easily with a fork but still is pink in the center for medium, 4 to 6 minutes per side.

Description: 
The olives reflect nicely the saltiness of capers without being overpowering, while the celery added the freshness of parsley with a subtle crunch. The small onion and celery work because I use a slicer to make them paper-thin.
