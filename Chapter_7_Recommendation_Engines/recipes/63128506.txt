Ingredients:
1 box Betty Crocker Angel Food Cake Mix
1 can crushed pineapple (it matters not if it is sweetened or unsweetened)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and butter and flour a 9" x 13" baking dish.
Stir together in a large bowl the cake mix and the pineapple as you would brownies, just until all ingredients are moistened.  Pour in the prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes until the cake tests done.  Cut cooled cake into squares and serve as is or with berries, fruit, ice cream, or anything else you heart desires.

Description: 
The directions Betty gave are that you MUST use Betty Crocker Angel Food cake mix with this recipe or it does NOT work out so I have always used Betty Crocker Angel food cake mix to make this one.
