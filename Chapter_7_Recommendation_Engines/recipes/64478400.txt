Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
3 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough, separated and cut into quarters
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Mix white sugar and cinnamon together in a gallon-size resealable bag; add biscuits and toss to coat. Press coated biscuits into muffin cups, about 2/3 full. Add pecan pieces on top.
Heat brown sugar and margarine together in a saucepan over medium-low heat until melted, 3 to 5 minutes; pour over each biscuit muffin.
Bake in the preheated oven until dough is cooked through, about 20 minutes.
