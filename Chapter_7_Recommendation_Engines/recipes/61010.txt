Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked rigatoni pasta
1/4 cup butter
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/2 cup cubed sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup cubed Gouda cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup blue cheese dressing
1/2 cup milk
paprika to taste
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil, and cook the rigatoni pasta 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente. Drain, and return pasta to the pot.
In the pot with the pasta, mix the butter, garlic, Cheddar cheese, Gouda cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Cook and stir over low heat. Be careful not to have too much heat, as the cheese will get stringy. Gradually mix in the blue cheese dressing and milk. Continue to cook and stir until the pasta is well coated. Season with paprika, salt, and pepper.

Description: 
A very rich, creamy, and zesty cheese and pasta recipe. Not for the dieters out there! The salad dressing adds a very nice creaminess and a little 'bite'!
