Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages reduced-fat cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
1 (15 ounce) can pure pumpkin (such as Libby'sÂ®)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped pecans, divided
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust
1/2 cup whipped topping, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Beat cream cheese and sugar together in a large bowl until creamy and smooth. Mix pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and vanilla extract into cream cheese mixture, scraping down the sides of the bowl, until mixture is smooth.
Fold 1/3 cup pecans into the pumpkin mixture; spread into the graham cracker crust. Sprinkle remaining pecans over pumpkin mixture. Cover pie with plastic wrap.
Refrigerate until set, 4 hours.
Cut pie into 8 slices and top each slice with about 1 tablespoon whipped topping.

Description: 
Trying to come up with a pumpkin cheese ball, didn't work out into my favor but came out with a wonderful pie instead. With cream cheese, pumpkin, pecans, and spices mixed in, it is pure taste-bud heaven served in a graham cracker crust. Such a wonderful turn-out on a mistake.
