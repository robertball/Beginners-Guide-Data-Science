Ingredients:
6 red potatoes, cubed
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon chili powder

2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and spread on a baking sheet.
In a small bowl, or cup, combine paprika, cayenne, chili powder, onion salt, garlic powder and parsley.
Drizzle potatoes with oil and sprinkle with spice mixture.
Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until crisp, turning every 10 minutes.
