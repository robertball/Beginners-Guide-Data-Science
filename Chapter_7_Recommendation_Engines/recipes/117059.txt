Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh broccoli spears, cut into 1/4 inch slices
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups small curd 1% cottage cheese
2 egg whites
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning

Directions:
In a large saucepan, bring 8 cups water to a boil. Add broccoli and salt; cover and boil for 5 minutes. Drain and pat dry. In a blender, combine the cottage cheese, egg whites, Parmesan cheese, flour and Italian seasoning; cover and process until smooth.
Place half of the broccoli in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray; top with half of the cottage cheese mixture. Repeat layers. Spoon spaghetti sauce over the top; sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until bubbly. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
