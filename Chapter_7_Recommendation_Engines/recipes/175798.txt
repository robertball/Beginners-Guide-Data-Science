Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 large yellow onion, sliced thin
6 slices bacon, diced
1 tablespoon brown sugar
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1 cup spicy barbeque sauce
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet.  Add onion; cook and stir onions until softened about 5 minutes.  Stir in bacon pieces and brown sugar, and cook until bacon pieces are crisp.  Remove from skillet.
Spread 1/4 cup barbecue sauce on one tortilla. Sprinkle with 1/4 of the bacon and onion mixture, 1 tablespoon cilantro, and 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese. Top with a tortilla.
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet.  Place the uncooked quesadilla in the skillet. Cook on one side until browned and crisp, about 3 minutes.  Flip, and cook on the other side until the cheese is completely melted, about 2 minutes more.  Remove to a paper towel lined plate to cool.  Repeat with remaining six tortillas.  Slice into quarters using a sharp knife or kitchen scissors when cool enough to handle.
