Ingredients:
1 medium broccoli crown
1 ripe Hass avocado
1/4 tsp Lawry's seasoned salt
1/4 tsp dried oregano, crushed
1/8 tsp chili powder
1/8 tsp garlic powder
pinch of cayenne pepper powder (or to taste)
pinch of cumin

Directions:
Remove very bottom of broccoli stem and discard.
Chop florets and as much of the stem as you want.  You do not want the broccoli pulverized.  It works well to shave the tops off with a knife, and then mince the stem.
In a bowl mash the avocado until smooth.  Add all seasonings in with smooth avocado and mix to combine.
Using your hands (or a fork), incorporate the seasoned avocado spread into the broccoli.

Submitter: 
Toasted Garlic
Description: 
Very healthy, very flavorful.  Easy to make -- no cooking involved!  Addictive, because it can be eaten as is, or with pitas, crackers, or chips; on a piece of toast; or, even as a spread to top a steak or chicken breast.  It would make a delicious, oil-free dressing for salads.  It might even be a good butter/sour cream substitute for a baked potato.  Point is this: it is one of the most versatile recipes I have ever created, and as far as I can tell, its usefulness in meal planning is limitless.  It is good for you, but it doesn't taste like it!
