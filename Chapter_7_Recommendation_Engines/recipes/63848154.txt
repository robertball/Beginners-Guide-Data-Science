Ingredients:
5 pounds pork butt, cut into half-inch pieces
1 pound sweet Italian sausage
1 piece of fat back, cut into quarter-inch pieces
6 pigs
3 pieces of pork skin
15 cloves fresh garlic
8 to 10 cans San Marzano tomatoes
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Fresh basil, kosher salt and crushed black pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Add a quarter cup of extra-virgin olive oil to a pot or Dutch oven. Tip: If you get your pan extremely hot and then add the cold oil, your food will never stick.
2. When the oil is hot (not smoking) add the pork butt pieces and let them begin to brown. Season them with kosher salt, crushed black pepper and granulated garlic. Brown on all sides, which takes about 10 minutes.
3. Remove the pork butt and repeat the same steps with the sausage and pigs' feet. Add the pork skin.
4. After the pork skin has browned, remove it from the pan, then add the fat back pieces to the pan and brown them as well. Add 15 cloves of smashed garlic. Let the garlic brown.
5. Put the tomatoes in a clean bowl and crush by hand. Then add the tomatoes to the fat back and garlic and bring the sauce to a rapid boil. Season with kosher salt and crushed black pepper and lower the heat to a slow simmer.
6. Add all of the cooked meat and simmer for about 2 hours (not all day). Serve over rigatoni.
