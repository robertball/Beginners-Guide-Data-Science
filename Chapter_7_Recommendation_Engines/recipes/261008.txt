Ingredients:
4 cups Almond Breeze Unsweetened Original OR any Almond Breeze Almond-Cashew Blend
6 ears fresh corn
1 russet potato, peeled and chopped
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
6 slices bacon
Basil leaves for garnish

Directions:
Shuck the corn. Break each ear in half. Standing each one vertically on a cutting board, use a serrated knife to cut off the kernels. Save the cobs.
In a pot, combine the corn, cobs, potato, almond milk, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and some freshly ground pepper. Simmer until the potatoes are soft (there's a big range for exactly how long this will be - once the pot is boiling, figure somewhere around 10 minutes and taste 'em as you go.) Remove and discard the corn cobs. Transfer the soup to a blender and puree. Strain back into the pot. Taste for salt, adding more if needed.
While the soup is simmering, cook the bacon until crispy in a hot frying pan or a 400 degrees F oven. Cut each slice in half. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish each with 3 half slices of bacon and basil leaves.

Submitter: 
Almond Breeze
Description: 
Warm up with a soup so creamy no one will believe it's dairy-free. For extra creaminess use any Almond Breeze Almond-Cashew Blend instead of Almond Breeze Unsweetened Original.
