Ingredients:
1 pouch (17.5 oz) Betty Crocker™ chocolate chip cookie mix
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour
1 egg
36 OREO™ mini chocolate sandwich cookies (from 8-oz bag)
1  1/2 cups of semi sweet milk chocolate morsels
1/3 cup white vanilla baking chips
1 teaspoon shortening

Directions:
1. Heat oven to 375°F. In large bowl, stir cookie mix, softened butter, flour and egg until soft dough forms. Shape into 36 (1 1/4-inch) balls; place in 36 ungreased mini muffin cups. Press 1 OREO™ mini in center of each cookie.
2. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Cool in pan 10 minutes. Carefully run small knife around outside edge of cookie to loosen; remove to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Place cooling rack of cookies over cookie sheet or waxed paper. Turn cookies over so bottom side is up and OREO™ mini side is down.
3 .In small microwavable bowl, microwave semi sweet morsels on High 30 to 60 seconds or until thin enough to pour. Pour slightly less than 1 tablespoon warmed frosting over each cookie to completely cover, using spoon to help spread if needed. Rewarm morsels  in microwave to maintain pouring consistency, if needed.
4. In another small microwavable bowl, microwave white vanilla baking chips and shortening uncovered on High 30 to 60 seconds or until mixture can be stirred smooth. Drizzle melted white chips over cookies. Let stand about 4 hours or until frosting glaze is set. Store covered in airtight container at room temperature.
