Ingredients:
* 1lb fresh green beans, ends snapped, but kept long
* one cup of grape tomatoes
* 3 TBSP extra virgin olive oil
* 3 TBSP red wine vinegar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/8 tsp pepper
* 1 TBSP salt
* 6 cups water

Directions:
Boil water and 2 TBSP salt, add green beans, cook til done, but still good and firm (eat one to test, but it's approximately 4-6 minutes, I think)
Cut tomatoes all in halves
Drain water from green beans, run very cold tap water and ICE to green beans for a quick chill.
In a small mixing bowl, add oil, start whisking briskly, slowly add vinegar. (you should see it turn almost creamy, and thicker in texture)
Stir in salt and pepper
In a medium sized bowl, add chilled green beans and tomatoes
Drizzle oil mixture over and toss to evenly coat. (For tastier results, let marinate for an hour or two in the fridge)
