Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 pound artichoke- and spinach-flavored ground sausage
3/4 cup crushed buttery round crackers
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup soy milk
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 cup ketchup
1/2 cup packed sucralose and brown sugar blend (such as SplendaÂ® Brown Sugar)
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 20 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Mix ground turkey, ground sausage, crackers, eggs, soy milk, onion, 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, Italian seasoning, and garlic salt together in a bowl. Fill each muffin cup 3/4-full with turkey mixture.
Combine ketchup, brown sugar blend, and 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl until smooth; spoon over each muffin cup; top with Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are cooked through, 45 to 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
These individual meat loaves are topped with a sweet and tangy sauce. The sausage in this recipe yields a more complex flavor than your standard meat loaf. Garnish meatballs with some Parmesan cheese and seasoning to taste before baking.
