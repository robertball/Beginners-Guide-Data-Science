Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups very finely chopped Fisher® Chef's Naturals® Walnuts
6 tablespoons sugar
6 tablespoons LAND O LAKES® Butter, melted
1 roll (16.5 oz) Pillsbury® refrigerated sugar cookies
1 tablespoon instant espresso coffee granules
1 1/2 cups dark chocolate chips
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons whipping cream

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°F. In medium bowl, stir walnuts, sugar and butter until moistened. Press mixture evenly on bottom of ungreased 13x9-inch pan or 12x8-inch (2-quart) glass baking dish. Bake 8 to 15 minutes or until edges are just golden brown. Cool 30 minutes.

Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 30 minutes.
In medium microwavable bowl, microwave chocolate chips and whipping cream uncovered on High 1 minute, stirring after 30 seconds; stir until chips are melted and mixture is smooth. Spread chocolate mixture over bars. Refrigerate 1 hour. For bars, cut into 6 rows by 4 rows. Cover and refrigerate any remaining bars.
