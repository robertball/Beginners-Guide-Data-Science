Ingredients:
2/3 cup sugar
2/3 cup butter, unsalted
2 eggs
1/3 cup greek yogurt
1 cup 100% whole wheat white flour
2 cups all purpose flour
3 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp vanilla
1-2 vanilla beans split lengthwise
orange zest, from 1 orange

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the sugar and butter on medium-high speed until smooth, 1-2 minutes.
Beat in the eggs (one at a time, the vanilla extract, seeds scraped from the vanilla bean, orange zest, and Greek yogurt until blended.
Mix in the flour, baking powder, and salt on low speed just until incorporated.
Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate until chilled and firm, at least 1-2 hours.
When you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350° F.  Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silpat.  Roll the dough out on a well-floured work surface to about ¼-inch thickness.  Cut with cookie cutters as desired and transfer to the prepared baking sheets.
Bake 7-9 minutes, rotating the sheets 180 degrees on the rack halfway through baking, until fully cooked but not at all browned.  Allow to cool on the baking sheet 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.  Decorate as desired.
