Ingredients:
1 loaf white bread, torn

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Push torn pieces of bread through the shredding disk of a food processor to make coarse crumbs. Spread the crumbs on a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until crumbs are dry but not toasted, 6 to 8 minutes. Shake the sheet twice during baking in order to evenly dry crumbs. Remove from the oven and cool completely.

Description: 
Any white bread will do for making panko. An Asian chef  swore that the best homemade panko came from Wonder Bread. The yield will vary according to how large you make your crumbs. Once cooled, crumbs may be stored in the freezer, in a resealable plastic bag for as long as several months.
