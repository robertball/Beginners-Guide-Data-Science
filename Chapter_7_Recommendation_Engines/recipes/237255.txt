Ingredients:
8 cups orange blossom honey
5 cups water
2 cups white wine vinegar
12 large sprigs fresh mint

Directions:
Stir honey and water together in a pot; bring to a boil and stir constantly until honey dissolves. Add vinegar, reduce heat to low, and simmer until syrup flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat.
Submerge mint in hot syrup and cool to room temperature. Remove and discard mint. Chill in the refrigerator.

Submitter: 
Desert Damsel
Description: 
A traditional Iranian beverage, wonderfully refreshing on a hot summer day. Great for outdoor events since you can make it weeks ahead of time and dilute at time of serving. Mix 4 to 5 tablespoons of this syrup with ice water and garnish with mint to serve.
