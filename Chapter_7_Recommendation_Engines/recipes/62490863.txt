Ingredients:
1/2 cup melted butter
2/3 cup honey (or sugar)
2 eggs
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp baking powder
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup flour (100% whole wheat)
1 cup yellow corn meal
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
Place a 10" cast iron skillet on the middle rack of the oven and preheat to 425.
In a medium bowl, mix butter, sugar, eggs, honey (if using) & buttermilk.
In a separate bowl whisk together flour, sugar (if using) cornmeal, salt, baking powder and baking soda.  Fold flour mixture into wet ingredients until just combined. Melt 1 Tbsp of butter in the warm skillet then pour batter into the buttered skillet and return to middle rack to cook for 20-25 minutes until edges are brown and a toothpick comes out clean.
If a cast iron skillet is not available, grease an 8x8 or 9x9 pan (do not preheat) and cook on middle rack for 20-25 minutes as well. If you double the recipe pour into a 9x13 cake pan and cook for 35 to 40 minutes.
