Ingredients:
2 cups water
3/4 cups long grain rice
1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
1 cinnamon stick, broken into pieces
400 ml full fat coconut milk
140 ml coconut cream
1/2 cup brown rice syrup
2 tbsp dark rum (optional)

Directions:
Put the coconut milk and coconut cream in the refrigerator.
Add the rice and water in a blender. Blend until the rice is ground to a course grind. Pulse until the rice is ground fine. Put the mixture into a jar or bowl. Add the split vanilla bean and cinnamon stick pieces. Cover the mixture and refrigerate eight hours or overnight.
After the rice mixture has set in the refrigerator, strain the mixture through cheesecloth. Scrape the vanilla bean and add the paste to the rice milk. Discard the remaining rice pulp.
Blend the rice milk, coconut milk, coconut cream, and rice syrup (and rum, if using) until well combined. Add to an ice cream maker and prepare the ice cream according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
You may need to freeze the mixture a couple of hours before serving.
Footnotes - If you can’t find brown rice syrup, use coconut syrup.

Description: 
Flavorful rice milk is mixed with coconut milk and coconut cream then churned to give your a frozen version of the Mexican drink horchata. An optional splash of dark rum adds a slight kick. This makes approximately one liter of frozen dessert.
