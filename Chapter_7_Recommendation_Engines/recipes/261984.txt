Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
10 jalapeno peppers, halved and seeded
1 (12 ounce) package turkey bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine cream cheese and Cheddar cheese in a bowl and mix well. Spoon mixture into the center of the jalapeno halves and spread out.
Cut bacon slices in half crosswise and wrap 1 bacon strip around the center of each jalapeno half. Place jalapeno poppers on a non-stick baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is cooked and jalapenos are a little tender, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
These are a constant request from my friends for dinner get-togethers! Simple to make and to prepare, and they turn out extremely delicious! The amount of the ingredients will depend on how many you want to make - remember you will be halving the jalapenos.
