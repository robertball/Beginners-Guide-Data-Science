Ingredients:
20 cups popped popcorn
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
2 teaspoons paprika
2 teaspoons lemon pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the popped popcorn in a large roasting pan.
In a small bowl, stir together the melted butter, paprika, lemon pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. Pour over the popcorn and stir until it is somewhat evenly coated.
Bake for 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely. Serve immediately, or store in an airtight container for later.
