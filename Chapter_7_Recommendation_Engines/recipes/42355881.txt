Description: 
I always make this sandwich after the holidays when I can get get ham right off the bone. Any other time of the year, I get thick cuts from my local deli. This is my daughter's favorite sandwich and I usually reserve it for special occasions. Please note, this is a heavy sandwich. If you don't like sourdough bread, substitute one that can take the weight. Enjoy :)
