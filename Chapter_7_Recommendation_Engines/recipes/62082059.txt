Ingredients:
3/4 stick of  butter (6 TBS), softened
1  cup granulated sugar
2  teaspoons baking powder
1  teaspoon salt
2   eggs
1  teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 teaspoons Instant coffee grinds
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Line an extra-large cookie sheet or 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.
In a large mixing bowl beat butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds.
Add granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt; beat until combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally.
Beat in eggs, vanilla, and coffee until combined.
Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. Using a wooden spoon, stir in any remaining flour along with pecans and chocolate chips.
On a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 2 equal portions. Shape each portion into loaves about 2-1/2 inches wide. Place at least 3 inches apart on prepared cookie sheet(s).
Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 30 minutes. Allow loaves to cool before transferring to a cutting board.
Cut each loaf diagonally into 1/2-inch slices.
Place slices cut sides down on the same parchment-lined cookie sheets. Bake in a 325 degree F oven for an additional 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; cool.
