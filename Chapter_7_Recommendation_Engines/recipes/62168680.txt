Ingredients:
2 cans (15 oz) of chickpeas (also know as garbanzo beans)
1 package of taco seasoning mix (I prefer the taste of Taco Bell brand)
8 Taco shells or soft flour tortillas
Toppings (shredded cheddar cheese, shredded lettuce, salsa, sour cream)

Directions:
Drain and rinse chickpeas
Add chickpeas to a medium saucepan
Add 3/4 cup of water to the chickpeas
Add taco seasoning mix and stir
Heat mixture over medium heat while stirring
Once thoroughly heated, remove from heat
Mash/crush mixture (I use a stick blender)until all chickpeas are crushed but not too smooth
Use this mixture as you would taco meat in taco shells / tortillas
Add desired toppings and enjoy!
