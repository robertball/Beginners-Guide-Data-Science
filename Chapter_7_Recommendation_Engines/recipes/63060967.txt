Ingredients:
4 plum tomatoes, halved lengthwise
3 ounces shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese (1/2 cup)
1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh basil leaves
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 garlic clove, minced
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat oven to 400° F. Scoop out the inside of each tomato half with a melon baller and roughly chop the scooped pulp. Combine tomato pulp, mozzarella, basil, Parmesan, garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
Place tomatoes, cut side up, on a baking sheet. Spoon in tomato mixture and bake until cheese is melted and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Serve warm.
