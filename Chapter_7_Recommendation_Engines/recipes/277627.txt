Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 cups seasoned bread crumbs
4 cups cold mashed potatoes
4 cups vegetable oil for frying
For Sauce:
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Beat eggs lightly in a small bowl; set aside. Pour bread crumbs onto a plate.
Roll cold mashed potatoes into 1-inch balls. Coat in eggs and roll in bread crumbs.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry fritters in the hot oil until golden brown, about 30 seconds, working in batches as needed. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
Mix cream, lemon juice, garlic, dill, salt, and pepper together in a bowl for sauce. Serve with fritters.

Description: 
This is an easy way to repurpose leftover mashed potatoes. You can add cheese or bacon for a new twist. My family absolutely loves these, especially the kids!
