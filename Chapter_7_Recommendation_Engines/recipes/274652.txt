Ingredients:
1 ½ cups soy sauce
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons molasses
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons honey
1 dash garlic salt
20  whole chicken wings, split

Directions:
Mix soy sauce, garlic, molasses, brown sugar, honey, and garlic salt together in a large bowl. Pour 3/4 of the marinade mixture into a resealable freezer bag and add wings. Release any air from the bag and seal. Place marinating chicken wings and remaining marinade into the refrigerator and chill for 5 to 6 hours.
Remove wings from the refrigerator 1 hour before baking.
Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and top with an oiled rack about 1/2-inch above the surface of the foil.
Space marinated wings on the rack about 1/2-inch apart.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Baste wings with some of the remaining marinade; repeat baking and basting every 20 minutes 2 more times for a total of 1 hour. Turn wings over, baste, and bake 30 minutes more. Turn wings over again, sprinkle with garlic salt, and increase oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking 15 minutes more.
