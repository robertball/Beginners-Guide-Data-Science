Ingredients:
4 Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts cut into strips
1/4 cup Flour
1 teaspoon Garlic
1 teaspoon Cayenne Pepper
1/2 teaspoon Salt
1 cup Panko Japanesse Bread Crumbs
1 Egg
1 tablespoon Hot Sauce
Hot Sauce & Butter 2:1 Ratio

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Coat baking sheet with nonstick spray.
In a bag, mix flour, 1/2 TEA garlic powder, 1/2 TEA cayenne pepper, and 1/4 TEA salt. On a plate mix the panko with the rest of the garlic, cayenne, and salt.
Shake the chicken strips with the seasoned flour. Beat egg with 1 TBL hot sauce and place egg mixture in shallow dish. Dip seasoned chicken strips in egg mixture, then rollin the seasoned panko mixture. Place on baking sheet.
Bake for 6 minutes and flip. Bake for 4 minutes then coat chicken in hot sauce/butter mixture. Bake for an additional 6 minutes. You can coat chicken one more time in hot sauce/butter mixture and serve.
I like Frank's RedHot Sauce.  Note: Frank's RedHot Wing Sauce already has the butter in it.
