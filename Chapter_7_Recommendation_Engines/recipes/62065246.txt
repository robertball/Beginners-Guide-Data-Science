Golden Yam Brownies Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla
4 eggs
1 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
2 cups yams or sweet potatoes, peeled and FINELY grated
GLAZE:
1 cup powdered sugar
2 Tb butter or margarine
2 Tb milk

Directions:
Cream the butter and sugars together.  Beat in vanilla and eggs, one at a time.  Combine flour, baking powder and salt, and add.  Beat in grated yams or sweet potatoes (batter may look curdled, but that's okay).  Spread batter in sprayed or greased 9x13 inch baking pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.  Combine glaze ingredients and spread over the hot brownies - the cake will absorb the glaze.  Serve warm or at room temperature (Note:  I doubled the recipe for the cake and glaze for a 12x18" sheet pan).
