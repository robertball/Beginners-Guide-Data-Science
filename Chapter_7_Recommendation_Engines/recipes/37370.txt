Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 1/2 cups butter, softened and divided
1 (16 ounce) package light brown sugar
3/4 cup sugar, divided
4 eggs
2/3 cup milk
1/4 cup dark rum
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons light rum
2 tablespoons water
Sweetened whipped cream (optional)

Directions:
GREASE and flour 2 (6-cup) Bundt pans or 2 (9- x 5-inch) loaf pans, and sprinkle evenly with pecans.
BEAT 11/4 cups butter at medium speed with an electric mixer about 2 minutes or until creamy.  Gradually add brown sugar and 1/4 cup sugar, beating 5 to 7 minutes.  Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating just until yellow disappears.
COMBINE milk, dark rum, and vanilla.
COMBINE flour, baking powder, and salt; add to butter mixture alternately with milk mixture, beginning and ending with flour mixture.  Beat at low speed just until blended after each addition.  Pour batter evenly into prepared pans.
BAKE at 325 degrees F for 50 to 55 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool in pans on wire racks 15 minutes; remove from pans.
BRING remaining 1/2 cup sugar, remaining 1/4 cup butter, light rum, and 2 tablespoons water to a boil in a saucepan, and boil, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes.  Drizzle over warm cakes, and cool completely on wire racks.
