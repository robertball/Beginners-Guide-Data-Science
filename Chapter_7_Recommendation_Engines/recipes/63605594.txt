Ingredients:
4 Cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 tbs sugar
1 package (2 1/4 tsp) active dry or fast rising yeast
1 3/4 cups warm water (105-115 degrees F)
2 tsp table salt
2/3 cup olive oil
2 1/2 tbsp of kosher or sea salt for sprinkling

Directions:
In a large bowl dissolve the yeast by combining  the yeast, the sugar and warm water about 10-15 minutes. Place in a warm (not hot or cool) place until the yeast is bubbling and aromatic.  Should be a nice creamy look.
Mix in/stir in the flour, salt, 1/3 cup olive oil to the yeast mixture.
**** If mixing by hand ****
Keep a bowl of lukewarm water on hand. Use a large wet spoon or one hand mix the ingredients. Repeatedly dip the spoon or your hand in the water to keep the dough from sticking. Rotate the bowl with you free hand while stirring until a shaggy dough forms.
Once dough has come together, let it rest for 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to a clean, lightly floured surface. Continue to knead it by hand letting it rest every 2-3 minutes until it becomes smooth,soft and elastic. Give a sprinkle of flour if the dough is really sticky and tacky.
Coat the inside of the bowl with half (1/3 cups) of the olive oil and return the dough to the bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap and put it in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size. At least 45 min.
Coat your baking pan with the remaining 1/3 cup of olive oil.
Punch the dough down / Knead it for another 2-3 minutes.
Put the dough onto the pan and begin pressing it out to fit the size of the pan.  Turn the dough over to coat the other side with olive oil. Continue to stretch the dough to fit the pan. Use your fingers or the back end of a kitchen utensil to poke holes all the way through the dough.
Put the dough in a warm place until it haas doubled in size about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 | degrees F
Brush the top of the dough with olive oil.
Bake dough on bottom rack until the top of the loaf is golden brown about 15 - 20 min.
