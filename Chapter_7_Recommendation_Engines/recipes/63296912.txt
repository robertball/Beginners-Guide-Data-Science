Ingredients:
1/3 cup coconut oil (coconut oil is perfect for this recipe, but canola will work if you’re unable to find coconut oil)
¾ cup honey
1 egg
1 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup grated zucchini
½ cup Greek Yogurt, plain, low fat
1-1/2 cups White Whole Wheat flour
¼ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoons cinnamon
1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. NOTE: The fats in this recipe are primarily from heart healthy Omega 3's in the nuts. To reduce the saturated fat to 2 grams per slice, simply leave out the nuts. In a large mixing bowl, cream coconut oil and honey. Add egg, grated zucchini, yogurt, vanilla and cinnamon, mix on low until combined. Combine in a small bowl, salt, soda and flour. Add flour mixture to batter and mix on medium speed just until combined. Stir in nuts. Spray a standard size loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray. Pour batter into loaf pan. Bake 50-55 minutes or until a fork inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean. Allow to cool 15 minutes in pan before removing and cooling completely on a wire rack. Cut into slices.
