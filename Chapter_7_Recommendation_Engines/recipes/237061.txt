Ingredients:
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
3 tablespoons olive oil, or more to taste
24 large spear (7-1/4" to 8-1/2" long)s large asparagus spears
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
4 ounces pastrami, sliced into thin strips

Directions:

Chef John
Description: 
When you shave asparagus thin with a peeler and give it a quick curing/pickling in the mustard dressing, the harsh attributes mellow out substantially, and the sweet, grassy flavor comes through. In fact, it was so delicious that I contemplated serving it without the fried meat. Happily, that passed.
