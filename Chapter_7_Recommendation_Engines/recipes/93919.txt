Description: 
Jalapenos stuffed with marinated shrimp are wrapped in bacon and grilled.  My husband got this recipe from a friend. We were all dubious about my husband attempting any sort of cooking but this recipe is delicious and super easy. Perfect for a night where you want to whip something up quick and great served on a bed of yellow rice.
