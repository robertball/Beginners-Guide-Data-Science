Ingredients:
1 Cup Peanut Butter
1/2 Cup Sugar
1/2 Teaspoon Baking Soda
1 Large Egg, beaten
1 Teaspoon Vanilla

Directions:
Beat the egg in a mixing bowl. Add and mix the sugar, vanilla, baking soda and peanut butter in with the egg.
Make sure to mix well.
Spoon out 1 tablespoon each onto an ungreased cookie sheet. You can make a cross hatch with a fork on each cookie if you wish, but it's not necessary.
Bake at 350 degrees on the top rack for 10 minutes.
Note: Let the cookies cool for a few minutes prior to removing them from the cookie sheet, as they will be very soft.
