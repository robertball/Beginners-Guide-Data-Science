Ingredients:
2 c. almond flour
2 c. cheddar cheese
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. dried thyme
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
6 Tbl. cold water

Directions:
Mix almond flour, cheddar, baking soda, thyme, and cayenne pepper. Add the cold water and mix to form into a flat dough. Cover and refrigerate for 1/2 hour.
Place teaspoon size balls on a cookie sheet and flatten down into crackers about 1/8" thick and at least 3/4" away from the next cracker. Bake at 300 for about 1/2 hour or until edges start to brown. Turn the over down to 210. Take the cookie sheet out of the oven and cool for 5 minutes. Turn crackers over and return to oven for another 1/2 hour. Turn the oven off, leaving the crackers inside until the oven has cooled down. Take out of the oven and let cool completely. Crackers should be still pale. Don't over cook! Store in an airtight container.
