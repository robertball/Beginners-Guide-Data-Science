Ingredients:
A whole roll of Bounty Paper towels
1 gallon ice cream bucket
2 cups water
2 tablespoons baby oil
1 tablespoon rubbing alcohol
1 tablespoon baby bubble bath (optional)

Directions:
Cut the roll of Bounty paper towels into two halves
Place one of the halved rolls vertically in an empty and cleaned ice cream bucket. In a large measuring pitcher, mix the water, baby oil, and rubbing alcohol. (And if you chose to do the bubble bath, that too)
Pour the liquid over the halved roll of paper towels in the ice cream bucket, and soak for 30 minutes. Remove the cardboard center. Feed the top corner of the paper towels through and X- shaped slit you've cut in the lid of the ice cream bucket so you can pull out and tear off one "wipe" at a time.
