Description: 
A yummy, custard-like rice pudding that will remind you of home if you grew up in Newfoundland. I was searching for years and upon guidance from my aunt and some tested recipes, I fine-tuned a yummy result! Eat this pudding as is or top with whipped cream, tin of cream, or milk to your liking.
