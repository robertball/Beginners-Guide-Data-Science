Ingredients:
1 boiled chicken, shredded
reserved stock from chicken
1 chopped large onion
1 chopped bell pepper
2 stalks celery, chopped
3 minced garlic cloves
1 large can diced tomatoes
1/2 small can tomatoes and chilies
2 cups andouille sausage, sliced
2 cups okra
3/4 cup frozen corn
1 cup shrimp (optional)
3 Tsp. butter
salt to taste
pepper to taste
1/2 tsp cayenne (adjust for heat)
2 Tsp. file' powder
Rice, cooked

Directions:
In a large pot, boil the chicken in water (or broth) with salt and pepper until done. Remove and shred.
In a skillet, add 3 Tsp. butter to saute the onions, bell pepper and celery until tender. Add garlic for a minute at the end. Add to reserved broth. Add tomatoes, tomatoes and chilies, sausage, okra and corn. Add spices except file' powder. Bring to a gentle boil, reduce heat and cover. Occasionally stir and simmer for 30 minutes.  It should reduce down to half the liquid. If you need to reduce more, remove cover after 15 minutes of simmering. Add chicken and shrimp. You should be able to almost eat this with a fork.
Check okra for doneness and adjust spices. Once it is as hot as you like it, remove from heat, add file' powder and stir. Serve with a scoop of rice.

Description: 
Gumbo has a history of the base being roux but Mom's recipe didn't have it. Now it is my most requested item at work, tailgating parties and at home. The vegetables really shine in this gumbo!
