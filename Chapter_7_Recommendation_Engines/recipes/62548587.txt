Ingredients:
4 medium sized Yukon Gold or other waxy potato
4 parsnips
3 cloves of garlic, peeled
2 bay leaves
1 tsp salt, divided
1/2 tsp pepper
2 cups chicken broth
1 tbsp butter
2 tbsp cream
chopped chives or parsley for garnish

Directions:
Peel and chop potatoes and parsnips into pieces of the same size, about 2 inches.
In a medium sized pot, place potatoes, parsnips, the whole cloves of garlic, the bay leaves, and 1/2 of the salt.  Pour chicken broth over top.  Heat to simmering, reduce heat, and cook, covered for about 10-15 minutes or until veg are tender but not water-logged.
Drain over a bowl, reserving cooking liquid and return to pot.  Remove bay leaves, but leave the garlic cloves in the potato mixture.
Add the butter and cream, and puree with an immersion (hand-held) blender, adding a bit of the chicken broth as needed until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper, garnish with chives or parsley, and enjoy!
