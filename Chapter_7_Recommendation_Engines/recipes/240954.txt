Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons dried basil
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 pounds chicken thighs
1 pound linguine pasta
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place butter into a 9x13-inch baking dish and set in oven while it preheats until butter is melted, about 5 minutes.
Stir onion, basil, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into melted butter. Add chicken, turning to coat with onion mixture and ending skin-side up.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Mix spinach into onion-butter sauce until thoroughly mixed; add linguine and Parmesan cheese, tossing to combine. Place chicken on top of pasta.
