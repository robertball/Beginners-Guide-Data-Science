Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package orecchiette pasta
1 (10 ounce) package fresh spinach
12 ounces sweet Italian turkey sausage, casings removed
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1 large egg
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup grated ricotta salata cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in orecchiette and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Place spinach in a large colander. Scoop out 1 cup pasta cooking water and reserve. Drain pasta in the colander, wilting the spinach.
Roll turkey sausage meat into 20 to 30 balls.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until browned and no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Pour off any drippings left in the skillet. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Stir in garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add cooked pasta, spinach, and meatballs to the skillet.
Whisk reserved  pasta water and egg together in a small bowl. Stir into the skillet until sauce thickens slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Divide pasta among bowls. Sprinkle with ricotta salata cheese and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.
