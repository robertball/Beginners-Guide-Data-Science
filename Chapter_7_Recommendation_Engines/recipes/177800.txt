Ingredients:
1/2 (17.3 ounce) package Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry Sheets
1/4 cup Dijon-style mustard
1 pound fresh asparagus
2 ounces prosciutto, cut into thin strips
1 cup shredded fontina cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves

Directions:
Thaw the pastry sheet at room temperature for 40 minutes or until it's easy to handle.  Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface.  Roll the pastry sheet into a 10 x 14-inch rectangle.  Place the pastry sheet onto the baking sheet.  Brush the pastry sheet with the mustard. Fold in the edges of the rectangle about 1/4-inch and crimp with a fork to seal.
Arrange the asparagus on the pastry in a single layer. Sprinkle with the prosciutto, fontina and thyme.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the pastry is golden and the asparagus is tender.
