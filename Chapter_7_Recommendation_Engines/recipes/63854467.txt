Ingredients:
3/4 c. finely chopped onion
1 1/2 c. chopped celery with leaves
1 c. margarine or butter
1 c. chicken broth (optional)
9 c. soft bread crumbs
2 t. salt
1 1/2 t. dried sage leaves
1 t. dried thyme leaves
1 t. poultry seasoning
1/2 t. pepper

Directions:
Cut up bread cubes in to about 3/4 inch cubes.  Add bread cubes to large pan or tub for easier mixing.  Mix all spices together and set aside.  Melt butter in saucepan, add onion and celery and cook until tender.  Remove from heat. Sprinkle spices over bread stirring as you go so that the spices are distributed evenly.  Begin pouring butter, onion, and celery mixture over bread.  This is best done by 2 people as you can get it mixed in more evenly. Pour chicken broth evenly over bread mixture.  Warm in 350 degree oven until warmed through and a little bit crispy.  We do not stuff turkey with stuffing as the turkey will cook faster without.  Completely up to you if you would like to.  We usually double this recipe.
