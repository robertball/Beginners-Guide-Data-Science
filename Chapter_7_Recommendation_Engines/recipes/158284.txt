Ingredients:
1 cup dried tart cherries
1/2 cup water
3 ears fresh corn, shucked
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
1/2 cup lemon or lime juice
Salt, to taste

Directions:
Heat cherries and water in a small saucepan. Simmer about 5 minutes, or until cherries have plumped and water is slightly syrupy. Set aside to cool.
Meanwhile, roast each ear of corn directly over gas flame on stovetop or over gas grill (just as you would for a roasted pepper). Turn until each ear is slightly charred all around. Set aside to cool.
Cut corn kernels from cobs.
Combine corn, cherries with liquid, onion, garlic, cilantro, chilies and lemon juice. Season with salt to taste.
