Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
1/2 pound butter
2 cups chopped celery
2 cups chopped onion
1 1/2 (16 ounce) packages saltine crackers, crushed
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 cup cooking sherry
7 cups chicken broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Brown the beef and pork in a large skillet over medium heat; drain and set aside.
Melt the butter in the skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the celery and onion in the melted butter until soft. Stir the meat and crushed crackers into the celery and onion mixture; season with pepper and poultry seasoning. Pour the sherry into the mixture; stir. Add the chicken broth to the mixture one cup at a time, stirring continually until all broth has been incorporated. Transfer the stuffing to the prepared baking dish; cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes; remove the foil and cook until the top has browned, another 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe handed down from my Grandmother. My kids request it each year at the holidays. It is a rich, delicious holiday stuffing. Because this recipe uses saltine crackers, you will not want to add salt.
