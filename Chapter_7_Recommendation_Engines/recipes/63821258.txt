Ingredients:
6 pounds green tomatoes
3 pounds white onions
1 package pickling spice(make sure the spice is in a bag, I use the toe of a pair of clean panty hose)
4 cups white vinegar
7 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper
1/2 cup coarse salt.

Directions:
In a food processer using the slicer, slice the tomatoes and onions on the thin side. Put the sliced tomatoes and  onions in a big bowl and sprinkle with the 1/2 cup of coarse salt and enough water to cover all. Cover bowl with a heavy plate big enough to cover all. Let stand over night on counter. In the morning drain off brine into a colander and rinse tomatoes and onions with cold water. Put them into a big pot add the vinegar, sugar and pickling spice(in a bag). Boil on medium high and stir often  until it changes color. When done put in sterilized mason jars, leaving 1/2 inch space. Leave to cool till  the lids seal. Store in a cool place, they will keep for 1 year or longer.*See Notes*
