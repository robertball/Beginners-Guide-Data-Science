Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups semolina flour
2 pinches salt
6 large eggs
2 tablespoons olive oil
water if needed 1 tsp at a time

Directions:
Put dry ingredients into Kitchen Aid and mix well.  In a separate bowl whisk eggs very gently with a fork, gradually pouring them into the mixer. Knead dough until it is smooth and supple. Dust dough and work surface with semolina as needed to keep dough from becoming sticky. Wrap dough tightly in plastic  or put in a gallon zip lock and allow it to rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.
Roll out dough with a pasta machine or a rolling pin to desired thickness. Cut into your favorite style of noodle or stuff with your favorite filling to make ravioli. Bring water to a boil in a large pot, then add 4 teaspoons salt. Cook pasta until tender but not mushy, 1 to 8 minutes depending on thickness. Drain immediately and toss with your favorite sauce.
