ROLL dough int 4 inch rolls and mold sides like dents where knuckles are to look like "fingers," using 1 Tbsp. dough for each. Place, 2 inches apart, on baking sheets sprayed with cooking spray. Press 1 of the nuts into dough in 1 end of each finger for the fingernail. You can also make toes by rolling 1 inch balls in hand pinching on side and this time add almond to the toenail sideways. Use sharp knife to make 3 crosswise slits in top of each finger and toes for the knuckles.

When cool take red gel icing to make blood at the end of the severed fingers and toes.  Also if any almonds fall off after baking glue bake with the red gel.
