Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) bag fresh cranberries
3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
1 large orange, juiced and zested
9 tablespoons port wine

Directions:
In a large saucepan, combine the cranberries, brown sugar, orange zest and juice, and port wine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the cranberries have popped and the sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes. Cool, and refrigerate overnight before serving.
