Ingredients:
1 cup honey mustard dressing
1 ½ tablespoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 (8 ounce) container mango yogurt
2 tablespoons garam masala
2 teaspoons lemon juice
4 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½  red onion, thinly sliced
½ cup raisins
½ cup blanched slivered almonds
¾ cup drained canned pineapple tidbits
8 cups mixed salad greens
4 sprigs fresh mint
4 wedges lime

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk together honey mustard dressing, ground cumin, and curry powder.  Cover, and refrigerate until serving.
In a baking dish, whisk together yogurt, garam masala, and lemon juice. Place chicken breasts in the dish, and turn to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, turning occasionally.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly brush oil over grill grate. Grill chicken until done, about 6 to 8 minutes per side.
In a small bowl, mix together onion, raisins, almonds, and pineapple.
In a large bowl, toss salad greens with salad dressing and 3/4 of the almond mixture.  Divide salad among 4 plates. Sprinkle equal amounts of reserved almond mixture over each salad. Top each with grilled chicken, and garnish with a mint sprig and a lime wedge.
