Ingredients:
1/2 cup white or cider vinegar
1 1/2 cups water
4 eggs
2 1/2 cups sugar
1 heaping tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 to 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon butter
1 bunch of ripe bananas, sliced (approx 4 cups)
2 cups chopped nuts

Directions:
Whisk eggs until smooth, removing any larger pieces.  Set aside.
Combine water, vinegar and sugar into a medium saucepan.
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Slowly add eggs into vinegar mixture, combining well with whisk. While more time consuming, temper eggs for best results.
In a small bowl, combine cornstarch with 2-3 tbsp water until smooth.
Slowly add the cornstarch mixture to the saucepan, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches the consistency of a thin pudding.
Remove from heat, stir in vanilla and butter.
Layer sauce, sliced bananas and chopped nuts into a medium bowl.  Repeat until all ingredients are used.
Top with chopped nuts.
Chill overnight.
