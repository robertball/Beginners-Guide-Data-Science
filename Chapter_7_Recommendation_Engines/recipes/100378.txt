Ingredients:
1/2 pound Irish bacon, diced
2 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
1 cup chicken stock, or as needed
Salt and black pepper to taste
2 cups thinly sliced dark green Savoy cabbage leaves

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep stockpot or saucepan. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain off any excess fat.
Stir in potatoes, tomatoes, and enough chicken stock to cover. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer for 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.
Stir in cabbage and allow the soup to simmer for a few minutes longer before serving.

Description: 
This is a wonderfully simple chunky soup. I use good quality Irish back bacon but if you can't get this, it tastes equally good made with pancetta. The dark green colour of the cabbage alongside the tomatoes gives the soup a beautiful colour.
