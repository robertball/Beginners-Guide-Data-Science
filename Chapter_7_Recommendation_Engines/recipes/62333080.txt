Ingredients:
6 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered
carrots, and other root veggies
green peas
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives
salt and pepper to taste
1 (4 pound) boneless pork loin roast
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a pot with enough water to cover, boil the potatoes for about 10 minutes. Drain, cool, and place in a bowl. Toss with olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, chives, salt, and pepper.
Rub the pork loin roast with 1 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and onion powder. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Place the roast on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, and cook 50 minutes in the preheated oven. Arrange the potatoes and carrots and other veggies around the roast, increase temp to 380 and continue cooking 50 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove from heat, add green peas, cover with foil, and let sit 15 minutes before slicing.
