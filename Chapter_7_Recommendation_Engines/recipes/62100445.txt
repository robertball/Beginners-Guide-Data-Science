1/2 c. butter, softened
3/4 c. sugar
1/4 c. milk

Preheat oven to 350'F.
Beat cream cheese, butter, and sugar in bowl until light and fluffy. Add milk, eggs, vanilla, and almond extract, and beat until mixed.
In another bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add to cheese mixture and stir until smooth.
Spoon half the batter into a greased and floured 13x9 inch pan. Pour berries evenly over batter. Spoon remaining batter over berries.

Description: 
This melt-in-your-mouth, moist coffee cake has a subtle almond flavor. For a stronger almond flavor, double the almond extract and omit the vanilla. Best served warm, but don't expect leftovers!
