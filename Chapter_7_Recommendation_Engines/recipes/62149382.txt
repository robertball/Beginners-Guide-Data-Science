Title:
Gluten Free Blueberry Pancakes Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 cup gluten free pancake mix
1/4 cup flax seed meal
1 egg (or liquid egg replacer substitute)
1/4 cup of milk (cow, nut, or soy)
1 tbs. honey
1 tbs. canola oil
1/2 cup of applesauce (preferably unsweetened)
1/3 cup of frozen blueberries

Directions:
Beat the egg in a large mixing bowl. Add the remaining ingredients, except for the blueberries, and mix together. If you need more liquid to make a workable batter, add more milk or a bit of water.
Ladle batter onto an oiled skillet. When bubbles form in the center of the cakes and the edges begin to look dry, flip them over and finish cooking.
I serve with either maple syrup or a blueberry sauce.
To make a blueberry sauce, just toss about 3/4 cup of blueberries into a saucepan with a couple of teaspoons of sugar and cook down until the sauce takes on a syrup consistency.

Description: 
I used Arrowhead Mills GF Pancake and Baking Mix, which is why milk is included in the recipe. If you're dairy-intolerant, use a mix like Pamelas, which just requires water.
