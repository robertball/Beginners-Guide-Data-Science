2 tablespoon of vegetable oil
1 small onion chopped

Heat oil in skillet over medium to high heat and cook the patties until they are brown.
Place patties into a big pot and pour over the remaining soup along with the mushrooms.  After it gets to a boil then cover and cook for 35-40 minutes or until they are no longer pink.
To cook in a slow cooker:  Place patties, remaining soup and mushrooms into slow cooker.  Cover and cook on low for about 1-2 hours.  This is great with mashed potatoes.

Description: 
I love to cook this when it is cold outside.  The smell of this reminds me of fall.  My husband begs for me to cook this all of the time.  I usually double the recipe so that he can take the leftovers in his lunch.  You can either cook it on the stove or put it in a slow cooker.
