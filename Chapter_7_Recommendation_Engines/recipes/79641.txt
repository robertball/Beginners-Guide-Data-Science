Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup coarsely chopped soft peppermint candy

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a small bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, stir together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until creamy and smooth. Stir in vanilla; then stir in eggs one at a time, stirring until the mixture is creamy and well incorporated. Gradually stir in the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well between each addition. Stir in the semi-sweet chips, then the bittersweet chips. Mix in the peppermint candy, stirring until evenly distributed. Drop by spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in a preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from oven; allow cookies to cool momentarily on the sheets before removing them to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
A variation on the classic chocolate chip recipe, these cookies have bittersweet chocolate chips and pieces of soft-cut peppermint candy added to them, as well as the traditional semi-sweet. They're quite chocolatey and quite decadent. The peppermint adds an interesting touch.
