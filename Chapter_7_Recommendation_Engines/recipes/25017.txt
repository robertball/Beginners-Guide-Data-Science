Ingredients:
2 cups butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
4 egg yolks
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Beat in the yolks one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Shape dough into logs about 2 inches in diameter. Wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate or freeze until firm.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Unwrap rolls. You can roll the logs in nuts or sprinkles before slicing. Slice into 3/8 inch wide slices. Place slices 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Do not brown. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
