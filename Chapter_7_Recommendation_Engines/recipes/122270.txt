Description: 
I CREATED this recipe and won a red ribbon for it in a 1976 cookbook contest. It's like meat loaf in a bun, so it's very hearty. Sometimes I'll serve it with gravy and without the bun.    When I prepared this for dinner, I always felt my family was well fed. -Bernadine Dirmeyer, Harpster, Ohio
