Description: 
This is NOTHING like canned creamed corn!  My husband is not a fan of corn or creamed dishes, but he thinks this is great.  Easy and quick to prepare  and is an especially delicious side dish for chicken or pork.  Everyone always asks for the recipe.Modified from: Cream Corn Like No Other
