Ingredients:
1 3/4 c. a. p. flour
4 tsp. baking powder
1 1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 tsp. nutmeg
1/4 tsp. cloves
1/4 c. chopped pecans (optional, we never use them)
2 c. canned sweet potatoes (we boil raw potatoes instead, they're healthier)
1/2 c. sugar (honey tastes better)
1/4 c. light brown sugar
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1/2 c. butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Grease a cookie sheet.
In a large bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and pecans. In a small bowl, mash the sweet potatoes with a fork.
Combine the sweet potatoes, honey, brown sugar, and vanilla in a medium bowl. Set aside.
Cut the butter into small pieces and blend into the flour mixture with a pastry blender, using a back-and-forth motion until the mixture resembles small peas.
Add the sweet potato mixture to the flour mixture and stir thoroughly with the wooden spoon.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured cutting board and knead for about 5 minutes until well blended.
Roll the dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the dough with a biscuit cutter. Place on cookie sheet and bake in preheated oven for 12 to 14 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Serve hot or cold.
