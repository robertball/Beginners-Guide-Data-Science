Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter and flour a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Mix cake mix, sour cream, pudding mix, vegetable oil, coffee, and eggs together in a bowl; fold in chocolate chunks. Pour batter into the prepared pan.

Description: 
This is my favorite chocolate cake ever. Given to me by a friend as a 'get well' cake, I've managed to coerce him into giving me the recipe. So good it needs no frosting!
