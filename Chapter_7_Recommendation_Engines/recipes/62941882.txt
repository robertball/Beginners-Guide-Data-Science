Ingredients:
1 bag (30oz) frozen Hashbrowns (thawed)
12-16 oz  ham steak
2-3 cups sharp shredded cheese
1 stick melted butter
1 8oz container sour cream
1 can (10.75) cream of chicken soup
1 med onion (chopped)

Directions:
Chop Ham into bit size peices and mix ALL ingredients together in large bowl. Salt & Pepper to taste.
Grease well a lasagna or large rectangular pan. Pour mixture in pan, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 mins.
During last 15 mins, uncover to brown.
A nice topping for this is some lightly crunched up Ruffles regular Potato Chips. They add a nice crunch factor to the casserole. I use them as a garnish when I serve it so they do not get mushy!!
