Description: 
My mother used to make this recipe for me when I was a kid in Russia. It is good for breakfast with some milk, brown sugar, and raisins. You can also add some other spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. Hulled millet can be found in most health food stores. It is very healthy as it is a whole grain that contains lots of protein.
