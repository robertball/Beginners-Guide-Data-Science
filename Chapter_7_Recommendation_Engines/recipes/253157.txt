Ingredients:
1 tablespoon chipotle hot sauce (such as CholulaÂ®)
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons minced ginger
1 teaspoon agave syrup
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 (8 ounce) package coleslaw mix
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
2 green onions, chopped, or more to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Mix chipotle hot sauce, rice vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, and agave syrup together in a small bowl to make sauce.
Heat olive oil and sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add ground turkey; cook, stirring to break up clumps, until juices run clear, about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl, reserving juices in the wok.
Combine coleslaw mix, red bell pepper, green onions, and garlic in the wok; cook and stir over medium heat until slaw is slightly wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add sauce; mix to combine, about 1 minute. Return turkey to the wok and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
Sprinkle sesame seeds over slaw before serving.
