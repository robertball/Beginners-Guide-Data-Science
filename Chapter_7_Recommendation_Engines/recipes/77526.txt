Ingredients:
2 cups pineapple juice
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons light soy sauce (50% less sodium)
1 1/2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 garlic cloves, crushed
3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
1 1/4 pounds raw firm fish, such as salmon, tuna or halibut, cut in chunks
4 cups fresh pineapple in large chunks (or substitute canned pineapple chunks)
1 large red onion, cut in wedges

Directions:
In a small saucepan, dissolve cornstarch in pineapple juice. Add soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and ginger. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 7 minutes. Let cool. Add fish and pineapple to sauce and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Thread fish, pineapple and onion on skewers. Place on a hot grill (or under a broiler) until fish is done to your liking.
Serve with rice. Heat marinade and use as a sauce over fish and rice.
