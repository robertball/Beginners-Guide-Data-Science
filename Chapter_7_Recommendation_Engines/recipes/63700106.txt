Ingredients:
2 avocados, halved and removed from their skin
1 tablespoon butter
4 ears of corn Grilled and cut off the cob
1/4 teaspoon cumin
2 Green onions, chopped
1 large diced jalapeno
1/2 cup chopped cilantro (Use to taste, we love it and use a lot)
1/4 cup crumbled feta
salt and pepper

Directions:
Soak the corn, still in husk, in water.  Grill corn in the husk for 15-20 minutes.  Remove husk and silk from the corn. Cut the corn from the cob, set aside.
In a bowl melt butter.  Add butter, cumin and a pinch of salt and pepper to corn.  Toss in the scallions, jalapeno, cilantro and feta cheese.  Taste and add more salt and pepper if wanted.
On a very hot grill or grill pan place the avocados on the grill.  (This is easier if the avocados are not too ripe and soft) Let sit undisturbed for a couple of minutes.  Flip the avocados over and grill the other side.  Remove from grill, slice if desired
Serve the corn and avocado halves on a bed of mixed greens.
