Ingredients:
cooking spray
10 slices sourdough bread, cubed
1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, divided
3/4 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as Ocean Spray速 Craisins速)
3 tablespoons butter, melted
4 large eggs
2 cups unsweetened almond milk (such as Blue Diamond速 Almond Breeze速)
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray.
Toss bread pieces with 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice in a bowl. Add dried cranberries; toss well. Pour into the prepared pan. Drizzle with melted butter.
Beat eggs in a bowl until thoroughly mixed. Add remaining 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, almond milk, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Beat until thoroughly mixed. Pour over the bread pieces. Let soak, pressing bread lightly with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top springs back when lightly touched, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
I feel this is the best bread pudding. Very moist. Family and friends just love it and are always asking for the recipe. One piece is never enough, so cut it big! Enjoy. Topped with a drizzle of caramel-flavored sauce on warm bread pudding. Yum.
