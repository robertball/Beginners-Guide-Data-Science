Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups broccoli slaw
1/4 cup skinny blue cheese dressing
1.25 lbs 93% lean ground turkey
2/3 cup grated carrots (grate in food processor)
1/4 cup seasoned whole wheat breadcrumbs
1 clove garlic, grated
1 tbsp red onion, grated
1/4 cup Frank's Red Hot Sauce
salt and fresh pepper
oil spray
5 slices reduced fat cheddar
5 whole wheat burger buns (I used Martin's 100 calorie Potato Whole Wheat Buns)

Directions:
In a medium bowl combine broccoli slaw and skinny blue cheese dressing. Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine ground turkey, carrots, breadcrumbs, garlic, onion, hot sauce, salt and pepper. Makes 5 equal patties, 5.5 oz each.
Heat a large skillet on high heat. When hot, lightly spray the oil. Add burgers to the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low.
Cook on one side until browned 4-5 minutes, then flip. Cook another 4 minutes or until burgers are cooked all the way through (keep heat medium-low to prevent burning); top with cheese and place on a toasted burger buns topped with broccoli slaw.
If grilling, clean grill well before cooking and spray with oil spray to prevent sticking.
