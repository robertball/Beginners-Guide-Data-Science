Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dried navy beans
water to cover
7 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup margarine
4 carrots, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1/2 pound bacon

Directions:
Clean and sort the beans. Place them in a large bowl with water to cover and soak for 3 hours.
In a large pot over medium heat, combine the beans and the chicken stock and allow to simmer.
Meanwhile, melt the butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the carrots and onion and saute for 10 minutes, or until onion is caramelized. Add this mixture to the pot.
In the same skillet over medium high heat, saute the bacon for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it is crisp. Drain the grease and add the bacon to the pot. Continue to simmer the soup over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the beans are tender and the soup has thickened.
