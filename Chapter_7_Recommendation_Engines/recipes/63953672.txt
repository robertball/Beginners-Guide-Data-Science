Ingredients:
1 pound Ground Beef
1 pound Ground Pork Sausage
1 Large Sweet Onion, chopped coarsely
2 Cloves Garlic, minced
2 Red Bell Peppers, cut into ¾” chunks
1 pound Smoked Sausage, cut into ¼” chunks
1 Tbs. Ground Oregano
3 Tbs. Chili Powder
1 Tsp. Ground Coriander
1 1/2 Tsp. Celery Seed
2 28 oz. (or 4 15 oz.) cans Ready-Cut tomatoes, undrained
2 27 oz. (or 4 15 oz.) cans Red Kidney Beans, drained (reserve liquid)
1/3 Cup Yellow Corn Meal

Directions:
In a large heavy pot or Dutch oven, over medium heat, brown ground beef and ground pork sausage. Drain fat and return to pot.
Add onions and garlic and cook until onions are tender. Add bell pepper and smoked sausage, cooking 5-10 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
Add spices and tomatoes. Simmer 5-10 minutes then add kidney beans.
In a bowl, blend the cornmeal with enough kidney bean liquid to make the consistency of cake batter. Mix with chili simmering another 10-15 minutes stirring occasionally.
At this point it is delicious and ready to serve, or let slow cook.
