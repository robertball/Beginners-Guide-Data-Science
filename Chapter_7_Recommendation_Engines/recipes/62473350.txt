Ingredients:
1/4 cup melted butter
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup applesauce
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 eggs
3/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup skim milk
2 tablespoons grated lemon zest
1.5 cup fresh or frozen blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan.
In a mixing bowl, beat together butter, sugar, juice, applesauce and eggs.  Combine flours, baking powder and salt; stir into egg mixture alternately with milk.  If desired, toss blueberries in a bit of flour so they won't sink. Fold in lemon zest and blueberries. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool bread in pan for 10 minutes. Remove bread from pan. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
This is a very tasty and easy to make recipe and I substituted some whole wheat flour, and decreased the butter and sugar. Left off the glaze in the original and it still tastes great!Modified from: Lemon Blueberry Bread
