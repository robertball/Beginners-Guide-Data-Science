Ingredients:
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
3 eggs
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon instant coffee (optional)
1/2 cup milk chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a round cake pan or 8x8 sheet pan.
Combine all ingredients except chocolate chips in a blender; blend until smooth; pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top of the mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges start to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes. Let cool and frost.
