Ingredients:
1 cup blanched almond flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 pinch salt
1 banana, mashed
1/2 cup almond milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Combine almond flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl; mix well. Stir in mashed banana, almond milk, and vegetable oil until well combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
