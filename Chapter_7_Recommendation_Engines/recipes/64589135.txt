Ingredients:
1 pound large shrimp (raw), shelled and deveined (16-20)
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee
1-2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup dry white wine
1 lemon zest then juiced
1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
2 scallions, thinly sliced
1 lemon, sliced

Directions:
Lay shelled and deveined shrimp on a large work board or platter and season with salt and pepper.
In a large pan heat over a medium temperature.  Add in oil and butter then once hot increase the temperature to medium-high then add in the shrimp.  Cook for 2 minutes shaking the handle to move the shrimp around.  Remove shrimp from pan and let sit on a plate.
Lower the temperature to medium then add in garlic and let cook for 1 minute.  Pour in white wine and while stirring scrape up any bits on the bottom of the pan. Pour in lemon juice and lemon zest.  Cook for 2 minutes then add shrimp back into the pan along with the parsley and scallions.
You can either serve from the pan or transfer to a platter and add sliced lemons.  Enjoy with your friends and a glass of white wine!
