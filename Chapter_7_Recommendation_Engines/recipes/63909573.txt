Ingredients:
Dough:
1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F)
1/2 cup white sugar
1 .75 ounce active dry yeast
1/3 cup butter, melted
2 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
4 1/2 - 5 cups bread flour
Cinnamon filling:
1 cup brown sugar, packed
2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1/3 cup butter, melted
Caramel topping:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup brown sugar, packed

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix milk, sugar, yeast and 1/3 cup of butter until dissolved.   Set aside to proof, about 10 minutes.
While waiting for mixture to foam, in a stand mixer, combine flour, salt and eggs.   Mix until well blended.
When yeast mixture is properly proofed, add into stand mixer with a dough hook and blend on speed 2 until a ball forms.
If it still looks wet add additional flour. Finished dough should be smooth and slightly tacky.
Put ball in a oiled bowl (roll dough to evenly coat with oil) and cover with a towel or plastic wrap and place in a warm area to rise.
When the dough has doubled in size turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
In a small bowl, blend 1 cup brown sugar and cinnamon.
Roll dough into a 16x24 inch rectangle.
Evenly coat the bread with 1/3 cup of melted butter.   Spread brown sugar and cinnamon mixture over top of butter.
Roll of dough and cut into 12 equal pieces.
Put into a greased 9x13 baking pan.
Cover and let rise until doubled in size.
While this is rising, melt butter on low-medium heat in a small saucepan.   Add in 1 cup of brown sugar and heavy cream and mix until brown sugar is disolved.  Remove from heat and set aside.
When rolls are doubled, pour butter/brown sugar/cream mixture evenly over top.
Bake in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes, or until the rolls start to brown on top.
Tightly cover pan with tinfoil and flip onto a hard surface (I use my smooth top stove) so the tinfoil is now the bottom.   Slowly remove pan and allow the rolls to sit for 5 minutes.
