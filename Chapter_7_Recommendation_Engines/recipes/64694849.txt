Ingredients:
1 onion, diced
3-4 garlic cloves, minced
1 pint of cherry tomatoes
2 Tbsp Olive oil
1, 15.5 oz can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1, 15.5 oz can diced tomatoes
1, 4.5 oz can chopped green chilies
1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1 1/2 tsp cumin
3/4 tsp ground coriander
1/8 tsp cayenne (leave out if you donâ€™t want a little heat)
1 tsp salt (or to taste)
1/2 tsp pepper (or to taste)
2 green onions, sliced (optional)
A handful of cilantro, chopped
1 1/2 cup uncooked quinoa or rice
Sauce:
2 Tbsp Greek yogurt, plain
1 Tbsp humus
1/4 tsp white vinegar
1 Tbsp water
Fresh ground pepper
Pinch of salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425. Put cherry tomatoes on a foil lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper and roll tomatoes around until tomatoes are evenly coated. Put in the oven and roast 15-20 minutes, until the skin starts to char and the tomatoes blister and pop.
In a large cast iron dutch oven or stock pot that has a lid over medium to medium-high heat add 2 Tbsp olive oil and onion. Cook for 4-5 minutes or until translucent. Add garlic, smoked paprika, cumin, coriander, cayenne, salt, and pepper and cook for another 30-60 seconds or until you can smell the garlic and spices.
Add the tomatoes and green chilies and bring to a boil. Once the mixture has come to a boil, reduce to a simmer and add the chickpeas. Add cherry tomatoes (and all their delicious juices) whenever they are done roasting. Cover with a lid and simmer for 30 minutes.
While the stew is simmering, cook rice or quinoa according to package instructions.
Mix together the Greek yogurt, humus, vinegar, water, salt, and pepper.
Server over rice or quinoa. Top with sauce, green onions, and cilantro.
