2 medium onions  chopped
2 cloves garlic  grated
1 c carrots  diced
1 delicata squash  seeded and chopped (no need to remove skin)
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper

2 tsp rosemary  fresh or dried
1 tsp thyme  fresh or dried
4 c chicken broth  low sodium
14 oz can fire roasted diced tomatoes
6 c kale  chopped

Directions:
Heat a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium-high and spray with non-stick spray.
Sautee onions, garlic, carrots and squash for 5-7 minutes or until tender, stirring frequently. Add a bit of salt and pepper to release juices.
Stir in diced chicken breasts, rosemary, thyme and remaining salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is browned.
Add chicken broth and fire roasted tomatoes then bring to a boil. Stir in chopped kale and simmer on low for 30 minutes.
Adjust for seasoning before serving. Tastes even better the next day as leftovers.
