Ingredients:
1 cup warm water
1/4 cup white sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
2 cups bread flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup coconut oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon chia seeds
1 tablespoon wheat germ
1 tablespoon flax seeds
1 tablespoon millet
2 tablespoons hulled hemp seeds, divided
2 tablespoons salted roasted sunflower seeds, divided
2 tablespoons old-fashioned oats, divided

Directions:
Mix warm water and sugar together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved; stir in yeast. Set aside until a creamy foam starts to form, about 5 minutes.
Combine bread flour, whole wheat flour, coconut oil, and salt in a food processor; pulse 4 times. Add chia seeds, wheat germ, flax seeds, millet, 1 tablespoon hemp seeds, 1 tablespoon sunflower seeds, and 1 tablespoon oats; pulse until incorporated.
Pour yeast mixture over flour mixture in the food processor; process until a dough ball forms, about 1 minute.
Turn dough into a well-oiled large bowl and cover with a damp towel; allow to rise in a warm area until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down and knead a few times. Form dough into an oblong shape and place in a greased bread pan. Lightly press the remaining hemp seeds, sunflower seeds, and oats onto the loaf. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm area for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and crust is lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Cool bread in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This is a very nice, light textured multigrain bread that uses many different grains and seeds and very easy to make if you have a food processor. I used my NinjaÂ® with the plastic blade attachment.
