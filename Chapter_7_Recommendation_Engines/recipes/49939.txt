Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pinch salt
4 teaspoons prepared mustard
4 large hamburger buns
4 teaspoons butter
1 small sweet onion, thinly sliced
4 slices American cheese
1 large tomato, thinly sliced
4 leaves iceberg lettuce, shredded
4 teaspoons mayonnaise (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill to high heat, and lightly oil grate.
Divide the ground beef into 4 balls, and flatten into patties between sheets of waxed paper. Lay patties onto the grate of the prepared grill. Sprinkle the tops of the burgers with salt. Grill for about 5 minutes per side, or to desired degree of doneness.
While the burgers are cooking, spread each top bun with 1 teaspoon of butter, and spread each bottom bun with 1 teaspoon of mustard. Place the buns onto the grill for just a minute to toast.
Assemble the burgers in this order: Bun, onion, burger patty, cheese, tomato, lettuce, a pinch of salt, and top bun. Spread mayonnaise onto top bun if using.

Description: 
My grandmother used this recipe at her summer resort. Preparation of vegetables is very important. All vegetables should be thinly shaved with large knife. She used to cook these burgers and people would come from miles to eat at her kitchen and then go fishing.
