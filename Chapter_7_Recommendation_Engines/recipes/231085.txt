Description: 
A co-worker shared this recipe with me. This is another one of my favorite slow cooker comfort foods. I don't know how I survived without this recipe in my life. I am glad I don't have to, and neither do you! 
I like to serve this on a hoagie or roll with chips and dip. Cook on High for 4 hours or on Low for 8.
