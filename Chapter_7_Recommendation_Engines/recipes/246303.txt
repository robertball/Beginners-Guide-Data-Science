Ingredients:
20 large fresh morel mushrooms
Breading Mix:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup Italian cracker crumbs
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon ground cumin
1 1/2 cups milk
1 egg
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Place morels in a large bowl of warm salted water and leave to soak, about 30 minutes. Drain.
Combine flour, cracker crumbs, paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, oregano, thyme, and cumin in a large resealable plastic bag to make breading mix.
Whisk milk and egg together in a small bowl.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Dip mushrooms, a few at a time, into milk mixture. Toss in breading mix until coated; shake off excess.
Fry breaded morels in the hot oil, working in batches, until dark brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
