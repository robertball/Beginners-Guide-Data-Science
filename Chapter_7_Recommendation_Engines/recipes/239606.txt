1 1/3 cups milk
1 cup buckwheat flour
1 cup almond flour

1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Stir milk, buckwheat, almond flour, vegetable oil, eggs, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a bowl until batter is smooth.
Working in batches, ladle batter into preheated waffle iron and cook until waffles are golden and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
So far this is the best I've come up with for waffles. They get a nice crispy outer shell in my waffle iron that I find delicious. Be warned: you have to like buckwheat to like these. Using half creamer and half milk is pretty awesome if you don't mind the extra fat/calories. You can substitute applesauce for the oil, if desired.
