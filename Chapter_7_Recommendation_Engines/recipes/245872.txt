Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 medium red onion, halved and thinly sliced
1 pound prepared pizza dough
½ cup prepared basil pesto sauce
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and quartered
1 (10 ounce) can chicken breast, drained and flaked
1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 (3.8 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
½ cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add onion to skillet and cook until just softened, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
Divide dough into 2 equal balls. On well-floured surface, with floured rolling pin, roll each ball into a 10-inch circle. Place on large cookie sheets or pizza pans. Brush crusts with remaining olive oil.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Spread pesto sauce on pizza dough within 1-inch from edge; top with red onion, artichoke hearts, chicken, sliced mushrooms, sliced olives and feta cheese. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until crust is golden.
