Ingredients:
3 cups grated unpeeled zucchini
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 cups white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9x13 inch pan.
Place grated zucchini in a colander and set aside to drain.
Whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl until well blended. Beat the eggs, applesauce, oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl until smooth. Fold in the flour mixture, then stir in the zucchini. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Allow to cool completely before cutting.

Description: 
I created this recipe to use up a bumper crop of zucchini and to get my kids to eat more fruits and veggies without them knowing it.  It is a dense cake reminiscent of carrot cake.  I frequently add in an extra cup of stir-ins.  Raisins, flake coconut, and walnuts or pecans are favorites.
