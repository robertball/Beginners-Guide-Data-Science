Ingredients:
2 cups granulated sugar
1/2 cup butter
2/3 cup evaporated milk
12 regular large marshmallows
1 teaspoon vanilla
6 oz. cherry chips
12 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips
3/4 cup peanut butter
1 teaspoon butter
10 ounces crushed peanuts

Directions:
Bring the first 3 ingredients to a rolling boil and boil 8 minutes.  Remove from heat, add next 3 ingredients and stir until fully incorporated.  Set aside to cool.
Melt chocolate chips.  Add peanut butter and butter, mixing until smooth.  Mix in crushed peanuts until fully coated.
Put 1/2 of the chocolate mixture in a buttered 9 x 13 pan, completely covering the bottom.  Pour the cherry filling on top of the chocolate and spread to cover.  Top with remaining chocolate mixture.  Cool and cut into bars.
Store in a cool place in an airtight container, separating layers with waxed paper.
