Ingredients:
8 frozen plain waffles (such as Eggo®), cut into bite-size pieces
1 3/4 cups milk
3 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking dish.
Spread waffle pieces in the bottom of the baking dish.
Beat milk, eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until well-blended. Pour over waffles in the baking dish, making sure to cover them evenly. Let stand for 5 minutes.
Bake in the preheated oven until center is set and edges start to brown and pull away from the sides, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I was greedy and bought the big box of waffles at Costco®. The kids got tired of them and I just had to come up with a recipe to get rid of them. What do you know, the kids ate this easy- to-make dessert in no time, and the waffles were gone! I have used homemade waffles for this recipe, which works just as well. We have tried adding fresh strawberries, chocolate chips, or raisins on top: delicious! Be creative and add your own toppings!
