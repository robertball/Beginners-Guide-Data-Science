Ingredients:
1 red onion, halved and thinly sliced
1 Roma tomato, seeded and finely chopped
1 ripe kiwi, diced
1 lime, quartered, divided
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 tablespoons sour cream
olive oil
1 poblano pepper - cored, seeded, and finely chopped
10 ounces ground pork
1 tablespoon Mexican seasoning
2 tablespoons chicken stock
1 tablespoon tomato paste
6 flour tortillas

Directions:
Mince a few slices of onion to get 1 tablespoon. Add minced onion, tomato, kiwi, juice from 2 lime wedges, 3/4 of the cilantro, salt, and pepper to a small bowl. Mix into a salsa.
Juice 1/4 of the lime into another small bowl; mix in sour cream to make the crema.
Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced onion and poblano pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until softened and lightly charred, 3 to 4 minutes. Add pork and Mexican seasoning. Cook until pork is browned throughout, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add chicken stock, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until everything is coated, 1 to 2 minutes.
Wrap tortillas in a damp cloth and microwave for 30 seconds. Divide tortillas over plates; spread cream on top. Top tortillas with pork mixture and salsa. Garnish with remaining cilantro.
