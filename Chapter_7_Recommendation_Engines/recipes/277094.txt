Description: 
These poppers are great on their own, in salads, or in wraps. Freezing and thawing the tofu before cooking gives these poppers more of a meaty, chicken-style texture. Even people who have never tried tofu because they think it's yucky love them. Serve with dipping sauce of choice. Leftovers can be stored in the fridge and reheated in the microwave later or just eat them cold, straight from the fridge!
