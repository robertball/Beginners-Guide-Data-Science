Ingredients:
1 pound Ground Beef
1/2 cup Italian Bread Crumbs
2/3 cup (or one small can) Evaporated Milk
1 tsp Minced Onion
1/3 cup Ketchup
1 small can Mushrooms
1 cup Cheddar Cheese
1-2 tsp Oregano

Directions:
Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, milk, and onion.  Press into pie plate(I use glass) forming a "crust".  Drizzle ketchup on top of this mixture (I just use it directly from the bottle and squirt it on top of the meat).  Drain mushrooms and layer over ketchup.  Sprinkle cheese over the mushrooms and then season with oregano.  Bake for 30-40 minutes in preheated 350 degree oven.  It will pull away from the sides of the pie plate when done.

Description: 
This is one of our favorite dishes.  This is a quick dish to prepare and is done in a half hour.  If you like meatloaf you will love Meatza Pie.  It's even better heated up the next day!
