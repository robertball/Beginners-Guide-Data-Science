Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter or stick margarine, melted
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped broccoli, thawed and drained
1 cup cooked rice
1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
8 (4 ounce) sole or whitefish fillets

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the butter, lemon juice, salt and pepper. In another bowl, combine the broccoli, rice, cheese and half of the butter mixture. Spoon 1/2 cup onto each fillet. Roll up and place seam side down in a baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Pour remaining butter mixture over roll-ups.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Baste with pan drippings; sprinkle with paprika.
