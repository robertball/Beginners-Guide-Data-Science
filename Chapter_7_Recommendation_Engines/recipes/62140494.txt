Ingredients:
2 T. Vegetable Oil
8 Cloves of Minced Garlic
2 Large Onions
1 lb. beef cubes (about 1-2 inches in diameter)
4 Cups Beef stock
1 Cup Pearl Barley
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Heat oil in the bottom of a large saucepan to medium heat.  Add the garlic and onions, and cook until opaque.  Remove the onions.
2. Raise heat up to high/medium-high, then brown off the beef.
3. Add the onions, as well as the rest of the ingredients, and bring up to a boil.  Once boiling, immediately reduce to just under a simmer.
4. Cook until barley is very soft, and stock is thick like a gravy (about 2-3 hours).

Description: 
I worked at a hotel on the Kinneret in Israel, where we made this recipe for every sabbath.  As there are few ingredients, use the best quality you can, especially for the beef stock.  If possible use homemade or organic.  As for the beef, use a good quality cheap cut, such as chuck steak.  Feel free to add your own touches to this recipe.  Sometimes I use venison instead of beef, or add a handful of forest mushrooms.  It's a great base to build off of.
