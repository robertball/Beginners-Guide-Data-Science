Ingredients:
4 Large Vidalia Onions
4 pats of butter
4 beef bullion cubes
12 ice cubes
4 double sheets aluminum foil
4 oz. sherry
salt & pper to taste (Easy on the salt, the bullion will add saltiness)
4 slices provolone cheese (1/4 inch each)

Directions:
Slice the tops from the onions 7 remove the skin, leave the base intact.
With a knife, cross-hatch the flat top, one half inch down.
Place the 1 oz. butter on top, and 1 bullion cube. Add 1 oz. of sherry to the packet.
Place the onion into the center of the foil and fold the foil up around the onion.
When almost closed place 3 ice cubes inside on top and seal completely.
Place the packets on the grill, set at medium/medium high heat, and let cook for 40 minutes. Don't open the packets until at least 40 minutes has past!
Check after 40-45 minutes, if the onions feel like they are cooked through, leave the packets open slightly and place 1 slice of provolone on each. Close the grill lid if possible, and allow the cheese to melt down into the onion.
Remove from the grill and either serve from the packets or remove onion to a bowl and pour the stock in with it.
Serve with warm, crusty, bread and and a sturdy red wine!

Description: 
I would like to be able to claim this but I got it from a good friend, I added the sherry.
Vidalia Onions cooked on the grill, sealed in foil! Just like French onion soup, without the bother! Great anytime, and very easy to make. This can be made in the oven, 350 degrees for one hour.
