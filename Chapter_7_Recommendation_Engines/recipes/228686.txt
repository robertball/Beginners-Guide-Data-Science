Ingredients:
4 sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
6 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon Cajun pepper seasoning
1 pinch kosher salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place sweet potatoes, olive oil, brown sugar, Cajun seasoning, and salt in a large resealable plastic bag; shake to coat potatoes evenly. Transfer mixture to a baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until sweet potatoes are tender, about 1 hour.

Description: 
The sweetness of the potatoes is offset by the spiciness of the Cajun pepper. Adjust the pepper to taste. My family absolutely loves this recipe!
