Ingredients:
7 pints of water
3 lbs of "navy" beans, also called "great northern" or "small white" beans
3 6oz cans of tomato paste
2 tablespoons of salt
2/3 cups of sugar
2 tsp of paprika
2 tsp of dry mustard

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a large crockpot and cook on high for 10-12 hours stirring occasionally toward the end of cooking.
If there is a trick to this recipe it’s getting the tenderness of the beans and the consistency of the sauce right. The beans should be soft but not mushy. The sauce should be syrupy. Adjust the cooking time or add water until you get it how you like it.
Some brands list cornstarch as an ingredient. If that helps you get the sauce the right consistency use it.
Some brands list vinegar as an ingredient. I find the tanginess of the tomato paste sufficient.
I freeze my beans in quart bags and defrost them as needed. If you do this I suggest undercooking them slightly as freezing and thawing the beans tenderizes them more.

Description: 
In the British Isles “beans” means one thing, white beans in a slightly sweet, tomato-based sauce. They've been a canned food staple for generations. Whether served with breakfast, as a side, or on toast for a simple hearty tea, these beans are one of the cornerstones of British comfort food. Expatiates and anglophiles  pay exorbitant prices for imported cans of British beans. Most recipes attempt to make British beans more exciting, but the charm of British beans is their simplicity. Here is a crockpot recipe that comes very close to imported beans
