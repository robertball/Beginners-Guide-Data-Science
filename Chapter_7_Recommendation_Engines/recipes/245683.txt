Ingredients:
2 cups lukewarm water
1/4 cup white sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
7 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
3 cups oil for frying

Directions:
Mix lukewarm water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to bubble slightly, about 5 minutes.
Sift flour and salt together in a large bowl.
Pour water mixture over flour mixture and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover bowl with clean cloth and let dough rise until until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.
Pinch off a piece of dough about the size of a tennis ball; roll until smooth. Flatten ball of dough until it is the size of palm; set aside on a floured work surface. Repeat with remaining dough.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry flattened pieces of dough in the hot oil, 2 to 3 pieces at a time, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
