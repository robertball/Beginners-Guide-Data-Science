Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
3 tablespoons butter, melted
Filling
2 (8 ounce) packages regular cream cheese
1 (8 ounce) package fat-free cream cheese
1 1/4 cups SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
4 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.
Combine graham cracker crumbs, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and melted butter in a small bowl. Press on bottom and up sides of prepared pan.
Bake 10 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.
Beat regular and fat free cream cheese together at high speed with a mixer until creamy; gradually add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, mixing well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating just until each one is incorporated. Add lime juice and a pinch of salt, beat until smooth. Pour into prepared crust.
Bake 50 to 60 minutes or until mixture is almost set, and slightly firm to the touch.  Run a knife around edge of pan to release sides, and help prevent cracking. Cool to room temperature on a wire rack; cover and chill at least 8 hours.
