Add to creamy mixture alternating with milk, mix well each addition.  In small bowl, beat egg whites until they have stiff peaks.  Fold into the batter.  Pour into the prepared pans.  Bake for 25-30 minutes.  Cool completely.
Coconut Filling:
Mix sugar with flour and salt in a medium saucepan.  Add eggs and mil.  Cook, stirring constantly until the mixture is thickened.  Remove from the heat and stir in vanilla, butter and coconut.  Cool.  Put 1/2 of the filling on 1 layer of cooled cake; add second layer and the rest of the filling.  Top with the third layer of cake.  Be careful, the cakes can slip around with the filling in between the layers, make sure the cake is even prior to frosting it.

Combine sugar, cream of tartar and water in a medium saucepan.  Cover and heat until it boils.  Remove cover and cook to 260 degrees F. on a candy thermometer.  In a small bowl, beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.  Gradually pour mixture from saucepan over beaten eggs, beating with the mixer constantly.  Continue beating until it is fluffy and thick.  You need it thick to spread over the cake.  Spread on all sides of the cake. Pour flaked coconut over top and sides until it has a nice even cover of coconut.
