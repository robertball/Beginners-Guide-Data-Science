Ingredients:
3 tablespoons coconut oil, softened, divided
1 (3 ounce) fillet sole fillet
1 pinch salt
1/2 head butterhead lettuce, cut into strips
1/2 pink grapefruit
2 scallions, chopped, or more to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 squeeze lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground black pepper

Directions:
Melt 1 tablespoon coconut oil in a grill pan over medium heat. Season sole fillet with 1 pinch salt; grill until opaque, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Trim off and discard skin.
Place butterhead lettuce in a bowl. Run a thin knife around each segment of grapefruit; scoop out using a spoon and add to lettuce. Flake sole into pieces over the grapefruit and lettuce. Add scallion and garlic.
Mix remaining 2 tablespoons coconut oil, sugar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Pour over salad; toss gently to combine.

Description: 
Delightfully tangy, aromatic, and light, this is ultimate girl food. Men are not likely to enjoy this dish, but for me it hits the spot.
