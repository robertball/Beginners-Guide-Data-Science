Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup milk
1/2 to 1 pound shredded Cheddar cheese as needed
2 tablespoons flour
1 pound beef or deer cutlets
1 tablespoon butter
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and pepper
10 spears fresh asparagus

Directions:
To Make Cheese Sauce:  Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Stir in milk, and cook just until bubbles begin to form at the edges.  Whisk in the shredded cheese until fully melted and smooth.   Remove from heat, cover and set aside to keep warm.
You can lightly bread cutlets if you'd like.  Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Cook cutlets in butter, 4 to 6 minutes a side, until browned.  Set aside and keep warm.
Preheat a large skillet with butter.  Trim asparagus, and saute in garlic and butter until bright green.
To Assemble:  Plate the cutlets; criss-cross the asparagus over the top; and drizzle cheese sauce over all.  Serve extra sauce on the side.
