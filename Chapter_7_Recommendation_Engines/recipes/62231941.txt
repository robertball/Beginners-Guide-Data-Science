Ingredients:
18 eggs
2 lb. pork sausage
1 lb. shredded hashbrowns
1 jar chunky salsa
2 cups Cheddar or Pepper Jack cheese
24 flour tortillas

Directions:
In large skillet scramble eggs.
Remove from skillet and set aside in large bowl.
Cook sausage.  Add to egg mixture.
Stir salsa, hashbrowns, and cheese into egg mixture and mix gently.
Warm tortillas as directed on package. Place about 1/2 cup egg and sausage mixture onto each tortilla. Roll up each tortilla to make burritos, folding in the ends and rolling up.
Roll into tinfoil.
When you're ready to eat, unwrap the burritos, wrap loosely in microwave safe paper towel and heat in the microwave on high power for 1-3 minutes until hot and cheese is melted.
You can also thaw burritos in the refrigerator overnight, then wrap each in foil and bake at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes until hot.
