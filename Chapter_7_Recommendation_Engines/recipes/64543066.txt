Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats
2 lb. ground beef
2 eggs
1/2 cup organic no-sugar-added tomato sauce
3/4 cup Parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tsp. onion powder
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tbsp. dried parsley
1 tbsp. mustard
2 tsp. dried minced onion
1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Spray slow-cooker with nonstick cooking spray.
Combine all ingredients into a large bowl. Crumble ground beef over mixture and stir well to combine.
Shape into an oval loaf; place in a 5-quart slow cooker. Cover and cook on Low until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 5 to 6 hours.
(Optional:  Whisk a little ketchup, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl; spoon sauce over meat loaf.  Continue cooking on Low until heated through, about 15 minutes.)
Remove from slow-cooker and let stand 10 minutes before cutting.
