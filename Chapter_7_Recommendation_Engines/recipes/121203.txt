Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
1 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
1 cup mashed potato flakes
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 envelope onion soup mix
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
TOPPING:
1 egg
1/4 cup dried minced onion

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the next eight ingredients; mix well. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down; divide into 18 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Beat egg; brush over rolls. Sprinkle with dried onion. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
As a 4-H judge, I sampled a variation of these light, golden rolls at our county fair. With a touch of onion, it's a real blue-ribbon recipe that wins raves whenever I serve it.
