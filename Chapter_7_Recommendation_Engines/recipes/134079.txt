Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 onion, minced
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
3/4 cup beef stock
2 tablespoons sour cream

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and onions, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the onions soften and turn translucent. Add the dill, thyme, salt, and pepper; cook for 30 seconds to flavor the onion.
Stir in the Dijon mustard, balsamic vinegar, and beef stock. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat then reduce heat to low, and continue simmering for 5 minutes to infuse the flavors. Remove sauce from the heat, and whisk in sour cream; season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.

Description: 
This is a delicious, quick sauce to serve with grilled steaks or a roast.  I got this recipe from my sister whose husband gave it the name 'Romance Sauce',  when she cooked this with steaks he knew it was going to be a special night.  Serve the steaks with a green salad and a simple vinaigrette; this is an easy, romantic meal sure to impress the ladies!  You could easily substitute the beef stock with chicken and serve over chicken breasts if beef isn't your thing.
