Ingredients:
1 cup chickpea flour (garbanzo bean flour /besan flour)
1 tsp salt
¼ tsp ground turmeric (optional)
3 cups water, divided

Directions:
Place the chickpea flour in a bowl along with the salt and turmeric (if using). Whisk to combine. Add 1½ cups of water and whisk until smooth.
Lightly oil (8 inch)x(8 inch) square baking dish or cake tin or use parchment paper.
Bring the remaining 1½ cups of water to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the chickpea flour and water mixture. Whisk over the heat until the mixture becomes really thick and glossy. This should take about 8 minutes.
Pour immediately into the prepared baking dish and leave to cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour. The longer it sits, the more water will drain out of the tofu and the firmer it will get.
