Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
6 hard-cooked eggs, diced
1/2 cup diced onion
1/2 cup diced celery
1/2 cup diced green bell pepper
2 cups mayonnaise
1 cup milk
1/2 cup sweet pickle relish
1/3 cup prepared honey mustard
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and rinse macaroni under cold water until chilled. Transfer macaroni to a large salad bowl.
Toss pasta with hard-cooked eggs, onion, celery, and green bell pepper. Whisk mayonnaise, milk, pickle relish, and honey mustard in a bowl and pour dressing over the salad; mix well and season with sea salt and ground black pepper.
