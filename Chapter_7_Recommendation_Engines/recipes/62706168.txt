Ingredients:
Cooking Spray  Spray your Baking sheets!
1 Cup Sugar
1 Cup Packed Brown Sugar
1 stick Unsalted Butter (to make up 1 cup of butter)
1 Stick Salted Butter (to make up 1 cup of butter)  I accidentally bought salted butter at the store. I usually get unsalted…so I had 1 stick of each. Use what you have. Don’t make a special trip to the store…unless you have no life. Then go ahead and run to the store to make this recipe exactly!
2 Large eggs
1 1/2 Teaspoons of Vanilla
1 teaspoon baking SODA  don’t mix them up. They are different, G, I promise.
2 ½ Cups All Purpose Flour
1/4 Cup Skim Milk  this batter is VERY dense. Don’t worry about it, it makes for great cookies. The milk just helps get things a little moist.
12 oz store bough trail mix  My sister lives in Philly and she bought me this beautiful bag of trail mix. But sometimes I cough and get allergies when I eat trail mix straight…so I decided to put it into this cookie dough! YUM!

Directions:
1)      Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Spray your baking sheets and lay out your cooling racks.
2)      In the mixer bowl of your Kitchenaid mixer OR in a very large kitchen bowl, place softened butter, eggs, white and brown sugar, and vanilla. Mix for about 2 minutes, stopping and scraping the bowl every so often to make sure everything gets incorporated into your dough.
3)      Slowly add in flour, baking soda and salt. If you have the mixer, let it stay on the stir mode and add in a bit of flour, salt and baking soda at a time. I put the baking soda and salt right into the measuring cup with the flour and then you can just pour it in a bit at a time. If you are hand mixing, you’ll have to start and stop. DO NOT just dump in the flour. You’ll end up with a messy shirt and your dough will take forever to mix.
4)      When dough is well mixed, add in your milk and give it a quick 10 second mix. Then add your trail mix and beat together for about 30 seconds or until everything is incorporated into the dough.
5)      Using the tablespoon on your measure spoon, spray it with cooking spray and use it to scoop out even sized balls of dough. You know how bakery cookies are all the same size? Well mine aren’t…but they’re CLOSE. And they cook evenly, so WIN! You may have to keep spraying the tablespoon from time to time to keep it from getting sticky.
6)      Bake for about 10 minutes. These you have to watch carefully because they are quick cooking.
7)      Immediately remove cookies to a wire rack
8)      Don’t wait for them to cool, start shoving them in your mouth. So good.
