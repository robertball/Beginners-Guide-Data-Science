Ingredients:
6 eggs
3 slices bacon, finely chopped
3 tablespoons crunchy peanut butter
8 pickle slices, diced
2 tablespoons olive oil mayonnaise
2 tablespoons hot sauce (such as LouisianaÂ®)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch ground paprika, or to taste

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil; remove from heat and let stand, about 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water and cool under cold running water. Peel and cut in half.
Place bacon pieces in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving 1 tablespoon grease.
Scoop egg yolks into a bowl. Add reserved bacon grease and peanut butter; mash well. Mix in pickles, mayonnaise, and hot sauce. Season with salt and pepper.
Spoon yolk mixture into empty egg whites. Garnish with bacon pieces and paprika.
