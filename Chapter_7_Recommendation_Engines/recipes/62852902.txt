Ingredients:
3 Cans of tomatoes with green chiles, drained
2-3 Roma tomatoes,chopped(optional. I like some fresh in my salsa)
3 Cucumbers, peeled,seeded, and chopped
1 large bunch of cilantro, chopped
Kosher salt to taste
Jalepeno (optional)or any pepper you prefer
Onions (optional)

Directions:
In a bowl, empty the drained cans of tomatoes and chiles.
Peel and seed the cucumbers. Chop up cucumbers and add them to bowl.
Chop up roma tomatoes and add them.
Wash and chop cilantro. Add to bowl.
Cut up onion as well as jalepeno (or any other pepper you prefer). Add to bowl.
Add the Kosher salt, to taste
Stir them all up. You can serve immediatly. OR in my opinion, it is better when it sits for about an hour or hour and a half in the fridge. Enjoy with tortilla chips or on your tacos, which we love.

Description: 
This is such a fresh and light salsa. I made this one day when I needed some extra ingredients and decided to throw some cucumbers in. I now make this for every picnic or party I go to. It is requested. Whereever I am, I have to give the recipe to someone. I keep this in my fridge at all times and all my kids love it. A great way to get them to eat their vegies.
