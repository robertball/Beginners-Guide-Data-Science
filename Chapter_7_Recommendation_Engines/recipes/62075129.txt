Ingredients:
2 boneless chicken breasts
16 ozs canned chicken broth
2 potatoes, sliced
6 mushrooms, sliced
1 zucchini, sliced
1 yellow squash, sliced
Salt, as needed for seasoning
Pepper, as needed for seasoning
Garlic powder, as needed for seasoning

Directions:
Make little trays out of sheets of aluminum foil.  Fold the sides up so that none of the ingredients leak out. Place one or two pieces of chicken in the foil, then add your vegetables and any seasoning.  Last, pour chicken broth over everything. Make sure you pour in enough to keep the chicken moist while cooking.
Fold all of the edges of the aluminum foil to the middle and roll the seam so that nothing will leak.
If cooking on the grill, cook them over medium heat for 30-35 minutes or until chicken is completely cooked.
In the oven, cook at 375 degrees for 30-35 minutes or until chicken is completely cooked.
