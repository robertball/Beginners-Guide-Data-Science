Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
3 teaspoons sugar, divided
2 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees F), divided
2 teaspoons salt
6 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/4 cup water; let stand for 10 minutes.  Combine salt, remaining sugar and water; add to yeast mixture.  Add 3 cups of flour; beat until smooth.  Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; shape into two loaves.  Place in two 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans that have coated with nonstick cooking spray.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes.  Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.
