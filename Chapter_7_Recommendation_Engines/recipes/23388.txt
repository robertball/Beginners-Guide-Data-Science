Ingredients:
1 cup buttermilk
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup boiling water
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.  In a medium bowl, combine the buttermilk and baking soda.  Set aside in a warm place.
In a large bowl, mix together 2 cups sugar, eggs, 3 tablespoons cocoa powder, oil and 2 teaspoons vanilla until blended.  Stir in the boiling water, then gradually beat in the flour.  Stir in the buttermilk mixture.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
To make the Fudge Icing:  In a saucepan, combine 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, milk, butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  Bring to a boil, and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat.  Using an electric mixer, beat icing for 3 minutes, or until it thickens to spreading consistency.  Pour over completely cooled cake.

Description: 
This is the simplest and moistest chocolate cake I have ever found and was a favorite when I grew up. I could even whip it up as a child.  This cake is also great with the boxed fluffy icing so the great chocolate flavor of the cake is not hidden.
