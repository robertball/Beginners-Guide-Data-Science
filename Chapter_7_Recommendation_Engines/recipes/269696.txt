Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound lean ground beef
1 medium onion, diced
1 1/2 cups water
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
4 green bell peppers, tops and seeds removed

Directions:
Add olive oil to the inner liner of a multi-functional electric pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add beef and onion to the hot oil and cook until beef is browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Remove from pot and drain.
Return beef and onion to the pot, still on Saute mode. Stir in water, tomato paste, and taco seasoning. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook until thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Fill bell peppers with the mixture.
Pour 1 cup of water into the inner liner; set trivet inside and place stuffed bell peppers on top. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 8 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
