Ingredients:
5 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/2 cup margarine, divided
1/3 cup milk, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 onions, minced
1 1/4 pounds ground beef
1 (11 ounce) can canned whole kernel corn (such as Green Giant NibletsÂ®), drained
1 (14.75 ounce) can cream-style corn

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes; drain.
Mash potatoes with 2 tablespoons margarine; stir in milk. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat 2 tablespoons margarine in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in onions and saute until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Spread onions evenly over bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Cook and stir ground beef in same skillet over medium heat until no longer pink, breaking up large pieces, about 5 minutes. Layer beef into baking dish evenly over onion layer.
Wipe out skillet; place corn and creamed corn in skillet over medium heat and cook and stir until bubbly, about 5 minutes. Pour corn mixture over beef in baking dish. Spread mashed potatoes over corn mixture; dot with remaining 4 tablespoons margarine. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbly and lightly browned at edges and margarine is melted, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe that my MIL gave me. It's French Canadian and called Pate Chinois, which translates to Chinese Pie. It's a little twist on shepherd's pie but it's simple, delicious and sticks to your ribs on a cold, wintry night! Leftovers (not typical in my house!) are even better as the flavors all blend nicely. Good comfort food!
