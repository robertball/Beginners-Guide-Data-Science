Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 pounds boneless venison roast
1 large apple, cored and quartered
2 small onions, sliced
4 cloves crushed garlic
1 cup boiling water
1 cube beef bouillon

Directions:
Spread the olive oil on the inside of a slow cooker.  Place the venison roast inside, and cover with apple, onions, and garlic.  Turn to Low, and cook until the roast is tender, about 6 to 8 hours.
When the roast has cooked, remove it from the slow cooker, and place onto a serving platter.  Discard the apple.  Stir the water and bouillon into the slow cooker until the bouillon has dissolved.  Serve this as a sauce with the roast.
