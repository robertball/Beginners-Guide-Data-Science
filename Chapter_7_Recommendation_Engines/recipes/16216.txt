Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 egg
1 pinch salt

Directions:
In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, milk, egg and salt.
Heat a large frying pan or wok over medium high heat. When the pan is hot add a teaspoon of butter and lightly coat the surface of the pan with the melted butter.
Pour one quarter cup of the batter into the pan and tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface in a smooth and even layer.
After two minutes, lift up an edge of the crepe with a spatula to see if it is browning. When the underside has begun to brown, flip the crepe and cook the other side until it is also brown; about 2 minutes.
Repeat steps 3 and 4 to cook the remaining crepes. Serve hot.
