Ingredients:
4 cups honey roasted peanuts
4 Tbsp. sugar
1 tsp. salt
4-5 Tbsp vegetable oil

Directions:
Add peanuts, sugar and salt to your food processor and blend until fine crumbs.  After the peanuts have been processed, proceed to add a tablespoon of oil at a time to the food processor until it reaches the desired thickness of peanut butter. (Do this while the processor is running to emulsify the oil and peanut crumbs.)  If you choose to not use honey roasted peanuts and opt for a roasted peanut, adjust your sugar measurements to taste.

Description: 
You won't buy peanut butter any more after you try it homemade.  This peanut butter is awesome and makes the best peanut butter cookies!  The texture will be slighly crunchy peanut butter.  My 7 kids won't eat the store bought stuff anymore.  Fortunately, it doesn't take long to make.
