Ingredients:
12 to 15 slices day-old bread
2 tablespoons butter, melted
7 eggs, beaten
3 1/2 cups milk
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 370 degrees F
Break bread into small pieces into 13x9 inch baking pan making sure the bread is lightly compacted. Use more or less bread as needed to ensure the pan is filled about 1/2 way to the top.
In a medium mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.
Beat until well mixed.
Pour over bread, and lightly push down with a fork until bread is covered and soaking up the egg mixture.
Drizzle melted butter or margarine over the top.
Place pan in the preheated oven and turn the temp down to 350 degrees. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the top springs back when lightly tapped.
Allow to cool for 5 minutes before cutting and serving. Great with milk or maple syrup.

Description: 
High Altitude changes and some minor tweaks.
This lightly spiced, extra thick bread pudding really hits home. We suggest using a rich egg bread or a moist white loaf in this recipeModified from: Bread Pudding II
