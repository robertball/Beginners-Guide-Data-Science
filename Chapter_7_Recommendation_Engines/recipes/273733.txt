Ingredients:
⅓ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
¼ cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
1 teaspoon sesame oil
½ teaspoon ginger paste
½ teaspoon garlic paste
2  green onions, chopped
1 pound chicken wings
1 teaspoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine soy sauce, brown sugar, gochujang, sesame oil, ginger paste, garlic paste, and green onions in a large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Turn heat off and set aside.
Place chicken wings in a large bowl. Add vegetable oil and massage into the chicken until evenly coated. Place wings in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 10 minutes. Flip wings and cook for 10 more minutes.
Dip wings into the sauce mixture and stir to coat. Return wings to the basket of the air fryer and cook 2 minutes. Coat wings into the sauce again. Return to air fryer basket and cook for 2 more minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Sweet, spicy, crispy chicken wings with a Korean flair. The flavor combination reminds me of bulgogi but with chicken instead of beef.
