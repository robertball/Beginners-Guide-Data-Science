Ingredients:
1 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips
1 (1 ounce) square semisweet baking chocolate, chopped

Directions:
Grease an 8x8-inch square baking dish with butter.
Place sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips, and baking chocolate in a microwave-safe dish; cook in microwave on low power until chocolate has melted, about 3 minutes. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth, about 1 minute.
Pour fudge into the prepared baking dish; let stand until set, 3 to 4 hours. Cut into squares to serve.

Description: 
Easy-to-make-and-tastes-amazing fudge, but that's a pretty long title so we just call it 3-Minute Fudge. It's only 3 minutes to cook and 3 ingredients! Great to cut up and put in ice cream.
