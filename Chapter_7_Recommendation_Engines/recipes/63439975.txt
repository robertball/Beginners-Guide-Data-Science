Ingredients:
1/2 lb. butter
1 1/2 c. sugar
2 tsp/ vanilla
1 T. water
2 eggs
3 1/2 c. flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. baking soda
1/8 c. white sugar
decorative sugars and sprinkles if desired

Directions:
Cream butter and sugar, add vanilla, water, and eggs.
In a separate bowl, combine flour, salt, and baking soda. Add about 1/2 cup at a time to moist ingredients, mixing well with each addition.
Chill dough at least 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 400 F.
Roll out dough on cookie sheets to desired thickness (I make mine between 1/8" and 1/4" in thick), cut out shapes with cookie cutters. Leave about 1/2 " between shapes to prevent them from sticking together during baking. Peel away dough between cookies.
If desired, shake decorative colored sugars, and sprinkles on top of cookies.
Top with a fine layer of white sugar.
Bake 6-8 minutes at 400 F.

Description: 
This is the basic sugar cookie recipe my mother always made at Christmas time when I was growing up. It's a good cookie whether decorated or just topped with a little white sugar.
