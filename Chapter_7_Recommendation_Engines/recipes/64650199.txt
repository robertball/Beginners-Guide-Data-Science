Ingredients:
homemade yogurt

Directions:
Line a colander with a clean cloth (a dish towel is satisfactory).
Place colander on bowl.
Pour chilled yogurt into lined colander and allow to drain for 6-8 hours (need not be refrigerated while draining).
Lift cloth by opposite ends, place on flat surface, and scrape "cream cheese" off with spatula and refrigerate it. It will be quite tart; a little liquid honey may be worked in to sweeten.
