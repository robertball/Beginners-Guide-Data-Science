Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter-flavored spread or spray
1 cup white wine Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup fat-free half-and-half
4 sole fillets

Directions:
Place the spread or spray in a medium saucepan. Whisk in the Worcestershire sauce, bring it to a boil and reduce the sauce slightly. Stir in the half-and-half and keep warm.
Meanwhile, preheat the broiler and place the fish on an unheated rack in a broiler pan. Broil 4 to 6 inches from the heat and cook for 2 to 6 minutes, or until it flakes easily. Remove the fish to a serving platter and spoon the sauce over the fish.
