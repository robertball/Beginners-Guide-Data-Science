Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 T. butter
2 small cans of condensed cream of chicken soup
2 carrots, peeled & chopped
1 onion, diced
1 stalk celery, washed well and chopped
2 (10 ounce) packages refrigerated biscuit dough, roll them out and cut into strips

Directions:
1. Place the chicken, butter, soup, carrots, celery and onion in a crock pot.
2. Fill the crock with enough water to cover.
3. Cover.  Cook for 5 to 6 hours on High, or 9 to 10 hours on Low.
4. About 30 minutes before serving, place biscuit dough strips in the crock pot. Cook until the dough is no longer raw in the center.
Variation: Omit water and vegetables, substitue with 3 cups chicken broth, and use bisquick drop dumplings instead of the biscuits. (Good substitute if you donâ€™t have bisquits on hand!)
