Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup butter, softened
8 eggs
2 cups white sugar
1 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoon lemon zest
2 teaspoons lemon extract
1 teaspoon orange extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix 2 cups of flour and confectioner's sugar together. Cut in the butter or margarine. Mix well until the dough resembles pie dough consistency. Press the dough into a 9x13 inch baking pan.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
Beat together eggs, sugar, 4 tablespoons flour, lemon juice and lemon rind for at least 1 minute. Pour the mixture over the baked crust.
Bake the bars another 20 minutes, or until the lemon topping has set. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar when cooled.
