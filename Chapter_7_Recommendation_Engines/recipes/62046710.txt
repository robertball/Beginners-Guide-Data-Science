Ingredients:
4 whole trout, or fillets
2 medium onions
1 large bunch of fresh parsley
salt to taste

Directions:
Cut a piece of foil to wrap each fish.  I double wrap them to protect against leaks.  Make sure fish is clean, and lightly salt insides of fish or both sides of fillets.  Finely chop onions and parsley, by hand or throw it all in a food processor.  Divide onion and parsley mixture equally and fill fish with mixture.  If using fillets, stack mixture on top of the fillet. Securely wrap in foil, and place each fish packet in a baking dish or on a cookie sheet.  Bake 350-375 for 30-45 minutes or until fish becomes very flaky.  The juices from the fish packets make an awesome sauce to pour over parsleyed potatoes!

Description: 
A German exchange student taught us this recipe and my family who couldn't stand fish LOVES this one!  Although we learned it with trout, we've tried it with all kids of fish and have loved it with Orange Roughy (the best), Talipia, and Salmon!  The whole family loves fish now!
