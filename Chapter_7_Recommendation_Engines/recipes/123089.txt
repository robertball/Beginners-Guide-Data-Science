Add potatoes, onions and peppers to the pan; place bacon over chicken breast. Bake 1 hour longer, basting often. Add tomatoes to the pan.

Description: 
I'VE never shared this recipe before, even with members of my own family. I use it only for special occasions such as Christmas.    I found the recipe in the first real good cookbook I owned, and my six children love it. I've also been inspired to enter cooking contests and have won several times. -Mary Dunphy, Stephenville, Newfoundland
