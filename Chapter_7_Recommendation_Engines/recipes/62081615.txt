Ingredients:
Juice and grated zest of 1 large lemon
1 26 to 28-oz. jar tomato-based pasta sauce
1 (1-lb.) package frozen cut leaf spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1/3 cup raisins
1 25-ounce package frozen cheese ravioli, uncooked
1 Â½ cups shredded Italian cheese blend
2 large plum tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped
2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves, chopped
2 tablespoons pine nuts, lightly toasted

Directions:
Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish or pan with nonstick cooking spray; reserve.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Stir lemon juice (reserve zest for later use) into pasta sauce, then spoon one-third of the sauce into prepared baking dish.  Layer with half each of the spinach, raisins and ravioli (may be necessary to place frozen ravioli in a colander and rinse with water to separate).  Top with another one-third of the sauce.
Repeat layers, ending with sauce.  Cover tightly with foil and bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove from oven; remove foil cover and sprinkle with shredded cheese blend and return to oven, cooking uncovered until hot and bubbly, about 10 additional minutes.
During the baking time, toss together plum tomatoes, basil, pine nuts and reserved lemon zest.
Remove from oven; sprinkle with plum tomato mixture and serve while hot.  Makes 6 to 8 servings.
