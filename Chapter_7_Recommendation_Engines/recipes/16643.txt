Ingredients:
1/2 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon margarine
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups milk
1 cup chicken broth
2 (12 ounce) cans whole kernel corn
2 1/2 tablespoons cream cheese
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
ground cayenne pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large pot over medium heat, combine the onion, garlic, parsley and butter or margarine. Saute for about 5 minutes, or until onions are tender.
Add the flour, stirring well, to make a pasty mixture. Whisk in the milk and the broth. Add the corn and the cream cheese and allow to heat through. Add the garlic salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper to taste. Stir together and serve.

Description: 
This soup is really easy to make, lower in fat than most cream soups, and delicious - especially if you are fighting off a cold! Try adding a chopped green chile pepper sauteed in the initial onion mixture or some small slices of chicken stirred in.
