Ingredients:
3 eggs
1/3 cup water
About 1 cup hot red-pepper sauce (we use Texas Pete)
2 cups self-rising flour
1 tsp pepper
1 chicken (1 lb. to 2 1/2 lbs.),  cut into pieces
House seasoning (1 cup salt, 1/4 cup black pepper, 1/4 cup garlic powder; mix ingredients together and store in airtight container for up to 6 months)
Oil, for frying (we use peanut oil)

Directions:
In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the water. Add enough hot sauce so the egg mixture is bright orange.
In another bowl, combine the flour and pepper. Season the chicken with the house seasoning. Dip the seasoned chicken in the egg, then coat well in the flour mixture.
Heat the oil to 350 F in a deep pot. Do not fill the pot more than half full with oil.
Fry the chicken in the oil until brown and crisp. Dark meat takes longer than white meat. It should take dark meat about 13 to 14 min, white meat around 8 to 10 min.
