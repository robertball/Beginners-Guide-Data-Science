Ingredients:
12 large Thai red chillies (dried or fresh)
3 tsp coriander seeds
1/2 tsp cumin seeds
2 green cardamom pods
1/4 tsp black peppercorns
1/4 tsp white peppercorns
3 mild green chili peppers, roasted and peeled
2 tsp ground mace
1 inch piece galangal root-skin removed, chopped
2 Tbsp fresh lemongrass - lower 1/3 only, chopped
1/2 kaffir lime peels
1 shallot
3 cloves of garlic, crushed
1 tsp soft tofu
1 tsp vegan Worcestershire sauce
1 Tbsp sesame oil
1 Tbsp water, optional

Directions:
Wearing rubber gloves, seed the red chilies, discarding the seeds. If using dried chilis, soak the chilies in fresh water for 10 minutes. Set aside.
Put the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and cardamom pods into a small pan and toast over low-medium heat, just until fragrant. About 2 minutes.
In a mortar, add the toasted seed medley, black peppercorns, and white peppercorns and crush them all together with a pestle until a ground powder has been achieved.
In the same mortar, or in a food processor, add all the ingredients, beating or pulsing until a paste has been achieved. If the paste is too dry to work with, then you may need to add a bit of water or a drop of sesame oil.

Description: 
My version of gluten free and fish free Thai red curry paste. I couldn't find a jarred version of curry paste that was both gluten and fish free. This is a combination of Thai ingredients available in my area.
