Ingredients:
2 cups flaked coconut
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
2 (5 ounce) packages instant banana pudding mix
6 cups cold milk
3 bananas, sliced
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, use fingers to mix together coconut, flour and sugar with butter until a crumbly mixture is formed.  Spread on a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until light brown, stirring occasionally, 45 minutes.
Prepare pudding mix with cold milk according to package directions.  In a 9x13 inch dish, sprinkle two-thirds of the coconut mixture.  Spread the prepared pudding over the crust.  Top with sliced bananas and whipped topping.  Sprinkle remaining crust on top and refrigerate until serving.
