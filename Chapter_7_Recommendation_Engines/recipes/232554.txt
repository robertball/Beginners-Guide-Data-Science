Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir chorizo into chicken mixture.

Description: 
A spicy chicken and chile dish. A good friend of mine from Guadalajara who works hard to make this on the stove inspired me to make my own version in the slow cooker. Serve on tostada shells and garnish with chopped cilantro and onions.
