Description: 
Seasoned with oregano and cheese, Martha Chayet's tomatoes take on a wonderfully intense flavor as they roast in the oven.  'Serve these warm as a side dish,' she suggests from her home in Manchester-by-the Sea, Massachusetts. 'They are very nice with grilled chicken. This dish is good year-round-even in winter, when tomatoes aren't at their best.'
