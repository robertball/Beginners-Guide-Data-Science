Ingredients:
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
3/4 teaspoon salt
4 egg yolks
2 1/2 cups milk
1 tablespoon espresso powder
1 (4 ounce) bar Ghirardelli 100% Cacao Unsweetened Chocolate Baking Bar, broken or chopped into 1-inch pieces
1 (9 inch) graham cracker crust
1 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In bowl, whisk together granulated sugar, cornstarch, salt and egg yolks. In saucepan, heat milk with 1 tablespoon of the espresso powder to just under a simmer, whisk into egg yolk mixture. Pour back into saucepan; cook, whisking constantly, until thick. Add chocolate; whisk until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Pour into crust and press plastic wrap onto surface of filling; refrigerate at least 1 hour or until set.
Just before serving, whisk cream with confectioners sugar, vanilla and remaining 1/2 teaspoon espresso powder until soft peaks form. Cut pie into 8 slices; top each slice with a dollop of the whipped cream. (If you prefer, mound the whipped cream on top of the pie and spread it with a spatula before cutting.)
