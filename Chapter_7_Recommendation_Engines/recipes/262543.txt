Ingredients:
4 ounces self-rising flour
4 ounces white sugar
1 ounce unsweetened cocoa powder
1 pinch salt
1 egg
1/4 cup milk
2 ounces margarine, melted
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
Sauce:
4 ounces brown sugar
1 ounce unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 pint warm water

Directions:
Mix flour, sugar, 1 ounce cup cocoa powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add egg, milk, melted margarine, and vanilla extract. Stir well to combine and transfer to a large microwave-safe bowl with sides at least 2 inches high.
Combine brown sugar and 1 ounce cocoa powder in a bowl. Sprinkle on top of the batter in the microwave-safe bowl. Pour warm water gently over the cake; use a fork to gently prick a few holes in the cake to allow water to seep in.
Cook in the microwave on high power for 5 minutes. Serve with ice cream or custard.

Description: 
This 7-minute gooey chocolate cake recipe is one I have known since I was a child. It is a great one to rustle up in the microwave if you are in need of a quick chocolate fix, as it comes out as a chocolate sponge cake with a delicious sauce hidden at the bottom. Great with ice cream!
