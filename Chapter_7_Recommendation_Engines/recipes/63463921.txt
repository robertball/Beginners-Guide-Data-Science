Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
36-40 miniature chocolate covered peanut butter cups, unwrapped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda; set aside.
Cream together the butter, sugar, peanut butter and brown sugar until fluffy. Beat in the egg and vanilla.  Add the flour mixture; mix well. Shape into 40 balls and place each into an ungreased mini muffin pan.
Bake at 350 degrees for about 8 minutes, or when the centers begin to sink and the cookies are very lightly browned. Remove from oven and immediately press a mini peanut butter cup into each ball. Cool and carefully remove from pan.
