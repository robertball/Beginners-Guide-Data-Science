Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound boneless pork tenderloin, cubed
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 carrot, thinly sliced
1 Granny Smith apple, peeled and sliced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 1/2 cups apple cider or fresh pressed apple juice
1 cup sodium-reduced chicken broth
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons cornstarch
4 cups baby spinach
2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1/2 (12 ounce) package NO YOLKS® Extra Broad Noodles

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet set over medium-high heat. Season the pork with 1/4 teaspoon (1 mL) each salt and pepper. Add to the skillet and brown all over; transfer to a bowl.
Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion, carrot, apple, rosemary and remaining salt and pepper; cook, stirring often, until tender. Whisk the cider with the broth, mustard and cornstarch. Stir into the skillet. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to medium-low. Return the pork to the skillet. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until cooked through. Stir in the spinach and vinegar; remove from the heat.
Meanwhile, prepare the noodles according to package directions. Arrange the noodles in a serving dish. Spoon the pork mixture over to serve.
