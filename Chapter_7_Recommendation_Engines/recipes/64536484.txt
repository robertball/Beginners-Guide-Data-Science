Ingredients:
* 1 package, lemon Oreo cookies, divided
* 3 Tablespoons butter, melted
* 1 (8ounce pkg.) cream cheese, room temperature
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 (3.4 ounce pkg.) instant lemon pudding mix
* 1 cup milk
* 1 large (16 ounce) carton, frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
1) Preheat oven to 350 degrees f. In a food processor, crush about 22 of the Oreos. Pour the Oreos into a 9inch pie plate. Stir in the melted butter, and press the mixture to the bottom and sides of the pie pate, forming the crust.
2) With a hand or stand mixer, cream together the room temperature cream cheese an sugar until smooth . Add the milk and pudding mix, and beat until smooth and creamy. Lastly fold in half (8 ounce) of the whipped topping to the pudding mixture. Pour the filling into the cooled pie shell. Refrigerate for 2-3 hours or until set. Top the pie with the remaining  whipped topping, and Oreo's. Enjoy!
Note: use less butter in the crust, the recipe calls for baking the crust but DONT bake the crust.
