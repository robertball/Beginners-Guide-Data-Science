Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon margarine, melted
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven toe 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Beat softened margarine or butter and cream cheese until thoroughly combined. Stir in flour.
Using 24 ungreased 1 3/4 inch mini muffin cups, press a rounded teaspoon of pastry evenly into the bottom and up the sides of each cup.
To Make The Filling: Beat the egg and mix in the brown sugar, melted margarine or butter and the chopped pecans.
Fill each pastry-lined muffin cup with about 1 heaping teaspoon of pecan filling.  Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for about 30 minutes or until pastry is golden and filling is puffed.  Cool slightly in the muffin cups, then remove and cool completely on a wire rack.
