Ingredients:
3 cups biscuit/baking mix
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup, undiluted
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup diced pepperoni
2 tablespoons chopped ripe olives
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning

Directions:
Place the biscuit mix in a large bowl. Combine the remaining ingredients; stir into biscuit mix just until moistened. Fill greased muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 17-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from the pans to wire racks. Serve warm.

Description: 
Loaded with pizza flavor, these moist muffins are served at Andrea McGee's home regularly. 'They're great for lunch but also make good appetizers when baked in mini muffin cups,' suggests the Port Alsworth, Alaska reader. 'Try adding chopped mushrooms or green pepper to the batter.'
