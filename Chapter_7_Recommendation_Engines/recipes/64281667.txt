Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles
1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
3/4 cup grated carrot
1/2 bunch kale, stemmed and chopped
1/2 head of cauliflower, chopped into small florets
3/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
3/4 cup chopped onion
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 (26 ounce) jars pasta sauce
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 packages frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1 (15 ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese
4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 eggs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook the lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.
In a large saucepan, cook and stir  mushrooms, carrot, kale, cauliflower, green peppers, onion, and garlic in oil. Stir in pasta sauce, basil and Italian seasoning; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes.
Mix together spinach, ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread 1 cup tomato sauce into the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer 1/2 each, lasagna noodles, ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Repeat layering, and top with remaining 2 cups mozzarella cheese.
Bake, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.
