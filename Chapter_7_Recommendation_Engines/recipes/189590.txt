Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 whole chicken
40 cloves garlic
¼ cup water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon dried thyme
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt the butter with the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the chicken to the Dutch oven and brown on all sides in the butter and oil, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the chicken to a cutting board.
Drain all but 2 tablespoons of liquid from the pan; stir the garlic cloves into the reserved liquid. Return the chicken to the pan; sprinkle the water, lemon juice, salt, thyme, and black pepper over the chicken; cover tightly.
Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 90 minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing.
