Ingredients:
8 slices SmithfieldÂ® bacon
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 1/2 cups whole milk
1/3 cup melted butter, plus more for greasing
1 egg
1 1/2 cups sharp Cheddar cheese, grated
1/4 cup chopped fresh herbs, such as dill, parsley, and chives
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 cup maple syrup
Romaine lettuce leaves
Sliced tomatoes

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Arrange bacon on a broiler pan and bake until crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove the bacon and reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees F.
Preheat a waffle iron to high.
In a large bowl, whisk the flours, baking powder, kosher salt, and few grinds of black pepper. In a medium bowl, whisk the milk, 1/3 cup melted butter, and egg. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir just to combine. Stir in the cheese and herbs.
Brush the waffle iron with melted butter and spoon in about 1/2 of the batter. Close and cook until the waffle is browned and crisp. Transfer the waffle to a plate and keep warm in the oven. Make another waffle with the remaining batter. Quarter the two waffles, creating 8 smaller waffles.
Mix Dijon mustard and maple syrup. Set aside.
To make a sandwich: top a waffle with the bacon, lettuce, and tomato. Drizzle on some maple-mustard sauce. Add another waffle to top.
