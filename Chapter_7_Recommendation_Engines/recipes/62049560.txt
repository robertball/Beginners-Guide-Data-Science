Pour the hot mixture over these ingredients and stir. Pour into a long cookie sheet.  The kind with the sides about an inch high so the mix doesn't spill out. Cook at 400 degrees for about 15 min.  Don't cook to long or they won't be moist. Get the frosting ready while the brownies are baking and cook in a pan. In a saucepan add the stuff for the frosting..add the butter, cocoa and buttermilk. Bring to a boil then turn the stove off.  Add a 1  lb. box of powdered sugar, the vanilla and coconut stir then add the walnuts.  Spread frosting while the brownies are still hot.  They won't spread if the browines are cool.  You have to hurry and spread them before the frosting gets to thick.  You can keep them at room temp or if you want put them in the fridge. Enjoy!

Description: 
If you LOVE brownies, but aren't sure what to think of the buttermilk, just try it. These taste more like a cake. My mom has made these for years and everybody always asks her to make them for functions and dinner parties.  These are really sweet tasting. My husband doesn't like coconut, but likes this recipe.
