Ingredients:
1 pound breakfast sausage
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls
1 egg white

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir in cream cheese.
Unroll crescent dough and separate into individual pieces; spoon 2 to 3 teaspoons sausage mixture onto each piece of dough. Roll dough around filling. Brush each crescent roll with egg white. Arrange crescent rolls on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
