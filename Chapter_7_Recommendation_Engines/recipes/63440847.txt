Ingredients:
1 Pound Good Quality Sausage (I use Jimmy Dean)
1 Pound Cream Cheese
1 Can of Rotel

Directions:
Brown the sausage and drain, soften cream cheese in the microwave for 30 seconds, drain can of Rotel from excess juices (I like to use the HOT Rotel, but you can use whatever kind you prefer) put all ingredients  into a crock pot on low, stir together and serve with “On the Border” or Frito's Scoops!!  I warn you it will go fast so think about doubling or even tripling this recipe!
