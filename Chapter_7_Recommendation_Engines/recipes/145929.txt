Ingredients:
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root
1 star anise pod (optional)
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch paprika
1/2 teaspoon honey
1/2 cup diced celery
1/2 cup diced apples
1/4 cup diced red onion
1/4 cup chopped raisins
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root

Directions:
Place the 1-inch piece of ginger and star anise in a pot of water over medium-heat and bring to a boil. Add chicken to the water. Lower heat to medium-low; simmer until chicken is no longer pink the middle, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove to a plate to cool. Once cool to the touch, dice into bite-sized pieces.
Make a dressing by whisking together the mayonnaise, salt, pepper, paprika, and honey; set aside.
Combine the diced chicken, celery, apple, onion, raisins, walnuts and 2 teaspoons minced ginger in a bowl. Drizzle dressing into the chicken mixture; stir until pieces are evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

My mom really likes the DC Chicken Salad at Corner Bakery, so I came up with a copy that tastes as good as the real thing. Enjoy!
