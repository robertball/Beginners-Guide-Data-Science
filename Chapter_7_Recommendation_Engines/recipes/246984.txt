Ingredients:
2 fluid ounces light rum
1/2 fluid ounce hibiscus syrup
1/2 fluid ounce freshly squeezed lime juice
3 dashes aromatic bitters (such as AngosturaÂ®)
ice cubes
4 fluid ounces ginger beer, or more to taste

Directions:
Combine rum, hibiscus syrup, lime juice, and bitters in a highball glass. Add enough ice to bring liquid volume up halfway; stir to combine. Top mixture with ginger beer.

Description: 
Bucks refer to drinks that combine lime and ginger beer, so a dark and stormy with lime is an example of a buck. In this version, I introduced aromatic bitters and homemade hibiscus syrup for extra flavor and a blush of color. Add your choice of garnish, such as a lime twist or a fresh hibiscus flower. Serve with a straw.
