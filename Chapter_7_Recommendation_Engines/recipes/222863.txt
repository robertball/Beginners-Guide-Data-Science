Ingredients:
2 ears corn on the cob, husks and silk removed
2 tomatoes, chopped
2 avocados - peeled, pitted, and diced
1/2 bunch cilantro, stems cut off and leaves chopped
1 white onion, chopped
3 tablespoons chopped garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
kosher salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook corn on the preheated grill until the kernels are lightly charred but still firm, 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning often. Cut kernels off the cobs, transfer to a large salad bowl, and let cool.
Mix in tomatoes, avocados, cilantro, white onion, garlic, olive oil, and red wine vinegar; season with kosher salt.

Description: 
This is a recipe I have been making for years. It is the number one dish people ask me to bring to parties. It is great with tortilla chips or on top of grilled chicken or steak. It also makes a wonderful filling for vegetarian tacos.
