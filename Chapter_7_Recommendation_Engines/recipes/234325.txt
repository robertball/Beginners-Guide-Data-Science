Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
1 3/4 cups pancake mix
1 cup water, or as needed
2 bananas, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup ground cinnamon

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix pancake mix and water together until batter is smooth. Dip each banana slice in the pancake batter until fully coated.
Fry coated banana slices, 3 to 4 at a time, in the hot oil until lightly browned, about 1 minute per side; remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle pancake pops with sugar and cinnamon.

Description: 
Banana pancake pops will cook easy and taste great. Warning: very addictive once tried. Don't worry if the first couple are darker then the rest. You'll get used to how long they should fry.
