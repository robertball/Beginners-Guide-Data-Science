Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup plain Greek 2 percent yogurt
1/2 cup cottage cheese
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 10-ounce box frozen spinach, thawed, drained, then squeezed dry
1 (8-ounce) can water chestnuts, coarsely chopped
Black pepper
Lemon
1 round loaf bakery wheat bread, the top sliced off and diced into 1-inch cubes, and the inside torn out and cut or pulled into pieces.

Directions:
Heat oil in a wide frying pan over medium heat and saute onion with salt, stirring frequently, until it's very nicely browned, about 15 minutes. Add garlic right at the end, and saute, stirring, another minute before turning off the heat. Meanwhile in a food processor whir together yogurt, cottage cheese, and mayonnaise until smooth. Add the slightly cooled onion mixture and spinach, and whir until nearly smooth. Scrape dip into a bowl, stir in water chestnuts, then season to taste with pepper, a squeeze or two of lemon juice, and more salt. Scoop into the hollowed loaf or — good-bye germs! — individually hollowed-out rolls, and serve with raw veggies and the bread innards or pita chips.
