Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
3/4 cup caramel sauce
3 (1.4 ounce) bars chocolate covered toffee, chopped
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tbsp sugar

Directions:
Line cupcake pan with foil cupcake liners. Make cupcakes from devil's food cake mix according to package directions; cool on wire rack for 5 minutes.   Using the end of a wooden spoon, poke a hole in the top of each cupcake, making sure not to go through to the bottom.
In a saucepan over low heat, combine sweetened condensed milk and caramel sauce, stirring until smooth and blended.  Slowly pour the warm caramel mixture into the hole of each cupcake, letting it sink in. Let cupcakes cool completely.
In a small mixing bowl, mix whipping cream with sugar. Beat until soft peaks form, then pour into a pastry bag.
Using pastry bag, top each cupcake with a dollop of whipped cream. Top with crushed candy bars. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
