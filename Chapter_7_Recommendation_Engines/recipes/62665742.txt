Beef Onion Bonus Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
2 (14 oz) cans beef broth
2 cups water
2 medium carrots, cut crosswise to make small circles
1 onion, julienned
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 bay leaves
2 medium sprigs thyme
3 tbsp Grand Marnier
1 lb package beef round cubes
1/4 cup cooking wine
1 package of herbed croutons, enough for 6 people
Shredded Gruyere cheese, enough for 6 people

Directions:
In a large soup pot, bring the first seven ingredients to a boil.  Cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.
Remove from heat, and immediately stir in the Grand Marnier.
In a separate pan sear the cubed beef.  When each piece is approximately medium rare, add it to the soup pot.  It will continue cooking in the pot.
Allow the pan to cool slightly, then pour wine into the pan.  It should lightly cover the entire bottom of the pan; add more if neccessary.  Over a low heat, stir to remove the fats and meat parts stuck to the pan.  Pour into the soup.
If necessary, bring the soup back to a boil, but do not cook for too long or the beef will become chewy.
Remove thyme and bay leaves before serving.  Serve with herbed croutons and top with shredded Gruyere cheese.

Description: 
I had a gravy recipe (which failed to congeal) but which seemed to have some great flavors.  So I used all the same spices and flavorings to make a soup.
