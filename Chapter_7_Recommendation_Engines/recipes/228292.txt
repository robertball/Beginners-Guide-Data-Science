Description: 
A recipe that my mom used to make when we were little and picky about what we ate. Now I feed it to my family and friends and everybody loves it! Good for a day when you don't want to stand at a stove forever but still want a really nice meal. For more flavor, you can add already mixed Italian dressing to the mayo and dry Italian blend.
