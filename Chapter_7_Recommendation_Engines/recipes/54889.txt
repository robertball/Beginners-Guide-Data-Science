Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups heavy cream
1/2 cup butter at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large heavy saucepan, combine the white sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Bring to a boil and heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.
Stir in the butter and heavy cream carefully - the mixture will bubble up. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Cool slightly before dipping apples or other fruit; caramel should cling to a spoon and drip slowly. Let apples set on waxed paper or parchment.
