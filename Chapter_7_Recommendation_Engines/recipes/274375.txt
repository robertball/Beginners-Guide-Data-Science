Ingredients:
3/4 cup fresh peaches, peeled and diced
1 small red bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion
2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 clove garlic, minced
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon Caribbean jerk seasoning
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 pork tenderloin

Directions:
Combine peaches, bell pepper, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Set peach salsa aside.
Combine olive oil, brown sugar, Caribbean jerk seasoning, thyme, rosemary, and seasoned salt in a second small bowl. Rub tenderloin with the spice mixture.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place tenderloin on hot grill and cook covered for 9 to 11 minutes. Turn and grill until tenderloin is slightly pink in the center, 9 to 11 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for 5 minutes before slicing. Serve with peach salsa.
