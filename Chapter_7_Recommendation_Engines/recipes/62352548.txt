Ingredients:
•	2 tablespoon olive oil
•	2 tablespoons minced shallots
•	2 tablespoons thin sliced celery
•	1 tablespoon chopped garlic
•	1 pound crawfish tails
•	Essence Creole Seasoning, recipe follows
•	1/8 tsp Tony’s Creole Seasoning
•	3 tablespoons chopped green onions
•	2 cups heavy cream
•	½ Stick Real Butter, Melted ( for roux )
•	2 tablespoons flour ( for roux )
•	4 (6 ounces) firm fish fillets, such as catfish, snapper, or red fish
•	1 cup buttermilk
•	1/2 cup flour
•	1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
•	1/2 cup vegetable oil for frying
Creole Seasoning ( Emerils Bayou Blast Seasoning) -
•	2 1/2 tablespoons paprika
•	2 tablespoons salt
•	2 tablespoons garlic powder
•	1 tablespoon black pepper
•	1 tablespoon onion powder
•	1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
•	1 tablespoon dried oregano
•	1 tablespoon dried thyme

Directions:
In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the shallots and celery and saute for 1 minute. Add the garlic and crawfish tails and continue to saute for 2 minutes. Season the tails with Essence. Add the green onions. Stir in the cream and bring the liquid to a boil. Melt butter and add flour, then add to sauce.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the liquid thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 4 minutes. Place the fillets in a glass bowl and cover with the buttermilk. Season the mixture with Essence. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator. Marinate the fish for about 30 minutes. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator and drain. In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and cornmeal. Season the flour with Essence. Dredge the fillets in the seasoned flour, coating each side completely. In another large pan, heat the vegetable oil. When the oil is hot, add the fillets and pan-fry for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until the fillets are golden brown and the flesh is flaky. Remove the fish from the pan and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the fillets with Essence. Serve the fish with the sauce spooned over the top.
