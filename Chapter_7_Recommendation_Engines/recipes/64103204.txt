Heat your outdoor grill to a medium-high temperature.
Portion out 16 patties on a clean work area.
Take 8 patties and line in a row.
Divide the vegetable mixture to the center of each patty leaving enough room on the edge to seal.
Top with the remaining 8 patties then use a fork to seal the edges.
Grill until your desired doneness!
