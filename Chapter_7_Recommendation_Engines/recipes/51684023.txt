Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) thick cut pork chops
8 slices smoked Gouda cheese
1/2 pound fresh spinach, rinsed and torn into bite-size pieces
Emeril's seasoning
Fresh ground pepper
3 tablespoons horseradish mustard
1 cup panko crumbs  or breadcrumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Lay each chop flat on cutting board, and with a sharp knife held parallel to the board, cut a pocket into the pork, leaving three sides intact. Stuff each chop with spinach, and then with cheese.  Sprinkle with seasoning to taste.
Place panko crumbs in a shallow dish. Coat each chop with a thin layer of horseradish, and then roll in crumbs. Arrange chops in prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until brown and crispy.
