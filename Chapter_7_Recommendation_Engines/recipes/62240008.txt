Ingredients:
3 large baking potatoes
1 (14.5 ounce) can of chicken broth
1 (10 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 teaspoon Lawry’s seasoning salt
cheddar cheese, bacon, and green onions (as garnish)

Directions:
Peel and cube potatoes. Place them in slow cooker and cover with chicken broth, evaporated milk, and Lawry’s. Cook on low for about 6 hours or until potatoes are fork tender. Use a slotted spoon to scoop most of the potato chunks out and place in a bowl. Mash with a potato masher or fork. Transfer back to slow cooker and stir to combine everything. Serve with cheddar, bacon, and green onions if desired.
