Ingredients:
Sugar Cookies:
1 c. all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. baking powder
1/3 c. shortening
1/3 c. white sugar
1 eggs
1/2 tsp. vanilla
Fondant:
6 c. marshmallows
1 c. white chocolate chips
2 tbsp. butter
icing sugar
1 c. abnosome (optional but recommended)
12 Fruit Roll-Ups

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375Â° F for the cookies.
Sift flour, then measure and sift with salt and baking powder.
Cream together the shortening and sugar.
Beat in the egg and add in the vanilla to the wet ingredients.
Mix the wet and dry ingredients together. Roll the dough and then cut out the dinomite shapes with a cookie cutter or by hand.
Place the cookies on a greased cookie sheet and bake.
While the cookies bake, heat the chocolate chips in the microwave until they are melted.
Add the chips to a bowl of marshmallows and mix together.
Once these are mixed microwave the mixture again so that it is a creamy texture, add water if necessary to get the desired texture.
Next, add icing sugar to the mixture, until the fondant becomes a dough-like consistency. Add food colouring if you so please.
Roll out the fondant like dough, and create the same shapes as the cookies in order to place them on top and make beautifully decorated cookies.
Cut out a cape from the Fruit Roll-Ups as well as some underwear for the Dinomite, and add these to the cookies.
