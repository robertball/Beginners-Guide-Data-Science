Ingredients:
3/4 cup yellow mustard seeds
1/4 cup brown mustard seeds
2 cloves garlic minced
1 cup champagne
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
2 T brown sugar
1 t salt
1/2 t black pepper
1/2 t dried dill

Directions:
Put mustard seeds in a medium sized bowl. Add champagne, dill and vinegar to cover. Let sit in the fridge for 24 hours. If the seeds soak up the liquid quickly, add more champagne or water. Place all ingredients into a food processor and blend until the desired consistency is reached, depending upon how grainy you like your mustard. Place finished mustard into 3 sterilized half pint jars and store in the fridge for 2 weeks before using.
