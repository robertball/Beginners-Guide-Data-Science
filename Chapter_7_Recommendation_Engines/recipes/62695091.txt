Ingredients:
1/3 cup warm water
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons orange juice
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon white vinegar
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1 teaspoon grated orange peel
2 tablespoons olive oil
handful of chopped green onions (scallions)
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cubed
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons cold water

Directions:
Stir together warm water, brown sugar, orange juice, soy sauce, ketchup, white vinegar, garlic, red pepper flakes, five-spice powder, orange peel, and scallions until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is well combined. Marinate chicken in mixture overnight and/or for the day.
Cook chicken and marinade in covered skillet for 30 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
Whisk the cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of cold water in a small bowl until smooth, and stir into the chicken and sauce, a few teaspoons at a time. Let the chicken and sauce cook for about 2 minutes to thicken. Serve over hot cooked rice with sauteed broccoli on the side.
