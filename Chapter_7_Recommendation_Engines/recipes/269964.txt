Directions:
Whisk water and masa harina together in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil. Add milk and cinnamon. Continue stirring until thick and bubbly.

Description: 
A wonderful, rich, thick drink. Like a cross between hot cocoa and pudding. Can never remember my tweaks to this recipe, so decided to post it. Officially called champurrado, but I call it what I can pronounce.
