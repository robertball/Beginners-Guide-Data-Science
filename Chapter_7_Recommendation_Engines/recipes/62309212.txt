Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
4 (2.5 ounce) packages Fritos or Doritos
2 cups shredded lettuce
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/3 cup salsa in a squeeze bottle
1/2 cup sour cream in a squeeze bottle

Directions:
Place ground beef in a large skillet. Cook and stir over medium heat until browned. Drain excess oil. Mix in the taco seasoning and prepare according to the directions on the package.  Meat can be kept warm in a crock pot until ready to be served.
With the bags unopened, gently crush the corn chips. Snip the corners off the bags using scissors and slit open the bags along the side edge. Spoon 1/4 cup of beef mixture into bag and have lettuce, Cheddar cheese, salsa and sour cream available to be mixed into the bags on top of the crushed chips. Serve in the bag and eat using a fork.
