2 teaspoons canola oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon molasses

Directions:
Flatten pork slices to 1/2-in. thickness. In a nonstick skillet, brown pork in oil over medium-high heat. Remove and keep warm.
In the same skillet, saute garlic for 1 minute; stir in the brown sugar, orange juice, molasses, salt and pepper. Return pork to pan; cook, uncovered, for 3-4 minutes or until pork is no longer pink.

Description: 
'This easy treatment for pork caught my eye when I was paging through a cookbook and saw the word 'caramelized,' Elisa Lochridge recalls from her home in Aloha, Oregon. 'The slightly sweet glaze is yummy. I like to serve this over noodles or rice...or with mashed potatoes.'
