Ingredients:
2 lbs. Ground Beef
2 eggs
1/2 large yellow onion diced
1/2 lage green bell pepper diced
1 cup italian bread crumbs
1 TBS. Creole Seasoning (cajun injector shake)
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 - 2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. black pepper
1 can tomato sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large bowl combine all ingredients except the tomato sauce and mush together until completely blended.
Place in 2 loaf pans of a sqaure baking dish and press in firmly. If there is extra left over place in small loaf pans, it makes great single size loafs for lunch boxes.
Top with tomato sauce and bake for  1 hour or until  juices run clear.
Drain off any fat and serve warm with your favorite sides. We love mashed potatos and green beans with out meat loaf.
