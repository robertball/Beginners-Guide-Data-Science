Ingredients:
•8 ounces uncooked spaghetti
•1-1/2 cups frozen broccoli cuts
•1/2 cup julienned sweet red, yellow and/or green    pepper
•1/4 cup coarsely chopped onion
•1/2 pound smoked sausage, cut into 1/2-inch slices (I use the Hillshire Farm Turkey Polska Kielbasa)
•1/4 cup water
•3/4 cup evaporated milk
•2 tablespoons butter
•1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
•1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a Dutch oven, cook spaghetti according to package directions, adding broccoli, pepper and onion during the last 4 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, bring sausage and water to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 7-8 minutes or until heated through. Add milk, butter and Italian seasoning; cook and stir until butter is melted.
Drain spaghetti and vegetables; return to the pan. Add Parmesan cheese and sausage mixture; toss to coat.
