Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/4 cup sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups fat-free milk
1/3 cup canola oil
1/4 cup egg substitute
3/4 cup chopped dried apricots
1/3 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, oats, sugars, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice and salt. In another bowl, combine milk, oil and egg substitute until blended; stir into dry ingredients just until blended (batter will be thin). Fold in the apricots and walnuts.
Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
