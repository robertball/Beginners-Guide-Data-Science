Ingredients:
Dressing:
1 cup olive oil
1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
1 shallot, diced
1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon honey
1 pinch kosher salt
Salad:
2 cups water
1 cube chicken bouillon
1 cup quinoa
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 red onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch fresh kale, chopped
1 cup pine nuts
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Blend 1 cup olive oil, lemon juice, shallot, Dijon mustard, honey, and kosher salt together in a blender until dressing is smooth and creamy.
Bring water and chicken bouillon to a boil in a saucepan; add quinoa, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Fluff quinoa with a fork and transfer to a large bowl.
Heat remaining olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; saute onion and garlic in hot oil until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir kale into onion mixture; saute until kale is tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir kale mixture into quinoa. Pour dressing over the top and add pine nuts and avocado; toss to coat. Serve warm or cold.
