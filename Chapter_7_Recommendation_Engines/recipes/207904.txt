Ingredients:
3 pounds carrots, peeled and chopped
5 tablespoons cornflake crumbs
6 eggs
2 cups milk
3 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup melted butter
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 cups cornflake crumbs

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan, and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the carrots, recover, and steam until very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain water, remove steamer basket, and return carrots to pan; mash with an electric mixer until smooth.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 12 cup ring mold or Bundt(R) pan; sprinkle mold with 5 tablespoons corn flake crumbs.
Crack the eggs into a large bowl and beat at high speed until light yellow, about 1 minute. Stir in the cooked carrots, milk, Cheddar cheese, butter, onion, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, nutmeg, and the remaining 1 1/2 cup corn flake crumbs; mix well. Spoon into prepared mold.
Bake in preheated oven until puffed and lightly browned, abut 1 hour. Remove from oven; let stand 30 minutes before inverting onto serving platter.

Description: 
I am the third generation in my family to have this recipe.  It boasts of cheesy, carroty, savory goodness!  A must-have side dish at all of my family's turkey dinner celebrations!  Although I'm sure it would pair nicely with a roast or a chicken as well.
