Ingredients:
2 bone in, bar-b-qued chicken breast with skin
1/2 can Rotel (Mild or Regular)
1 tbsp. Adobo Seasoning (or to taste)
1 pkg. shredded lettuce
1 avacado mashed and seasoned with salt and pepper
1 cup cheddar cheese
1 cup sour cream
Finely chopped tomato (optional)
Flour or Corn tortillas

Directions:
Remove and discard chicken skin and then pull chicken breast off of bone in large chunks and place in skillet.  It's okay if some of the bar-b-que sauce is still on the chicken. Add Rotel and Adobo Seasoning (to taste). Cover and cook about 10 minutes till chicken is hot.   Warm tortillas in dry skillet till soft.  Place a little cheese down the center of the tortillas then top with chicken, lettuce, sour cream, avacado, tomatoes (optional) and a bit more cheese.  Enjoy!

Description: 
Delicious and easy way to use left-over bar-b-qued chicken breast.  Regardless of what we bar-b-que, we always throw some bone-in chicken breast on the pit so we can have these tacos the next day. Be sure to season the bar-b-que chicken just like you would if you were going to eat them that night and the little bit of bar-b-que sauce that remains on the chicken after you remove the skin make them all the better.  I prefer corn tortillas but my boys like flour.  It's your choice.
