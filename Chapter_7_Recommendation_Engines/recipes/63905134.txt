6 boneless skinless chicken thighs (or breasts -- or a combination!) ? ?

1/2 cup sweet chili sauce
1/2 cup Sambal Oelek ground chili paste
1/2 cup chopped peanuts
3 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Place chicken (trimmed of visible fat) into slow cooker.
Mix together peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, ginger, sweet chili sauce and sambal oelek. Our over chicken.
Cook on Low 8 hours or on High 4 hours.
Serve 1 piece of chicken and sauce with chopped peanuts and cilantro as garnish.

Wonderful with a 1/2 cup of rice on the side.
Remember that you won't be using all the sauce, so the calories and fat that are listed are higher than what you will actually be eating!
