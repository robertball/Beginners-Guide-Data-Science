Description: 
I ordered this martini at a chain restaurant which we don't have in our area when I was visiting family out of town.  I tried one, and fell in love with it.  So I wrote down the ingredients and starting playing around with the measurements.  I found the perfect amount and it tastes even better than the one at the restaurant!  I have used Sugar Free Cranberry Juice with this and it has turned out great!
