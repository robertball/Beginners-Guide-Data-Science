Ingredients:
8 Plum Tomatoes chopped
1 Celery Stalk minced
1 Carrot minced
1 sweet onion minced
4 Cloves of garlic minced
2 TBPS olive oil
1 Can of 15 oz Cannellini Beans
2 Cups of Beef Broth
2 Cups of water
2 TBSP of Parmesan Cheese
Bunch of plain parsley, chopped
Salt and Pepper to taste
1/2 tsp of fresh chopped thyme
1 Bay Leaf
1/2 cup of Eden Organic Vegetable small shell pasta

Directions:
Chop your tomatoes and mince the garlic cloves right on the pile of tomatoes and combine.  Let sit for 10 minutes.  Mince onion, carrot & celery and add to 2 TBSP of olive oil under medium heat.  Cook for 5 minutes.
Add the beef broth, water, tomatoes, beans, bay leaf & thyme and bring to a boil.  After reaching a boil, bring down to a simmer and salt and pepper to taste. I also like to add 1 TBSP of Parmesan Cheese at this point.
Simmer for 30 minutes.  20 minutes into the simmering process, cook your pasta...when finished add the cooked pasta to your mixture and you are done.   Serve the soup and add chopped parsley and the remaining Parmesan to the serving bowls.

Description: 
This recipe combines healthy with the old school version of making Pasta e Fagioli.  This is more of a “brothy” version rather than most of the recipes which I think are too tomato based.  Fresh ingredients and fresh tomatoes are the key.  I like to use whole wheat pasta or a version of this for this recipe since I'm trying to stay away from white starch but feel free to use regular pasta if you like.  The Eden Organic Vegetable Small Shell Pasta is 60% whole wheat and tastes great.
