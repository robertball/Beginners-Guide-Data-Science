Ingredients:
2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts
6 tablespoons Thousand Island salad dressing
1 egg
1 tablespoon milk
1 cup shredded corned beef
6 slices Swiss cheese, cut to fit
3/4 cup pickled red cabbage, well drained

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll out pie crusts on a flat, lightly floured surface. Cut each crust into three 6-inch rounds. Spread Thousand Island dressing evenly over the rounds, leaving a 1/2-inch border.
Whisk egg and milk together to make an egg wash. Brush over the borders.
Divide the corned beef evenly among the 6 rounds, placing it in the center. Top each with Swiss cheese and red cabbage. Bring the sides of the dough to meet in the middle, forming a semi-circle shape. Press to seal and crimp the edges with a fork.
Cut 2 small slits into each hand pie for steam to escape. Brush the top of the pies with the remaining egg wash. Transfer pies to the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until dough is cooked through and golden brown, 17 to 20 minutes. Remove pies from the baking sheet and serve warm.

Description: 
The inspiration for this tasty hand pie comes from a local German restaurant that serves an exceptional Red Reuben sandwich. They swap out sauerkraut for red cabbage on a traditional Reuben sandwich with awesome results. German potato salad and dill pickles are excellent sidekicks.
