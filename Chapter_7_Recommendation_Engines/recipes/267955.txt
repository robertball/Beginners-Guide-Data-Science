Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, diced
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
2 teaspoons chopped garlic
1 (7 ounce) can diced green chiles
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
2 (15 ounce) cans white beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a 4-quart pot over medium-high heat. Saute chicken until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the pot.
Heat remaining 1 teaspoon oil in the same pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic for 3 minutes. Add chiles, cumin, and oregano; cook for 3 minutes more. Add chicken, white beans, and chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Add Monterey Jack cheese and sour cream; cook and stir until cheese melts, 3 to 5 minutes.
