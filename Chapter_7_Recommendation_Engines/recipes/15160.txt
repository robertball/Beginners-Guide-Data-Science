Ingredients:
10 sheets phyllo dough
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium mixing bowl combine cream cheese, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Beat until light and fluffy. Set aside.
Remove thawed phyllo from package and unroll. Keep stack covered with a damp towel at all times to prevent drying out and tearing. Separate one sheet of phyllo from stack, brush lightly with melted butter or margarine, and place sheet in a 9-inch pie pan. Let edges of dough hang over sides of pan. Continue this process with 4 more sheets of phyllo dough. Spread cream cheese mixture evenly into pan.
Spread fruit filling over cream cheese layer. Fold overhanging phyllo dough over fruit layer. Brush another sheet of phyllo with melted butter or margarine and lay over top of pie. Continue this process with remaining 4 sheets of phyllo.
Tuck edges of top phyllo sheets inside pie between pan and filling, sealing well. Cut small slits in top layers of dough to allow steam to escape.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes, ensuring that phyllo doesn't get too brown, just golden. Cool completely before serving. Refrigerate leftovers, if any ...
