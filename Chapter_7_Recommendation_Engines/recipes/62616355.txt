Ingredients:
½ cup hot fudge dessert topping, divided
1 Oreo pie crust
1 tub (8oz) Cool Whip whipped topping, thawed, divided
1 ¼ cups cold milk
2 packages (4 serving size each) Jell-O Oreo flavor instant pudding and pie filling

Directions:
Remove 2 tablespoons of the fudge topping; set aside. Spoon remaining topping into
crust; spread to evenly cover bottom of crust. Top with half of the whipped topping.
Freeze for 10 minutes.
Pour milk into large bowl. Add dry pudding mixes. Beat with a wire whisk for 2 minutes
or until well blended. (mixture will be thick.) Gently stir in remaining whipped topping.
Spoon over whipped topping layer in crust. Freeze 4 hours or until firm. Remove pie
from freezer 15 minutes before serving. Drizzle with remaining fudge topping. Store
leftover pie in freezer.
Make it easy: If fudge topping is cold, remove cap and microwave on high for 30 seconds
or until easy to spread.
How to drizzle chocolate: Spoon chocolate topping into resealable plastic bag. Using
scissors, cut off tiny piece of one of the bottom corners of the bag. Twist top of bag and
gently squeeze bag to drizzle chocolate back and forth over pie.
