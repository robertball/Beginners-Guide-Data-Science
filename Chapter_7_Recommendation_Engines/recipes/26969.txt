Ingredients:
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple in heavy syrup, drained with syrup reserved
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons maple syrup

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix the crushed pineapple, cornstarch and ground ginger. Gradually stir in enough of the reserved pineapple juice to make the mixture smooth.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, blend orange juice and maple syrup. Cook and stir 5 minutes, until clear and thickened. Mix in the pineapple mixture. Continue to cook and stir until well blended and thick, about 15 minutes.
