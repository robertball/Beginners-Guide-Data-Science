Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) bag fresh spinach - rinsed, dried and torn into bite size pieces
1 (24 ounce) carton ricotta cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch deep-dish pie plate.
In a large bowl, stir together the spinach, ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs and bell pepper. Spread in the prepared pie dish so that it is a little thinner in the middle.
Bake for 40 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until the center is set, and the edges are lightly browned.
