Ingredients:
2 lbs. firm tofu, drained
4 green peppers, chopped
2 large onions, diced
2 carrots, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch green onions, sliced thin
3 tbsp. peanut oil, divided
1 tsp. sesame oil
1/4 cup natural, unsalted peanut butter
1 tsp. salt, or more to taste
1/2 tsp. ground black pepper
2 tsp. Sriracha hot sauce, or more to taste
2 tsp. soy sauce
2 tbsp. water

Directions:
Slice tofu into 1/2 inch strips and press between paper towels while preparing vegetables to remove excess water.
Saute pepper, onion and carrot in 2 tablespoons of the peanut oil and the sesame oil over medium-high heat until the peppers and carrot are tender and the onion is golden brown.  Remove from heat, mix in garlic and green onions and cover.
Meanwhile, chop the tofu into bite-sized chunks and saute in the remaining tablespoon of peanut oil in a seperate pan over medium heat until golden brown.
In a blender, combine peanut butter, salt, pepper, hot sauce, soy sauce and water and blend until smooth.  Taste for desired seasoning.
Add tofu and peanut sauce to vegetables and return to heat until warmed through.
