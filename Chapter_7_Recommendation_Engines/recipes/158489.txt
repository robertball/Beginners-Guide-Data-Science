2/3 cup chopped dried tart cherries

Thinly sliced green onions (optional)

Directions:
To assemble, layer 1/3 cup cheese, 1/2 cup chicken, 1/3 cup cherries and 1 1/2 tablespoons salsa on half of each tortilla. Sprinkle each with 1/3 cup of remaining cheese. Fold tortillas in half; pressing gently.

Cook quesadillas, uncovered, for 9 to 12 minutes or until golden and cheese is melted, carefully turning over once. Remove quesadillas from skillet.
Cut quesadillas into wedges. If desired, serve with additional salsa, sour cream and green onions.
