Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cored and cut into florets
1 head broccoli, cut into florets
2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups skim milk
5 ounces shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 teaspoons spicy mustard
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 pinch nutmeg
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup crumbled tortilla chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring salted water to a boil in a saucepan. Cook cauliflower until easily pierced with a fork, about 5 minutes. Transfer cauliflower to a baking dish with slotted spoon. Cook broccoli until easily pierced with a fork, about 2 minutes. Transfer broccoli to baking dish with slotted spoon.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and whisk until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Whisk in milk and bring to a boil. Simmer, whisking constantly, until sauce is smooth and thickened, about 2 minutes more. Remove from heat; gradually whisk in 4 ounces Cheddar cheese. Stir in parsley, garlic, mustard, red pepper flakes, and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper.
Pour sauce over cauliflower and broccoli; toss to coat. Combine tortilla chips and remaining Cheddar cheese in a small bowl; sprinkle over cauliflower and broccoli.
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Increase heat to broil; bake until bubbly and brown, about 5 minutes more.
