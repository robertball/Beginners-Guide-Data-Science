Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line 42 mini muffin cups with paper cupcake liners.
Bake for 7-10 minutes or until cookie as spread to the edge of the cup. Allow to cool for about a minute then gently press in the center of the cookie, making a nest.
Beat cream cheese, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, and vanilla extract until smooth. Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons over each cookie in cup.
