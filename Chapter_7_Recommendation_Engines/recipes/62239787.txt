Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 1/2 c milk
1 1/2 c half and half
1/4 c sugar
1 tsp vanilla
pinch of salt
5 thick slices of chocolate bread, cubed
1 c dried cherries
1 c chocolate chips

Directions:
Mix eggs, milk, half and half, sugar, vanilla and salt together (easiest to pulse in blender).  Put bread cubes in large mixing bowl and pour egg mixture over them.  Push bread into liquid to make sure it absorbs evenly.  Cover with plastic and chill 30 minutes.  Preheat oven to 350.  Butter a 12X8 inch dish.  Mix cherries and chocolate chips together in small bowl.  Put a layer of bread mixture in the pan, sprinkle with cherries/chips and cover with remaining bread mixture.  Press down with palm of hand so ingredients are evenly distributed.  Bake for 40 minutes.
Serve warm with ice cream.
