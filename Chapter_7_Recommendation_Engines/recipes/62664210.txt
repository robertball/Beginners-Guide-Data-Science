Ingredients:
1 c all-purpose flour
2 t salt
1/2 t black pepper
1/4 t cayenne pepper
1/4 t paprika
1 egg
1 c milk
2 chicken breast fillets
4-6 c vegetable oil
1/4 c Crystal or Frank's Louisiana hot sauce

Directions:
Combine flour, salt, peppers, and paprika in a gallon-sized Ziploc bag.
In a medium-sized rectangle dish, whisk together egg and milk.
Slice each chicken breast into 6 pieces.  Preheat oil in a deep fryer to 375-degrees.
One or two at a time, dip chicken into egg mixture, then drop into Ziploc bag and shake.  Repeat process so each piece is double coated.
When all pieces have been breaded, arrange them on a rack and chill for 15 minutes.
Drop each piece into oil and fry until each is browned.
In microwave safe dish, combine hot sauce and butter and melt 20-30 seconds in microwave.
Drain chicken on paper towels after cooked.
Place chicken in large bowl and pour sauce over chicken.  Toss to ensure completely covered.
Serve with dressing and celery sticks.

Description: 
Using Crystal or Franks's hot sauce makes these boneless chicken nuggets buffalo.  I love these with Ranch dressing as much as Bleu Cheese.
