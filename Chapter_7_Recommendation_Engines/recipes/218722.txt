Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
5 pounds lean beef short ribs, cut into 3-inch pieces
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 large onion, cut into thick slices and separated into rings
5 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 cup barbeque sauce
1 cup beef broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Heat oil over medium heat in a large, heavy, oven-safe pot or Dutch oven, and brown the ribs on all sides, about 5 minutes, working in batches if necessary. Sprinkle ribs with salt and black pepper as they brown. Transfer cooked ribs to paper towels to blot up extra oil.
Stir the onion rings and carrots into the same pot, and cook and stir until the onions turn translucent and start to brown, about 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 1 more minute. Mix in tomato sauce, barbeque sauce, and beef broth; bring the sauce to a boil, and simmer for 1 minute to blend flavors. Stir in the browned ribs.
Cover the pot, and bake in the preheated oven until the rib meat is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Turn the ribs occasionally while cooking. Season to taste with salt and black pepper before serving hot.

Description: 
Beef short ribs are a highly flavorful cut; this method of cooking makes the meat so tender you won't need a knife.  The thick rich sauce is delicious served with mashed potatoes and the carrots that cook with the ribs.
