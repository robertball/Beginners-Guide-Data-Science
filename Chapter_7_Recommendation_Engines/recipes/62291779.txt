Description: 
This is the authentic Cajun style Crawfish Etouffee. You don't EVER put ANY tomatoes/tomato sauce in the Original Crawfish Etouffee.  This recipe hails from the Crawfish Capitol of the World, Breaux Bridge, Louisiana.  I hope you'll try it and enjoy it's wonderful taste and the simplicity of this recipe.
