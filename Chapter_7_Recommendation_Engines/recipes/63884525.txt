Ingredients:
1 cup mayonnaise
4 cloves garlic, pressed
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 boneless skinless breasts (sliced thinly to make 4)
3/4 - 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup uncooked rice
1 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir mayonnaise, garlic, rosemary, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Cover bottom of 9x13 baking dish with rice and fill with water.  Spread mayonnaise mixture over chicken and place chicken pieces on top of the rice then top with Parmesan cheese.
Bake until the juices run clear, chicken is no longer pink in the middle, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest chicken piece reads at least 165 degrees F (70 degrees C).  This should only take about 35-45 minutes since the chicken is sliced thin.  (about 1 hour and 10 minutes if breasts are not sliced)
