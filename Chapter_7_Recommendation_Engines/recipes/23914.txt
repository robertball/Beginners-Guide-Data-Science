Ingredients:
4 pounds beef rib roast
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup plain bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Romano cheese
1/2 cup minced fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Wash and pat dry the roast. Sprinkle salt and pepper over meat.
In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped garlic, butter, and olive oil. Stir to blend well. Place the seasoned rib roast in garlic mixture and turn to coat, rubbing it into the meat. Add a little more oil if it doesn't completely coat the meat.
In another mixing bowl, combine the bread crumbs, cheese and parsley. Mix thoroughly. Press the bread crumb mixture into the meat; completely covering the roast.
Place roast on a roasting rack inside of a shallow baking pan. Roast in a preheated oven until desired doneness; about 2 hours. Rare beef is 120 to 125 degrees F (49 to 52 degrees C). Well done beef is 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) Always use a clean meat thermometer to check for doneness.
