Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
¼ pound feta cheese, crumbled
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried oregano
6  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 ½ cups water
1 cube chicken bouillon, crumbled
2 cups loosely packed torn fresh spinach leaves
1  ripe tomato, chopped

Directions:
On large plate, combine 1 tablespoon flour, salt, and pepper. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine cheese, lemon juice, and oregano.  Set aside.
With a meat mallet, pound each chicken breast to 1/2 inch thickness.  Spread cheese mixture on each chicken breast, leaving 1/2 inch border.  Fold chicken breasts in half;  secure each with toothpick.  Coat chicken breasts with flour mixture.
In large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Cook chicken breasts for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, until golden.  In a small bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups water, chicken bouillon cube, and remaining flour; pour over chicken breasts in pan.  Add spinach and tomato to skillet, and bring to boil.  Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink inside.  Discard toothpicks before serving.
