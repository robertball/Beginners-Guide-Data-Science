Ingredients:
Box of Cheezits or any other box of cheese crackers
Peanut Butter
chocolate chips (I used milk chocolate)
(about 12 ozs)
S

Directions:
Spread some peanut butter on one side of a cracker. Place another cracker on top.
Microwave chocolate in a bowl in the microwave (or double boiler - I added a little bit of Crisco), stir often. Dip the crackers in the melted chocolate and cover completely.
Set on waxed paper on a cookie sheet. Then put them in the freezer for 5-10 minutes to get the chocolate to set up.
