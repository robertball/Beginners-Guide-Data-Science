Ingredients:
1 lb. eggplant
salt
1 c. celery, peeled
1 c. onions, chopped
1 green pepper, cleaned
extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 c. canned Italian plum tomatoes, chopped
1/2 c. toasted pinenuts
pinch of basil
pinch of oregano
1/2 Tbsp. anchovies, chopped
1/4 c. green olives, chopped
1 Tbsp. capers, drained
freshly ground black pepper
red wine vinegar
lettuce leaves (optional)
tomato wedges (optional)
Italian bread croutes, 1/2 inch slices on diagonal (optional)

Directions:
Peel eggplant and cut into 1/2-inch dice.  Salt and drain in a colander for 30 minutes, then squeeze dry.  Heat oilive oil in a large skillet and saute the eggplant until it is golden brown.  Remove.  Chop celery and pepper in 1/3-inch dice.  Add more oil to skillet and sautee the celery and pepper until it begins to soften.  Put the eggplant back in the skillet along with tomate, herbs, and anchovies, and sautee over high heat until thick.  Veggies should be tender but still have a little crunch to them.  Cool all of this at room temperature.  Add olives and capers to the mix and dress with red vine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper if necessary to taste.  Add toasted pinenuts.  Serve at room temperature on lettuce-lined plates and garnish with tomato wedges.  Serve French bread croutes to spread caponata on.  Or just stuff cherry tomatoes with it!
