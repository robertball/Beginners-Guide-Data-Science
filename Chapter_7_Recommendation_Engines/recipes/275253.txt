Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes, scrubbed
2 tablespoons olive oil
coarse kosher salt
ground black pepper
garlic powder
dried parsley
4 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Rub potatoes with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and parsley. Place potatoes in the air fryer basket.
Cook in the preheated air fryer until potatoes are soft, 40 to 50 minutes, depending on potato size.
Slice potatoes lengthwise. Pinch both sides of each potato, using your hands and forcing potatoes to open up, until the fluffy insides come up. Place 1 tablespoon of butter into each potato.
