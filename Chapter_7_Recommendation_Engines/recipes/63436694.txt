Ingredients:
2 c. gingersnap cookie crumbs
6 T. butter
1 can pumpkin
3 8 oz. pkg cream cheese, softened
1/4 c. cream
3/4 c. brown sugar
3/4 c. white sugar
4 eggs
1 1/2 t. cinnamon
1 t. dried ginger
1/ 4 t. nutmeg
1/4 t. allspice
Optional: add 1/2 t. grated fresh ginger

Directions:
Line outside of springform pan with foil. Mix together, press into bottom and up sides of 10" springform pan (up the sides as far as it will go; if you want more crust, use more crumbs & butter; I tend to only go up about 1 - 1 1/2"). Optional: grate approx. 1/2 t. fresh ginger on crust.  Chill crust.
Beat cream cheese in mixer for 10 minutes; slowly add sugars and mix until smooth.  Add spices.  Beat in eggs one at a time.  Scrape bottom and sides of bowl and mix until smooth. On low speed, add cream and mix until incorporated.  Pour batter into chilled crust.  Place pan on baking sheet in center of oven and bake for approximately one hour and 20 min.  It's done when it's slightly jiggly in the center but mostly firm everywhere else.
