Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup finely diced green bell pepper
1 (6 ounce) can mushrooms
1/2 cup finely diced onion
2 1/2 cups beef broth
1 1/4 cups milk
1 (8 ounce) package seashell pasta
1/2 (8 ounce) package shredded Provel cheese
1/2 (8 ounce) package shredded pepper Jack cheese

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
Stir thyme, garlic powder, salt, and pepper into the beef. Add bell pepper and cook over medium heat for 3 minutes. Stir in mushrooms and onion and continue cooking over medium heat until onions become translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in beef broth, milk, and pasta.
Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until pasta has softened, 20 to 25 minutes. Add 1/2 the Provel cheese and 1/2 the pepper Jack cheese at a time, stirring after each addition, until cheeses are fully melted. Remove from heat; sauce will thicken slightly as it cools.

Description: 
A creamy, cheesy, budget-friendly, one-pot pasta dish of my own creation, with no need for heavy sour cream or cream cheese! 
You can fancy this up by using thinly sliced rib-eye or keep it budget with ground beef. Best of all, 30 minutes on the stove and you're done! I make this with Provel for that smoky/salty flavor, but if you're not a native St. Louisian and don't care for it, you can sub white American.
