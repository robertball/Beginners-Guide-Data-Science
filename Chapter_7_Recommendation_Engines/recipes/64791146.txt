Ingredients:
5 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup Grand Marnier liqueur
1/2 teaspoon LorAnn Bakery Emulsion or orange extract

Directions:
Line a 9x9 inch pan with a non-stick liner (I use an oven liner that I have cut to size to fit the bottom of the pan and up the sides).
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine 3 cups chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk. Heat in microwave until chocolate melts, stirring occasionally (I microwave in 30 second intervals). Spread into pan, and cool to room temperature.
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine cream, liqueur, Bakery emulsion or extract and 2 cups chocolate chips.  Heat in microwave until the chocolate melts; stir until smooth. Cool to lukewarm, then pour over the fudge layer.
Refrigerate until both layers are completely set, I allow about 2.5 hours. Cut into 1 inch pieces (for ease of cutting I remove from the liner and sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before cutting).
