Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped*
2 (8.5 ounce) packages corn bread/muffin mix
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 (14.75 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs, beaten
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook the beef, onion and peppers over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the corn bread mix, salt, baking soda, corn, milk, oil and eggs.
Pour half in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Layer with half of the cheese and all of the beef mixture. Top with remaining cheese. Carefully spread remaining batter over top. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.

Description: 
To stretch our grocery budget, we eat a lot of soups and pots o' beans. This satisfying Mexican corn bread always livens up the meal. Like many of my recipes, this one came from a church cookbook.                                 -Patty Boling                                  Seymour, Tennessee
