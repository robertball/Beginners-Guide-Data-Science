Ingredients:
2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 15.8 oz can Great Northern Beans, drained and rinsed
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups chicken broth
2 cups water,  or as needed
12 oz "medium heat" salsa
1 cup tomato puree
2 tsps chili powder
1 1/2 tsps cumin
1 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 1/2 tsps dried oregano
1/2 tsp black pepper
2 bay leaves
1 tsp molasses
salt to taste
4 oz pepper jack cheese, cut into cubes
4 oz Monterey jack cheese, cut into cubes
1 green bell pepper, diced
sour cream

Directions:
1. In a 6-quart slow cooker, place chicken, beans, onion, garlic, chicken broth, water, salsa, tomato puree, chili powder, cumin, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, black pepper, bay leaves, molasses, and salt. Stir gently to combine. Cover and cook over low heat for about 4-6 hours, or until chicken is falling apart.
2. Remove chicken from crock pot, shred, and return to crock pot. Stir in pepper jack cheese, Monterey jack cheese, and green bell pepper. Cover and cook an addition 30-45 minutes, or until bell pepper is softened and the cheeses have completely melted into the chili. Adjust salt, black pepper, and chili powder to taste.
3. Remove bay leaves before serving. Serve warm topped with sour cream and extra cheese, if desired.

Description: 
While not a true white chili--due to the addition of salsa and tomato puree--it's still an easy and delicious meal to throw into the crock pot, and have dinner waiting for you! Stirring cheese directly into the chili adds creaminess and tons of extra flavor too!
