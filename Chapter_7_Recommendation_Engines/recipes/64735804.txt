Ingredients:
•	1 tbsp vegetable oil
•	1/2 cup diced onion
•	1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
•	1.1 pounds canned green jackfruit, drained
•	2 cups plain tomato sauce
•	1 tbsp tomato paste
•	2 tbsp brown sugar
•	1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
•	1 tbsp spicy chili garlic sauce (such as Sriracha)
•	1 tsp white vinegar
•	1/2 tsp garlic powder
•	1/2 tsp dried parsley
•	1.5 tbsp brown mustard
•	Salt and pepper to taste
•	6 hamburger buns

Directions:
1.	Use the sauté function to sauté the onion and bell pepper in the vegetable oil. Turn off the sauté function. Add the jackfruit in a single layer over the vegetables.
2.	In a bowl, whisk together the tomato sauce, tomato paste, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, chili garlic sauce, vinegar, garlic powder, dried parsley, brown mustard, salt and pepper. Pour this mixture evenly over the jackfruit. Slow cook for four hours.
3.	Once the four hours have passed, toast the hamburger buns. Top each with the cooked jackfruit and serve.
Notes/Footnotes:
I used an Instant Pot® that has both sauté and slow cook functions. If using a traditional slow cooker, skip the sauté step.
Be sure to purchase green (unripe) jackfruit in water or brine, not the sweet (ripe) jackfruit in syrup.

Description: 
Your lunchroom favorite goes vegetarian. Slow-cooked green jackfruit adds texture without compromising flavor. Pop this in the slow cooker in the morning and you’ll have thick and tangy sloppy joes by lunchtime. Serve with pickles and vegetable chips. No hair net required.
