Ingredients:
1 pound boneless pork tenderloin, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 large onion, cut in half and sliced
8 ounces assorted sliced mushrooms (baby bellas, shiitake, and oyster)
1 medium apple, sliced
1 (10.5 ounce) can Campbell's® Healthy Request® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
3/4 cup Swanson® Natural Goodness® Chicken Broth
2 cups hot cooked instant brown rice

Directions:
Season the pork with the thyme and black pepper.
Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook until browned on both sides.  Remove the pork from the skillet.
Cook the mushrooms and onion in the skillet for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the apple and cook for 5 minutes or until the apple is tender-crisp. Stir in the soup, vinegar and broth and heat to a boil. Return the pork to the skillet.  Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the pork is cooked through. Serve the pork and sauce with the rice.
