Ingredients:
2 Cups Flour
1 1/2 Cups White Sugar
2 tsp Baking Powder
2 tsp Cinnamon
1 tsp Baking Soda
4 Beaten Egs
1 16 oz can Pumpkin (all my cans are 15 oz, so I just use that)
1 cup Vegetable Oil
3 oz of Cream Cheese, softened
1/4 cup of Butter, room temp
1 tsp Vanilla
2 cups Powdered Sugar

Directions:
Combine eggs, pumpkin, sugar and oil. Mix till well combined.
Add cinnamon, baking powder and baking soda. Mix well.
Add flour, mix and spread into an ungreased 15x10x1 inch baking pan (I always use a 9x13 dish because I like them thick!)
Bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 min.
While baking, beat butter, cream cheese and vanilla together until fluffy.
Gradually add powdered sugar until smooth.
Pour over cooled pumpkin bars.
