1 cup water, divided in half

Food coloring (optional)
2 1/4 cup sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
1 packet of Pop Rocks, flavor of your choice

Directions:
1. Combine Â½ cup water and gelatin in a large stand mixer bowl. Add food coloring if desired. Stir and set aside.
2. Combine remaining water, sugar, and corn syrup in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stir frequently. Cook until mixture reaches 240 degrees/soft ball stage.
3. Turn the mixer on low and slowly pour the syrup over the gelatin mixture. Once the liquid starts to thicken, gradually increase the mixer to its highest speed, making sure not to send hot drops of marshmallow flying. Beat on high for 10 minutes.

5. Cut marshmallows with a cookie cutter or sharp knife. Roll in Pop Rocks. Serve immediately.
