Ingredients:
4 cups water
1 cup split yellow lentils (moong dal)
1 bunch fresh spinach, shredded
2 green chile peppers, halved lengthwise
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
salt to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)
6 fresh curry leaves
2 dried red chile peppers, broken into thirds
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon mustard seed
1 pinch asafoetida powder
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper

Directions:
Combine the water, lentils, spinach, green chile peppers, ginger, turmeric, and salt in a large pot over medium-high heat; bring to a boil and cook until the lentils are tender and the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Heat the oil and ghee together in small skillet; fry the curry leaves, red chile peppers, cumin seeds, mustard seed, and asafoetida powder in the mixture until the seeds begin to splutter. Stir the mixture into the lentil mixture. Sprinkle the ground red pepper over the mixture and cook another 5 minutes. Serve hot.

Description: 
This is a comforting everyday dal. My kids love this dal mixed with cooked plain rice and ghee. Spinach adds texture, fiber, and essential nutrients.
