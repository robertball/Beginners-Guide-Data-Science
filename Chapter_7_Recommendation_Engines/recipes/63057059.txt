1-2 carrot, sliced or julienned

1/2 c grapeseed or safflower oil

Directions:
Mix the vegetables and the salt together with your hands until well combined. Cover with clean fresh water.
Cover and allow the vegetable mix to brine for 8-12 hours.
Drain the vegetables and rinse well. Pack the vegetables into sterilized pint jars.
Combine the garlic and all herbs in a medium bowl, then add the vinegar and mix well.
Add the oil in a stream to emulsify, then pour this mixture over the vegetables in the jars.
Allow the mixture to mellow for a couple of days before serving.
This giardiniera will keep about a month in the refrigerator. In the winter, mine keeps for months in the garage.
