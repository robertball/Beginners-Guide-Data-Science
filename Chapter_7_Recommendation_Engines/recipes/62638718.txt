Description: 
This has been a favorite of mine since I was about 14 when I first made it. Experiment with different cheeses like gruyere; and I would suggest sprinkling seasoning between the layers for more flavor. Sauteing the potatoes and the onions with some chopped garlic adds a nice touch also.
