Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
1 pound sausage
1 tablespoon butter, melted
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 pound shredded Cheddar cheese
3 cups heavy whipping cream
8 large eggs
1 cup half-and-half

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook and stir bacon and sausage in a large skillet and over medium-high heat until evenly browned and bacon is crisp, about 10 minutes; drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
Brush butter on the bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese into the bottom of the baking dish and top with bacon and sausage. Spread Cheddar cheese over bacon and sausage.
Beat cream, eggs, and half-and-half together in a bowl. Slowly pour egg mixture over cheese and sausage into the baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool for 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
Yet another crustless quiche that is designed for a low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet. It is very rich and cheesy. The Parmesan and butter on the bottom form a nice skin on the bottom that really helps. The egg and cream mixture is quite flexible and the ratio of egg to cream and the heaviness of the cream is a personal choice. The cheese can easily be replaced with any hard cheese that holds up well when shredded such as Swiss, Cheddar, Gouda, or Provolone. The meats can be replaced with anything that isn't too wet; whether it is meat or vegetable.
