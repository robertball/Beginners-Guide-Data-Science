Ingredients:
450g raw shell-on shrimp, rinsed
1 clove of garlic, finely chopped
1 shallot, minced
1 tsp parsley, minced
1 tsp olive oil
juice of 1 lime
salt & freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Boil water in a pan. Add the shrimp to the hot water. Let the water return to a gentle simmer. Cook the shrimp over medium-high heat, monitoring it closely. Remove the shrimp from the water as they rise to the surface. Chill the shrimp immediately to stop them from cooking further. Remove the shell, legs, tail and vein.
Place the cooked shrimp in a bowl. Add the garlic, shallot, olive oil, and lime juice. Mix well. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Marinate in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight.
