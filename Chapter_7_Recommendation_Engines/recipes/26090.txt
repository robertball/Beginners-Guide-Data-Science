Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
2/3 cup ORTEGA® Garden Style Salsa
1/2 cup loose-pack frozen whole-kernel corn
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 cup sour cream, divided
4 (10 inch) burrito-size flour tortillas
1 1/3 cups cooked, shredded chicken breast meat
4 slices Monterey Jack cheese
2 cups shredded romaine lettuce
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
HEAT olive oil in medium skillet over medium heat.  Add garlic; cook for 30 seconds.  Stir in beans, salsa, corn and cumin; cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes.
SPREAD 2 tablespoons sour cream over each tortilla.  Evenly distribute bean mixture, chicken, cheese, lettuce and cilantro over bottom third of each tortilla, making sure ingredients don't touch edges.
FOLD the bottom edge of each tortilla toward the center and gently roll until tortilla is completely wrapped around the filling.  Cut in half.
