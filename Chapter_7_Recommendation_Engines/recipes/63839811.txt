Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups flour, sifted
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup unsalted butter
1 egg, slightly beaten
1 tablespoon milk, or as needed
2 (16 ounce) cans pitted sour cherries, drained
3/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons flour
3 eggs at room temperature
3/4 cup milk
1 pinch cinnamon
1 pinch nutmeg
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup flour

Directions:
Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Whisk together 1 1/2 cup of sifted flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
With a pastry cutter, chop the unsalted butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs; mix in 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of milk, creating a dough; if dough seems dry and crumbly, mix in additional milk, a teaspoon at a time.
Pat the dough into the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle the cherries evenly over the dough.
In a bowl, sift 3/4 cup of sugar with 2 tablespoons of flour; whisk in the 3 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk until smooth.
Mix in cinnamon and nutmeg; pour the mixture over the cherries.
In a small bowl, using a pastry cutter, chop 2 tablespoons of butter with 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup flour until crumbly; sprinkle the streusel over the custard mixture.
Bake at 350Â° until the custard is set and the streusel is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
Serve warm or cold; refrigerate leftovers.
