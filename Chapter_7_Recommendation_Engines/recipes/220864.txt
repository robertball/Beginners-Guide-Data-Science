Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, coarsely chopped
1 (3 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed
4 cups vegetable broth, or more to taste
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
3 apples, peeled and cubed
3 large cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, or to taste
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Saute onion until translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add squash, broth, sweet potatoes, apples, garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper, cumin, ginger, and salt.
Close and lock the lid. Bring to high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook until squash and sweet potatoes are fork-tender, about 15 minutes.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions. Unlock and remove lid. Liquefy soup using an immersion blender. Stir in half-and-half. Serve with a dollop of yogurt on top.
