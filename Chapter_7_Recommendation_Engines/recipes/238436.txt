Description: 
Easy weeknight recipe with plenty of room for variation: use chicken or fish, bok choi, tat soi, choy sum, mustard greens, or turnip greens. 
It's made with things I normally have on hand (greens, onions tomatoes, cheese, frozen protein, couscous or rice) and cooks up in a jiffy. Feels like a real treat!
