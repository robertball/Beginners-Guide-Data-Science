Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 cup white sugar
1 cup self-rising flour
3/4 cup milk
2 cups fresh blackberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour the melted butter into the bottom of an 8x8-inch square baking pan. Mix the sugar, self-rising flour, and milk together until moistened, and pour the mixture over the butter. Do not stir. Spread blackberries evenly over the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned and the cobbler is bubbling, about 45 minutes.
