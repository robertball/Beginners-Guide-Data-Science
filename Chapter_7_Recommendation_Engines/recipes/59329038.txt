Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cups Bisquick
1/2 cup water
5-6 sliced tomatoes
8oz of shredded mozzeralla cheese
A bunch of Fresh basil (you could use dried)
Dried oregano (just to spinkle)
Italian seasoning (just to spinkle)
Onion powder (just to spinkle)
Topping:
1 cup mayo
8 oz shredded sharp cheddar

Directions:
Preheat oven at 350 degrees.
Grease a 9inch deep pie plate.
Mix the 2 cups Bisquick and 1/2 cup water and make it into a thin crust.  I like to roll it but my mom likes to just press it into the pie plate.
Layer the tomatoes, and sprinkle with oregano, onion powder and italian seasoning, then layer the fresh basil on top.  Then sprinkle the mozzarella cheese on top.
Continue to layer like that 2-3 times.
Topping:
Mix together the mayo and cheddar and carefully spread on the top
(I have tried using lowfat mayo here and it doesn't come out as nice so you could try 1/2 lowfat and 1/2 regular possibly. Also, My mom uses 2 cups of mayo I think that is too much)
Bake at 350 for 45 min-1 hour until the top is golden brown.
Let cool a bit before cutting.

Description: 
My mom and I have made this tomato pie for years and EVERY SINGLE TIME I make it, people ask for the recipe. I am almost embarrassed at how easy it is when I describe the recipe.
