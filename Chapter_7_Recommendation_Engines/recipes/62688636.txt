Ingredients:
3 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1/4 cup wheat bran
1/4 cup oat bran
1/4 cup flax meal
1/3 cup slivered almonds
1/4 cup canola oil
2/3 cup honey
1/3 cup white chocolate chips
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, stir together first six ingredients. Set aside.
In a small saucepan over medium low heat, combine oil and honey. Stir for 3 minutes, or until mixture starts to bubble. Lower heat slightly and continue to stir for 2 more minutes. Remove from heat and stir in chips, vanilla extract and salt. Stir to blend (chips may appear not to completely blend in but it's not a problem). Pour over dry ingredients. Stir until dry mixture is thoroughly coated.
Pour mixture onto prepared baking sheet, spreading evenly. Lightly press down with spatula. Bake 30 minutes. Turn pan around and bake another 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool 15 minutes. The mixture will crisp as it cools and form a solid sheet. When cool, break mixture into small chunks and store in an airtight container. *If you prefer a finer textured granola, stir mixture every 15 minutes while baking.

Description: 
This sweet vanilla granola treat is great on it's own or with vanilla yogurt and fruit. I sometimes add extra white chocolate chips to the finished granola and dried fruit such as cranberries and apricots. Enjoy!
