Ingredients:
12 (3 inch) unbaked tart shells
2 eggs
2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 cup milk
2 teaspoons instant coffee granules
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a small bowl, beat together eggs, coffee liqueur, and sugar.
In a small saucepan, combine milk and coffee granules; heat over medium high heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until milk is steaming and tiny bubbles appear around edge of saucepan.  Beat milk into eggs.  Strain egg mixture through sieve into a pitcher.  Carefully pour egg mixture into tart shells, filling evenly (tarts will be very full).  Sprinkle each tart with a little cinnamon.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes, or until filling is set and tart shells are golden brown.  Cool before serving.
