Description: 
This creamy risotto combines crabmeat and bay scallops for a delicious dish!  You may omit the peas if desired, I leave them so that it is a one-dish meal and I've gotten some veggies worked into it. My husband loves this, whenever I make it, he thinks it must be a special occasion! Enjoy!
