Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 (1.55 ounce) bars milk chocolate candy, broken into pieces
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x15-inch baking pan.
Cream butter and brown sugar in a bowl; beat in egg yolk and vanilla extract. Gradually add flour and salt, beating dough until smooth. Press into prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, 17 to 19 minutes. Remove from oven and place chocolate bar pieces on top; return to the oven just until chocolate is shiny and melted, about 1 minute. Spread melted chocolate in a layer, making decorative swirls; sprinkle with pecans. Allow to cool until chocolate topping is set, about 1 hour. Cut into bars to serve.

Description: 
Chocolate-covered shortbread bar cookies with the rich buttery taste of toffee are much easier than making candy, and they look great on a cookie tray.
