Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups sugar
2 eggs
2 egg whites
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/3 cup canola oil
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
3 cups shredded carrots
1/2 cup golden raisins
6 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese
1 tablespoon butter or stick margarine, softened
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the first five ingredients until smooth. Combine the flours, baking soda, salt and spices; add to the egg mixture and mix well. Stir in carrots and raisins. Pour into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
