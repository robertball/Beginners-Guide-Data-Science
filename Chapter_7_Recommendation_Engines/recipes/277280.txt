Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 cup water
1 (1 ounce) packet ranch seasoning mix
1 1/2 pounds pork chops
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Stir together cream of chicken soup, water, and ranch seasoning mix in a slow cooker until well combined. Add pork chops.
Cook on Low until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, 4 to 6 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Stir in sour cream during the last 10 minutes of cooking.

Description: 
This is a slow cooker favorite in my family. The pork comes out so tender and moist, you don't even need a knife. Serve over rice, noodles, or potatoes.
