Ingredients:
48 littleneck clams, shucked and drained
1 cup 2% milk
1/2 cup gluten-free all purpose baking flour
1/2 cup masa harina
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
oil for frying

Directions:
Place shucked clams in a small bowl. Pour in milk; toss clams gently with a fork to cover evenly. Let soak in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Combine flour, masa harina, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper in a plastic container with a lid. Seal container and shake to blend flour mixture.
Remove clams one at a time from the milk and place in the flour mixture; shake gently to coat. Shake off excess flour and place on a plate.
Heat 3/4 inch oil in a large saucepan or deep-fryer. Fry clams in small batches until golden brown and crispy, about 1 minute. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.

Description: 
Came up with this easy, gluten-free recipe to tame my craving for fried clams. They came out every bit as good as I remember having at seafood restaurants before my Celiac diagnosis. I like them with French fries, lemon or lime wedges, and tartar sauce or seafood cocktail sauce. Yum!
