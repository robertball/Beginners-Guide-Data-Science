1 Tbs. olive oil
1 cup chicken broth
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tsp. paprika
2 tsp. garlic powder
2 tsp. poultry seasoning
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
4-6 boneless pork chops
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, chicken broth, garlic, paprika, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, basil, salt and pepper. Pour into a large skillet. Place pork chops into skillet in single layer and cover. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to simmer at medium-low for 2 hours. Sauce should bubble a bit, so fool with temperature to keep it cooking & not just staying warm. Turn chops once during cooking to redistribute herbs & spices.
