Description: 
This was a recipe given to me by my Mexican friend Ruth Herrera. The recipe comes from her grandmother-in-law who lives in rural northern Mexico. This fiery salsa is hot and creamy and utterly addictive. Serve with tortilla chips, or alonside tacos. Can also be used as a relish in sandwitches and wraps.
