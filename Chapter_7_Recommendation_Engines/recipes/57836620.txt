Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
salt and pepper to taste
2 large baking potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/4 cup canola oil
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced
2 tablespoon chopped jalapeno peppers
1 lime, juiced
12 (6 inch) corn tortillas, warmed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place potatoes in a shallow baking dish. Drizzle with about 1/2 the oil, and season with salt. Bake 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until tender.
Meanwhile, season chicken with cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Arrange in a separate baking dish, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until no longer pink and juices run clear. Cool and shred.
Heat remaining oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute onion and garlic until tender. Mix in shredded chicken, jalapeno, and lime juice. Cook until heated through.
Serve the chicken and potatoes in warmed tortillas.

Spicy, addictive, easy to make - you can't stop eating these! The potato puts it over the top! Well worth the time. Serve with salsa, cheese, cilantro, and sour cream. Great with beans and rice!Modified from: Cinnamon and Lime Chicken Fajitas
