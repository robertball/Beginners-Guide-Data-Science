Ingredients:
2 cups whipping cream, divided
3 egg yolks
16 (1 ounce) squares semisweet baking chocolate
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
RASPBERRY SAUCE:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries, thawed
1/4 cup light corn syrup

Directions:
In a bowl, whisk 1/2 cup whipping cream and egg yolks; set aside. In a 3-qt. saucepan, heat chocolate, butter and corn syrup over low heat until chocolate and butter are melted. Remove from the heat. Stir about 1 cup into the egg yolk mixture; return all to the pan. Cook and stir over low heat until mixture coats the back of a metal spoon or reaches 160 degrees F. Remove from the heat; cool. In a mixing bowl, beat remaining cream with confectioners' sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form. Fold into chocolate mixture until well blended. Pour into a 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan that has been lined with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 8-10 hours. For sauce, place raspberries in a blender; cover and puree. Strain and discard seeds. Stir corn syrup into raspberry puree; refrigerate. Unmold mousse onto a serving platter; serve with raspberry sauce.
