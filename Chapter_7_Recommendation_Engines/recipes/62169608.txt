Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
Juice from 1/2 a lemon
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon Worcestershire Sauce
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup brown sugar
6 salmon fillets

Directions:
Heat barbecue coals or grill to medium heat.
Place all ingredients (except fillets) in microwavable container & heat until butter is melted.  Stir.
Baste the flesh side of fish with sauce and place flesh down, skin up on the grill.  Cook 3-4 minutes and turn flesh side up.  Baste again and every 3 minutes until the salmon is cooked.  The inside of the fish will lose its translucent appearance.  Baste one last time with sauce and serve.  Enjoy!
