Directions:
Cook chicken breasts in broth or stock approximately 20-30 minutes until no longer pink. Cut into bite size chunks.  Strain broth through mesh strainier or cheesecloth
Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat, add peppers, onion, and garlic.  Saute about 5 minutes, until onion is almost translucent.
Add mushrooms and saute until mushrooms start to release their liquid.
Stir in flour to form a roux/paste and cook until no flour is no longer white and starting to brown.
Add chicken broth and milk. Bring to boil.  Continue stirring until sauce thickens. Reduce heat.
