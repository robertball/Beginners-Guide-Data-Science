Ingredients:
8 ounces Italian flat bread (focaccia), cut into 3/4-inch cubes (4 cups)
2 1/2 cups chopped zucchini and/or yellow summer squash
3/4 cup chopped green sweet pepper
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic, undrained
finely shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Spread bread cubes in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet.  Bake in a 375 degree F oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until lightly toasted.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan cook zucchini or yellow squash, sweet pepper, and onion in hot oil for 5 minutes. Stir in stock or broth and undrained tomatoes.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat.  Simmer, uncovered, about 5 minutes or until vegetables are just tender.
Ladle soup into bowls. Top each serving with toasted bread cubes and, if desired, Parmesan cheese.
