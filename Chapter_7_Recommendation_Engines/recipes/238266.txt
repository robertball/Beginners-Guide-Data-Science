Ingredients:
1/2 cup sliced almonds
4 cups vegetable stock
2 cups quinoa
1 English cucumber, diced
15 grape tomatoes, quartered
1 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, stemmed and leaves finely chopped
1 orange bell pepper, diced
3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/2 cup raisins
1/4 cup chopped black olives
4 scallions, white and light green parts, chopped
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread almonds onto a baking sheet.
Bake almonds in the preheated oven until lightly toasted and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes.
Bring vegetable stock and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and stock has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer quinoa to a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.
Mix almonds, cucumber, tomatoes, parsley, orange bell pepper, feta cheese, raisins, olives, and scallions into quinoa.
Whisk lemon juice and olive oil together in a bowl; pour over quinoa mixture and stir until quinoa mixture is coated.

Description: 
The original recipe is from a friend, and I modified it by adding some ingredients to the recipe. Since it has an abundance of goodness in it, I'll often eat it alone as a meal. I've also served this as a side dish with bbq chicken or lamb shish-kabobs.
