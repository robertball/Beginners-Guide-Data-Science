Ingredients:
16oz uncooked elbow macaroni (approx. 4 cups)
6 Tbsp margarine
6 Tbsp flour
4 cups milk
2 cups shredded medium Cheddar
2 cups shredded American (or 16oz slices, torn)
1/2 tsp salt
Dash pepper

Directions:
Pre heat oven to 350. Cook macaroni according to pkg directions, drain.  Melt margarine, blend in flour(a wire whisk works the best for no clumps). Add in milk.  Cook and stir until sauce thickens.  Add salt and pepper.  Add 2 cups American and 1 1/4 Cheddar, reserving roughly 3/4 for the top.  Stir until completely melted.  Place macaroni in a greased 9x13 baking dish.  Pour sauce over macaroni.  Top with remaining cheese.  Bake uncovered for 30 minutes.
