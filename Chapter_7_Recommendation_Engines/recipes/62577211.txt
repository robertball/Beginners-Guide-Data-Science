2 pounds unpeeled potatoes (about 6 medium)
8 garlic cloves, peeled
1 container (8 oz.) sour cream

Directions:
Cut potatoes into 1-inch pieces. Place potatoes, garlic and enough water to cover in medium 3-qt. saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil; reduce heat and cook 8-10 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
Drain potatoes and garlic in large colander; return to saucepan. Using nylon masher, mash until no lumps remain.
Stir in sour cream, salt and black pepper. Gradually beat in enough of the hot milk to make potato mixture light and fluffy.
