Ingredients:
2 small pkgs cherry jello (or 1 lrg)
2 cups boiling water
1 small can crushed pineapple, undrained
1 can cherry pie filling
Topping:
8oz package cream cheese
1 tsp vanilla
8oz sour cream
1/2 cup sugar

Directions:
Mix cherry jello package(s) with boiling water. Mix well.
Add undrained pineapple and cherry pie filling.
Mix together, stir well. Refrigerate uncovered until chilled.
Make topping by, softening cream cheese in microwave (remove wrapper) and microwave 20 seconds.
Add vanilla, sour cream, and sugar. Mix well. Add to the top of cherry jello.
Cover with aluminum foil not plastic wrap because plastic wrap will cling to topping.
If you cover before chilled you will end up with droplets of water on top.
Jello should NOT be put into aluminum pans.
