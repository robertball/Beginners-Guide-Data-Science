Ingredients:
6 large eggs, hard cooked and cooled
1/4 cup Soy-Free Mayonnaise
1 Tbsp Chopped Celery
2 teaspoons Buffalo Sauce (I use Frankâ€™s Red Hot)
Salt and Pepper
Blue Cheese Crumbles, for garnish

Directions:
Halve the eggs lengthwise.
Remove the yolks from the whites and transfer them to a separate bowl. Mash the yolks with a fork until there are no large pieces left.
Stir the mayonnaise, celery and buffalo sauce with the yolks and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Scoop (or pipe if you would like to achieve a design) about a tablespoon of the mixture into each egg white half.
Sprinkle the tops with blue cheese crumbles for garnish.
