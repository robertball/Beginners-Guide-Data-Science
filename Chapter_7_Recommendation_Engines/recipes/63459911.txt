1/2 cup cornstarch
1-1/2 cup sugar
1/4 tsp. salt
1-3/4 cup water
4 egg yolks, slightly beaten
2 Tbsp. butter
1 Tbsp. grated lemon rind
1/2 cup lemon juice
4 egg whites
1/4 tsp. cream of tarter
1/2 cup sugar

Directions:
preheat oven to 350 F
Blend cornstarch, 1-1/2 cups sugar, and salt in saucepan; stir in water gradually.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to boiling. Boil 1 minute.
Stir half the mixture slowly into egg yolks; stir into mixture in saucepan.
Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, 2 minutes; remove from heat.
Add butter, lemon rind, and juice; cool slightly. Pour into baked pastry shell.
Beat egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy; beat in 1/2 cup sugar gradually; continue beating until meringue forms stiff glossy peaks.
Swirl meringue onto filling with spoon or spatula. Be sure meringue touches crust all the way around to prevent shrinkage.
