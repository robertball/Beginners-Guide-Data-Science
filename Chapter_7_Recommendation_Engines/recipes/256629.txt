Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup pesto
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
12  cherry tomatoes
12  red onion chunks
6  wooden skewers, soaked in water for 20 minutes
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken pieces, pesto, and lemon juice in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag; seal bag and toss to coat evenly. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
Thread chicken, tomatoes, and onion alternately onto skewers. Season with salt and pepper.
Preheat Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven to Medium-High on the "Grill" setting.
Place the skewers into the grill pan and set the timer for 3 minutes.
Turn skewers and cook another 3 to 4 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Allow to rest for about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Delicious, moist and flavorful. I prefer using homemade pesto, but store-bought will do if necessary. This is sure to become a family favorite! Serve with lemon wedges. This recipe was made in a Panasonic CIO.
