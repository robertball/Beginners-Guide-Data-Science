Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked deep-dish pie crust
10 ounces chorizo sausage
6 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®), drained
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided
1 (15 ounce) can refried beans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Lightly beat eggs and milk together in a large bowl; stir in tomatoes with green chile peppers and half the Mexican cheese blend.
Spread refried beans evenly across the bottom of the pie crust; layer chorizo onto refried beans. Pour egg mixture over chorizo layer; top with remaining Mexican cheese blend.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the middle of the quiche comes out clean and cheese is lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool for 15 minutes before serving.
