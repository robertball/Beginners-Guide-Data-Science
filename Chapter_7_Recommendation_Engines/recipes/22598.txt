Ingredients:
1 (13 ounce) package HERSHEY®'S HUGS® Chocolates, divided
1 (13 ounce) package HERSHEY®'S KISSES® Milk Chocolates, divided
3/4 cup butter
2/3 cup white sugar
2/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1/3 cup HERSHEY®'S Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
1 teaspoon shortening
1 tablespoon cold water
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
2 tablespoons boiling water
2 cups heavy cream
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 F.  Grease and line bottoms of two 9-inch heart-shaped baking pans with wax paper.*  Remove wrappers from 24 Hugs and 24 Kisses; chop into 1/4-inch pieces.
Beat butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla in large bowl until creamy.  Add eggs; beat well.  Stir together flour, baking powder and salt.  Add flour mixture alternately with milk to butter mixture, beating well after each addition.  Stir in chopped chocolate.  Pour batter into prepared pans.
Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool 10 minutes in pans on wire racks.  Remove from pans; cool completely .
Place chocolate chips and shortening in small microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave at HIGH (100%) 30 seconds to 1 minute or until chocolate is melted when stirred.  Trace 5-inch heart shape on paper; place wax paper over top.  Place melted chip mixture in bottom of sturdy seal-top plastic bag; using scissors, snip off small corner at bottom.  Pipe melted chocolate over heart; refrigerate until firm.
Prepare Whipped Cream Frosting:   Place 1 tablespoon cold water in small cup; sprinkle 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin over top.  Let stand several minutes to soften.  Stir in 2 tablespoons boiling water until gelatin is completely dissolved and mixture is clear.  Beat 2 cups (1 pt.) cold whipping cream and 1/3 cup powdered sugar in large bowl until stiff.  Pour in gelatin mixture; beat until well blended and thickened.  Stir in 5 drops red food color, if desired.
Reserve 1 cup of frosting; set aside. Frost between layers, sides and top of cake.  Place reserved frosting in sturdy seal-top plastic bag with star tip; pipe rosettes along top of cake.  Unwrap 17 Hugs; place on top of rosettes.  Unwrap 32 Kisses; place along bottom edge of cake.  Remove chocolate heart from wax paper; place in center of cake.  Cover and refrigerate cake.
