Ingredients:
1/4 cup rolled oats (or flour)
1/2 cup liquid egg whites
1/4 cup almond milk
1/2 tsp baking soda

Directions:
Blend all ingredients together.
Spray a nonstick pan with PAM or low-calorie spray.
Turn heat to medium/high.
Once the pan is sizzling hot, pour the batter in it. Then turn the heat to medium/low to make sure the pancakes cook through without burning.
Flip once bubbles start to appear on the surface, flip again, and then they're ready!
