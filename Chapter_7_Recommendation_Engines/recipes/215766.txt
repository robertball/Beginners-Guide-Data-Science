Description: 
This meatloaf is moist, delicious, and a great way to sneak in some vegetables to your weekday dinners.  Feel free to use whatever combination of meats based on your personal tastes or what's on sale at the supermarket.  This is an often-requested recipe in my house and my husband still doesn't know about the zucchini in this recipe!
