Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound ground beef
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup finely chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1/2 cup finely chopped carrot
1 (10.75 ounce) can chicken gumbo soup
1/2 cup chili sauce
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
1 teaspoon onion salt

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot oil until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Return skillet to heat.
Stir onion, bell pepper, celery, and carrot into the ground beef; cook and stir until the vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes; add chicken gumbo soup, chili sauce, yellow mustard, and onion salt. Reduce heat to medium-low, stir beef mixture, and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is based on the sloppy joes I loved as a kid. My own kids don't eat enough veggies, so I added them to this recipe and they pass the kid-approved test. This recipe was entered in our school's cookbook and has been a big hit for a quick weeknight supper. Equally tasty with ground turkey.
