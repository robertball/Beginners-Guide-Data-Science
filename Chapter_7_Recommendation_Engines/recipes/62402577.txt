Ingredients:
Spice Blend:
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed with your fingers
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons water
Tofu:
3 garlic cloves, minced (or more)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound extra-firm tofu, drained
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
Fresh black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Blend the spices and salt together in a small cup.  Add the water and mix. Set aside.
Preheat a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat.  Saute the garlic in olive oil for about a minute.  Break or cut the tofu into bite-size pieces and saute for about 10 minutes, stirring often.  Take care that the tofu does not stick to the pan. The tofu should brown on at least one side. The water should cook out of it and not collect too much at the bottom of the pan; if that is happening, turn the heat up and let the water evaporate.  If the scramble seems dry, add splashes of water until it's moist.
Add the spice blend and mix to incorporate.  Add the nutritional yeast and pepper.  Cook for about 5 more minutes. Serve warm.
