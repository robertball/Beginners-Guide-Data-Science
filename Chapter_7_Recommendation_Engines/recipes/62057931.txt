Ingredients:
6 slices of white bread
4-5 apples, peeled cored and cubed
cinnamon
butter or margarine

Directions:
Cook apples and cinnamon in a frying pan with a little butter over medium heat until soft, remove from heat. Cut crusts off of bread slices and discard crusts. Using a rolling pin or soup can, roll out bread slices until thin. Spread apple mixture along longest side of bread and roll up, slice in half(each bread slice makes 2 rolls). Spread butter on top of roll and sprinkle with more cinnamon. Bake, seam side down, at 350 for 20-25 mins, or until golden brown and crispy.
