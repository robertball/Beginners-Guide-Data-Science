Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 1/2 tablespoons honey
1 1/2 tablespoons diced jalapeno chile pepper

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Mix ground beef, jalapeno chile pepper, and honey with your hands in a large bowl; shape into 4 even patties.
Cook on preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 7 to 10 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
This sweet and spicy twist makes for a not-so-ordinary burger. Using only two simple ingredients, honey and jalapeno, who would have ever thought it would be so tasty! I use a counter-top grill that cooks both sides at the same time. It cuts down on grilling time and also reduces fat. I make four equal-sized patties and grill for only about 5 minutes total.
