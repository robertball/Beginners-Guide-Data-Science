1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Cook meat in a large skillet over medium-high heat until brown, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon and breaking up the meat. Remove skillet from heat. Place colander over bowl. Spoon meat into colander and let fat drain into bowl. Return meat to skillet. Discard fat.

Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese over cottage cheese. Add another layer of 2 uncooked noodles, one-third of the meat mixture, the rest of the cottage cheese, and 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese. Layer remaining uncooked noodles, meat mixture, and mozzarella cheese. Finally, sprinkle Parmesan cheese over top, if you like.
Cover baking dish with foil. Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 1 hour. Remove from oven and let stand on a cooling rack with foil cover in place for 15 minutes. Carefully remove foil from dish so steam escapes away from you. Makes 6 servings.
