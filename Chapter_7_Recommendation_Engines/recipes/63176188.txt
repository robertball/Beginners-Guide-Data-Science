Ingredients:
1 box Manischewitz potato pancake mix
3 large russet baking potatoes
1 medium onion
1 cup "Real" egg whites
3 Tablespoons matzah meal
2 cups water
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
Grease casserole or baking dish.
Peel potatoes and alternately grate them with the onion. (This stops potatoes from turning brown.) Squeeze out any excess water.
Combine remaining ingredients in a large bowl. Let rest for 3 minutes as matzah becomes hydrated.
Bake in prepared dish for 1 hour or until firm and top is browned.
Cut into squares to serve.
