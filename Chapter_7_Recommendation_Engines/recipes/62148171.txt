Ingredients:
1 package of square wontons
1 lb sage flavored sausage
1 bunch of green onions
Half a red pepper
Half a green pepper
1/2 c ranch salad dressing
2 cups shredded colby cheese

Directions:
With a minimuffin pan, line each cup with a single wonton wrapper, carefully pressing them into the shape of a cup.  Take care to not tear the wrapper as they will tear easily.
Bake the unfilled wraps at 350 for 8-10 minutes, until they are golden brown.  Place wraps on a cookie sheet and repeat with all the remaining wontons until package is finished.
Brown the sausage, crumbling it well, drain if there is any grease.  Set aside to cool.
Chop peppers and onions finely, add to cooled sausage.  Add cheese and ranch salad dressing, stirring to coat.
Fill each cup with a spoonful of the filling and place on a cookie sheet.
Bake uncovered for 15-20 minutes at 350 until cheese has melted and is beginning to bubble.

Description: 
This is a fabulous appetizer, it does take a little time to prepare, but the taste is well worth it.  If you want to freeze them for later use, they turn out just as good, just pop them in the freezer after filling the cups and then bake a bit longer then in the orginal recipe
