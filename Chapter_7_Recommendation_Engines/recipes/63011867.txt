Ingredients:
2-3 TBS olive oil
6-8 chicken thighs (boneless), diced if you prefer.  Can use breasts if you prefer.
1 container fresh salsa from store in frig section
6 cups water
3 cups white rice
salt

Directions:
Cook chicken in olive oil until browned on med to med high.  I like to cook mine in a cast iron pan or dutch oven, but use whatever you have.  Add salsa and lower heat and cook for about 20-30 minutes.
While the chicken is cooking, put water in a sauce pan with a little salt, place lid on pot.  Put on high till it boils.  Add rice, stir, and put on lowest temperture you can.  Replace lid and check in about 15 minutes.  Don't open pan until then.  When rice is done it should also be sticky.  That makes he best rice for meals.
Serve chicken and salsa over the rice and enjoy.  Very easy, quick, and tastes great.

Description: 
I needed to make dinner one night that was easy and quick to make.  We eat rice a lot, we had chicken and fresh salsa in the frig, so I went to work.  It was really easy and it tasted great.  What was most important is that my kids loved it.  You can also add diced onions, green peppers, or whatever other veggies you like if you want.  This dish just can't lose or be messed up.
