Ingredients:
5 Cups Low sodium chicken broth
16 ounces cooked shredded chicken- white meat only
1 small onion, chopped
3 cloves of garlic, crushed
1 15 ounce can black beans, rinsed & drained
1 11 ounce can corn, drained
1 14.5 ounce can diced tomatoes
1 small can diced green chiles -I forget the ounces! ooppss it's the small ones
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon cayenne (I also sprinkle more in my bowl- for an extra kick)
Juice of 1 lime
Salt
*OPTIONAL- fresh cilantro
Mission EXTRA THIN corn tortillas

Directions:
In a medium pot spray with PAM- add onion & garlic. Cook until onion is slightly translucent. Add in cumin & cayenne-stir for a couple of minutes. Add in all remaining ingredients (except cilantro and tortillas)
Cover and bring to a boil, simmer for a few minutes to blend the flavor.
Meanwhile cut your tortillas into triangles or strips. Place on a baking sheet and spray with PAM & season with salt if desired. Bake at 400 degrees for just about 8 minutes or until golden brown. Watch them- because each oven varies.
Serve your bowl of soup with the chips in it or on the side. Top with cilantro. You may also like shredded cheese and/or sour cream as a topping too.
