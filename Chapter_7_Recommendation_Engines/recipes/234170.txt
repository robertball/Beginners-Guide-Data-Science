Ingredients:
wooden skewers
12 slices bacon
12 mushrooms

Directions:
Soak wooden skewers in a bowl of water for about 10 minutes.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Wrap 1 slice bacon around each mushroom and thread onto skewers, leaving about 1/2 inch of space between each wrapped mushroom.
Cook on the preheated grill, rotating the skewers often, until bacon is crispy, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is the most requested camping food we have. We have these when we go camping EVERY time! We make dozens at a time and there are never any left. My son hates mushrooms and hates bacon but he eats these all up every time. These can also be cooked in the oven over a grill rack in a cake pan.
