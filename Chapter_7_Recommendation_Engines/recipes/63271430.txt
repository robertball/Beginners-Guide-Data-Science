Ingredients:
2 T. vinegar (choose from: red wine vinegar, champagne vinegar, rice wine vinegar, rice vinegar or balsamic vinegar)
6 T. oil (choose from: olive oil, canola oil, vegetable oil or try using 5 T. vegetable oil and 1 T. sesame oil for a rich, nutty flavor)
1 t. mayonnaise (choose from light or regular)
1 t. mustard (choose from: Dijon, yellow, stone-ground, spicy, brown or honey mustard)
2 t. fresh chopped herbs (choose from: Parsley, basil, dill or thyme) Note: You may want to use any combination herbs, but remember to use half the amount if you are using “dried” herbs.
¼ t. salt
¼ t. black pepper
Other flavor options (choose from: 1 T. minced garlic, 1 T. minced shallot, 1 T. grated parmesan cheese, ½ t. sugar, and/or a few squeezes of fresh lemon juice)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except oil. Whisk until smooth and there are no lumps from the mayonnaise or mustard. Slowly drizzle oil into the mixture by pouring in a slow stream as you whisk. It will thicken and look shiny. If the vinaigrette is too tart for your liking, add about ½ teaspoon sugar.
This will make approximately ½ cup dressing. Toss with your favorite salad greens or fresh veggies.
