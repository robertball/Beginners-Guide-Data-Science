Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups peeled and diced potatoes (Yukon Golds)
1/3 cup diced celery
1 small onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup sliced carrots
1/2 lb. cup diced cooked ham
3 1/2 cups chicken stock
1/2 tsp. ground thyme
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/8 tsp. (or less) cayenne pepper
salt and ground white pepper, to taste
FOR THE ROUX:
5 tablespoons butter
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk

Directions:
Combine the potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, ham and chicken stock in a stockpot. Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add thyme and garlic powder and stir well; taste and add salt and pepper as necessary.
FOR THE ROUX:  In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with a fork, and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk (so as not to allow lumps to form) until all of the milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir the roux into the stockpot, and cook soup until heated through. Serve immediately.
