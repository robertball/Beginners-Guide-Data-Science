Ingredients:
3 pounds cooking apples, such as McIntosh or Rome, cored and sliced (do not peel)
1 1/2 cups cranberry juice cocktail
2/3 cup red hot cinnamon candies (available in cake-decorating aisle)

Directions:
In a large pot, combine all ingredients. Bring to a boil. Cook over medium heat, covered, 15 minutes.
Lower heat; simmer until apples are very soft, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly. Transfer to a food processor with the knife blade; process until smooth. Serve warm, chilled or at room temperature.

Description: 
This spicy, bright-red applesauce boasts extra antioxidants (concentrated in the apple skins) and antibacterial activity (in the cranberry juice). As a bonus, cinnamon helps blunt sugar's ability to spike blood glucose. It's an easy alternative to traditional cranberry and apple sauces for your holiday feast.
