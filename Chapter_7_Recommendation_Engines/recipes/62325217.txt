•	5  cloves garlic, minced
•	1/2 to 1 tsps. crushed red pepper

PLACE freshly cooked pasta in a large bowl; set aside.
HEAT the extra virgin olive oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and crushed red pepper flakes; cook and stir 1 minute. Add drained tomatoes and green onions; sprinkle with salt, then simmer.
COOK and stir until just heated through, about 3 minutes. Toss the hot cooked pasta with the tomato mixture.
