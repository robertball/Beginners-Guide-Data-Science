Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) corned beef brisket, seasoning packet discarded
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
1 (12 ounce) bottle beer

Directions:
Place brisket fat-side up on a rack inside an electric pressure cooker. Sprinkle garlic powder and onion powder over brisket; pour beer into the pot.
Seal pressure cooker and cook beef on the "meat" setting according to manufacturer's instructions, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Allow pressure to release naturally according to manufacturer's instructions.
Transfer brisket to a cutting board. Remove top layer of fat from the brisket. Slice across the grain using an electric knife.

Description: 
This method of cooking makes the most tender, flavorful corned beef brisket that you will ever eat! Cooking time does not include the time for the pot to reach the proper pressure and to release the steam. Cutting the finished brisket with an electric knife makes for beautifully cut meat.
