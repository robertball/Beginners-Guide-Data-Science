Ingredients:
1 1/2 lb lean ground beef
1/2 c. dried bread crumbs
1 egg beaten
1 tsp. minced onion
1 tsp. italian seasonings
3/4 tsp. salt
1 8 0z can tomato sauce
1 1/2 c. shredded mozarella cheese
1 6 oz. can sliced mushrooms, drained

Directions:
In a lrg. bowl, combine beef, bread crumbs, egg, onion, Italian seasoning, and salt.  Stir in half of the tomato sauce.  Set aside.
Cut 2 pieces of wax paper 15" long.  Place meat mixture in center of rectangle; cover w/ second rectangle.  With a rolling pin or your hands flatten meat into a 9" x 13" rectangle.  Remove top sheet or wax paper.  Sprinkle meat w/ cheese and mushrooms; top w/ remaining tomato sauce.  Roll up meat like a jelly roll - use wax paper to help.  Place meat seam side down; seal ends securely.  Place meatloaf in a 9" x 5" x 3" bread pan.
Bake at 375 for 30 min.  Spoon off any fat that has accumulated; return to oven for 30 min.  Remove from oven and let stand 5 min.  Serve warm.  Enjoy.
Other ingredients can be added to the filling.  I've tried spinach and garlic.  Have fun experimenting.
