Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon lemon extract
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups chopped almonds
60 milk chocolate candy kisses, unwrapped
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar for decoration
3 (1 ounce) squares bittersweet chocolate
2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In large bowl, beat butter, 3/4 cup sugar and lemon extract until light and fluffy.  Add flour and almonds; beat at low speed until well blended.  Cover; refrigerate at least 1 hour for easier handling.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Shape scant tablespoons dough around each kiss, covering completely.  Roll in hands to form ball.  Place on ungreased baking sheet.  Bake for 8-12 minutes until set and bottom edges are light golden brown.  Cool 1 minute; remove to rack and cool completely.   Sprinkle cookies with confectioners'  sugar.
In small pan, melt chocolate squares and stir in oil until smooth.  Drizzle over each cookie.
