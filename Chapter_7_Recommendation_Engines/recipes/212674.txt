Ingredients:
3 tablespoons poppy seeds
3 tablespoons almonds
1 tablespoon uncooked white rice
1/2 cup fresh grated coconut
2 cups water
1 cup grated jaggery (palm sugar)
1 pinch saffron threads
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom

Directions:
Combine the almonds, poppy seeds, and rice in a bowl; pour enough water over the mixture to cover by about 1 inch. Allow to soak for 4 hours; drain.
Grind the almond mixture with the coconut into a paste using a mortar and pestle.
Stir the water and jaggery together in a saucepan until the jaggery dissolves into the water to make a syrup. Stir the paste into the syrup; add the saffron and cardamom to the mixture. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring continually; boil and stir until thick. Serve hot, warm, or cold, depending on your preference.

Description: 
When I first visited my in-laws my mother-in-law had made gasagase payasa for us. I have been a huge fan of this dessert since then. I like it cold and thinned out with a little milk.
