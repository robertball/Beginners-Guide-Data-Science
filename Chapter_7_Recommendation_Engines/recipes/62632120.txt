Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
3 eggs, room temperature
1 tsp vanilla (optional)
1 cup sour cream
4 cups AP flour (or until spoon stands up)
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Cream butter and sugar until well combined. Add eggs one at a time until well mixed. Finally blend in vanilla and sour cream; set aside.
Into the wet ingredients add one cup flour at a time, until you reach the 4th. Then add a 1/4 cup at a time until a wooden spoon stands straight up in the dough; set aside.
In a small bowl combine baking soda, baking powder and salt. Mix in these remaining ingredients into the dough.
Refrigerate for 1 hour. Drop by tablespoon or small scoop onto a cookie sheet. And bake for 7-10 minutes or until lightly golden and springs back upon touching.
