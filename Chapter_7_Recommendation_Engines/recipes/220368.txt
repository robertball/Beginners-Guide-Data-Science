1 tablespoon chili powder

Directions:
Stir the soup, chili powder and cumin in a 4-quart slow cooker. Add the beef and turn to coat.
Cover and cook on LOW for 6 to 7 hours or until the beef is fork-tender.
Remove the beef from the cooker to a cutting board and let stand for 10 minutes. Using 2 forks, shred the beef. Return the beef to the cooker. Stir the cilantro in the cooker.
Spoon about 1/4 cup beef mixture into each taco shell. Top each with about 1 tablespoon cheese. Top with the lettuce and the sour cream, if desired.
