Directions:
Spray a heavy-bottomed 4-quart pot with cooking spray. Add chorizo and cook, stirring frequently, until fat is released and chorizo is crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the pot using a slotted spoon and set aside.
Pour 1/2 cup chicken stock into the pot and scrape any browned bits on the bottom. Add remaining stock, turnips, onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Cook until turnips are soft, about 15 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Puree mixture with an immersion blender until smooth.
Stir kale into the soup. Cover pot and cook over low heat, about 15 minutes. Ladle into bowl and top with cooked chorizo.
