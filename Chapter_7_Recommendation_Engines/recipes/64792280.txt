Description: 
It’s an interesting time -this quarantine.  I’m finding I have to be very flexible when it comes to meals because the stores have limited items.  This salad is the result of buying  what was at the store and  pantry items  and coming out on top.  Use your favorite dressing to compliment the salad.
