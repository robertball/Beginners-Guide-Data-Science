Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons flour
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese, plus extra for sprinkling
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
1/4 cup flour
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, tenderloins removed
Salt and ground black pepper
3 cups packed torn fresh spinach leaves
2 Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over low heat. Whisk together chicken broth, 2 tablespoons flour, lemon juice, feta, oregano and garlic, set aside.
Flatten chicken breast. Sprinkle both sides of chicken with salt and pepper; dredge in remaining flour. Increase heat to medium-high. Add chicken to pan when wisps of smoke start to rise; saute until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate, cover and keep warm.
Add broth mixture to empty skillet; simmer to blend flavors and thicken, about 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in spinach and tomatoes; continue to simmer until spinach wilts, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Spoon a portion of sauce on each plate, top with a chicken breast, sprinkle with additional feta, if desired and serve immediately.
