Description: 
We sometimes send our delicious Washington salmon all the way to Michigan for my sister to use in this family-favorite dish! The tasty topping can be used on other types of fish, too. Fresh thyme from your garden really sparks the flavor.                                                            --Perlene Hoekema                                                               Lynden, Washington
