Ingredients:
1 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 leek, white parts only, quartered lengthwise and finely sliced
1/2 teaspoon coarse salt
water to cover
1/3 cup milk, warmed
2 tablespoons butter
salt to taste

Directions:
Combine potatoes, leek, and salt in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Add water to cover, about 2 cups. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow about 10 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Carefully release remaining pressure using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain potatoes well and return them to the pot.
Select Saute function. Toss potatoes until dried and starting to sizzle, about 3 minutes. Add butter; stir until melted. Add milk. Mash potatoes with the back of a wooden spoon for a rustic mash, or run them through a ricer for a smoother mash. Taste and adjust the salt.

Description: 
A little something different from traditional mashed potatoes, for the Instant Pot®. The leeks add a very mild oniony flavor. Enjoy!
