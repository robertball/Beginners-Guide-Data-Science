Ingredients:
1 stick butter
1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion salt

1/4-1 tsp cayanne

3tbsp water, mixed with 1 tbsp worchestershire

Directions:
Sift together flour and spices.
Using hands, or pastry cutter, break butter into flour mix until it forms a crumbly texture. Using hands, mix in cheese.
Slowly start to mix in the water/worchestershire mixture until it forms a thick dough that holds shape.
Split dough in half, and form each half into a log, saran wrap and put in the refridgerator for a minimum of 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 375.
Remove from fridge, and slice into 1/4 inch thick coins, and place on baking sheet. Sprinkle with sea salt, if desired.
Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, and turn oven off, but leave crackers in. Leave until cooled, but check every few minutes to prevent from over browning.

Description: 
Rolled into a log, refridgerated, then sliced into coins, these crackers are a easy treat to make yourself. They look rustic and beautiful with little cheese bubbles on top, with awesome cheesey flavor. You might just make your own istead of store bought crackers! Awesome enough by themselves, these little gems are swell with Franks Red Hot buffalo chicken dip!
In addition, these make wonderful pet rodent snacks if you substitute the cayanne with small pet vitamins!
