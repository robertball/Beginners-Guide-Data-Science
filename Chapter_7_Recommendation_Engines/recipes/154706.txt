Description: 
This is a delicious version of Irish Cream liqueur for the chocolate lover.  It is sweet and creamy but definitely not for kids!  It's great in coffee, over ice cream, or on its own.  It's also wonderful as a grown-up frozen dessert; just pour some into your ice-cream maker and freeze as directed.  Because of the alcohol, it will not freeze very firm, but it still works nicely.  Try it as a family-appropriate dessert by omitting the whiskey.
