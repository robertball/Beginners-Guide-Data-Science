Ingredients:
2 prepared pie crusts
2 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and chopped
8 oz blackberries, fresh or frozen
8 oz raspberries, fresh or frozen
8 oz cranberries, fresh or frozen
3/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoons corn starch
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
Combine the fruit, sugar, and corn starch in a large bowl.  Mix until evenly distributed.
Pour fruit mixture into a pie tin lined with the first pie crust.  Place the second pie crust over the top and seal around the edges.  Cut 4-8 lines around the center of the upper pie crust.
Brush the egg across the top of the pie evenly.
Bake pie for 30 minutes.  Open oven and place foil or a silicon crust shield around the edges of the pie.  Bake an additional 25 minutes, or until filling has been bubbling for at least 8 minutes.
Let cool for at least 2 hours before eating.

Description: 
When I lived in Oregon, there were four fruits that grew wild near me.  Years later, I decided to try combining them into a pie, similar to the fruits of the forest pie you can find frozen or in restaurants.  The taste reminds me of the rocky coast and all its wild flavors.  For a variation, try adding fresh huckleberries or rhubarb instead of one of the other fruits.
