Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package bow tie pasta
3/4 cup butter
3 green onions, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Let cool and transfer to a large salad bowl.
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir green onions and garlic until garlic is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir butter mixture into the bow tie pasta and mix in parsley.
