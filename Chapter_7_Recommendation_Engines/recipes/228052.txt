Ingredients:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar
1 tablespoon finely chopped Chinese chives
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®)
1 pound ground pork
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese chives
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 1/2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
50 dumpling wrappers
1 cup vegetable oil for frying
1 quart water, or more as needed

Directions:
Combine 1/2 cup soy sauce, rice vinegar, 1 tablespoon chives, sesame seeds, and chile sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.
Mix pork, garlic, egg, 2 tablespoons chives, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle. Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. Repeat with remaining dumpling wrappers and filling.
Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Pour in 1 cup of water, cover and cook until the dumplings are tender and the pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Repeat for remaining dumplings. Serve with soy sauce mixture for dipping.
