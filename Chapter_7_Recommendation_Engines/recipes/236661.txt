Description: 
This can be a quick last minute appetizer or something you can throw together quickly to take to a pot luck. Generally I always have these items on hand which adds to the ease. I have also subbed out other dressings like Green Goddess with fantastic results. 
I love it because it looks impressive, yet it is easy to make. Serve immediately or you may put the platter in the refrigerator for a few hours.
