Daylily Home Fry Recipe

Ingredients:
1 lb daylily tubers
2 - 3 TB butter
2 - 3 TB olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
Salt
Fresh ground pepper

Directions:
Clean tubers of excess dirt and trim away any small rootlets that may cling to them.  Cut off any green leaves or stems.
In a large stockpot, bring enough salted water to a boil to cover tubers.  Boil them like potatoes until they are tender, about 15 minutes.  Remove pot from heat and drain.  Pour in enough cool (or cold) water to cover tubers and let cool for a few minutes until tubers are cool enough to handle.
Drain cool water from tubers and "peel" them by pinching one end and allowing the tuber to come out of its skin.  They should look a lot like bite-size chunks of peeled potato at this point.
Heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until oil is shimmery.  Put tubers and garlic in and season with salt and pepper.  Heat through and serve immediately.
