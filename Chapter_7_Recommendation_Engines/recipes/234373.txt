Ingredients:
2  chicken leg quarters
½ large red onion, chopped
1  ripe plantain, sliced
6  fresh figs, stems removed
2 cloves garlic, sliced
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
salt and ground black pepper to taste
¼ cup olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
¼ cup water

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
Place chicken quarters in a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Arrange onion, plantain, figs, and garlic around chicken quarters and season with rosemary, salt, and pepper.
Whisk olive oil and balsamic vinegar together in a bowl; pour over chicken quarters. Pour water into casserole dish.
Place casserole dish in the preheated oven; reduce temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
