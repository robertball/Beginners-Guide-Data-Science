Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons instant espresso powder
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
3 cups old-fashioned oats
1 1/2 cups salted peanuts
1 1/3 cups milk chocolate chips
1/2 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and espresso powder. Combine the flour and baking soda; blend into the sugar mixture until just moist. Stir in the oats, peanuts, chocolate chips and coconut until evenly mixed. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are golden. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
