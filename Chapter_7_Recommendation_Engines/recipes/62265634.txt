24 chicken wings, split at joint and tips cut off

2 c. Frank's Hot Sauce
1/4 c. Montreal Steak Seasoning

Salt to taste

Directions:
Move rack to upper third of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F.
Arrange wings in a single layer on a parchment paper-lined sheet pan.
Season wings with lemon pepper and salt.
Bake for 35 minutes or until golden brown and internal temperature reads 180 degrees F.
Transfer cooked wings to a large bowl.
While wings are cooking, reduce Frank's Hot Sauce over medium-high heat by 1/3 in a saucepan.
Add in butter, steak seasoning, and Da Bomb.
Stir until butter is melted and pour sauce over wings.
