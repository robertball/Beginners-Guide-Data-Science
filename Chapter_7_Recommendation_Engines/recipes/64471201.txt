Dinomite's Fluffy Bites Recipe

Ingredients:
- Up to 8 large pancakes or 24 small ones - if you're using large pancakes you will need a cutter (I used a shot glass and shop-bought pancakes for efficiency)
- 1 packet of large marshmallows
- 1 jar of chocolate spread and/or a large bar of your preferred cooking chocolate (if you're not using the spread you may need 2 bars of chocolate)
- Cocktail sticks
- Tubes of coloured icing (optional)
- Paper cases

Directions:
Lay out paper cases on a tray and place a mini pancake in the bottom of each one. If using large pancakes, cut out as many smaller ones as you can using a cookie cutter or a shot glass.
Break the chocolate into small chunks, place in a microwave-safe bowl and heat on high power for a couple of minutes, stopping every minute or so to stir it well. The chocolate should be smooth with no lumps but be careful not to burn it.
Spoon a small amount of melted chocolate (or chocolate spread) onto the pancake and immediately place a marshmallow on top. (You can dip the marshmallows in the chocolate instead but don't burn your fingers)
Decorate with coloured icing (Dinomite red and blue in this instance) or leave them as they are.
Push a cocktail stick in the top of each one and leave to cool for a few minutes before serving. (If you're making these in advance, keep them refrigerated and then leave time for them to reach room temperature before serving for that melt-in-the-mouth experience!)
