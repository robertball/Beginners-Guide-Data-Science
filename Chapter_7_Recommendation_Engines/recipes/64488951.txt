Ingredients:
One Small Pie Pumpkin
32 oz. (One Box) of Chicken Broth
One Leek, Chopped
One Handful of Baby Carrots
2 Tbsp Olive Oil
2 Tbsp Butter
4-8 oz. Crème Fraîche
8-10 Sage Leaves
One Handful Chopped Chives
Pepper to Taste

Directions:
Prepare the pumpkin by cutting it in half, de-seeding it, and peeling it with a vegetable peeler. Cut into small one-inch chunks and place in a pot along with butter and olive oil, with leek (chopped and rinsed) and baby carrots. Sauté everything for ten minutes, adding extra olive oil if necessary; then add chicken broth to the pot and bring to a boil.
Simmer for ten minutes, add sage, and then simmer for ten more minutes; stirring occasionally with wooden spoon. You can add pepper to taste during this stage.
Place in food processor and purée until the mixture is smooth. Pour back into the pot, add crème fraîche, and heat through and stir, until crème fraîche is mixed in.
Serve immediately with chopped chives.
