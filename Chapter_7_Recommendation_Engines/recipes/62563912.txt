Ingredients:
1/2 cup Dry white wine (I suggest using dry vermouth)
1/2 lb Cream cheese
1/2 lb Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
1/4 lb Blue cheese, crumbled
1/4 cup Green onion, chopped
1 Tbsp butter or margarine (for cooking onion)
2 Tbsp crushed garlic
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a pot on the stove (or, if you have an electric fondue pot, you can do this right in the fondue pot), melt butter and saute onions and garlic over medium heat until onions are softened (about 3 minutes)
Add dry wine and cream cheese.  Mix until cream cheese is fully melted and creamy.
Gradually add the Monterey Jack cheese and mix thoroughly.
When the Monterey Jack cheese is melted, add the blue cheese crumbs and either transfer to a warm fondue pot or turn down the heat to "warm" on your electric fondue pot.
I like this with crusty bread but almost anything you dip in this will be awesome!
