Ingredients:
15 oz cannelli beans or another small white bean, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup green onions, use mostly the green ends, cut into 1/2 in. chunks
2 T tahini
1 T freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/4 tsp ground cumin
1/8 tsp salt
1/8 tsp black pepper
1 clove garlic, peeled and cut into 1/4ths
1 - 1 1/2 T EVOO
water, if needed

Directions:
Place all except the EVOO and water into a food processor. Process until smooth, stopping to scrap down sides as needed. As the processor is running slowly drizzle in the EVOO. If still too thick add water at small amounts until desired consistency is reached. Can serve immediately or chill for at least a few hours to let flavors develop.
