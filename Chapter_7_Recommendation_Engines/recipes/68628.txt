Description: 
Yes, the title says it all! This recipe was created by mistake. While using another recipe as a guide, I made the mistake of using cocktail sauce instead of chili sauce. Well, this was the best darn mistake I have ever made. These pork chops had the most wonderful zip to them! Mistakes like this should happen more often!
