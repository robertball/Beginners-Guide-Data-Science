Ingredients:
Cake:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 eggs
3/4 cup vegetable oil or applesauce
3 cups grated zucchini
Frosting:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, room temperature
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans or 9x13 pan.
In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, white sugar, and salt. Mix well.
In another bowl, beat eggs, vegetable oil, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together. Pour into egg mixture into the flour mixture and mix well. Stir in the shredded zucchini. Pour batter into prepared pans.
Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted into each layer comes out clean, about 25 minutes for 9-inch pans or 55 minutes for 9x13 pan. Allow cakes to cool in pans for 10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack and allow to cool completely.
To Make Frosting: Beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Add the confectioner's sugar, a little at a time, and beat until smooth. Stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla. Spread between cake layers and stack to make a 3-layer cake.
