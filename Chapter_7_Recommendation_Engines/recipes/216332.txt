Ingredients:
12 (2 inch) frozen mini tart shells
1/4 cup melted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
2 teaspoons evaporated milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup flaked coconut
2 tablespoons strawberry jam

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place frozen mini tart shells on a baking sheet.
Beat the butter, sugar, egg, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract, mixing until fully combined. Stir in the coconut. Place 1/2 teaspoon of jam into each mini tart shell, and fill the shells with about 1 tablespoon of the coconut mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until the shells and topping are lightly golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack.

Description: 
My Grandma used to send these to the soldiers in the Second World War. I've modified their sugar content as they used to be quite sweet.
