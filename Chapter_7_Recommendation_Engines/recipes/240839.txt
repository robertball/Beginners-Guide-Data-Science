Ingredients:
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 cup finely shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 tablespoons taco seasoning mix
12 jalapeno peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded
2 tablespoons fine bread crumbs, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper.
Blend cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, and taco seasoning together in a bowl; spread into jalapeno halves and arrange onto prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle bread crumbs over the cheese filling.
Bake until the peppers are just tender, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
After a number of unsatisfactory attempts at making deep-fried poppers, I modified a recipe by Emeril that is much easier than frying and everyone in our family agrees that these are at least as good as -- if not better than -- any fried poppers they have had! We love hot peppers and always make a lot of these from the ones we grow in our garden every year.
