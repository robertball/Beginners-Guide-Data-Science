Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package thin spaghetti, broken in half
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 ½ pounds chicken tenders, cut into bite-size pieces
4 stalks celery, sliced
2  red bell peppers, sliced
1  red onion, sliced
⅔ cup shredded carrots
1 cup chicken broth
½ cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon sesame oil
¾ cup unsalted peanuts
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.
Heat oil in a large non-stick pan or wok over medium heat; cook and stir chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Add celery, red bell peppers, red onion, and carrots; cook and stir until vegetables are slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
Mix chicken broth, soy sauce, cornstarch, garlic powder, and sesame oil in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until desired thickness of sauce is reached, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir peanuts, garlic, and red pepper flakes into chicken-vegetables mixture; cook for 2 minutes more. Pour sauce over chicken-vegetable mixture; add spaghetti and toss to coat.

Description: 
I had a dish like this at a restaurant in Canada on my honeymoon and thought it was delicious, so I tried to recreate it once I got back home. This is the result.
