Ingredients:
2 large sweet potatoes
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup evaporated milk
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust

Directions:
Bake sweet potatoes whole in skin for 60 minutes, or until done.  Run cold water over the sweet potato, and remove the skin.
Place sweet potatoes in a bowl.  Add butter and mix well with mixer. Stir in sugars, milk, eggs, nutmeg, cinnamon, lemon zest, flour and vanilla. Beat on medium speed until mixture is smooth.  Pour filling into an unbaked pie crust.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 60-70 minutes, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Allow to cool for two hours before slicing. Serve chilled or room temp. For that extra special touch, serve with a dollop of Cinnamon-laced whipped cream!
