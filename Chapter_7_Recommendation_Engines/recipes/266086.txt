Ingredients:
3 cups filtered water
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup dried red hibiscus flowers
1/8 cup dried white hibiscus flowers
1/3 cup freshly squeezed grapefruit juice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1/3 cup pomegranate seeds

Directions:
Heat water to a low boil. Add sugar and hibiscus flowers; stir until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Strain; discard hibiscus flowers. Add grapefruit juice and mint and mix well. Refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours.
Pour chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer's instructions. Add pomegranate seeds 5 minutes before the granita reaches the soft-serve stage.
