Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon minced garlic, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated flaky biscuit dough
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with 2 tablespoons butter.
Stir garlic, dry mustard, and 2 tablespoons melted butter together in a small bowl. Separate biscuits and cut each biscuit into 4 pieces; place cut biscuit quarters into the prepared baking dish. Drizzle melted butter-garlic mixture over the cut biscuits and sprinkle Parmesan cheese and sesame seeds over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until monkey bread is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes; serve warm.
