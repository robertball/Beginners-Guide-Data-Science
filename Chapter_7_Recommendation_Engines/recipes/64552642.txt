Ingredients:
2/3 cup white long grain rice
3 cups warm water
2 cinnamon sticks
3/4 cup sugar
2 cups rice milk
½ cup Fireball® whiskey
¼ t. cayenne
¼ t. ground cinnamon
Ground cinnamon, for serving

Directions:
Using a coffee or spice grinder, grind rice into fine pieces. Transfer to a bowl along with cinnamon sticks and cover with warm water. Cover and allow to sit overnight, or at least 8 hours.
Strain rice mixture through sieve; press wooden spoon against solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids.
Stir in sugar and milk and taste. Mixture should be pretty sweet; remember that the sweetness will be dulled by freezing, so don’t under-sweeten.
Measure out 2 ½ cups horchata and add Fireball® whiskey, cayenne and cinnamon. Pour into popsicle molds and freeze for at least 12 hours. Pops with alcohol take longer to freeze.
Run molds under warm water, release popsicles, sprinkle with a dash of ground cinnamon, if desired, and serve. Makes eight 3oz pops.
Note: If you normally use your coffee grinder for coffee, easily clean it by grinding ¼ cup of rice. Dust out interior and discard rice, then grind your rice for horchata.
