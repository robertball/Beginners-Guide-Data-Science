2 1/2 tsp active dry yeast

1 tbsp fennel seeds
1 tbsp anise seeds
1 tsp salt

2 cups milk, scalded and cooled

Directions:
Sprinkle yeast in water and set aside for 5 minutes.
Crush fennel and anise seeds into powder.  Add to yeast mixture with salt, sugar, butter, milk, and rye flour.  Mix well.
Add enough bread flour to make a stiff dough.  Let rest for 15 minutes.
Turn dough onto floured surface and knead until smooth, about 10 minutes.  Grease a large bowl.  Place dough in bowl and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
Punch dough down and divide into 4 portions.  Place balls on greased baking sheets and let rise for about an hour.
Bake in a preheated oven at 375 for 25 minutes.  Cool for at least an hour before slicing.
