Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
4 large portobello mushroom caps, cut into 1/2-inch slices
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups Arborio rice
3/4 cup dry white wine
6 cups chicken stock, or more if needed
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook onion in hot oil until softened, about 3 minutes. Add bell pepper and portobello mushrooms to the skillet, season with kosher salt and pepper, and continue cooking another 10 minutes.
Stir Arborio rice into the mushroom mixture. Pour white wine into the skillet; cook and stir until the wine is warmed. Add chicken stock 1 1/2 cups at a time, stirring continually to allow each addition to absorb into the rice before adding the next, until all stock is integrated, 20 to 30 minutes. Stir heavy cream into the rice mixture; cook about 1 minute. Remove the skillet from heat and stir Parmesan cheese into the risotto. Let sit 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I haven't seen any recipes with bell peppers in it, so I decided to try this on my own. Had a 6-person dinner party that I served with some bone-in pork chops. I first thought I made too much, but all of my guests were upset that there wasn't more. Hope you like it.
