Ingredients:
• 2 Cornish game hens (1½ to 2 pounds each), cut down the back with kitchen shears to butterfly
• 1½ tsps. olive oil
• 1½ tsps. dried thyme leaves
• ¼ cup dry plain bread crumbs
• Salt and ground black pepper
• ¼ cup Dijon mustard

Directions:
Adjust rack to lowest position and heat oven to 425 degrees.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add thyme and bread crumbs; toast until fragrant and golden, a couple of minutes.
Lightly sprinkle hens all over with salt and pepper. Place on a rimmed baking sheet large enough for them to comfortably fit in a single layer. Brush hens with mustard and sprinkle with bread crumbs.
Roast until impressively golden brown and juices run clear when leg thigh is pricked with a fork, about 30 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes. Halve and serve.
