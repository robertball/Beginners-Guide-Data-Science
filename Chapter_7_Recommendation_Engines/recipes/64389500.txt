So easy!
Chop noted ingredients put all in large bowl.

Description: 
So fresh, so easy, and packed full of protein with the tofu. Eat on crackers, serve as a complete meal salad, or go with smaller servings as a side dish. It looks and tastes EXPENSIVE. A definite show off at your next gathering or pot luck.
