Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out dough
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon fine salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup shortening
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon, or as desired

Directions:
Sift together all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
Beat together butter and shortening using an electric mixer in another bowl until combined; add sugar and continue beating until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Pour in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pour in flour mixture and blend until batter is smooth.
Dust a work surface with flour and roll out cookie dough with a floured rolling pin into a 1/4-inch thick rectangle. Sprinkle cinnamon generously over the dough. Roll up the dough gently into a log starting on one of the long sides. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Unwrap the dough log and carefully slice into 1/4-inch pieces without smashing down the cookie. Place on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden around the edges, about 12 minutes.
