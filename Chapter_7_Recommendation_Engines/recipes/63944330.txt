Ingredients:
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
4 tablespoons butter or avacado oil
2 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes, with liquid
1 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons mustard powder
1 teaspoon celery seed
3 clove garlic, minced
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1 diced, carmelized onion

Directions:
Carmelize onion in pan. Remove.
In a shallow dish or bowl, combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper. Coat chicken breasts with flour mixture. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown chicken on all sides. Remove from skillet, and drain on paper towels.
In the same skillet, combine the tomatoes, water, brown sugar, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. Season with salt, chili powder, mustard, celery seed, garlic and hot pepper sauce. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, and return chicken to skillet. Cover, and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes, or until chicken is tender, no longer pink and juices run clear.
