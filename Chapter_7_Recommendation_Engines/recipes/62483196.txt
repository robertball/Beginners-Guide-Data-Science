Ingredients:
1 teaspoon Active Dry Or Instant Yeast
4 cups All-purpose Flour
1 teaspoon Kosher Salt
1/3 cups Extra Virgin Olive Oil

Directions:
Sprinkle yeast over 1 1/2 cups warm (not lukewarm) water.
In a mixer, combine flour and salt. With the mixer running on low speed (with paddle attachment), drizzle in olive oil until combined with flour. Next, pour in yeast/water mixture and mix until just combined.
Coat a separate mixing bowl with a light drizzle of olive oil, and form the dough into a ball. Toss to coat dough in olive oil. Cover with a moist kitchen towel and set in a warm place for 1-2 hours.
Divide dough in half. Lightly drizzle olive oil on a pizza pan or rimmed baking sheet. Using your hands, stretch dough to the desired shape, pressing the dough into the pan with your fingers.  The thinner the crust is, the better your pizza will be.
Lay the desired toppings over the dough and bake pizza for 8-10 minutes in a preheated oven at 500 degrees. The edges should be golden brown.
