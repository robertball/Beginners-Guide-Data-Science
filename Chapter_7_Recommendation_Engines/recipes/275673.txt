Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) bars dark chocolate, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package purple candy melts
1 (8 ounce) package green candy melts
Assorted sprinkles and candies

Directions:
Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Divide dark chocolate, purple candy melts, and green candy melts between 3 microwave-safe bowls. Heat each separately for 1 minute, then stir. Continue heating in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until completely melted.
Pour contents of each bowl onto the pan in random spots; don't worry if they overlap. Shake pan to spread melted chocolate and candy. Use a knife to swirl colors together and shake pan again to spread even more. Sprinkle Halloween sprinkles and candy over chocolate mixture. Let set, about 15 minutes. Break into shards.

Description: 
Drizzle pre-colored candy melts over dark chocolate into the festive design of your choice, then cool, break into shards, and voila! Homemade Halloween candy. Chocolate bark is one of the easiest things you can throw together for any holiday or event. Just change up the color of the chocolate and switch up the themed sprinkles you use every time.
