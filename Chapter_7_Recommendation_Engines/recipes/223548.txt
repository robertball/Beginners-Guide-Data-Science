Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1 (15 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained (juice reserved)
1 cup couscous
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1/3 cup warm water
2 tablespoons taco seasoning mix

Directions:
Combine 1/2 cup water and reserved pineapple juice in a saucepan over medium-low heat; bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Stir couscous into the liquid to coat. Set aside until the liquid is absorbed and the couscous is tender, about 5 minutes; fluff with a fork. Divide onto 2 plates.
Stir pineapple chunks and black beans together in a skillet over medium heat. Mix 1/3 cup warm water and taco seasoning mix in a small bowl; pour over the black bean mixture. Cook and stir the mixture until hot, 5 to 7 minutes. Spoon over couscous to serve.

Description: 
A quick and easy meal with protein from the black beans and couscous. You will also love the sweet pineapple with the spice from the taco seasoning. Depending on how much juice was with your pineapple, you may need to add more water to the couscous if it looks like it needs it.
