Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 pounds cube steaks, pounded thin and cut into bite-size pieces
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 medium onion, chopped
1 pound mushrooms, sliced
salt and pepper to taste
1 (1.2 ounce) package brown gravy mix
2 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes
1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles

Directions:
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Dredge steak strips in flour. Working in batches, place strips in hot oil. Fry until browned on both sides. Remove to a warm platter. When all meat is browned, return meat to Dutch oven, and stir in onions, mushrooms, salt, pepper, gravy mix, and stewed tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then simmer about 30 to 45 minutes.
About 20 minutes before steak is finished, fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
Serve Swiss steak over noodles.

Description: 
My mother has been making this Swiss steak for years. It is wonderful, and can be made either on the stove top or -- when you don't have a lot of time but want a hearty meal ready when you come home -- in the crock pot. Serve over a bed of egg noodles or rice with a hunk of thick crusty bread.
