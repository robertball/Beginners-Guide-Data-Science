Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) bottle Italian dressing
1/3 cup soy sauce
3 Tablespoons cup Worcestershire sauce
10 cloves of pressed garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1 teaspoon ground ginger
4 to 6 tablespoons brown sugar
4 pounds bone-in chicken parts

Directions:
In a large container, mix the Italian dressing, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, mustard, ginger, and brown sugar. Place chicken in the container and marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat grill for high heat.
Lightly oil grill grate. Discard marinade and place chicken on grill. Cook 30 minutes, or until chicken juices run clear. Smaller parts will be done more quickly.

Description: 
A simple marinade results in some mighty fine grilled chicken.   1 Bottle of Bernsteins Italian dressing 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1/3 Cup Soy Sauce 4 to 6 Tablespoons Brown Sugar 10 Cloves of Pressed Garlic 1 Teaspoon Dry Mustard 1 Teaspoon Ground Ginger This recipe is the best. Our family also uses this for steak. We tend to let it sit in the fridge for a few days turning it once a day to move around the seasonings. Keep a spray bottle near the grill because this flares up sometimes. Enjoy!Modified from: Secret Sauce Chicken
