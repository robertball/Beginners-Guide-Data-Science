Ingredients:
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
4 eggs
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup cubed fully cooked ham
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a 6-in. broiler-proof skillet, saute the onion, green pepper and garlic in oil. Reduce heat to medium. In a bowl, beat eggs, salt and pepper. Add egg mixture and ham to vegetables. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When eggs are nearly set, sprinkle with cheese. Broil 4-5 in. from the heat for 1-2 minutes or until eggs are completely set.

Description: 
This egg dish is true to my Italian heritage. Italians make frittatas with many combinations of ingredients. I'm a creative cook, so I came up with this simple recipe based on how I remember my grandma making this dish. Even at that, I'm not sure I make it the same each time. -T.
