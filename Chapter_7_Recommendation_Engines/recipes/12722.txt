24 large clams
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup minced onion
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup dried bread crumbs
4 slices bacon
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoons olive oil

In a small skillet, cook bacon until crisp over medium heat.  Crumble, and set aside.
Wash clams.  Place on a baking sheet.  Heat in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven for 1 to 2 minutes, or until clams open.  Discard any that do not open.  Remove meat from shells. Chop, and set aside.
Add 2 tablespoons oil and butter to a small skillet, and place pan over medium heat.  Add onion, pepper, and garlic; saute until tender. Remove from heat, and cool.
In a medium bowl, combine bread crumbs, bacon, oregano, cheese, sauteed vegetables, and chopped clams.  Mix well.  Fill clam shells with mixture, and place on baking sheet.  Sprinkle with parsley and paprika.  Drizzle with olive oil.
Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 7 minutes.  Serve.
