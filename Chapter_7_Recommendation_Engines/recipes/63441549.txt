Ingredients:
1 box spice cake mix (can also use a yellow cake mix for less “spice”)
1 box (small) instant pudding, pumpkin spice flavor
3 eggs
1/3 cup oil
1 can(s) pumpkin (15 oz)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together well. Pour into greased loaf pan, or 4 mini loaf pans.
Bake at 350, 45-55 minutes for large pan, 20-30 minutes for minis, or until a toothpick inserted comes out fairly clean (moist crumbs are ok)
Cool 5-10 minutes in pan, then remove to cool completely on cooling rack.
