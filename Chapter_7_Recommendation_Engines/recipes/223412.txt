3/4 cup halved and thickly sliced celery stalks
2 tablespoons chopped white onion
1/3 cup sliced green onions
1/2 cup salted sunflower kernels
1/2 cup mayonnaise, or to taste
2 tablespoons white vinegar, or to taste
sea salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Combine coleslaw mix, celery, white and green onion, and sunflower kernels in a large salad bowl. Mix in mayonnaise; sprinkle salad generously with white vinegar, salt, and black pepper to desired consistency and flavor. Refrigerate overnight and adjust seasoning if desired.

Description: 
I was making my old regular coleslaw one afternoon and found it too bland for company. I only had a few items on hand at the time to tweak the recipes, and pickles did not seem appropriate. So this is what I came up with. Very simple but very tasty. Since you use salted sunflower seeds, use salt sparingly.
