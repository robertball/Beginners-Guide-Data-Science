Ingredients:
1 potato, peeled and cubed, or more to taste
3 cups water
1 1/2 cups jasmine rice
1 tablespoon peanut oil, or more to taste
1 tablespoon red curry paste
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 (14 ounce) can light coconut milk
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon paprika, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half, cut into cubes
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/2 sweet onion, diced
1/4 green bell pepper, diced
1/4 yellow bell pepper, diced
1/4 red bell pepper, diced
1 carrot, diced
3 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon yellow curry powder
1 bay leaf
1/2 cup frozen peas

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain.
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat peanut oil in a large deep skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir red curry paste, ginger, and garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir coconut milk into curry paste mixture until well blended. Stir cayenne pepper, paprika, cumin, and salt into coconut milk mixture; add chicken and cook until chicken is about half-cooked, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir chicken stock, potatoes, onion, green bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, red bell pepper, carrot, fish sauce, brown sugar, curry powder, and bay leaf into coconut milk-chicken mixture; cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Add peas to mixture; cover skillet and cook until peas are heated through, about 5 more minutes. Serve over cooked jasmine rice.

Description: 
This is a mix of several different recipes to create a hybrid of Thai and Indian curry chicken. It has a bit of a kick to it, but is a very tasty kick of spice. There is also a layer of sweetness, which gives it a good mix of sweet and hot. Served over jasmine rice added another dimension to the flavor.
