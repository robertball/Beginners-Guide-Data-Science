Ingredients:
5 wide-mouth quart size Mason jars
10 ounces cucumber ranch dressing
2 tbsp buffalo hot sauce, such as Frank's
4 stalks celery, cut into 1/8" thick slices
4 medium carrots, cut into 1/8" thick slices
15 ounces cooked chicken, cut into bite-size pieces
10 cups salad greens
1 1/4 cups crumbled blue cheese
3/4 cup croutons, optional

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together the ranch dressing and hot sauce.
Divide the dressing evenly between the 5 mason jars, forming the first layer.
Divide the celery evenly between the jars, forming the next layer. Top the celery with the carrots.
Place 3 ounces of chicken over top the carrots.
Top the chicken with 2 cups of salad greens in each jar.
Place 1/4 cup of blue cheese over top of the salad greens. Seal and refrigerate each jar until ready to use.
If using croutons, divide these evenly into 5 small resealable plastic bags.
When ready to eat, dump jar contents and optional croutons into a bowl and toss.
Cook's notes: Adjust the amount of hot sauce used to your liking. Make sure to pack the lettuce into the jar tightly to remove any air pockets. This will help ensure the salads stay fresh all week.
