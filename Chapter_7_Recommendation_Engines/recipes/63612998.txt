Candy Penguin Cupcakes Recipe

Ingredients:
Unfrosted cupcakes, any flavor
White frosting
Coconut
1 bag of large marshmallows
Sanding sugar, white sparkly sugar, or white sprinkles
1 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 Tbsp. shortening
Candy corn
Trolli Gummi Strawberry Puffs (or 5 cent strawberry puffs)
1 cube almond bark (or white chocolate chips to make eyes)
Yellow and orange Starbursts
Supplies:
1 pair kitchen shears
Some kind of foam, preferably floral foam
Bamboo skewers or sucker sticks
1 large Ziploc bag
2 small Ziploc bags (snack size is perfect)

Directions:
In a large, heat-safe cereal bowl or a small mixing bowl, combine chocolate chips and shortening. Heat in the microwave, stirring about every 30 seconds, until the chocolate is completely melted and flows easily.
While chocolate is melting, insert a bamboo skewer about halfway into a flat end of each marshmallow. You can stick these into the craft foam while you wait for the chocolate to continue melting.
Now…you’re going to want to work on about 6 penguins at a time.
Working quickly (and holding the end of the bamboo skewer), dip each marshmallow into the chocolate and tap the skewer onto the side of the bowl a few times to remove excess chocolate. Place the skewer holding the dipped marshmallow into the craft foam so the chocolate can dry without touching anything.
Pour a small amount of sanding sugar/sparkly sugar/sprinkles onto a plate. Using your kitchen shears, carefully cut a thin slice (about 1/8?) of marshmallow. Dip the sticky side (or just one side if both sides are sticky) into the sanding sugar and then carefully place the non-sugared side onto the dipped marshmallow. The melted chocolate will hold the marshmallow slice in place and the sanding sugar will keep yucky stuff from sticking to his tummy. Repeat with remaining dipped marshmallows.
Next, take two candy corns per penguin and place them directly “above” (they’ll end up on bottom, though) the penguin’s tummy with the fat, yellow end poking out (these are his feet). You want to form a little “V” with the white ends so the feet stick out at an angle. This is a great stopping point.
Once the penguins are dry, ice your cupcakes.
Place a semi-penguin on each iced cupcake and gently press some coconut or sanding sugar around each penguin body (for snow). More directions in notes.
