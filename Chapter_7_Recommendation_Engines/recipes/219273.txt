Ingredients:
4 large tomatoes, diced
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
1/2 pound dry tagliatelle or wide fettucine pasta
1 tablespoon shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Stir together the tomatoes, basil, red wine vinegar, olive oil, and oregano in a bowl; allow mixture to stand at least 10 minutes.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the tagliatelle pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but still firm, about 8 minutes. Drain well. Mix the hot cooked tagliatelle into the tomato mixture; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
A super easy, fresh, fast pasta dish that can be made as a main course or side dish.  I always try to make it with heirloom tomatoes when they are in season.
