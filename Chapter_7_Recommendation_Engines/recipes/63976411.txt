Ingredients:
2 c sugar
1/2 c cocoa
1/2 c milk
1/2 c (one stick) butter
3 c oatmeal
1/2 c peanut butter (I prefer crunchy)
1/2 tsp vanilla
Dash salt

Directions:
Bring sugar, cocoa, milk and butter to a rolling boil in medium saucepan.  Boil two minutes (less if the pan has a thin bottom-I use a copper-bottomed pan).  Add oatmeal, peanut butter, vanilla and dash of salt.  Drop by teaspoonfuls on wax paper, parchment paper, or a buttered cookie sheet to cool.
