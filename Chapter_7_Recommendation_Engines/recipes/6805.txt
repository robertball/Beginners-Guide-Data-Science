Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1 egg
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup fresh blueberries

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).  Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
In a large bowl, stir together milk, egg, and oil.  Add flour, baking powder, sugar, and blueberries; gently mix the batter with only a few strokes.  Spoon batter into cups.
Bake for 20 minutes.  Serve hot.

Description: 
These muffins are absolutely delicious.  The secret is in NOT mixing the batter too much: the less you mix, the better the muffins are. You can replace the blueberries with chocolate chips to make an even better muffin--so my kids say.
