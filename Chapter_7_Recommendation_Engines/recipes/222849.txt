Ingredients:
3 ears corn, husked
1 fresh poblano chile pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 limes, juiced
1 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and cut into chunks
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 cup slices red onion

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook corn on preheated grill until kernels are cooked through, turning regularly, 10 to 20 minutes; set aside to cool. Cut kernels from the cob and place in a large bowl.
Cook poblano chile pepper on the preheated grill until the skin blackens, turning regularly, 5 to 10 minutes; set aside to cool. Peel and seed the poblano. Cut poblano into 1/2-inch pieces; add to the bowl with the corn.
Whisk olive oil, lime juice, chipotle pepper, and salt together in a bowl; pour over corn and poblano mixture. Add avocado, cilantro, and red onion to the mixture and gently toss to coat.

Description: 
Great summer salad. I usually end up adjusting the chipotle and lime juice depending on who I am making dinner for.  This is a perfect summer salad, great for BBQ.
