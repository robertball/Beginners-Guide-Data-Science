Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup uncooked white rice
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained

4 hard-boiled eggs, mashed

4 cornichons, minced
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 bunch fresh dill, chopped

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and cool for a minimum of 4 hours or overnight.
Combine cooked and cooled rice, corn, imitation crab, eggs, onion, and cornichons in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Stir together mayonnaise and garlic in a small bowl; pour over salad. Mix well. Sprinkle with chopped dill.
