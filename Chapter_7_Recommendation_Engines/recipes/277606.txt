Ingredients:
Cinnamon Topping:
1/2 cup white sugar
5 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
Cake:
1 cup butter, softened
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 eggs
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch glass baking dish.
Mix together sugar, cocoa powder, and cinnamon in a small bowl; set topping aside.
Combine butter and cream cheese in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add sugar and mix until well blended. Mix in vanilla extract. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift in flour and baking powder and blend until thoroughly combined. Fold in chocolate chips.
Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared baking dish and sprinkle with 1/2 of the cinnamon topping. Spread remaining batter on top and sprinkle with remaining topping.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 60 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Serve warm.

Description: 
Recipe passed to me a few months ago by an aunt. Make sure to use high quality cocoa for a richer flavor. This will keep well in a fridge and can be reheated in the microwave (covered loosely with a paper towel or napkin).
