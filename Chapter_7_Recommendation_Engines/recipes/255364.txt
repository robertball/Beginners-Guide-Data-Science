Ingredients:
3 large ripe bananas, mashed
2 cups rolled oats
1 cup chopped dates
2 tablespoons applesauce
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons natural peanut butter
1/2 cup chocolate chips
1 teaspoon raw sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Mix bananas, oats, dates, applesauce, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl with your hands. Stir in peanut butter until blended; mix in chocolate chips. Let dough stand until oats soften slightly, about 10 minutes.
Drop 1-inch scoops of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet; flatten lightly. Sprinkle raw sugar on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
