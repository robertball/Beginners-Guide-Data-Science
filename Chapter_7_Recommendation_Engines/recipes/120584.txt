Description: 
IOWA--'We are retired and not longer have an orchard, but we bury crisp apples each fall from a nearby fruit grower. My husband and I really enjoy them, so we always get several bushels. We each eat an apple a day in winter.    'For get-togethers, I like to make apple pie, apple salad or Apple Cake (recipe below). It's a moist yummy cake with a rich sweet butter sauce.'                                            --Leona Luecking, West Burlington
