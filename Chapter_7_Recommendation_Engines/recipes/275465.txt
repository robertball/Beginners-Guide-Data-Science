Ingredients:
cooking spray
12 egg whites
1/2 cup skim milk
3 1/2 cups frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup onion, chopped
4 tablespoons cooked crumbled bacon, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
4 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat an 8-inch square baking dish lightly with cooking spray.
Whisk egg whites and milk together in a large bowl. Stir in hash browns, 3/4 of the Cheddar cheese, onion, 2 tablespoons bacon, salt, and chili powder. Pour into the prepared dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar cheese and bacon, and green onions. Let stand for about 5 minutes before cutting into 6 equal pieces.
