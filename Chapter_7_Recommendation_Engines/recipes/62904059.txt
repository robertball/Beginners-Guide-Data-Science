Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar
4 TBS water
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tsp vanilla
1 cup (2 sticks) SALTED butter, softened
2 lbs confectioners' sugar
2 TBS meringue powder(optional)
6-8 TBS milk

Directions:
stir together granulated sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. continue cooking, without stirring, until mixture turns dark amber in color, about 6 to 7 minutes. WATCH CLOSELY as the caramel will burn quickly once it is ready.
remove from heat and slowly add in cream and vanilla (just start with a tablespoon or two), stirring with a wooden spoon until completely smooth. be careful, as the mixture will definitely bubble up and possibly splatter a bit as you add in the cream. also, if you add the cream too quickly, your caramel will seize. set aside until cool to the touch, about 25 minutes.
beat the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light in color and fluffy, about 3 minutes. reduce speed to low, add meringue powder and powdered sugar alternately with milk and mix until completely incorporated.  turn off the mixer, and add caramel. beat frosting on low to combine, scrape down the sides of the bowl and then increase to medium-high and beat until fluffy.
