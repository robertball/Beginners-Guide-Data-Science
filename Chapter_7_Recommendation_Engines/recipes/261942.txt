Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1 small onion, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can whole sweet corn, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chile peppers, undrained
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper, or to taste
2 teaspoons lime juice
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
8 (8 inch) whole wheat tortillas

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir turkey and onion in the hot skillet until turkey is browned and no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Add corn, black beans, tomatoes, red bell pepper, lime juice, garlic powder, chili powder, and cumin. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors combine, 15 to 20 minutes.
Place tortillas on a microwave-safe plate. Heat in the microwave until warmed, 15 to 20 seconds. Divide turkey mixture over the warmed tortillas.

Description: 
Turkey burritos are a lighter version of our favorite beef burritos. My husband actually prefers these over the local Mexican restaurant! Optional toppings: lettuce, fresh spinach, avocado, salsa, tomatoes, black olives, fat-free sour cream, low-fat Cheddar cheese, etc.
