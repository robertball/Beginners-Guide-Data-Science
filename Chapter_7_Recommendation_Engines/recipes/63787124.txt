Ingredients:
8 ounces small raw shrimp, shelled & deveined
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp black ground pepper
1/2 tsp cornstarch
2 tbsp cooking oil divided
3 eggs
2 stalks green onion, minced
4 cups left over rice
3/4 cup peas & carrots (if frozen, defrosted)
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp sesame oil

Directions:
In a bowl, toss the shrimp, salt, pepper, & cornstarch. Let marinate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Heat a wok or large saute pan on high heat. When pan is hot enough for a bead of water to instantly sizzle and evaporate, add 1 tbsp of cooking oil to pan and swirl to coat pan.
Add the shrimp to pan, spread out so that not touching. Let fry for 30 seconds, flip over and let the other side fry for 30 seconds, or until about 80% cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the pan onto a plate.
Turn the heat to medium. Add the eggs to the pan, stirring in a quick motion to break up the yolk and scramble the eggs. Cook the eggs about 80% (slightly runny in the middle) and dish out the eggs onto the plate with the cooked shrimp.
Clean pan with a paper towl and turn heat to high again. Add remaining 1 tbsp of cooking oil to pan, swirl to coat.
When oil is hot, add green onions and fry until fragrant (~15 seconds). Add in the left over rice, mix well with green onions and spread to evenly coat the pan.
Let the rice sit, untouched, until you hear the bottoms of the rice grains sizzle (1-2 minutes). Then stir or toss the rice.
Drizzle soy sauce all around the rice and toss/stir.
Add peas, carrots, cooked eggs, cooked shrimp, and sesame oil, tossing/stirring to mix the rice evenly with all the ingredients.
Let everything heat up again. Taste and add more soy sauce as needed.
