Ingredients:
Taco Meat:
1 lb. ground beef
1/2 packet taco seasoning
1/2 cup water
Toppings:
small bags of Doritos or one large bag
lettuce, chopped
tomatoes, diced
onion, finely diced
shredded cheese
Ortega taco sauce
sour cream
salsa

Directions:
Brown ground beef and drain fat. Add water and taco seasoning. (Follow instructions for meat mixture on the back of the taco seasoning packet.)
Using small bags of Doritos, crush the chips and top with taco meat. Using a large bag of Doritos, crush about a handful of chips and place in a cereal bowl or on a plate and top with taco meat.
Top your walking taco with cheese, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. My family likes topping off our tacos with Ortega taco sauce, salsa and sour cream.
