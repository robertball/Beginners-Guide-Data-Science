Ingredients:
16 ounce bottle or can of enchilada sauce
6 tortillas
1 jar of salsa
2 cans of refried beans
1/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1/4 cup shredded Monterrey Jack Cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup kalamata olives, pitted
1 jalapeno, chopped and seeded
Roasted Chicken, diced

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees.
Pour the can of enchilada sauce into a pie dish.  Dip tortillas in the sauce to soften them.
On a cutting board, gently spread refried beans on one side of each tortilla.  Add enough chicken to cover the beans.  Sprinkle with cheddar and Monterrey Jack cheeses.  Add olives, jalapeno and salsa.
Roll up the tortillas and place seam-side down in a 9x13 baking dish.
Blend the sour cream into the remaining enchilada sauce in the pie dish.  Pour over enchiladas and sprinkle remaining cheese.
Cover and bake for 25-30 minutes until hot and bubbly.
