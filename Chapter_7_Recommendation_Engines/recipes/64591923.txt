Title:
Chicken Rice Soup Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
8 cups chicken stock (I usually make it with bouillon granules & sometimes add a can of chicken broth)
1/2 cup rice, uncooked
2 cups chopped cooked chicken (or 2 - 3 whole fresh or frozen chicken breasts)
2 stalks celery
2 sliced carrots
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a dutch oven. (I usually add chicken breasts right out of the freezer.)
Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer about 1/2 hr or so till meat is cooked (if using fresh/frozen) and veggies are tender.
Remove whole chicken breasts and cut into whatever size pieces you prefer. Return to soup.
Remove bay leaf or have a bay leaf lotto haha! and see who finds it in their bowl ;)
This soup is even better the next day or if it's left longer to simmer and thicken.
Using less broth or more rice and veggies will make soup thicker too.

Description: 
I got this recipe from a dear friend who's now a memory. We were gathering recipes together to publish a book one day & I still have this recipe written in her handwriting :) I've since added my own notes. It's my go-to comfort food on cold days or for someone not feeling well.
