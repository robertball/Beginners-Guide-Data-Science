Ingredients:
2 cups shredded potatoes
1 cup shredded yellow squash
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 egg
4 tablespoons self-rising flour
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup cooking oil

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine potatoes, squash, onion, egg, flour, garlic salt, salt, and pepper.  If the batter is too thin, add more flour; if too thick, add milk.  Form batter into 3-inch patties.
Cover the bottom of a large skillet with just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan,  and heat over medium-high heat.  Place patties in hot oil, and cook until golden brown on each side; drain on paper towels.
