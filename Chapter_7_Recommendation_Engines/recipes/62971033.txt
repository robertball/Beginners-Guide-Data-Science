Ingredients:
1 pound elbow macaroni (or other similarly shaped
pasta-like small shells) cooked
1 pound ground turkey (or beef, chicken, sausage
or tofu crumbles -- whatever works for you)
2 eggs
1 pound ricotta cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper
1 jar spaghetti sauce: 24 - 26 ounces
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Brown meat and drain well, if necessary.
While meat is cooking, stir together eggs, ricotta, grated Parmesan and salt and pepper.
Mix cooked meat, macaroni, sauce and veggies. Add ricotta mixture and blend well.
Coat a 9x13 baking pan with cooking spray or olive oil and spread half of macaroni mixture evenly over the bottom. Top with a cup of mozzarella and a healthy sprinkle of grated Pamesan. Add the remaining macaroni mixture and top with another cup of mozzarella and another sprinkle of Parmesan. Cover with foil.
At this point the whole thing can go into the refrigerator to be cooked when you're ready.
Heat your oven to 350 degrees F and bake the casserole for 20 minutes. Uncover and bake for another 10 to 20 minutes until the cheese on top is lightly browned and bubbly.
