Ingredients:
1/2 cup salted butter
1/3 cup coconut sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 eggs
1 1/4 cups cassava flour
1/4 cup almond flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
pinch sea salt
For topping:
2 tablespoons coconut sugar (additional)
1 tablespoon cinnamon

Directions:
In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stir butter until melted.
Continue stirring gently until it just begins to darken in color and a slight nutty smell; immediately remove from heat.
Pour into a medium mixing bowl and place butter in freezer for 10 minutes to cool slightly.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Sift together flours, baking powder, and sea salt.
In a small dish, mix together topping ingredients and set aside.
Remove butter from freezer and use an electric mixer to beat in 1/3 cup sugar, vanilla extract, and eggs.
Gradually add flour mixture and continue beating just until combined.
Using a medium cookie scoop, gently roll dough-balls in topping mixture.
Bake on parchment lined pan for 10-11 minutes.
Allow to cool completely before moving to serving plate.

Description: 
These grain-free cassava flour cookies are made with coconut sugar so they're much healthier than the traditional version, slightly less sweet, and full of cinnamon-y goodness.  Because cassava flour is more starchy, expect a bit drier cookie and be sure to let it cool completely on the cookie sheet.
