Ingredients:
1 cup Amish Friendship Bread Starter
3 eggs
3/4 cup oil
1/2 cup milk
1 cup sugar brown
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups flour
1 box instant chocolate pudding
1 teaspoon instant coffee
1 cup mini chocolate chips
1/4 cup peanut butter
1 box instant vanilla pudding
1 bag peanut butter chips
1 box of Girl Scout Tagalongs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325° F (165° C).
In a large mixing bowl, add ingredients as listed up to the flour.
Pour half the mixed batter into another bowl.
To one bowl, add chocolate pudding, coffee and chocolate chips.
To the other bowl, add peanut butter and vanilla pudding.
Grease two large loaf pans.
Dust the greased pans with a mixture of 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cocoa powder.
Pour the vanilla batter evenly into loaf pans.
Evenly pour peanut butter chips on top of the batter.
Pour chocolate batter evenly on top and sprinkle the remaining sugar-cocoa mixture and crushed Tagalongs.
Bake for one hour or until the bread loosens evenly from the sides and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.
ENJOY!
