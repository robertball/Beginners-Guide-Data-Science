Ingredients:
Pizza Dough
Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm (105-110F) water
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 package active dry yeast
1 cup whole-wheat flour
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
Pizza Sauce
Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup Cabernet Sauignon
28 ounces canned crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoons fresh flat leaf parsley, chopped
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
Pizza:
1 cup mozzarella
1/4 cup Parmesan
17 slices turkey pepperoni

Directions:
Dough Instructions:
Put the water, oil and salt in a small bowl and sprinkle with yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes, until foamy.
Combine fours in a food processor. With the processor running, pour the yeast mixture through the feed tube. After the dough forms in a ball, move it to a lightly-floured counter. Knead briefly, until smooth and elastic.
Spray a bowl with non-stick, add dough and cover tightly. Let rise in a warm spot until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.
Punch down and roll out int a 12 inch circle.
Sauce Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet, add onion and saute over medium heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for an additional minute. Increase heat to high and add wine, deglaze the skillet and stir until  almos all the liquid evaporates. Add tomatoes, parsley, salt and pepper, reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.
Building your pizza:
Preheat oven to 400F
Spray a pizza pan or stone with olive oil and place crust on it.
Spread about 1/2 cup of pizza sauce to within about 1/2-inch of the edge of crust. Top with 1/4 cup Parmesan and 1/2 cup part-skim mozzarella. Arrange 16-18 pieces of turkey pepperoni and top with another 1/2 cup of mozzarella.
Bake until cheese is lightly browned, 12-15 minutes.
