Ingredients:
•2 lbs ground beef
•1 med onion, chopped
•Garlic powder
•3 10-oz cans Old El Paso enchilada sauce (med heat)
•10-count large flour tortillas
•Large bag grated cheddar (or your favorite) cheese

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400
2. Spray large baking dish w/cooking spray
3. Brown ground beef & onions together w/the garlic powder; drain
4. Pour in one can of the enchilada sauce & let simmer till meat absorbs the liquid.
To Assemble:
1. If you have a  ceramic-top electric stove, on the large burner of your stove (set on about 5 or 6), heat both sides of a tortilla just till heated & pliable; I have a cast iron round griddle pan that works well too, or just a flat-bottom skillet will work.
2. Spoon generous portion of meat mixture down center of tortilla;
3. Add a handful of cheese;
4. Fold top & bottom of tortilla toward center, turn a half-turn, fold bottom up, then roll & place in baking pan.
5. When pan is full (8 to 10 enchiladas), pour remaining 2 cans of enchilada sauce over all enchiladas making sure to cover them or they will be dry;
6. Cover w/grated cheese;
7. Bake for about 20 minutes or until cheese on top is melted & lightly browned.
8. Serve with your favorite condiments…suggestions: sliced black olives, salsa, sour cream, sliced jalapenos, diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce
