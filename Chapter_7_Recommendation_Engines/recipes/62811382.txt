Description: 
This is my version of the wonderful house almond mandarin salad served at a local restaurant.  My husband actually likes it better than theirs and it's my favorite salad!  To get the right flavor, be sure to use seasoned rice vinegar because it has sugar and salt in it.  To crush the almonds, I just double bag them in zipper bags and coarsely crush them with a hammer.
