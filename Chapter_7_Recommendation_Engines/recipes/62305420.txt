Ingredients:
20 gms (3/4 ounce) dried Porcini mushrooms.
Half a medium onion, thinly sliced or finely diced, your choice of how you want to present.
2 Tablespoons of plain flour.
1 glass dry white wine (can be red wine for red meats, but I like white better - see also the footnotes and choose the wine to suit the soaking mixture).

Directions:
Soak the porcini mushrooms in 300 ml (1 1/4 cups) of warm water (or a mixture - see fotnotes) for at least 10 minutes.
Remove the mushrooms from the liquid and retain the liquid. Chop the mushrooms as coarsely or as finely as you wish - it's YOUR presentation.
In a smallish pan, gently saut√©e the onion until soft.
Add the chopped 'shrooms to the onion pan and increase the heat. Fry for 2 minutes.
Add the flour, whisking well to remove any lumps and cook for a further 2 minutes.
Deglaze the pan with the wine and throroughly scrape the pan of all crusty bits.
Add the retained mushroom soaking liquid, bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and reduce the sauce by half to remove the alcohol.
Keep warm until required.
