Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2 large eggs
1/4 cup oil
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/3 cups corn meal
2/3 cup flour
8 to 10 hot dogs (depending on size)
flour for dusting (about 1/2 cup)
oil for Deep Frying
sticks

Directions:
Heat oil for fying in a deepfryer or a tall pot.
In a large bowl sift together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder and seasoning.
In a separate bowl combine the eggs, milk, sugar and oil.
Now combine the liquid mixture into the flour mix and blend to make a thick batter.
Dry the hotdogs with a papertowel and dust them with flour.
Insert the sticks halfway into the hotdog or further to insure the hot dog will stay on the stick.
You can either roll the hot dogs in the batter bowl or you can use a tall drinking glass and dip them in. Put only half the glass full of batter, becuase otherwise it will overflow.
Quickly put the battered hot dog into the hot oil and cook until evenly brown on all sides.
