Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package elbow macaroni
4 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
3 stalks celery, minced
1 (6 ounce) package frozen peas, thawed
2 cups low fat mayonnaise (such as Hellmann'sÂ® Low Fat)
3 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons white vinegar
3/4 teaspoon celery seed
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.
Stir eggs, celery, and peas together in a large bowl. Whisk low fat mayonnaise, yellow mustard, sugar, vinegar, celery seed, and salt in a separate bowl, dissolving the sugar. Pour dressing over vegetables and stir in macaroni until thoroughly coated with dressing. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
