Ingredients:
2 pounds baby carrots (two 16-ounce bags)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon table salt

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Toss carrots, oil, and salt in broiler-pan bottom. Spread into single layer and roast 12 minutes. Shake pan to toss carrots; continue roasting about 8 minutes longer, shaking pan twice more, until carrots are browned and tender.

Description: 
Inspect your bag of baby carrots carefully for pockets of water. Carrots taken from the top of the supermarkets carrot pile are often waterlogged. This not only makes carrots mealy, it also dashes any hopes of caramelization in the oven.
