Place the potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook 15 minutes, or until tender.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic until tender.

This recipe was given to me by my mother-in-law. It is always served at family get togethers and BBQs. You can use regular peeled and cubed potatoes if you can't find baby potatoes.
