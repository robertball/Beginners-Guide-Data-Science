Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups vegetable broth
3/4 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
1 tablespoon margarine
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
2 tablespoons peanut oil
1/2 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 large yellow onion, sliced
2 cups sliced mushrooms
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon minced garlic
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  In a saucepan combine broth, rice and margarine.  Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed.
Place sesame seeds on a small baking sheet and bake in preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes, or until golden brown; set aside.  Meanwhile, heat peanut oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat until very hot.  Add asparagus, bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, ginger and garlic and stir-fry for 4 to 5 minutes, or until vegetables are tender but crisp.  Stir in soy-sauce and cook for 30 seconds.  Remove from heat and stir in sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds.  Serve over rice.

Description: 
In this dish, the peanut oil is preferable to the vegetable oil, as the flavor of the peanut oil adds a really nice nutty flavor.
