Description: 
This is a favorite around our house; it's quick, easy and tastes great! This is a recipe that I came up with; measurements can be varied depending on your taste, i.e. if you want more cheese add more cheese, if you want less use less, you really can't hurt it. And you really can't mess it up as long as you use this recipe as a foundation.
