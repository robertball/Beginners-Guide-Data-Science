2 cups heavy cream
1 tablespoon instant coffee granules
1/2 cup chocolate syrup
1/2 cup butter, chilled
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup chopped mixed nuts

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine cream, instant coffee and chocolate syrup in a large bowl and place in refrigerator.
In a mixing bowl, cut butter into flour until mixture resembles large crumbs.  Stir in nuts and press into a 9x9 inch baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven 15 minutes, until lightly browned.  Let cool completely.
Beat chilled cream mixture with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.  Spread over cooled crust, cover and freeze 4 hours, until firm.

Description: 
I received this dessert recipe from a friend when I asked her what to make for a baby shower. It was very easy to make and was first to be gobbled up at the shower.
