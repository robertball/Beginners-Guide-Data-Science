Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/972479.jpg
Ingredients:
1  skinless, boneless chicken breast
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
2 teaspoons Greek seasoning, or to taste
1 cup brown rice
2 cups water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch casserole dish.
Place chicken breast in the prepared baking dish. Spread cream of mushroom soup evenly over chicken; generously sprinkle with Greek seasoning. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Bring brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.
Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces; stir rice into chicken mixture. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes before serving.
