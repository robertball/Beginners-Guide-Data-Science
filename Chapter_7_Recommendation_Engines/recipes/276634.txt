Ingredients:
cooking spray with flour
Cake:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
3 eggs
1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 limes, zested
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
Glaze:
1/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup lime juice
Icing (Optional):
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 tablespoon water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat an 11x7-inch baking pan with cooking spray with flour.
Cream sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer. Add eggs, yogurt, and lime juice; mix well. Mix in lime zest. Sift in flour, baking powder, and salt; mix well. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until center is set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the glaze by heating sugar and lime juice in a saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves and becomes a clear liquid, 3 to 5 minutes. Poke holes throughout the top of the cooled cake using the end of a wooden spoon; pour glaze over the cake and let soak in. Continue to let cool.
Mix powdered sugar, lime juice, and water together in a bowl for icing and drizzle over the cooled cake.
