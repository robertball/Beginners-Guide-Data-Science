Ingredients:
4 oz cream cheese, room temperature
2 eggs
2 T parmesan cheese, grated
1 c mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/2 to 3/4 c pork rinds, crushed/ground, like almond flour (or sub portion for ground keto cheese crackers)
1 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp oregano
pinch salt, if desired

Directions:
preheat oven to 425F
combine cream cheese, egg, cheeses, and spices with hand mixer or immersion blender
add pork rinds, mix with spoon until well combined; add more pork rinds if needed to make a dough
divide into portions if desired
make a dough ball, cover and refrigerate for 10 min to make easier to roll
cut two large pieces of parchment paper
roll dough out between sheets of paper
put on cookie tray or pizza pan
bake in preheated oven for 15-20 min until slightly golden
let cool
add toppings
reduce heat to 400F
bake again until cheese melted and toppings done to liking
tips:
- refrigerating dough before rolling makes it much easier to roll
- don't over bake the crust, as you will need to bake another 10 min or so with toppings
- I used a paper towel to mop up some of the cheese grease when baking the crust to get a crispier crust
- this is the only time I'd use low moisture mozzarella, less grease, so crust isn't soggy
- I used 1/2 of this dough to make the pizza pictured; I wrapped the other half in saran wrap and put in freezer for next time
- I didn't have enough pork rinds so used 1/2 c pork rinds and 1/4 c crushed/ground keto cheese crackers
- to make the cheese crackers, get pre sliced cheese of your choice (pepper jack, cheddar, Swiss, etc), cut each into four squares, put on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cover cheese with paper towel and leave on counter for 24-48 hours to dry out/absorb moisture, then bake at 350 for 10 min or so until crisp)
