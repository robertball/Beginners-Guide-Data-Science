Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoons honey
1/4 cup coconut flakes (optional)
2 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Bring coconut milk to a gentle boil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in oats and honey; lower heat and simmer until milk has mostly been absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Sprinkle coconut flakes, brown sugar, and cinnamon into oatmeal. Cook until oats are creamy and flavors are combined, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Oatmeal is only as exciting as the stuff you put into it, since it's boring on its own. This dish is sweet and creamy, a tad exotic, and the kids will love it. If you want, prepare it the day before, refrigerate, and reheat in the microwave. Enjoy!
