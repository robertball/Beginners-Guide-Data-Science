Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
25 pounds ripe tomatoes
2 large onions, finely chopped
1 cup minced garlic
1 cup olive oil
1 (12 ounce) can tomato paste
3/4 cup dried oregano
2 large bunches fresh basil
Salt, to taste
Crushed dried red pepper, to taste
1 cup burgundy wine

Directions:
Use 2 (12-quart) nonstick pots, if possible. If regular pots are used, spray with vegetable spray. Nonstick pots are best because tomatoes tend to stick.
Rinse and quarter whole tomatoes (do not peel). Cook in one pot at medium boil for 2 hours, stirring often to prevent sticking.
Mash hot tomatoes through a sieve; discard skin and seeds. Return juice to pot and bring to a boil.
In second pot, saute onions and garlic in olive oil on low heat. Add tomato paste and cook 10 minutes, stirring constantly.
Add tomato juice to mixture in second pot, 1 quart at a time, stirring after each addition. Bring to a boil and turn heat to low for a slow boil. Add oregano, basil, salt, crushed red pepper, and wine. Simmer 1 to 2 hours to blend and thicken.
Let cool to room temperature before freezing in plastic containers. Use quarts, pints, and/or half pints to suit your needs.

Description: 
I found this recipe in the newspaper many years ago. It is not a very thick sauce, so some people may want to thicken it up a bit. I usually add a little sugar to the sauce when I go to use it.
