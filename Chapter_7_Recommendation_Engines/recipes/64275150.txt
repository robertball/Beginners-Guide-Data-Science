Ingredients:
1 pound dry great Northern beans (I use 15 bean mix)
8 cups chicken broth (I use about 2-1/2 cartons)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 ham hock/hambone
1 cup chopped carrots
1/2 stalk celery, chopped
1 cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon mustard powder
2 bay leaves
2 cups chopped ham
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper

Directions:
Rinse the beans, sorting out any broken or discolored ones. In a large pot over high heat, bring the water to a boil. Add the beans & salt and remove from heat. Let beans sit in the hot water for at least 60 minutes (2 hrs is better).
After the beans have soaked, rinse the beans in a collander and return to the pot.  Add 8 cups broth, and place the ham bone, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, mustard and bay leaves in the pot. Stir well, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 60 more minutes.
Remove ham bone and discard. Stir in the chopped ham and simmer for 30 more minutes. Season with ground white pepper to taste.  (I take a few cups of finished soup and run in the blender and add back to soup to thicken it.  BE CAREFUL--HOT THINGS IN BLENDER EXPLODE!  Only blend a little at a time.
