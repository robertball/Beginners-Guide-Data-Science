Description: 
I recently was at an early Thanksgiving potluck where our host had made this insanely great salsa.  Even with all the people buzzing about his home, he graciously dug out his recipe for me to copy down.
This salsa is light, bright, and fresh, with a hint of sweet and creamy thanks to the avocado.  It is absolutely addictive whether eating it with chips or fresh vegetable dippers.
