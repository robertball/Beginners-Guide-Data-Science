Ingredients:
2 cans sweet potato
2/3 c. buttermilk
4 c. white flour (or a mix of white flour and whole wheat pastry flour)
1/2 c. brown sugar
2 T baking powder
2 tsp salt
2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice (or use 1 T fresh finely minced ginger, 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp ground clove)
12 T frozen butter (1.5 sticks of butter), cut into chunks

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425.
In a large box, mix together the buttermilk and canned sweet potato until very smooth.
In a food processor, mix together all the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder salt, spices.
Add the butter one chunk at a time, pulsing a few times after each addition.  After all the butter is added pulse until the mixture looks like very rough cornmeal.
Dump the dry mixture on top of the sweet potato buttermilk mixture.
Using a wooden spoon mix the ingredients together until you make soft dough.
It's okay if there are lumps!  Don't overwork the dough.
Using a large soup spoon, drop dough onto cookie sheet.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until biscuits begin to brown.
Place on a cooling rack, serve immediately.
Serve with honey, butter, and bacon.
