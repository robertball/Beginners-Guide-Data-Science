Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1/2 pound ground pork
3/4 cup canned whole kernel corn
1/2 cup crumbled cornbread
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup shredded pepperjack cheese
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1/4 cup milk
1 egg, lightly beaten
3 fresh jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.
Mix the ground beef and ground pork in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the corn, cornbread, sour cream, pepperjack cheese, onion, milk, egg, jalapeno peppers, garlic, kosher salt, and pepper. Gently mix the corn mixture into the meat mixture. Form into a rounded loaf shape, and place in the prepared baking dish
Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 160 degrees F (72 degrees C). Loosely cover with aluminum foil during the last 15 minutes of cook time if the loaf is overly brown.
