Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground pork sausage
12 eggs, beaten
1/2 (4 ounce) can chopped green chile peppers, drained
1 small onion, chopped
1 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups.
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine eggs, chiles, onion, garlic powder, salt pepper and sausage; mix well. Spoon 1/4 cup of sausage mixture into each prepared muffin cup.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until egg has set and a toothpick inserted into each 'muffin' comes out clean.

SMILEYBLAKE
Description: 
This is a quick and easy morning or afternoon snack. I use the regular size muffin pans but fill them enough 1/3 full, but may adjust the amount of filling to suit your taste.
