5 tablespoons butter, melted
5 cloves garlic, minced

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place scallops, melted butter, garlic, and shallots in a bowl. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Stir gently to combine. Transfer to a casserole dish.
In a separate bowl, combine bread crumbs and olive oil. Sprinkle on top of scallops.
