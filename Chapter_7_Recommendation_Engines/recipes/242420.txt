Ingredients:
1/2 cup bread crumbs
3 (4 ounce) fillets swai fish
1/2 cup creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip®)
3/4 cup shredded Asiago cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Put bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Press swai fish, skin-side down, in bread crumbs. Spread creamy salad dressing onto exposed side of each fillet. Arrange fillets in a baking dish and top with Asiago cheese; season with salt and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 45 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe one day standing in front of the freezer for inspiration. The swai is a 'meaty' fish that when coupled with Asiago and Miracle Whip® tastes like crab cakes without the hassle. Side with steamed broccoli or any fresh vegetable that is steamed.
