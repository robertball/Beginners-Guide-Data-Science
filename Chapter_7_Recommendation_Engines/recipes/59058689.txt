Description: 
I made this recipe a bit easier and pocket-book friendly by doctoring up a store bought box of cornbread mix.  Use the extra money you save to make whipped honey butter to serve with the bread and really make your family feel like grandma made this recipe.Modified from: Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread
