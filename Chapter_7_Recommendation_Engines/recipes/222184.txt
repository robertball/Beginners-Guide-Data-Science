Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon paprika, plus more for sprinkling
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, plus more for sprinkling
1 teaspoon garlic powder, plus more for sprinkling
1 teaspoon dried parsley, plus more for sprinkling
1 teaspoon dried dill weed, plus more for sprinkling
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 whole trout, cleaned
1/4 cup butter, divided
1 lemon, thinly sliced
1/2 cup blanched slivered almonds

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine flour, paprika, rosemary, garlic powder, parsley, dill, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Shake bag to mix contents. Place trout into bag, one at a time, seal bag, and shake to thoroughly coat with seasoned flour. Lay each trout onto a large piece of aluminum foil.
Insert 1 tablespoon butter, a few lemon slices, and a few slivered almonds into the cavity of each trout; press the cavities closed. Top fish with more lemon slices and almonds. Sprinkle fish with a pinch of paprika, rosemary, garlic powder, parsley and dill.
Place trout on aluminum foil sheets onto preheated grill and cook until fish are browned and the flesh is opaque  and flakes easily, about 8 minutes per side.

Description: 
I use this recipe all the time in the kitchen and the outdoors for fresh trout. To add some variation, substitute the lemon with a an orange and add 3 to 4 fresh pieces of asparagus lengthwise and some sliced onion in the cavity; top with a couple slices of bacon. Hope you enjoy it!
