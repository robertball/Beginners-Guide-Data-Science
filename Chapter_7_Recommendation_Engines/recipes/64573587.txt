Ingredients:
2 pieces of bread
1 hotdog
Some Mayonesa (Mexican Mayonnaise)
Some Ketchup
and I guess a microwave.

Directions:
Spread the Mayonesa on on one piece of bread (with a butter knife)
Cut the hotdog vertically in half and then those halves in half again
Put the pieces of hotdog into microwave for 1 min.
When the hotdogs are done (they'll be hot) put them on either piece of bread
Put Ketchup on the hotogs (yes I said Ketchup)
Put both slices of bread together like a sandwich
THE END.
