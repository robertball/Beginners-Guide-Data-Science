Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar and brown sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until just blended. Finally, mix in the chocolate chips. Shape dough into golf ball sized balls and place them 3 inches apart into ungreased cookie sheets. Flatten slightly.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This recipe does taste like Mrs. Field's.  When I make them it does not take long for my husband and three boys to make them disappear.
