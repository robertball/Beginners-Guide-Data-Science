Ingredients:
2x medium Courgette
250g Turkey Breast Strips
1x Red Chilli Pepper
1x Bell Pepper
200g Green Beans
3 tbsp Soy
1x Garlic Clove
1 tbsp Coconut Oil
Optional: Chia seeds and Poached eggs for garnish

Directions:
Put the coconut oil in a pan onto a medium heat to melt. Chop the chilli and garlic finely, and crushed with the side of a knife before adding to the pan.
As the pan warms up and the oil/garlic/chilli begins to sizzle, add the turkey strips and cook for 4-5 minutes until nearly done.
During this time I usually chop the bell pepper and green beans, and spiralize the courgettes.
Add the soy sauce, chopped bell peppers, and green beans to the pan and allow to sizzle for 2 to 3 minutes until the turkey is cooked through.
Finally, add the spiralized courgette and stir continuously for 2 to 3 minutes until just starting to soften.
Serve immediately, garnish if you wish and season with a little black pepper.
Enjoy your low carb, highly nutritious, and extremely colourful meal!

Description: 
Spiralizers are the new thing, and itâ€™s amazing how easily you can whip up a low carb meal. This can take around 20 minutes, from fridge to table! I used Turkey breast but pretty much any meat will work here, and it also gives great freedom with what vegetables you want to add. You will need a spiralizer or pre-spiralized courgette.
