My friends mom is Chinese and living in Hong Kong, and she sent my friend this family recipe, at my request, because I couldn't find a good one on the internet, and I asked him if his mom had a special recipe. If you love Lo Mein and want to make an authentic Chinese recipe for it, then this is it!
