Ingredients:
2 cups half-and-half
8 large eggs
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons raisins
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 loaf white bread, torn into large chunks
Butter Sauce:
1 stick butter
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10x12-inch baking pan.
Combine half-and-half, eggs, sugar, heavy cream, raisins, cinnamon, and vanilla extract in a bowl; mix well.
Arrange bread pieces on the bottom of the prepared pan. Pour cream mixture over bread. Allow to soak 10 to 15 minutes.
Place the baking pan into a larger pan; fill the larger pan with water halfway up the sides of the smaller pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 75 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a small skillet over low heat. Pour into a small bowl; add confectioners' sugar and mix well.
Remove bread pudding from the oven. Poke holes throughout using a butter knife. Pour butter sauce over the top.
