THE FRIDGE
RINSE OFF THE BRINE WITH COLD WATER AND PAT FISH DRY
LEAVE THE FISH TO GLAZE OVER (ABOUT AN HR)
HEAT SMOKER TO 180 USE ANY COMBO OF WOOD CHIPS THAT
YOU LIKE(WE HAVE BEEN USING THE TREGER WOOD PELLETS)
LOTS OF SMOKE FOR A COUPLE HRS THEN ADJUST SMOKE,KEEP THE TEMP AT 180
WE USUALLY START BASTING AFTER AN HR, THEN EVERY HALF HR OR SO WITH THE MAPLE SYRUP BASE.
