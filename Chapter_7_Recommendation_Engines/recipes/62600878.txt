Ingredients:
5-6 lb boneless leg of lamb
3 large cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped
1 T. dill weed
1 T. rosemary
5 T. strong mustard such as dijon
1 T. brown sugar
1 T. kosher salt
2 tsp. black pepper
2 T. olive oil

Directions:
Remove netting from roast if present, rinse meat in cold water and pat dry, set aside. Place garlic, dill and rosemary in food processor bowl and pulse briefly 2-3 seconds. Add remaining ingredients except oil and pulse again. Scrape down sides of processor bowl, then while processor is running, slowly drizzle in oil. Open roast and liberally smear marinade over meat. Roll meat tightly and truss with butcher string. Place on rotisserie rack and insert into rotisserie per machine directions. Cook on rotisserie at 350' for approximately 2 hours or until meat thermometer reads between 135-140'. Remove from oven and cover with foil, let rest for at least 15 minutes. Remove from bar and slice. Alternate cooking methods- may bake at 350' in oven same directions. Or may place on grill over hot coals spread on 1/2 of grill, turning meat 1/4 turn every 5 minutes, then move to indirect heat and cook with cover down until meat reads 135'.
