Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix (such as PillsburyÂ®)
3 ounces white cake mix extender
1 1/4 cups water
4 egg whites
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries
1 cup water
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Blend cake mix plus extender, 1 1/4 cups water, egg whites, and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer until just moistened. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 32 to 26 minutes.
While cake is baking, stir sugar and cornstarch together in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add 1 cup water and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Add blueberries and lemon juice; cook and stir until blueberries burst and sauce turns a deep purple color, about 10 minutes. Gently mash any berries that did not burst. Remove from heat and let cool until cake is ready.
Transfer cake to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature, at least 25 minutes.
Poke holes into the cake about 1 inch apart using the handle of a wooden spoon. Slowly pour the warm blueberry sauce over cake. Refrigerate until cool before slicing.
