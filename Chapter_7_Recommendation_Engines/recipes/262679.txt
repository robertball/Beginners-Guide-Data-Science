Ingredients:
1/2 baguette, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1/3 cup breakfast sausage
1/4 cup diced onion
5 large eggs
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place baguette slices on a baking sheet.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Cook and stir onion in the same skillet until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add eggs and sausage; stir until eggs are set, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Divide egg mixture among baguette slices and sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 8 to 10 minutes.
