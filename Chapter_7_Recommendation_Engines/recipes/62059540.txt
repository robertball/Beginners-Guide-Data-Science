Ingredients:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1/2 cup BBQ sauce for chicken (divided in half)
1/2 cup red pepper, cut into thin strips
2 green onions, chopped
2 cups mozzarella/cheddar cheese, blend, grated
1 tbs Italian seasoning
1 tbs. Parmesan Cheese (optional)
4 Pocketless pita breads

Directions:
Rinse Chicken breasts; pat dry. Brush the chicken with 1/4 cup of the BBQ sauce and place on the grill at medium-high heat, and grill for 8 minutes on each side, covered.  Remove from grill; set aside for a few minutes to cool slightly, then slice.  Reduce heat of the grill to medium.
Meanwhile, mix the remaining 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce with the pizza sauce.  Spread 1/4 of the pizza/BBQ sauce mixture on each pita to 1/2" of the edges; place equal amounts of chicken, red pepper, and green onion on each.  Top with grated cheese and sprinkle with italian seasoning and parmesan cheese, if desired.
Place each pita on the grill and close the cover and heat through for 6 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
Cut into wedges and serve immediately.  Makes a great party appetizer if sliced, or an entree as a whole.
