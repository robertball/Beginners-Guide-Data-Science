Ingredients:
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water
1 pound pork tenderloin, cubed
1 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
3 teaspoons dark sesame oil
1 tablespoon peanut oil
3 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
2 green chile peppers, chopped
1/2 cup julienned carrots
1/2 cup sugar snap peas, julienned
2 teaspoons chili oil
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/4 cup finely chopped peanuts

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon cornstarch and water. Mix all together until smooth and stir in the pork cubes. Cover and refrigerate for 30 to 45 minutes.
In a small bowl combine the lime juice, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, vinegar, 1 teaspoon cornstarch and sesame oil. Mix together and set aside.
Remove pork and marinade from refrigerator. In a large skillet or wok heat peanut oil until hot. Stir in ginger and chile pepper and saute for 1 minute. Then stir in pork with marinade, carrots, and sugar peas and stir-fry for 6 to 8 minutes or until pork is tender.
