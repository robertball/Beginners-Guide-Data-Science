Ingredients:
2 cups homemade yogurt
1 quart frozen fruit (strawberries, raspberries, sliced peaches, blueberries) (do NOT thaw)
honey to sweeten

Directions:
Place 1/2 cup yogurt in blender.
Gradually add frozen fruit and remaining yogurt alternately.
Add honey to taste.
Blend until thick and store in freezer until ready to eat. This is thick and smooth and should be eaten soon after making. If refrozen, it will crystallize
Variation: Freeze yogurt in ice cube tray and mix cubes with pineapple juice or other juice in the blender. Use about 6 yogurt cubes and 1/2 cup juice, adding small amounts of juice to obtain thick consistency.
