Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1 cup sliced carrots
1 cup frozen corn
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup chopped onion
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 3/4 cups chicken broth
2/3 cup milk
2 (9 inch)  unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F
In a saucepan boil 2 cups of water with two bouillon cubes then add chicken, carrots, and corn, cover and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain and set aside.
In the saucepan over medium heat, cook onions in butter until soft and translucent. Stir in flour, add seasonings. Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
Place the chicken mixture in bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
