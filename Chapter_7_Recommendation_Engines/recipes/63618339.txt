Ingredients:
1-12 oz jar Herdez Traditional Chipotle Mexican Cooking Sauce
3 heaping tablespoons light brown sugar
juice of 1 lime
1-5 lb bag chicken wings

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.  Place frozen wings on large cookie sheet that has been sprayed liberally with cooking spray.
Season wings with salt and pepper and bake in oven for 35 minutes or until wings start to brown, turning once halfway through.
While wings are baking, mix 1 jar of Herdez Traditional Chipotle Mexican Cooking sauce, brown sugar, and lime juice.  Stir well to combine and set aside.
Remove wings from oven, place in large bowl and coat with about 4 tablespoons sauce.  Return wings to pan and broil 3-4 minutes until they start to look crispy.
Remove wings from oven and toss with more sauce.  Sprinkle with chopped cilantro.  Serves 4 people.
You may have some sauce left over.  This is great to dip fries in too!
