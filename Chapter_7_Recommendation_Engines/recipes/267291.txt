Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/4-inch strips
1/2 cup lime juice
2 (1 ounce) packets taco seasoning mix (such as Old El PasoÂ®)
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1 cup sour cream
1 cup salsa
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package no-boil lasagna noodles, or to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken, lime juice, and taco seasoning in a large bowl. Stir to make sure chicken is evenly covered.
Cook chicken mixture over medium heat until firm, about 15 minutes.
Mix 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, sour cream, and salsa in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
Put a few spoonfuls of the sour cream mixture in the bottom of a 9x9-inch baking dish. Layer noodles and chicken on top. Cover with remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until noodles are tender and cheese is melted, about 1 hour.
