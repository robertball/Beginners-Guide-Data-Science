Ingredients:
1 cup water (70 degrees to 80 degrees)
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 tablespoons nonfat dry milk powder
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon wheat germ
2 teaspoons molasses
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
TOPPING:
3 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first nine ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer.  Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons water or flour if needed). When the cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Roll into a 14-in. circle; transfer to a lightly greased 14-in. pizza pan.  Make indentations in top of dough with fingers.  Spread with butter; sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 25 minutes.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes; cut into wedges and serve warm.

'Wedges of this chewy cinnamon bread are a big hit with our eight children,' writes Patricia Spurrill of Pritchard, British Columbia. 'The bread machine does most of the work, so I  can move on to other things.'
