Ingredients:
2 (14 ounce) packages little smoked sausages
1 1/2 cups distilled white vinegar
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon pickling salt
1 teaspoon pickling spice, or more to taste
1 teaspoon whole mustard seeds
1 teaspoon celery seeds
1 teaspoon dill seeds
1 small onion, thickly sliced
1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste
20 whole black peppercorns
2 tablespoons pickled banana pepper rings (optional)

Directions:
Place the sausages into a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes, poking sausages with a sharp fork to release fat. Drain and rinse the sausages.
Place the sausages into a 1-quart glass canning jar.
Pour white vinegar and water into a saucepan, and stir in the pickling salt, pickling spice, mustard seeds, celery seeds, dill seeds, onion slices, garlic, black peppercorns, and banana pepper rings.
Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often.
Pour the vinegar mixture over the sausages in the jar; cap the jar, and refrigerate at least 3 days before serving.

These make a great addition to an appetizer tray.  I often get a lot of requests to make them from the hubby's crew at the rig.
