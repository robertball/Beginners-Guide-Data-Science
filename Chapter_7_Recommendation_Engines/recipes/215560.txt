Ingredients:
2 large cucumbers, peeled and sliced in half lengthwise
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup white onion, minced
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 pinch white pepper, or to taste
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese

Directions:
With a spoon, scoop out the seeds from the cucumber halves. Slice the cucumbers into thick half moons, and place the slices on a plate on paper towels. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of salt over the cucumber slices, and set aside.
Place the onion, sour cream, white wine vinegar, dill, sugar, and white pepper in a bowl, and mix until well combined. Lightly stir in the blue cheese. Pat the cucumber slices dry with paper towels, and lightly mix them into the salad. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving; season to taste with salt just before serving.

Description: 
Move over, plain jane cucumber salad! This salad makes an entrance with unusual chunks of blue cheese tossed in for a creamy burst of flavor. If blue cheese is too strong for you, try a mild feta and a squirt of lemon! When testing this recipe, both light and regular sour cream held up well, while the fat free version tended to water out quickly.
