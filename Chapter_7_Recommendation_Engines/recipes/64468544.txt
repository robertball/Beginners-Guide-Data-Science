Ingredients:
MEATBALLS
1 lb of herbivore
1 pterodactyl egg
1 tbsp of any jurrasic-era plant (or onion flakes)
1/4 tsp of pepper + garlic
1/2 cup of dinosaur bread crumbs
2 tbsp of soy sauce - sourced from ancient octopus

SAUCE
28oz canned tomatoes
2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup of chopped onion
1 tsp of sugar
1/8 tsp pepper
Dinosaur feathers as desired for added fluffiness!

Directions:
Meatballs. Combine all ingredients inside a mixing bowl - preferably half of a large dinosaur egg. Shape into 24 meatballs. Set aside.
Sauce. Mix all ingredients together in saucepan. Bring to a boil. Throw meatballs into sauce as though they were asteroids hitting the earth. Sauce must splatter all over the place because you are recreating the extinction of entire ecosystems! Now cover. Simmer gently for 30 minutes rrrrAAAWWEERRRRR
