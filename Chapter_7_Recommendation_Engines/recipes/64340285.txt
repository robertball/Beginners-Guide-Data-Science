Use a large microwaveable coffee mug.  Add dry ingredients to mug, and mix well.  Add the egg, milk, oil, chocolate chips and vanilla, then mix thoroughly.  Put your mug in the microwave and cook for 1 minute at high power or until middle is slightly firm. The cake will rise over the top of the mug, but don't be alarmed!  Allow to cool a little, and tip out onto a plate if desired.

Description: 
Why is this the world's most dangerous cake?  Because we are all now 5 minutes away from warm chocolate cake!  I am so very allergic to chocolate but even I can have this because it does not contain cocoa butter.  When it is me against the world and the world is winning; this is pretty comforting.
