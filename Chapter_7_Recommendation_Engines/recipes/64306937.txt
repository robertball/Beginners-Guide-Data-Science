Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef
2 Tbsp. parsley
1 Tbsp. scallions/onion
½ tsp. salt
¼ tsp. black pepper
1 Tbsp. flour
2 tsp. olive oil
1 cup sliced onion
2 tsp. minced garlic
1 ½ tsp. tomato paste
1 cup low-sodium beef broth
2 Tbsp. dry red cooking wine
¼ tsp. dried thyme leaves

Directions:
Combine ground beef, parsley, scallions/onions, salt, and pepper; shape into 4 oval patties.  Place 2 tsp. flour in a shallow dish; dredge each patty in the flour.
Heat oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat.  Add patties and sauté until browned, about 3 minutes on each side. Remove patties from pan.
Add onions to pan, sauté 5 minutes over medium heat.  Stir in garlic and tomato paste.  Sauté until paste begins to brown, about 1 minute. Sprinkle mixture with remaining 1 tsp. flour, cook 1 minute. Stir in broth, wine, and thyme.
Return patties to the pan and bring sauce to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover pan and simmer patties in sauce for 10 minutes.
