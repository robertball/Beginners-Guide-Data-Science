Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) boneless pork loin chops
1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1 tablespoon shredded Parmesan cheese
2 garlic cloves, minced
pepper to taste
3 cups cornbread stuffing

Directions:
In a large skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, brown pork chops on both sides; set aside. In the same skillet, saute mushrooms until tender. Transfer mushrooms to a 1-1/2-qt. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray.
In a small bowl, combine flour and broth until smooth. Stir in the sour cream, Parmesan cheese, garlic and pepper; pour over mushrooms. Top with pork chops. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes. Sprinkle with stuffing. Bake 10 minutes longer or until meat juices run clear.

Description: 
Rich, creamy mushroom stuffing inside moist chops makes this dish special enough to serve company. Although the recipe serves just two, it can easily be doubled or tripled, notes LaDonna Reed, a field editor from Ponca City, Oklahoma.
