Ingredients:
4 small (3 ounce) baking (russet) potatoes
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter
1 (3 ounce) fillet smoked salmon, chopped
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3 ounces Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
1 tablespoon capers
5 sprigs fresh dill

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Brush potatoes with 2 tablespoons olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a knife, about 1 hour. Cool until they can be easily handled.
Halve potatoes lengthwise and scoop out some of the flesh, leaving a small amount on the skins. Cut hollowed out potato halves in half so you end up with quarters.
Melt butter and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small skillet and season with salt and pepper. Brush melted butter mixture onto potatoes and place back on the baking sheet.
Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly before filling.
Drizzle salmon with lemon juice. Combine salmon, Greek yogurt, chopped dill, and capers until well combined. Spoon small dollops of filling into each quartered potato and garnish with dill fronds.
