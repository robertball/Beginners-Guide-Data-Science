Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes
1/4 cup fresh bacon bits
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup milk
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 cup packaged shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pierce potatoes with a fork then microwave on high for 5 minutes. Rotate, then microwave for an additional 5-6 minutes or until inside is just soft enough to scoop out.
Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl. Place the skins on a baking sheet and transfer to the pre-heated oven while you prepare the potato mixture. To the potato flesh add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 2/3 cup cheese and 1/2 the green chiles.  Mix with an electric mixer until well blended and creamy.  Spoon the mixture into the potato skins.  Top each with remaining cheese, green chiles and bacon bits.
Bake in oven for another 30 minutes until cheese is fully melted and top starts to brown.

Description: 
Although twice baked potatoes are easy to make, they are not always quick. This recipe cuts the cooking and prep time in half by partially microwaving the potatoes before baking and using readily available pre-packaged ingredients where possible.Modified from: Ultimate Twice Baked Potatoes
