Description: 
This tasty flatbread- flavored with sun-dried tomato pesto -is about as far from a traditional recipe as you can get.  One evening I had the urge to bake something, so I improvised with the ingredients at hand.  My family and I have been hooked ever since.  As well as tasting great, this recipe is incredibly quick and easy, because it's heated on a stovetop, rather than in the oven.
