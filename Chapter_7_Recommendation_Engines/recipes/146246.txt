Ingredients:
1/4 cup peanut oil for frying
2 tablespoons butter
3 yellow plantains (very ripe), peeled and cut in 1-inch-thick slices
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)

Directions:
Heat peanut oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the butter begins to sizzle. Gently toss plantain slices with brown sugar, then place into hot oil. Fry until the plantains begin to turn golden brown, then turn over, and continue frying until they have caramelized, about 2 minutes per side.
Drain plantains on a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt before serving.
