Ingredients:
non-stick spray
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets
2 Tablespoons butter
2 eggs
6 oz evaporated milk
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon dry mustard
10 oz sharp cheddar cheese made with 2% milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray non-stick spray onto a large cookie sheet.
Spread cauliflower evenly onto the prepared cookie sheet, spray with more non-stick spray and season with salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste.
Bake for 25 minutes, stirring halfway through.
While cauliflower is roasting, in a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, evaporated milk, hot sauce, salt, pepper, and mustard.  Set aside.
In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat.  When cauliflower is roasted, carefully place in pan with melted butter and toss to coat.
Stir the egg and milk mixture into the cauliflower and add the cheese.
Gently stir over medium-low heat for 3 minutes, or until creamy.
