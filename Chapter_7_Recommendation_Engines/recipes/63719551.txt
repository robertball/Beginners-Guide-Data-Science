Ingredients:
1 1/2 quarts spaghetti sauce
1/2 cup grated carrot
1/2 teaspoon oregano
6-9 cooked lasagna noodles - I use "no-bake" noodles
1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 (16 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well drained
2 eggs
3 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Let spinach thaw.  Drain and squeeze all water from spinach.
Mix carrots, oregano, and spaghetti sauce together.
Mix Ricotta, spinach, and eggs together in separate bowl.
Spread ½ cup spaghetti sauce in bottom of 9 x 13 inch baking dish.
Layer 3 lasagna noodles, ½ remaining sauce, ½ Ricotta mixture, ½ Mozzarella, and ½ Parmesan.
Repeat layers with remaining ingredients.
Bake in 350 degrees oven for about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is my solution to my son's dependence on store bought individually portioned veggie lasagna.  Not only is this much cheaper, I can prepare it using non-GMO foods.  My kids love it!
