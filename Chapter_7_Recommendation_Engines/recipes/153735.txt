Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon minced onion
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/4 cup dried apricots, cut in half (optional)
2 teaspoons lemon zest
2 tablespoons lemon juice
4 cups water
2 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1/2 roasted, shredded rotisserie chicken

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook the onion in the oil until it has softened and turned translucent, about 4 minutes. Stir in the raisins, apricots, lemon zest, lemon juice, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 5 minutes. Add the apples, and cook about 5 minutes longer until the apples soften. Season with additional cinnamon, salt, and pepper if desired. Stir in the shredded chicken before serving.

Description: 
Not for the weak at heart, this one is a sweet chicken and fruit soup from Algeria. You must serve with a crusty baguette to soak up the sweet and tangy broth.
