Description: 
This pie is a little less sweet than the original version.  By using 8oz. of cream cheese as a substitute for one 14oz. Can of condensed milk, we were able to reduce the sugar content but still have a great tasting pie. We also cut calories by eliminating the sour cream.Modified from: Key Lime Pie VII
