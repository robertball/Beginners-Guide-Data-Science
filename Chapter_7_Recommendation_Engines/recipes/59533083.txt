Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes
1/4 cup real bacon bits
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup milk
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
8 green onions, sliced, divided

Directions:
Preheat grill to 375 degrees F.
Bake potatoes in preheated grill with closed lid for 1 hour. Potatoes can be placed directly on the grill, although I found that placing them in a slotted vegetable basket makes it easier to manipulate and keeps the potatoes from falling over after they are stuffed.
When potatoes are done allow them to cool for 10 minutes.  Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save skins.  To the potato flesh add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 2/3 cup cheese and 1/2 the green onions.  Mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy.  Spoon the mixture into the potato skins.  Top each with remaining cheese, green onions and bacon bits.
Bake for another 15 minutes.

Description: 
I made these several times before and recently tried them on the grill. This was a really easy way to make them and they turned out perfectly. Instead of frying the bacon on the grill, I substitued 1/4 cup of real bacon bits which were really quite tasty and a lot less messy.Modified from: Ultimate Twice Baked Potatoes
