Description: 
By far the best chopped chicken liver ever! This is from the recipes used at the famous Grossinger's Resort in the Catskills, NY. Please use real rendered chicken fat; it makes a big difference in the flavor. See the recipe for rendered chicken fat in the footnote of this recipe. Serve with crackers or on lettuce or on a bagel with a tomato slice.
