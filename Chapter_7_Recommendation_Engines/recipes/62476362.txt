Ingredients:
1 can Italian stewed tomatoes, drained and chopped
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tsp. garlic powder, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1.5 cups Italian Cheese Mix , grated
1 (8 ounce) package reduced fat cream cheese
1 TBL Italian seasoning, or to taste
1 tsp garlic powder, or to taste
1 tsp onion powder, or to taste
1 French garlic bread loaf, cut into 1/2 inch thick slices

Directions:
Drain and chop stewed tomatoes and transfer to a medium bowl.  Mix in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.  Shredded cheese may also be added at this time.  Cover and refrigerate a recommended minimum of 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.   Slice the bread and arrange on a butter sprayed cookie sheet in a single layer.  Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Remove and cool on a wire rack.
In a small bowl, mix together Cream Cheese, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder.  When bread has cooled, spread some cream cheese mixture on each slice and top with the tomato mixture, about 1 heaping tablespoon.
