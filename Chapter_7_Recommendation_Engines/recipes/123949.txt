Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/2 cup shortening
2 1/3 cups sugar
4 eggs
1 cup milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and shortening. Gradually add 2 cups sugar; cream until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine milk and vanilla; set aside. Sift together flour, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk mixture, beating just enough after each addition to keep batter smooth. Combine cinnamon and remaining sugar; sprinkle 1-1/2 teaspoons into a greased 10-in. tube pan. Pour 1/3 of batter into pan. Sprinkle half of remaining cinnamon/sugar; top with 1/3 of batter. Repeat with remaining cinnamon/ sugar and batter. Smooth top with spatula. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pan to a wire rack to cool thoroughly.
