Ingredients:
12 large eggs
2 tablespoons cream cheese
1/3 - 1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon Sriracha or to taste
2 teaspoons mustard
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup chopped chives

Directions:
Place eggs in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Remove from heat, cover the pot and let sit for 10 minutes.
Drain eggs and fill the pan with very cold water. Let eggs sit in cold water until they are cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.
Peel eggs and slice in half lengthwise. Remove yolks to a bowl and cover the egg white halves with a damp towel while you prepare the filling.
Mash together egg yolks, cream cheese, mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce, and mustard with a spoon or spatula until just combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Pipe filling into the egg shells.
Top each egg chopped chives. Chill for at least 20 minutes before serving.
