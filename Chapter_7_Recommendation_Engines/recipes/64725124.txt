Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
2 ounces leeks, cut into rounds
1 bunch radish tops, washed
8 large eggs
2 tbsp heavy cream
4 tbsp grated Parmigiano Reggiano
4 radishes, shredded

Directions:
In an oven-safe skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Sauté the leeks. As they soften, separate them. Add the radish tops and sauté until wilted.
Meanwhile, turn on the oven broiler.
In a bowl, whisk the eggs, heavy cream, and the grated cheese. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and allow to cook. Once the edges are firm and have begun to pull away from the sides of the skillet, place under the broiler until browned on top.
Once browned, remove from the broiler. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving. Top with shredded radishes. Serve warm or cold.
