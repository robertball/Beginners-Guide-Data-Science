Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup heart-shaped cinnamon candies, ground into a fine powder
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided

Directions:
Beat butter in a large bowl with a hand mixer until fluffy; add vanilla extract, confectioners' sugar, ground cinnamon candies, and cornstarch and mix with hand mixer until combined.
Incorporate flour 1/4 cup at a time, mixing with your hands until all flour is used and dough comes together.
Divide dough into halves; roll each into an 8-inch cylinder. Wrap each cylinder in waxed paper and freeze until firm, at least 1 hour to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove dough from freezer and let thaw just until slightly softened.
Cut dough into 1/4-inch slices and arrange onto baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until firm along the edges but not yet browned, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on racks for 5 minutes before moving to a rack to cool completely.
