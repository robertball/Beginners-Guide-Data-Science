Ingredients:
¼ cup + 1/8 cup gluten-free oat flour
1/8 cup rice flour
½ tsp matcha powder
1/8 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp baking soda
1 tsp vinegar
3 tbsp maple syrup or honey
1 tablespoon extra virgin oil
1/8 cup coconut milk
¼ cup frozen, crumbled raspberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees (I usually only do this once I've mixed most, if not all of the ingredients together.)
Add oat flour, rice flour, matcha powder and baking powder to a bowl and mix well.
Add melted coconut oil, maple syrup and non-dairy milk to another bowl and mix well.
Add baking soda to a smaller bowl then add the vinegar to the small bowl.
Once the baking soda vinegar mixture begins to bubble, add it to the wet ingredients.
Transfer the bowl of dry ingredients to the bowl of wet ingredients and mix until well combined.
Line a mini muffin tin with mini muffin cups.
Add frozen, crumbled raspberries to the muffin batter and mix until well combined.
Fill each muffin cup about 2/3 to 3/4 full.
Place muffin tin in oven and bake for 12-14 minutes.
Take out of oven, transfer to plate or cooling rack and enjoy!
