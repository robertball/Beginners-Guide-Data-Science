Ingredients:
- 2 to 2.5 cups kimchi, cut small
- 3 bowls day old rice
- 3 to 4 TB Korean hot pepper sauce
- 2 TB juice from the kimchi jar
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp soy sauce (optional if you like it salty)
- 4 fried eggs, sunnyside up (optional)
- shredded unseasoned gim/edible seaweed (optional)
- toasted sesame seeds to garnish (optional)

Directions:
Over medium high heat, saute the kimchi in a wok for 3-4 minutes, or until softened.
Add the hot pepper sauce, kimchi juice, sesame oil and soy sauce, allow to cook for about 3-4 minutes.
In a separate skillet, fry an egg and set aside, allowing a few minutes for the flavors to mix in your wok.
Add the rice, lower the temp to low. Mix thoroughly until there are no white spots with a rice paddle or wooden spoon.
Add a splash of sesame oil and soy sauce, taste for spiciness and adjust to your preferences.
Once your spices are perfect for you, distribute in personal serving bowls, top it off with a fried egg, shredded gim and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Enjoy!!
