Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups peeled and diced potatoes
1/3 cup dices celery
1/3 cup finely chopped onion
3/4 cup diced cooked ham
3 1/4 cups water
2 tbsp. chicken bouillon granules
1/2 tsp salt or to taste
1 tsp pepper
5 tbsp. butter
5 tbsp. flour
2 cups milk

Directions:
Combine the potatoes, celery, onion, ham and water in a stockpot. Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the chicken bouillon, salt and pepper.
In a separate sauce pan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with a fork and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all of the milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat until thick. 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir the milk mixture into the stockpot and cook soup until heated through. Serve immediately.
