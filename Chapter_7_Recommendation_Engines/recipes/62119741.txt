Ingredients:
1 cup (4 oz) dried cranberries
2 eggs
¾ cup (6 oz) sugar, plus extra for topping
½ cup (4 fl oz) vegetable oil
2 TBS finely grated orange zest
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 ¼ tsp baking powder
1 tsp vanilla extract
½ tsp almond extract
¼ tsp salt
2 cups (10 oz) flour, or as needed
1 cup slivered blanched almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a large bowl, mix the eggs, sugar, oil, orange zest, cinnamon, baking powder, vanilla extract, almond extract and salt.  Whisk to blend.  Add the flour, almonds, cranberries and stir until a dough forms.  Turn out onto a heavily floured surface and knead until smooth adding more flour if too sticky to work, about 20 turns.  Divide the dough in half.  Continuing to work on floured surface, form each half into a log 2 inches in diameter. Carefully transfer the logs to an ungreased baking sheet, spacing them well apart.  Sprinkle the tops with sugar.  Bake until golden brown and firm to the touch, about 30 minutes.  Let cool for 10 minutes.  Leave the oven set at 350 degrees.  Using a spatula, carefully transfer the logs to a work surface.  Using a serrated knife, cut on the diagonal into slices ½ inch thick. Return the slices cut side down to the baking sheet.  Bake until brown, about 20 minutes.
Transfer the cookie to wire racks to cool. Store in an airtight container for 2 weeks.
