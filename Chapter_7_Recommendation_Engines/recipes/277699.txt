Ingredients:
1 large spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 cup chopped onion
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound bulk pork sausage
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste
2 teaspoons salt, divided
1 (28 ounce) can Italian crushed tomatoes
4 tablespoons Marsala wine
28 ounces ricotta cheese
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
3 sprigs fresh basil, leaves stripped from stems
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (16 ounce) package sliced fresh mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place each squash half cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled. Scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands with a fork. Transfer to a colander and place over a bowl to drain.
While squash is baking, heat olive oil in skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sausage, breaking it up with a sturdy spoon to remove clumps. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir Worcestershire sauce, Italian seasoning, and 1 teaspoon salt into the sausage mixture. Add crushed tomatoes, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add wine and cook for another 30 minutes.
Mix ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, basil leaves, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
Layer 1/2 of the shredded spaghetti squash, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, and 1/2 of the meat mixture in a 4-quart glass baking dish. Repeat layers once more, and top with mozzarella cheese slices.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning halfway through, until cheese is golden, about 1 hour.
Remove from the oven and immediately top with thin basil slices. Allow to cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
