Ingredients:
4 pounds chicken wings
4 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
1 (5 ounce) bottle hot sauce

Directions:
Rinse wings in cold water and place on baking sheets. Generously sprinkle Cajun seasoning on both sides of chicken, then dash all with hot sauce (enough to cover wings, without leaking off baking sheets). Refrigerate for 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake chicken in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn and bake for another 10 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through (juices run clear). Serve with blue cheese or ranch salad dressing, if desired.

Description: 
My husband and I love hot wings.  We experimented one night with two different recipes and both of us and all our neighbors liked this one the best.  WARNING: These are extremely HOT! Spicy hot, that is.
