Description: 
Over the years I've finally developed this salad that is perfect for the Dragon.  Very versatile, add your own favorite touches. A meal for company lunch or to take to work. There is no salt added other than what is in the mayo. Complete meal, serve on some lettuce leaves with extras of your choice...tomato, hearts of palm, cucumbers, olives, carrot sticks, cottage cheese, artichoke hearts, etc.
