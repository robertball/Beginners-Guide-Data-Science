Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (12 ounce) can low-sodium canned luncheon meat (such as SPAM®)
½ (1 ounce) envelope taco seasoning mix
2 tablespoons water, or as needed
1 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 (8 ounce) package shredded lettuce
8 ounces block Cheddar cheese, grated
1 small tomato, diced
1 small onion, diced
2 (2.5 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained

Directions:
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat; add luncheon meat. Cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add taco seasoning mix; stir to coat. Pour in water; cook and stir until water is evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn heat to low to keep luncheon meat warm.
Spray a separate skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat; add 1 tortilla and cook until heated through, about 1 minute per side. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
Layer luncheon meat, lettuce, Cheddar cheese, tomato, onion, and black olives onto each tortilla.
