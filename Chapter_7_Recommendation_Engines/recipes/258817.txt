Ingredients:
2 cups penne pasta
1 (6 ounce) jar marinated artichokes, coarsely chopped, marinade reserved
3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
3 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
¾ cup reduced-fat low-sodium chicken broth
½ cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon cornstarch
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
Pour artichoke marinade into a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chicken; cook and stir until white, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in artichokes.
Mix chicken broth, white wine, and cornstarch together in a bowl until cornstarch is dissolved. Pour into the skillet slowly, stirring constantly until sauce comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.
Toss chicken mixture with penne in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
