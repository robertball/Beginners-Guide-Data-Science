Ingredients:
2 oranges
3 cups fresh cranberries
1 1/2 cups finely chopped celery
1 8-ounce can crushed pineapple in juice
1/2 cup chopped pecans
3 3-ounce packages orange-flavored gelatin
3 cups water
2 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 cup sugar
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Zest oranges, and reserve oranges.  Put zest and cranberries into a food processor and process until cranberries are finely chopped, then place chopped berries and zest into a large bowl.
Remove white membranes from oranges, break each section into 2 or 3 parts, and add to bowl.
Add celery, pineapple and juice, and pecans, stirring to combine.
In a saucepan, bring water to the boil.  When the water is boiling, add the gelatin, remove from heat, and stir until gelatin is dissolved.  Add lemon juice, sugar and salt, stirring until sugar is dissolved.
Add gelatin mixture to the bowl containing the "solids", and stir to combine.
Pour entire mixture into molds, and chill until set.  The salad flavor is enhanced with a 24 hour chill time.

Description: 
I have made this salad at holiday time for over 30 years.  If I make cornbread dressing, this will also be on the table, because it has the perfect zing to complement the savory dressing!
