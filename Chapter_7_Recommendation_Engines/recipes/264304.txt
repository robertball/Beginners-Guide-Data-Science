Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 Roma tomatoes, diced
4 green onions, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3 dashes hot sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
4 (6 ounce) cans solid white tuna packed in water, drained
1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
12 corn tortillas

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add tomatoes, green onions, garlic, cumin, and oregano; saute until tomatoes are very soft, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add drained tuna; gently break into bite-sized pieces and mix in. Season with red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cover and cook until tuna is warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes more.
Stack 6 tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Heat in the microwave until pliable, 15 to 20 seconds. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Spoon tuna mixture over warm tortillas.

Description: 
Tuna tacos sounds funny, but these are delicious. I threw these together for dinner one night and now they're our favorite! If desired, serve with sour cream, fresh cilantro, and more hot sauce.
