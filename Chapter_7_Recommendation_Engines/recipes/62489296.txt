1 t. vanilla extract
1/2 t. almond extract

* Coarse sugar (Usually available in Baking supply stores that carry specialty baking products, or at King Arthur Flour.

Directions:
Preheat over to 350*
Beat together Butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Slowly add all remaining ingredients and mix only until combined. Do NOT beat or muffins will become tough. Batter should be lumpy.
