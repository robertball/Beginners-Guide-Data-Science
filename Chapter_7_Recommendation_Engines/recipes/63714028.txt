Directions:
Roast the jalapenos, either over stovetop flame or in the oven, chop, then mix with the ground beef and chorizo. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Grill or cook stovetop until meat is done, around 135 degrees.
While meat is cooking, sautee onion until caramelized (brown and translucent), about 5 minutes; top the patties with the onions, then melt pepperjack cheese on top of this to keep the onions from falling off.
Mix together the ranch, sour cream, chili powder, and lime juice. Spread the ranch mixture onto one side of the hamburger bun. Build the burger and top with lettuce, avocado, and tomato.
