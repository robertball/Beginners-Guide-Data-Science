Directions:
Instructions: Crust
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
1. Preheat over to 325 deg F.  Boil a pot of water (in a tea kettle is preferable).
2. Wrap outside of 9-inch springform pan in aluminum foil.
3. Combine the melted butter and cookie crumbs in a bowl
4. Press into a 9-inch springform. Thinly at the bottom, and up the sides slightly.
Instructions: Filling
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
1. Cream the cheese and sugar together, approx 3 min in an electric mixer.
2. While mixing, add one egg at a time, allow about 20 seconds between each egg.
3. While mixing add vanilla and heavy cream.  When blended, stop mixing.
4. Fold in chocolate chunks
5. Pour filling in to the spring form pan.  Leave at least 1/4" space from top of pan.
6. Move pan into a larger tray for waterbath, and put in pre-heated oven. Fill tray at least one inch with water from tea kettle.  Bake 45-55 min at 325... do not open the oven during baking!  Around 45 min start keeping an eye on the cake.  It should be set around the edges and slightly gelatinous in the middle.  This means it is done.
7. When done, turn off the oven and open the over door about two inches. Leave it this way for another hour.  Afterwards, wrap the pan (leave the alumninum foil on) in saran wrap and refrigerate over night.
Instructions: Decoration (optional)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Some fun things to do while the cake is baking.  You can decorate the sides and/or top of the cake.
Top (icing):
1. Cut a diamond template in cardboard or paper. This may take some time, and is a good activity while the cake bakes.
2. When the cake has cooled (overnight), combine until smooth the heavy cream, sour cream, and confectioner's sugar.
3. Remove the cake from the spring form pan.  If the cake is not perfectly level, level it with a sharp, warm knife.
4. Pour icing over the top of cake and spread smooth with an icing knife or spatula.
5. Hold diamond template over wet icing, and sprinkle cocoa powder.
6. Refrigerate again after decoration.
Sides (chocolate diamonds):
1. Melt the chocolate and heavy cream together in a double boiler.
2. Temper and spread to less than 1/8" sheet on cool marble.  As it sets carve diamonds in the sheet.
3. After setting, cut out diamonds and trasnfer to the freezer until the cake has chilled.
4. Once the cake has been removed from the springform pan, press the frozen chocolate diamonds into the side.
