Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
14 milk chocolate candy kisses, unwrapped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream together shortening and peanut butter; gradually add sugar and brown sugar, creaming well. Beat in the egg and vanilla.
Sift together dry ingredients and add to creamy mixture.
Shape dough into balls, using a rounded teaspoon for each ball.  Roll balls in sugar and place on a greased cookie sheet.
Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  Remove from oven.  Top each cookie with a candy kiss, pressing down firmly so cookie cracks around edges.
Put back into oven for 2 to 5 minutes longer, until golden brown.
