Ingredients:
1 head of cauliflower, riced
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 small yellow onion, diced
1 tsp cumin seeds
1/2 tsp coriander seeds
1/2 tsp crushed cayenne flakes
1/2 tsp paprika
2 dried rose buds
1/8 cup chopped coriander leaves
2 tsp EVOO

Directions:
Heat a large skillet. Add the cumin and coriander seeds. Toast the seeds over medium heat, stirring occasionally to toast the whole seed and to keep them from burning.
Once toasted, put the seeds in a mortar. Crush with a pestle. Add the dried rose buds and crush until pulverized. Add the cayenne and paprika. Mix together with a spoon to combine the spices. Set aside.
Add 1 tbsp olive oil, to the skillet and place it over medium heat. Add the diced onion, stirring until it is translucent. Add the riced cauliflower, stirring until the couscous is warmed. Sprinkle the spice mixture evenly over the coucous and stir until the seasonings are distributed evenly. Turn off the heat, cover the skillet to allow the couscous to take on flavor and use the vapor to cook the couscous thoroughly.
After 5 minutes, add the  chopped coriander leaves. Using a fork, fluff the couscous while mixing the coriander evenly throughout. Drizzle oil on top then serve.
