Ingredients:
1 can light coconut milk
3 garlic cloves, minced

2.	Add the chicken, reduce heat and simmer, covered, just until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.  (While chicken cooks combine basil, cilantro brown sugar and salt.)
3.	Add the combined mixture of basil through salt, peas, and sesame oil to pan.  Cook on medium heat for 2-3 minutes covered until peas are warm, stirring occasionally to combine flavors.
