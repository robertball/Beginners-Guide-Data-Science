1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced

1 (15 ounce) can ranch-style beans
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained

This is just the basic recipe, and then with additions of seasonings you can have almost any style (Italian, Mexican, etc) meal you want! Our favorite is Cowboy style, with just a little Worcestershire sauce.

This is very quick and easy dish.  My brother was starving one night, so I just started throwing things in a skillet!  He gave it the name and it sure is good.
