2 cups spelt flour
2 cups einkorn flour
1/2 cup oat flour
1/4 cup flax seeds
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons fast-rising yeast
1/3 cup milk, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Place water, spelt flour, einkorn flour, oat flour, flax seeds, sugar, butter, salt, and yeast in a bread machine in the order listed by the manufacturer. Run Wheat cycle.
Check dough's moisture level while the machine is mixing; add enough milk to reach a smooth, damp consistency. Remove dough from the machine after the cycle is done, about 1 hour 45 minutes.
