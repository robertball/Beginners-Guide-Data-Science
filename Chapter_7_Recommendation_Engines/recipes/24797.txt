Ingredients:
3  eggplants, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/2 inch thick slices
3 tablespoons olive oil
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - diced
1  onion, diced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
Â½ cup water
2 teaspoons dried oregano
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place eggplant strips in a big pot of lightly salted water and soak for 30 minutes (this will improve the taste; they will leave a brown color in the pot).
Remove eggplant from pot and brush lightly with olive oil. Saute or grill until lightly browned and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Set aside.
Saute diced chicken and onion in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in tomato paste and water, cover skillet, reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pour chicken/tomato mixture over eggplant. Season with oregano, salt and pepper and cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
