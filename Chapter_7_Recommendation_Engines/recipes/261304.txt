Ingredients:
Peanut Butter Dough:
1/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 egg yolk
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
Ginger-Molasses Dough:
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 egg
1/4 cup blackstrap molasses
2 1/2 cups flour
2 tablespoons chopped crystallized ginger
1/4 cup turbinado sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
Peanut Butter Dough: Put butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a bowl. Cream together with a mixer until butter clings to sides of bowl and is uniform in color, about 3 minutes. Mix in peanut butter, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until incorporated. Scrape down sides of bowl, then mix in egg yolk until incorporated. Add flour; mix on low speed until a dough forms. Cover with plastic wrap.
Ginger-Molasses Dough: Put white sugar, butter, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a bowl. Cream together with a mixer until butter clings to sides of bowl and is uniform in color. Scrape down sides of bowl; mix in egg until incorporated. Mix in molasses until incorporated; mix in flour until incorporated. Mix in crystallized ginger until incorporated. Scraping bowl between additions.
Roll a walnut-size ball (1 1/2 tablespoons) of ginger-molasses dough in turbinado sugar. Set on prepared baking sheet; flatten slightly with your palm. Brush top with water. Roll a marble-size ball (2 teaspoons) of peanut butter dough, set atop disk, then use a fork to flatten dough and make a crisscross pattern. Repeat with remaining dough. Bake until edges of top cookies start to turn golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on sheet 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Stacking two cookie doughs makes for an impressive-looking cookie. It also means you don't have to pick between your two faves! You just need two cookies that bake in about the same time. I used a half batch of two Allrecipes recipes-Big Soft Ginger Cookies and Chef John's Peanut Butter Cookies--with minor changes (less water and more flour to bulk up the base recipe, for example) and a little water to adhere them.
