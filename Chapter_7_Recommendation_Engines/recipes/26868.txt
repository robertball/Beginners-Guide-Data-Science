Ingredients:
3 (1 pound) loaves frozen bread dough
2 pounds pork sausage
12 eggs
1 pound pepperoni sausage, diced
2 pounds provolone cheese, shredded
5 eggs, well beaten

Directions:
Thaw the frozen bread dough.
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside.
In a large skillet over medium heat, rapidly cook and stir the eggs until solid. Remove from heat and set aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.
One loaf at a time on a lightly floured surface, roll the bread dough into a sheet approximately 1/4 inch or less thick. Spread 1/3 of the sausage, 1/3 of the eggs, 1/3 of the pepperoni and 1/3 of the Provolone cheese evenly over each dough sheet. Roll into a loaf.
One at a time, place rolled loaves into the prepared baking dish, brush with 1/3 of the beaten egg mixture and bake in the preheated oven 30 to 45 minutes, until golden brown. If desired, form loaves into a U shape before baking.
