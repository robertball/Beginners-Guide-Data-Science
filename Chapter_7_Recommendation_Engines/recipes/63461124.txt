Ingredients:
CREPES
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups milk
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons butter, melted
Vegetable cooking spray
FILLING
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups sour cream
1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1/4  teaspoon ground cinnamon

CREPES:  Combine first 3 ingredients; beat with a wire whisk until smooth.  Add eggs; beat well.  /Stir in butter.  Cover; chill at least 1 hour.
Coat bottom of a 6" crepe pan with cooking spray; place over medium heat until hot.

Stack crepes between sheets of wax paper (so they won't stick together), and place in an airtight container, if desired.  Store in refigerator up to 2 days or freeze up to 3 months.
FILLING:  Prepare crepes
Combine sour cream, brown sugar, flour and cinnamon.  Stir well.
Spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons sour cream mixture on each of the crepes.
Roll up crepes, and place, seam side down in a lightly greased 13"x9" baking dish.
Pour cherry sauce over crepes.
Bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes, or until thoroughly heated.  (Top withe whipped cream and/or almonds if desired.)
