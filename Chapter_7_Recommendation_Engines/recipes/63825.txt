Ingredients:
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon butter
2 veal chops
1 portobello mushroom, sliced
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 1/2 teaspoons fresh rosemary, chopped
1/2 cup red wine

Directions:
Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil with butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chops until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Once browned, stir in mushrooms and cook for 1 minute. Add chicken broth and rosemary; cover, and simmer 10 minutes. Stir in red wine, increase heat, and cook, uncovered, until sauce is reduced by half. Veal chops may be removed at any time to prevent over-cooking, then returned to the pan for the final minute.
Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, and serve.
