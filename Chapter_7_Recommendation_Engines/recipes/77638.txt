Ingredients:
Ingredients for Marinade:
1/3 cup CRISCO® Canola Oil
1/3 cup water
1/3 cup lime juice
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning
6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
Salsa:
1 cup purchased salsa
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup canned or frozen corn
Optional Garnish:
Sour cream
Shredded Cheddar cheese
Diced avocado

Directions:
In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together marinade ingredients. Transfer to a self-sealing plastic bag. Add chicken breasts; marinate 30 minutes in refrigerator.
While chicken is marinating, combine salsa, black beans and corn in a small saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat, until corn is tender, about 5 minutes.
Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Grill or broil chicken breasts, turning once, about 7 minutes per side or until no longer pink in center.
Place each chicken breast on a plate; top with salsa mixture and garnish with sour cream, cheese, and avocado. Serve immediately.
