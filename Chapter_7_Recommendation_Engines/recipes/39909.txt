Ingredients:
12 eggs
2 cups white sugar
2 cups vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon anise oil
1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger whiskey
4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, vegetable oil, anise oil, and whiskey until well blended. Gradually stir in flour until fully incorporated. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat a pizzelle iron, and spray once with cooking spray. Drop tablespoons of batter onto the centers of the patterns. Close the lid, and cook until steam no longer comes out, about 1 1/2 minutes. Check, and adjust cooking time if necessary. Carefully remove cookies, cool, and store in an airtight tin at room temperature.
