Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups Swanson® Unsalted Chicken Stock
2/3 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed
1 pound 98% fat-free ground chicken breast or 99% fat-free ground turkey breast
1 clove garlic, minced
1 medium onion, chopped
1 (10 ounce) package chopped frozen spinach, thawed and well drained
1 (10.5 ounce) can Campbell's® Healthy Request® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
4 medium red bell peppers, cut in half lengthwise and seeded

Directions:
Set the oven to 350 degrees F.
Heat the stock and quinoa in a 1-quart saucepan over high heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 13 minutes or until the quinoa is tender.
Cook the chicken, garlic and onion in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until the chicken is cooked through, stirring often to separate meat. Stir in the spinach, soup, quinoa and 3 tablespoons cheese.
Place the pepper halves into a 11x8x2-inch baking dish. Spoon the chicken mixture into the pepper halves.
Bake for 30 minutes or until hot.  Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.
Bake for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
