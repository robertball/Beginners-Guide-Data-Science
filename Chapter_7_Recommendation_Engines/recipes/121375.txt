Ingredients:
1/3 cup apple juice
1/3 cup maple syrup
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
2 garlic cloves, minced
4 (8 ounce) salmon fillets

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Remove 1/2 cup for basting; cover and refrigerate. Pour remaining marinade into a large resealable plastic bag. Add salmon; seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 1-3 hours.
Drain and discard marinade. Broil salmon 4-in. from the heat for 5 minutes. Baste with reserved marinade. Broil 10 minutes longer or until fish flakes easily with fork, basting frequently.

Description: 
Maple syrup and apple juice provide the mildly sweet marinade for these salmon fillets. Whether they are broiled or grilled, the fillets glaze nicely when basted. Everyone I've served this to seems to love it.                                                         --Kathy Schrecengost                                                                 Oswego, New York
