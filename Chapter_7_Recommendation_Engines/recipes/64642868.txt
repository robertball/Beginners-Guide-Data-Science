Directions:
Start by cutting the carrots, the potatoes, the onions and the beef into cubes. Make sure you cut the meat in small cubes approximately into 1 inch. In a deep casserole add two tablespoons of olive oil and add the diced veggies except the celery.  Stir all the vegetables for about 4 minutes, add a bit salt and pepper and lastly add the chopped celery. Stir for another 1-2 minutes and remove them from fire. Let them rest int the casserole.In a shallow pan add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and add the meat. Stir frequently until your meat is well browned. Add the chopped garlic, salt and pepper and stir for a minute. Then remove the beef and add it to the casserole with the veggies. Stir well all the ingredients.Add the diced tomatoes, the tomato paste , the bay leaves and the beef stock. Bring the casserole into fire and cook the soup for around 45 minutes in low to medium fire. Do not forget to add the sugar, a bit of salt and pepper.I like my soup to be thick so if you prefer yours to be less thicker add towards the end a bit more beef stock!Serve the soup while is hot!Enjoy!
