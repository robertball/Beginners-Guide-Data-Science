Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Sift together flour and salt in a bowl.  Stir in olive oil and water, and then knead until firm and elastic.  Divide into four balls, and roll as flat as possible with a rolling pin.
Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat.  Cook the chapati on both sides until golden brown, about 1 minute per side.  If desired, sprinkle with additional olive oil before serving.
