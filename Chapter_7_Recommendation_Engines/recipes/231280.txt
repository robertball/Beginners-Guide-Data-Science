Ingredients:
1/2 pound maple-cured bacon, chopped
1/2 cup diced ham
1 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables
4 cups diced potato
3 cups water
1 onion, diced
1 (15 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 (14 ounce) can whole kernel corn
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup milk
1/4 cup half-and-half

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bacon and ham until bacon is crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon and ham on a paper towel-lined plate.
Bring mixed vegetables, potato, water, and onion to a boil in a large pot; reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes begin to soften, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in cream-style corn, whole kernel corn, cream of mushroom soup, milk, half-and-half, bacon, and ham. Continue to simmer until potatoes are completely tender, about 5 minutes more.
