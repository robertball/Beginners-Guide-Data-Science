Ingredients:
1 pound 15% ground hamburger
¾ pound seasoned breakfast sausage (Farmer John on the West Coast is preferred)
1 large egg
¼ cup fine breadcrumbs
¾ cup minced onions

Directions:
Mix all ingredients with your hands.
Pre-heat a large frying pan on a medium high flame. Form meat mixture into large golf sized balls, flatten slightly and place in pan with a little space in between patties. Cook until browned on one side, flip and brown again on the other side. Turn down heat to low and cover. Cook for approximately 5-7 minutes, until cooked through.
Crumble one patty and use, with drippings to make pan gravy to serve over the Frikadeller and cooked red potatoes or egg noodles.

Description: 
Lightly seasoned meat patties that are a Danish home cooked supper staple. This recipe is from my Grandma Sorenson who raised her daughters during the Great Depression in a converted chicken coop in Los Angeles. Served with pan gravy, Good Danes would have an onion and cheese bread with butter to serve with this, as well as red cabbage and a good beer.
