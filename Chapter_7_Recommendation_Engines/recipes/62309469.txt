Ingredients:
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup hot mashed potatoes
1-1/2 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
2 packages (1/4 ounce each) active dry yeast
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
2 teaspoons salt
7-8 cups all-purpose flour
FILLING:
1-1/3 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1 stick butter, softened
1 cup chopped walnuts, optional
Vanilla icing, optional

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine sugar and mashed potatoes. Add water and yeast; mix well. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, combine filling ingredients and set aside. Stir dough down; beat in the butter, eggs and salt. Pour into mixing bowl with dough hook attachment. Gradually stir in flour. Start with 7 cups and slowly add 1/4 cup at a time until flour is no longer sticky. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Let dough rest for 10 minutes.
Divide dough in half. On a floured surface, roll each portion into a 12 x 15" rec square. Spread filling to within 1 in. of the edges of each square. Roll up jelly-roll style. Cut each roll into 12 slices. Place in a greased 9 x 13" baking pan. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Bake at 350° for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown. Drizzle with icing if desired.
