Ingredients:
2 lbs ground turkey
1 (28 g)envelope of Ranch Seasoning Mix
1 1/2 cups shredded cheese
6 strips of bacon, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl.
Mix well and form into 6-8 patties, depending on how big you like your burgers.
Place on a cookie sheet lined with plastic wrap or foil and place in the freezer for about 30 minutes (this will help the burgers hold together on the grill).
Preheat a barbeque to med-high.
Grill burgers for approximately 7 minutes per side (depending on size of your burgers), until no longer pink inside.
Serve with your favourite burger toppings.

These moist, flavourful burgers are a real favourite.  The ranch seasoning adds just the right flavour, and you can't go wrong with bacon!
