Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 small onion, diced
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 slices bacon, diced
2 medium russet potatoes, peeled and diced, or more to taste
1 (8 ounce) bottle clam juice
2 1/2 cups minced clams, drained
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups almond milk
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add 1/4 cup oil, onion, celery, and bacon. Cook and stir until bacon fat renders and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes and clam juice. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are fork-tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add clams and cook for 10 minutes more.
Meanwhile, combine 1/4 cup oil and flour in a separate saucepan over medium heat. Stir until paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Gradually whisk in almond milk; cook and stir until mixture becomes a thick slurry, 6 to 7 minutes more.
Stir slurry into the chowder to thicken it. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.
