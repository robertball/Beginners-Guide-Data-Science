Description: 
This is a very different recipe I first tried at my aunt's house. I thought it would be gross but it turned out to be GREAT! Even the extremely picky kids ate it! The bowl was spotless in no time. Plus this recipe is super easy. If you prefer, you can replace the cole slaw mix with your favorite green salad mix.
