Ingredients:
1 head broccoli, stalk and florets chopped separately
2 cups water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
Â½ cup uncooked white rice
salt to taste
1 squeeze lemon juice

Directions:
Combine broccoli stalk and 1 cup water in a blender; blend until pureed. Add remaining cup of water for a total of 2 cups of green water to cook the rice in.
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat and cook garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add rice and cook and stir for 3 minutes. Add chopped broccoli florets, green water, and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Fluff cooked rice with a fork and squeeze lemon juice on top before serving.

Description: 
In order to infuse the rice with the taste of broccoli, I puree the broccoli stalk with water and cook the rice in the green broccoli water. Some freshly squeezed lemon at the end adds freshness to this broccoli and rice recipe.
