Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 pound ground beef
2 small yellow onions, finely chopped
1 jalapeno chile, seeded, de-ribbed, and minced
1 (1 ounce) packet Hidden Valley® Original Ranch® Salad Dressing & Seasoning Mix
1/4 cup chili con carne seasoning
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes in juice
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained
Ranch Sour Cream:
2 cups sour cream
1 (1 ounce) packet Hidden Valley® Original Ranch® Salad Dressing & Seasoning Mix

Directions:
In a large Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot with a lid, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef and saute, stirring frequently, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the onions and jalapenos and saute until soft but not brown, about 3 minutes longer. Stir in the seasoning mix and chili seasoning. Add the diced tomatoes, including the juice from the can, and the chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and reduce the heat to a simmer. Partially cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the beans and simmer, uncovered, until thickened, about 10 minutes longer.
Meanwhile, to make the Hidden Valley(R) Original Ranch(R) sour cream, combine the sour cream with the seasoning mix and stir until smooth and completely combined. Set aside for up to 1 hour or refrigerate until ready to serve.
To serve, ladle the chili into warm bowls. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream.
