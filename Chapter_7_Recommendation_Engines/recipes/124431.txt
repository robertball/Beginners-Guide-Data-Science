Description: 
I first made this original recipe about 40 years ago, and it hasn't failed me yet. The thing I like about the dish is that it isn't plain. The flavorings dress up an 'ordinary' vegetable, and put some real zip in any meal! This is an easy, quick dish to make, and it adds a splash of color to your table.
