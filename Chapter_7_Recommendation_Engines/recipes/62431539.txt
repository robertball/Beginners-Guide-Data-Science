Ingredients:
5 lbs Boneless skinless chicken tenders
Breading
7 Eggs
4 cups Flour
2 tsp Salt
1 cup Olive/Canola oil
Sauce
2 cans Pineapple chunks
1 cup Ketchup
1 Tbsp Soy sauce
3/4 cup Brown sugar
1 1/2 cup Apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Prepare large skillet with oil on stove.
Set out 2 2qt mixing bowls.  Crack the eggs in one and mix the salt and flour in the other.  Dip chicken into eggs and roll in flour mixture.  Set in skillet and turn to medium/high heat.
Fry until golden and flip once.  Pick chicken pieces out carefully to insure no breading comes off.  Drain as much oil off the chicken as possible.
Set in a 13x9 baking dish.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Pour all sauce ingredients into a large mixing bowl.  Pour only the pineapple juice from cans and keep pineapple for later.  Mix well to ensure the brown sugar is mixed properly.
Pour over fried chicken that is now all in the 13x9 pan.  Pour the 2 cans of pineapple chunks evenly over the chicken and sauce.
Cover with foil and cook for 50 minutes.
Let cool for 5 minutes and serve on plates of white rice.
