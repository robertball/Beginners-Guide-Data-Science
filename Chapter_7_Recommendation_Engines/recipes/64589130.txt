Description: 
Don't you love one pot recipes?  I love making them.  As much as I love to cook not having a big mess makes me very happy!  The kitchen smelled so good curry blends and the haddock took on the flavors perfect!  Thanks again City Fish! 

This is also a 30 minute meal and a paleo dish!  Keep it healthy...
