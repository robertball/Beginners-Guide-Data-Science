Description: 
This is the coleslaw recipe that I make for our dinner a couple of times per month. I made it up myself.  It's pretty sweet, but we like at way.  If made with fat free mayonnaise, it only has about 70 calories per serving, and the servings are pretty big!  I'd like to try adding dried cherries to it sometime.
