Ingredients:
2 pounds bulk Italian sausage
1 pound pepperoni, sliced
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1 (8 ounce) jar salsa
1 (18 ounce) package tortilla chips
4 cups crumbled feta cheese
1 onion, chopped
1 cup sliced jalapeno peppers
2 cups black olives, drained and sliced
1 1/2 cups sour cream

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and add the Italian sausage, sliced pepperoni and crushed red pepper flakes.  Cook and stir until the sausage is well browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes.  Drain fat from skillet. Stir in the spaghetti sauce and salsa.  Cook until meat and sauce are hot, about 5 minutes.
Spread the tortilla chips on a very large platter.  Spoon the hot meat sauce evenly over the chips and top with the feta cheese, chopped onions, jalapenos, black olives, and sour cream.

Description: 
Very easy to make and very tasty! I tried these at an Italian festival; they were very good, but they needed a little something more to them. So I added more ingredients, which makes them even better! You can substitute mozzarella or provolone cheese for the feta, or use a combination of the three.
