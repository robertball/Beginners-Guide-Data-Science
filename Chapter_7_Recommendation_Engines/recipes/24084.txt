Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 large onion, diced
1 pound lean ground beef
1 (14.5 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes
ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
6 ounces grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 egg yolk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Heat olive oil in a skillet and cook garlic, onions and beef until meat is browned; drain fat.  Add tomatoes, pepper and oregano. Stir and cook about 5 minutes.  Sprinkle in 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese.
Lightly coat a casserole or baking dish with olive oil and spread 1/2 the cooked pasta in it.  Add the meat sauce and cover with the remaining pasta.
Melt butter in a saucepan and blend in flour.  Slowly add milk, stirring almost to boiling. In a bowl, blend remaining parmesan cheese and egg yolk and slowly add to the milk sauce, stirring constantly.
Pour sauce over macaroni and bake for 30 minutes.  Top should be golden and a little crispy.
