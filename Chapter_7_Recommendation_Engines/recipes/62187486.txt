Carrot Onion Cheese Souffle Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups baby carrots
2 large onions
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
Garlic powder to taste
3 eggs
4 egg yolks
1/2 cup of sugar
1 1/2 cups of flour
1 cup shredded mozzerella
Ramekins:
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Shred the carrots and onions into a very fine mix, almost like a mush. Add 1/2 cup melted butter and mix thoroughly. Add 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and mix thoroughly. Add garlic as you like it for taste -- from 2 teaspoons to four. Mix well. Set aside.
In your mixer, blend the eggs and the yolks with 1/2 cup of sugar. Gradually add flour, you may not need the full 1 1/2 cups. The "dough" should be smooth, but not runny -- and definately not as thick as cookie dough.
Gradually add the carrot/onion mix until thoroughly blended. Use a low speed on your mixer to do this.
Finally fold in the shredded cheese.
Ramekins: Butter the bottom and sides of your dish.
Pour the souffle batter into your ramekins. Fill almost to the top. Put in the fridge to chill for at least one hour. (I put them in for three hours and the souffles still came out ok).
When ready to serve, put into the oven at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes (you'll know to take them out when the souffle rises above the dish's edge).

Description: 
This is a variation of my other recipe, Easy Chocolate Souffle, that I experimented with today. The recipe is very easy and the flavour is surprisingly complex -- the baby carrots add a sweetness and the garlic and cheese add a savoury kick.
