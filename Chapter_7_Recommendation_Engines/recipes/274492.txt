Ingredients:
2 small ripe yellow peaches, peeled and cubed
1 cup sliced peeled English cucumber
1/4 cup chopped yellow onion
1 clove garlic
1/2 cup chopped orange bell pepper
2 pints Sungold cherry tomatoes
1 cup red cherry tomatoes
2 teaspoons kosher salt, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 lime, juiced, or to taste
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup cold water, or to taste
For the Garnish:
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese, or to taste
1/2 cup diced peach, or to taste
6 leaves fresh basil, thinly sliced, or more to taste

Directions:
Combine peaches, cucumber, onion, garlic, bell pepper, and tomatoes in a blender. Season with salt, cumin, and cayenne. Pour in vinegar, lime juice, olive oil, and water. Blend until smooth, starting with a few pulses and finishing on high speed.
Strain soup through a fine-mesh strainer into a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 3 to 4 hours.
Stir soup and season to taste. Pour into serving cups and garnish with feta, diced peach, basil, and a sprinkle of cayenne.

Description: 
Many gazpacho recipes that include fruit turn out tasting more like dessert, which is fine if that's what you're into, but if you want a super-refreshing, seriously savory gazpacho, then this peach-kissed version is for you. You can't go wrong with this very simple recipe; served ice-cold, it might just be your new favorite thing to eat on a hot, sunny afternoon.
