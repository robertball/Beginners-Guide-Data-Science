Ingredients:
1 pound medium ground beef
1 pound lean ground pork
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup breadcrumbs
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup milk
1 onion, minced
1 tablespoon dried Italian spice blend (oregano, basil, thyme, marjoram)
3 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a small sauté pan over medium heat sauté onion in 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Once translucent, add garlic and dried Italian seasoning and continue to sauté for 2-3 minutes until garlic is cooked, then allow mixture to cool.
Drizzle a large cookie sheet with approximately 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
In a large bowl add ground meats, eggs, breadcrumbs, cheese, milk, onion mixture, salt and pepper.
Use your hands to mix everything together as quickly as possible as over mixing can produce a tough meatball.
Once the meat mixture is combined form 1.5 inch balls and place on cookie sheet.
Transfer to oven and bake for 30 minutes, turning them over after 15 minutes.
Serve with your favorite marinara sauce.
