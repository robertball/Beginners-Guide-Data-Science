Ingredients:
3 pounds assorted baby potatoes such as red-skinned, White Rose, and baby purple, halved
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 sprigs fresh rosemary, each broken into 4 pieces plus more for garnish
3 large garlic cloves, halved
1 1/2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt
3 tablespoons salt-packed capers, rinsed well

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Arrange potatoes in single layer on large rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with oil; sprinkle with rosemary pieces, garlic, and salt; toss to coat. Roast until potatoes are tender, stirring every 15 minutes, about 45 minutes total. Mix in capers. Roast until flavors blend, about 5 minutes longer. Season with pepper. Transfer to bowl. Garnish with rosemary sprigs.
