Description: 
Slow oven roasting transforms average-tasting cherry tomatoes and garlic into pure heaven! I like to serve these on goat cheese bruschetta. They can be eaten warm, room temperature, or cold. Toss in pasta, on sandwiches, or eat alone! Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
