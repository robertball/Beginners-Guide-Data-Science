Ingredients:
1 (8.8 ounce) pouch UNCLE BEN'S® Ready Rice® Original Long Grain or Whole Grain Brown
4 ounces cream cheese, softened

1 1/2 teaspoons taco seasoning mix
1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro
12 large jalapeno peppers, halved lengthwise, seeds and membranes removed
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1 tablespoon melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Prepare rice according to package directions. Allow to cool slightly.
Mix rice, cream cheese, shredded cheese, taco seasoning, and cilantro together in a bowl. Combine thoroughly.
Fill each jalapeno half with about a teaspoon of rice mixture, depending on size of jalapeno. Arrange filled jalapeno halves on prepared baking sheet.
Mix panko bread crumbs and melted butter together in a small bowl. Top filled jalapenos with crumb mixture.
Bake poppers in preheated oven until lightly golden on top, about 15 to 20 minutes.
