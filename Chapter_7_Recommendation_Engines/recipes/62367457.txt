Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/8 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt (heaping)
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 stick (1/2 cup) butter, room temperature
1 cup sugar
2 eggs, room temperature

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare muffin pan with liners.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
Mix milk and vanilla in a separate cup.
Cream butter and then add sugar a little at a time.  Mix until light and fluffy.
Beat in the eggs one at a time until light and fluffy.
Add flour mixture and milk mixture alternately, starting with flour mixture and ending with flour mixture until fully--but not overly--mixed.
Fill muffin papers 3/4 cup full.  Bake for 18-20 minutes until top springs back lightly when touched.

Description: 
This recipe started with a newspaper article and ended up with some of my changes.  I have made these into mini-cupcakes, too, with a yield of about 35.  These are just too good not to share with a few of my friends on Allrecipes!
