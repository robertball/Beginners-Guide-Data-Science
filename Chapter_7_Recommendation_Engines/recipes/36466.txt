Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup white sugar
2 pears - peeled, cored and diced
1 (12 ounce) package fresh or frozen cranberries
1 cup honey
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, stir together the water and sugar over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. Stir in pears, and reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring frequently for 3 minutes, then stir in cranberries and honey. Continue to cook until cranberries pop and the mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice and lemon zest. Cool to room temperature, then store covered in the refrigerator for up to one week.

Description: 
Refreshingly sweet, tart and tangy - this recipe is incredibly easy and it's a great change of pace from the usual boring cranberry sauce. The flavor of the cranberries mingles wonderfully with the pear, honey and lemon. It freezes well too!
