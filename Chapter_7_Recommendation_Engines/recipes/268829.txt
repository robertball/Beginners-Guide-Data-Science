Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package rotini pasta
4 slices leftover meatloaf, or to taste
1 cup frozen corn
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 dash Italian seasoning
1 dash dried basil
1 dash dried oregano
1 dash onion powder
1 dash garlic powder
salt
1 dash ground black pepper
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup Italian bread crumbs
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
While pasta cooks, mash meatloaf in a 2 1/2-quart casserole dish. Add corn and mix.
Combine tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, basil, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and sugar in a bowl. Stir well.
Drain pasta and add to the meatloaf mixture in the casserole dish. Mix in tomato sauce mixture. Top with Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 30 to 45 minutes.
