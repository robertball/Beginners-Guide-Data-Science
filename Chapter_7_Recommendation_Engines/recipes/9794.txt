5/8 cup sesame seeds
7 ounces almond paste, crumbled
1/2 cup white sugar

Sprinkle sesame seeds onto a large baking sheet and bake  about 20 minutes or until light gold, stirring occasionally. Let cool.
Line cookie sheet with parchment paper.
With an electric mixer, beat almond paste and sugar until   only very small pieces of the paste remain.   Separate the eggs and add the egg whites and mix on high speed until mixture is smooth.  Mix in sesame seeds.
Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheet, spacing 2 inches apart.  Bake about 14 minutes or until cookies are puffed, pale golden  and the edges begin to brown.
Transfer cookies on the parchment paper to a rack and cool completely.  Carefully peel cookies from parchment paper.
