1. Chill the bowl and whisk attachment of a stand mixer for 20 mins in the fridge or 5 mins in the freezer. Pour the heavy cream into the bowl and whisk on med-high speed until it just starts to thicken.
2. Slow the speed down to medium and gradually pour in the sugar. Continue to whisk until soft peaks form.
3. Add the vanilla extract* and continue to whisk by hand until the cream is smooth, and stiff peaks form (the cream will stand up straight when the whisk is raised).
