1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat vegan butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat until melted. Add vegetable broth, potato, carrots, onion, celery, and ginger; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until potato is tender, about 30 minutes. Uncover soup and let cool, about 15 minutes.
Puree soup in batches in a food processor or high-speed blender until smooth.
Return soup to the Dutch oven; stir in coconut cream. Season with curry powder, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until soup is heated through, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is a vegan spin on a Bavarian carrot soup. It is very delicious and I have even seen it made with other vegetables, like beets, as the star of the dish. Try it out and experiment with other vegetables. I have even substituted the celery with an extra carrot and a teaspoon of celery seed and it worked out great. The recipe listed is my favorite and it is a great go-to for vegans. Enjoy!
