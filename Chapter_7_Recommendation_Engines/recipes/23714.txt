Description: 
This is a great quick pasta sauce, full of flavor.  Ladle onto short pasta with a generous spoonful of Pecorino Romano cheese. This is not intended to be a sauce that you smother the pasta in. If the fresh tomatoes aren't garden fresh and full of flavor I would consider omitting them from the recipe.
