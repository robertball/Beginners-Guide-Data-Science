Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 10 inch Bundt pan with non-stick cooking spray.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Beat in the sliced bananas, sour cream and baking soda. Beat in the flour. Pour batter into prepared pan.
