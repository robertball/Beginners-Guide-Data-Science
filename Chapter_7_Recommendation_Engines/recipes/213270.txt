Description: 
My husband doesn't like BBQ sauce, but we had a pork roast. I whipped this up in the slow cooker, and it was awesome served with broccoli and rice, and also as pulled pork sandwiches for the 2 kids and hubby for a few days without them getting tired of it! It got better and better until it was gone, so I figured it was worth sharing. You let me know what you think!
