Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon salt-free herb seasoning blend
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and herb seasoning blend.
Place a lightly greased skillet over medium-high heat.  When hot, pour the egg mixture in, and turn the skillet to coat evenly. Cook until almost done, then flip over. Spread the top with horseradish and sprinkle with Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses. Continue to cook until the bottom is no longer raw. Fold in half and transfer to a plate for serving.

Description: 
A tangy, ooey gooey omelet sure to please the pampered palette. I like to use Dubliner Irish cheese instead of Parmesan if I can get it.
