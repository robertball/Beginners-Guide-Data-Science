Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 cup sugar
Dash of salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
5 cups tart apple (8 medium Granny Smith or similar), cored, peeled, and thinly sliced
2 tbsp tapioca pearls
1/2 cup sugar
3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
Confectioner's sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, salt, and butter; make crumbs.  Measure out 3/4 cup crumbs and set aside.  Press remaining crumbs into a 9" springform pan, building up the sides of the pan.  Mix tapioca, 1/2 cup sugar, and spices, and toss with apple slices to coat.  Arrange in crumb shell.  Bake 25 minutes, then sprinkle top with reserved crumbs and bake 20 minutes more.  Dust with confectioner's sugar.

Description: 
A delicious alternative to pie: tart apple slices tossed in cinnamon and sugar and baked in a crumbly crust.  This recipe was handed down from my mom's side of the family; my brother used to request this instead of a typical frosted cake on his birthdays.
