Ingredients:
1C White Rice Flour
1/2C Brown Rice Flour

Scant 1/2C corn meal (or leave cornmeal out to vary per recipe, as needed)
1T (or to taste) Jane's Krazy Mixed-up Salt (a staple in my kitchen)
1 tsp paprika  (orig 1T?)
1 1/2 T onion powder (orig 3T)
2 tsp sea salt or to taste (generous)
1-3T fresh ground multi-colored pepper or more to taste

Directions:
Mix all ingredients and store in an airtight container or zipper-style bag.
Alternatively, mix first 4 ingredients in one container and add cornmeal as each recipe calls for.
Then make a separate container with all the seasonings and add more or less depending on each recipe.
