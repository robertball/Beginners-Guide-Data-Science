Ingredients:
1/4 cup canola oil
3 lb chicken thighs
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper

Directions:
Heat oil in large skillet.
Mix salt, pepper, paprika, oregano and thyme and lightly season chicken. Sprinkle flour over chicken and add to skillet.  Brown chicken about 6 minutes per side, add rhubarb and onions to skillet.  Cook and stir until onions are browned, about 5 minutes.
Add garlic and cook 1 minute, add wine and cover skillet allowing to simmer over medium heat about 45 minutes, stirring often and adding additional wine if mixture seems too dry.  When juices in chicken run clear (about 165 degrees) add parsley.  Serve over rice.
