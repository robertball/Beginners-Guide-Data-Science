Ingredients:
1 cup shredded zucchini
1/4 cup shredded carrots
1 tablespoon minced canned water chestnuts
1 tablespoon pine nuts
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon oil, or more as needed
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 (10 ounce) mushrooms, stems removed
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine zucchini, carrots, water chestnuts, pine nuts, and garlic in a mixing bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add vegetable mixture and cook until slightly soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and return to the mixing bowl to cool.
Add Parmesan cheese to the cooled vegetables; mix to combine. Fill each mushroom with a generous amount of vegetable mixture, sprinkle cayenne pepper on top, and place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until mushrooms are tender, about 12 minutes.
