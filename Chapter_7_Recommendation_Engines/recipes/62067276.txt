Ingredients:
1/4 lb. butter at room temp
3 tbsp brown sugar
1 tbsp molasses
1/4 cup maple syrup
4 tbsp orange peel
3 tbsp chili powder
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
pinch of ground cloves
1/2 cup orange juice
6 red-skinned yams (about 3 lbs)

Directions:
You can use all the ingredients above.  If you prefer stronger flavor of chili powder, add more.  If you prefer less spice, omit the cayenne pepper.  Molasses adds strong sweet flavor ... if you prefer less of that flavor, then reduce or omit and add more maple syrup.  Experiment with cinnamon and cloves and ginger amount.  Quantities above are starting point.  You can use dried orange peel or fresh.  If you like the orange flavor, add more orange peel.
Mix all ingredients together except the yams.
Rinse yams.  Peeling yams is optional.  Cut yams into 1/2" thick slices or quarter them.  Slices cook faster and absorb more flavor.  Place yams into a deep baking dish.  Spoon the butter mixture over top of yams and place uncovered in pre-heated oven at 375Â°.  Bake until yams are tender (about 60 to 90 minutes).  Every 15 - 20 minutes use a large spoon to baste the yams and gently stir them so those on top are moved to the bottom of the dish.  If it looks like need more liquid, add orange juice.  Avoid overcooking as the yams will break up.  Remove from oven and allow to stand for a few minutes.  Serve warm.  Enjoy.
