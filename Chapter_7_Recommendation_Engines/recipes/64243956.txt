Ingredients:
20 oz. Jennie-O lean ground (93/7) ground turkey
2 teaspoons light olive oil
1-1/2 teaspoons rubbed sage
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon dried marjoram
2 teaspoons brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 dash nutmeg

Directions:
Place the turkey in a large bowl and add the spices and oil to it. Mix well with your hands.
Place mixture onto cutting board or parchment lined counter, forming into large ball. Cover with parchment paper and roll to about 1/4" thick with rolling pin or pat thin.
Cut into 3" circles with cookie cutter or large glass (I used my large 16 oz. green Tupperware glass). Repeat until all meat is used up. This made approx. 2 oz. patties. I got 10 patties.
Slowly saut√© the patties in a large skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes per side, or until no longer pink. Safety guidelines indicate internal turkey temperature must reach 165 degrees F.
For best flavor plan ahead and mix the night before cooking.

Description: 
Mornings are now made healthier without sacrificing flavor. A perfect blend of seasonings and much less saturated fat and calories makes this turkey sausage a perfect substitute for pork sausage. This tastes best mixed the night before cooking to allow the flavors to meld.
