Description: 
THIS DISH is quick to prepare, but to save time, I'll often boil the sweet potatoes in advance, then complete the recipe the next day.    Orange juice and cinnamon are wonderful for enhancing the flavor of sweet potatoes. This classic recipe is great during the holidays. -Ruby Williams, Bogalusa, Louisiana
