Ingredients:
12tart apples, peeled and cored
1/2 c brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, or to taste
1/4  cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tsp. salt
2 Pillsbery unbaked pie shells
2 tablespoon butter
eight carmaels snipped in half with a kitchen sheers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cut the apples with the corer thingy  slices are thick,but coring and cutting save a lot of dicing time that is very unessary as they  bake soft and delicious.
In a mixing bowl, combine sugar, cinnamon, flour, nutmeg, and salt; mix thoroughly. Stir until the apples are coated; let sit to disolve and marry the flavors.
Line one crust in a 9 inch deep dish pie pan. Pour the apples in the pie crust. Dot the apple filling evenly with butter and the snipped carmels. Fit the top crust over the apples. Press the crust down gently behind bottom crust, press down and poke fork holes in the top; brush with milk and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.  Place crust ring on pie plate to save the edges from burning, or wrap with foil,  I leave it on for the whole baking time.
Bake in the preheated oven one hour,  crust will be golden brown. Check the pie after the first 30 minutes of cooking: if the crust is already browned reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) to allow the apples to cook without the crust burning.
