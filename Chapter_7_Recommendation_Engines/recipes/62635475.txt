Ingredients:
6 Chicken thighs or breasts
1/2 cup Flour
1 teaspoon Garlic salt
1 teaspoon Paprika
1/2 teaspoon Ginger
2/3 cup Brown sugar
1/2 cup Water
1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce
1/4 cup Soy sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees.
Wash chicken.
Dry thoroughly.
Coat chicken with flour seasoned with garlic salt, paprika and ginger.
Arrange chicken skin side up in a single layer in baking pan.
Roast, uncovered, for 1 hour.
Drain. Mix other ingredients in a pot over a low flame. Pour over baked chicken when sugar has suitably melted. Bake for another 2 hours at 250 degrees or until chicken is done and delicously glazed.
Basting and turning at least once will ensure an evenly coated glaze.
