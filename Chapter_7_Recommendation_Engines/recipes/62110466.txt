Ingredients:
8 cups plum juice
6 cups sugar
4 garlic cloves, pressed or finely chopped
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon roasted garlic seasoning
2 tablespoons Southwest Chipotle seasoning
1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped (if you leave seeds it will be hotter)
7 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon Liquid Smoke flavoring, optional

Directions:
Reserve 3/4 cup of juice and put in small saucepan.
Add garlic and onion to reserved juice and cook over medium high heat until onion is translucent and soft, not crunchy.
Put remaining 7 1/4 cups plum juice in large pot and boil juice juice.
Stir in sugar, vinegar, garlic seasoning, SW Chipotle seasoning, jalapeno pepper, and salt to plum juice.
Continue cooking plum juice on medium high heat.
Stir the pot frequently to keep from sticking or burning.
When the onions are done add to plum juice in large pot.
Now, you may want to increase the heat and watch closely to get your sauce to the right consistency.
Take a small amount and put in small bowl and put in freezer to cool....when it is the desired consistency, turn the heat down and continue cooking while you ladle the sauce into jars.
Be ready to add lids and seal.
TIP:  To get juice from plums I use a colander with lots of holes.
Using small handfuls of ripe plums, I squeeze and press the plum juice/pulp through the holes into a bowl using a gloved hand until I've got 8 cups of juice.

Description: 
When plums are in season, this is a great alternative to putting up jam with all those plums.  This is a great addition with pork, chicken or as a topping on cream cheese served with crackers.
