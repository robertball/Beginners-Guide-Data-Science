Ingredients:
4 C. Dry Slaw Mix, Packed
1 Carrot, Grated
1 C. Crushed Pineapple in 100% juice, or diced fresh
1 Tbsp. Fresh Ginger Root, grated
3 Tbsp. Rice Vinegar
1 Tbsp. Sesame Oil
1 Tbsp. Soy Sauce
1/2 Lime or lemon, juiced (lime is best, but lemon will do in a pinch)
3 green onions, thinly sliced (optional)
1 Tsp. Sesame Seeds, toasted (Optional)
1/4 Tsp. Red Pepper Flakes (Optional)

Directions:
Combine slaw mix, carrots and green onions in a large bowl.
In another bowl (I use a 4 cup measuring cup for this), whisk the remaining ingredients together in a small bowl and pour over the slaw mixture. Make sure itâ€™s well combined.
Cover and put in the fridge for 30 minutes before serving, to give it a chance to flavor through.
