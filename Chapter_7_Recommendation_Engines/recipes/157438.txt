Ingredients:
4 teaspoons sake
4 teaspoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
1 1/4 pounds clams in shell, scrubbed
3 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 green onion, chopped

Directions:
Scrub and rinse clams. Soak in a large bowl of cold water for 5 minutes. Drain thoroughly.
Heat a wok or large saucepan over high heat. Quickly pour in the sake, mirin and rice vinegar. Add the clams; cover and cook until the clams open, 3 to 4 minutes. Discard any clams that do not open.
Remove any scum that forms on the surface using a spoon or paper towel. Stir in the butter, soy sauce and green onion, tossing to coat the clams as the butter melts. Arrange clams on a serving plate and drizzle the sauce over them. Serve immediately.
