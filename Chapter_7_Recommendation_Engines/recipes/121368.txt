Ingredients:
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 (4 pound) beef top round roast
2 1/2 cups water
2 cups cider vinegar
2 medium onions, sliced
1/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoons mixed pickling spice
1 teaspoon whole peppercorns
8 whole cloves
2 bay leaves
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
14 gingersnaps, crushed

Directions:
Combine salt and ginger; rub over roast. Place in a deep glass bowl. In a saucepan, combine water, vinegar, onions, sugar, pickling spices, peppercorns, cloves and bay leaves; bring to a boil. Pour over roast; turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 2 days, turning twice a day.
Remove roast, reserving marinade; pat roast dry. In a large kettle or Dutch oven, brown roast on all sides in oil over medium-high heat. Strain marinade, reserving half of the onions and seasonings. Pour 1 cup of marinade and reserved onions and seasonings over roast (cover and refrigerate remaining marinade). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 3 hours or until meat is tender.
Strain cooking liquid, discarding the onions and seasonings. Measure liquid; if necessary, add enough reserved marinade to equal 3 cups. Pour into a saucepan; bring to a rolling boil. Add gingersnaps; simmer until gravy is thickened. Slice roast and serve with gravy.

Description: 
Our family loves it when Mom prepares this wonderful old-world dish. The tender beef has a bold blend of mouth-watering seasonings. It smells so good in the oven and tastes even better!                                   --Cathy Eland                                                            Highttown, New Jersey
