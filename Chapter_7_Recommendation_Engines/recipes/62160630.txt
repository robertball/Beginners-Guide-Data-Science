Ingredients:
1/2 Cup Sugar or brown sugar
1/2 Cup Mirin (sweet rice wine)
1/2 Cup Soy sauce

Directions:
Mix together and reduce over medium heat to about 3/4 cup.
1/2 cup of dashi may be added to create a richer, more authentic flavor. (Dashi is a fish stock or shiitake mushroom stock that must be made at home)

Description: 
Also called Nitsume, Unagi or Kabayaki. It is a sweet and salty sauce that goes great over grilled fish or chicken and is a common drizzle over sushi. Traditionally it is used on Japanese grilled eel and eel rolls. I also use this sauce over fresh cooked noodles for a quick snack.
