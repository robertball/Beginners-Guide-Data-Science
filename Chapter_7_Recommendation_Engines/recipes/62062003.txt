Ingredients:
12 cups sugar
2 Quarts vinegar
7 sticks of cinnamon
2 Tablespoons whole cloves
16 lbs. peaches, small or medium

Directions:
Combine the sugar, vinegar, cinnamon, and cloves in a large kettle. Bring to a boil and let simmer, covered about 30 minutes. Wash peaches and remove skins, (for easy peeling -- dip peach in boiling water and then quickly in cold water.) To prevent darkening of fruit, immediately put peeled fruit into cold water with Fresh Fruit Preserver (2 Tablespoons per gallon). Drain before using. Add peaches to the boiling syrup, enough  for 2 or 3 quarts at a time and heat for about 5 minutes. Pack hot peaches into clean hot jars. Continue heating peaches in syrup and packing into the jars. Add 1 stick of cinnamon and 2-3 cloves per jar. Cover peaches with boiling syrup to within 1/2 inch of top. Adjust lids. Process in boiling water for 20 minutes, starting to count processing time after water in canner reaches boil. Remove jars and complete seals.

From my Grandmother's juice-stained cookbook, Pickled Peaches make a great wintertime side dish for pork...and the jars have cloves floating in them.
