Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1  cup sugar
1 1/2 tsps baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
2 large eggs
1 tsp almond extract
1 tsp vanilla extract
4 tbsp butter melted
2/3 cup sliced almonds, toasted (optional)
1/2 bag white chocolate chips, melted with 1/2 tsp shortening  (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325.
Combine flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and pumpkin pie spice in a large bowl and whisk together.
In another bowl whisk together pumpkin, eggs, melted butter, extracts and pumpkin pie spice.
Slowly add flour to pumpkin mixture and stir until dry ingredients are moistened. Gently mix in almonds
Place dough on a lightly floured surface and divide into 2 portions. Lightly flour hands and shape each portion into long log the length of a full baking sheet.  Bake for 30 minutes; remove from oven and reduce oven temp to 300.
Cool log for 15 mins then transfer to a cutting board. Using a serrated knife, cut into 1/2? thick pieces, slicing at a slight angle.  The interior of each biscotto will still be just a little moist
Place the biscotti with a cut side facing up on a half sheet pan and bake for 10 minutes. Remove the pan and flip all the biscotti over so the other cut side is now facing up. Bake for another 10 minutes. Set all the pieces on a wire rack to cool.
Once the biscotti have cooled, drizzle with melted white chocolate. (To melt the chocolate, pop it in the microwave and heat for 30 seconds, then stir.  Place back in microwave and heat in 15-second intervals and stirring in between until chocolate is melted. Alternately, dip 1/4/-1/2 of each biscotti in chocolate.  Store in airtight container.
