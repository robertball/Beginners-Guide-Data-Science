Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
1 cup buttermilk
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons red food coloring
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon white vinegar
Cream Cheese Icing:
3 (6 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
3 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 30 mini muffin cups.
Sift flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder together in a bowl.
Beat oil, buttermilk, eggs, food coloring, vanilla extract, and vinegar together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Slowly add the flour mixture; beat on low speed until batter is just moistened and still airy. Pour batter into the muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert cupcakes carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 15 minutes.
Beat cream cheese and butter together in a clean stand mixer bowl. Slowly add confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract. Mix on low until smooth. Spread icing over cooled cupcakes.
