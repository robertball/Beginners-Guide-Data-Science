Ingredients:
1 Chicken breast, cooked and cut into 1/2" pieces
1 can of artichoke hearts, rinsed
4 strips of crispy, cooked bacon, roughly chopped
2 oz. of neufchatel cheese (cream cheese), cubed
1/2 c. mayonnaise
2-3 Tbs. milk (depending on how loose you like your dip)
1 clove of garlic, minced
1/2 c. shredded mozzarella cheese
2 slices of swiss cheese, cut up into pieces
ground pepper, to taste
1 1/2 c. fresh spinach, wilted and chopped
*optional: crushed red pepper if you like "spunk" in your dip

Directions:
Put as many of the ingredients in a food processor as you can and let 'er rip! You really can not mess it up. Stir them altogether and place in an oven-friendly container and bake @ 350 degrees (Farenheit) for 30 - 40 minutes. Stir after the dip is hot and serve!
