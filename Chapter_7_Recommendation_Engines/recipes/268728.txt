Ingredients:
3 cups self-rising flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 stick unsalted butter
1/2 cup chopped fresh cranberries
1 orange, zested
3/4 cup buttermilk, or more as needed
1/4 cup cranberry-pomegranate juice
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoons cranberry-pomegranate juice, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine flour and sugar in a large bowl. Cut in butter until mixture is coarse and crumbly. Add cranberries and orange zest.
Mix 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/4 cup cranberry-pomegranate juice together and pour over flour mixture. Mix until a soft dough forms. Add more buttermilk as needed to bring dough together.
Turn dough out onto a floured board. Shape into a circle and cut into 10 wedges. Arrange wedges on the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned, 12 to 20 minutes.
Mix powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons cranberry-pomegranate juice together while scones are baking. Brush glaze onto hot scones.
