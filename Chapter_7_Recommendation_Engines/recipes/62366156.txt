Ingredients:
500 grams beef, cubed
3 links of sausage (chorizo), cooked and sliced
2 tbsp oil
2 carrots, diced
2 cups of butternut squash, diced
2-3 potatoes, diced
1 onion, diced
1 leek (white part) chopped
4 cloves of garlic, minced
1 can of tomato sauce
3 cups of water
1 vegetable favored OXO cube
2 cups of small soup pasta
salt and pepper to taste
1 tbsp oregano
1 tsp cumin
1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1 cup of cooked lentils and/or frozen peas (optional)

Directions:
Cook chorizo in large pot, prick with fork to release some of the fat, remove, slice and set aside.
On high heat add some oil to pot, add beef and let brown
Add cooked chorizo back to the pot along with onions, leeks and garlic and saute a few minutes or until onions are translucent
Lower heat to medium low and add vegetables; carrots, potatoes, squash to the pot and cover with water and tomato sauce.  If the vegetables are not covered you may need to add a bit more water
Add spices, OXO cube,salt and pepper, oregano, and cumin
Once stew comes to a boil lower heat to low and let simmer (stirring occasionally) for about an hour.  The stew will thicken up.
Once the stew has thickened up, add pasta, chopped parsley and lentils and/or peas. You may need to add some more water at this point so the pasta does not make it too dry.
Once the pasta is ready, it is ready to serve.
