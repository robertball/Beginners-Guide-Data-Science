Description: 
This was one of the very first casseroles I made for my family. It was originally a green bean casserole recipe, but since I wanted this to be an (almost) all-in-one dish I added the ground chicken and eggplant. I also added more spices. My 2-year-old twins loved it and so did my hubby! It's a hearty dish that we usually eat with brown rice and/or crusty bread. It's also good served with a side of fresh and crisp green salad with tangy dressing. This casserole may be too mushy for some people. If you don't want it to turn out that way, you can substitute the ground chicken with 1 1/2 to 2 cups of cooked and cubed boneless, skinless chicken breast.
