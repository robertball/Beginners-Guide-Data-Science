Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (15 ounce) can sliced peaches, drained
4 ounces cream cheese
2 eggs
1 1/4 cups milk
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 1/2 cups bran flakes cereal

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Cut the peaches and cream cheese into 1/2-in. cubes; set aside. In a bowl, beat eggs, milk, honey, butter and lemon peel until blended. Stir in the bran flakes, peaches and cream cheese. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.
Fill greased muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
