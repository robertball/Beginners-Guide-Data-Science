Ingredients:
8 eggs
1 cup cream
2 cups frozen hash browns
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 cup cooked bacon, chopped
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1 tablespoon salt, divided
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper, divided

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Grease a 9-inch pie pan with butter or olive oil.
Crack the eggs into a medium large bowl and whisk. Add the cream and whisk until well blended. Season the eggs with half the salt and pepper. Set aside.
Combine the shredded cheese with the frozen hash browns, the bacon and the chopped green onions. Season with the second half of the salt and pepper.
Pour the egg mixture into the pie pan and then gently add the hash brown mixture, making sure that some of the potatoes remain above the egg mixture.
Place on a cookie sheet and then into the preheated oven for 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out cleanly.
Optional: Add more cheese on top 5 minutes before removing the quiche from the oven.
Important note: Let it stand for 10 minutes before slicing into wedges and serving to ensure the quiche has set up.
