Ingredients:
-Blocks of your favorite cheeses. I like using extra sharp cheddar and mozzarella.

Directions:
-Light up about 4 pieces of charcoal. Once they are completely gray, put one small piece of wood on top of the charcoal. I've been using pecan and mesquite wood. Place foil on top of rack that is farthest from the heat of your smoker. The foil acts as a heat shield.  Place a pan full of ice on the rack that has foil on it. Place a rack on top of the pan of ice and place cheese on this rack.  Smoke 2-3 hours making sure the temp inside smoker stays below 90 degrees.  Add ice as needed and flip the blocks of cheese about every 30 minutes. Once done, vacuum seal or place cheese in freezer bags and put in fridge.  You can eat cheese immediately after it cools down, but if you let it sit in fridge for a few days or even a couple of weeks, the flavor gets better and better.
