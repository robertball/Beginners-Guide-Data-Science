Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package rapid rise yeast
3 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons canola oil
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
2 1/2 cups gluten-free all purpose baking flour (such as Bob's Red MillÂ®)
2 teaspoons xanthan gum
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic

Directions:
Stir warm water with sugar together in a bowl. Sprinkle yeast packet over water mixture and allow yeast to slightly foam, about 5 minutes.
Whisk eggs, canola oil, and vinegar together in a bowl until frothy.
Combine flour, xanthan gum, and salt together in a bowl until evenly mixed. Beat yeast mixture into flour mixture using an electric mixer until evenly combined. Beat egg mixture into flour mixture until just combined; stir in dill and garlic. Beat dough on high until dough holds together and is sticky, at least 4 minutes. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside to slightly rise in a warm area, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x13-inch baking dish.
Form dough into 12 large rolls and arrange 3/4-inch apart in the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven rolls are lightly golden, 35 to 45 minutes.
