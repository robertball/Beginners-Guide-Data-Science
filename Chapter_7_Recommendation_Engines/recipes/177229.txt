Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 (32 ounce) package frozen tater tots, (such as McCain® Tasti Taters)
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
8 ounces sour cream
1 cup melted butter
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
salt to taste
1 (7 ounce) bag sour cream-and-onion-flavored potato chips, crushed

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large casserole dish.
Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the onion in the hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix the cooked onions, tater tots, mushroom soup, sour cream, butter, pepper, and salt together in a large bowl until the tater tots are evenly coated. Stir the Cheddar cheese in a little bit at a time until evenly distributed throughout the mixture; pour into the prepared dish. Sprinkle the potato chips over the top.
Bake until golden brown on top, 45 to 60 minutes.
