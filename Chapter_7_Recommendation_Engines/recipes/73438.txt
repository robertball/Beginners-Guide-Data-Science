Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 cup shrimp stock
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons butter
4 large uncooked shrimp, peeled
4 shucked oysters
1/2 teaspoon Cajun-style blackened seasoning
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
4 fresh mushrooms, sliced
2 ounces fresh lump crabmeat (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
4 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and onion, and cook until onion is tender, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in the shrimp stock and white wine, stirring until smooth. Season with cayenne pepper and salt, and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, then stir in cream and remove from heat.
Preheat the oven's broiler.
Melt remaining butter in a skillet over medium heat. Season the shrimp and oysters with blackened seasoning, and saute in butter for about 2 minutes. Add the spinach, mushrooms, crabmeat and green onion, and cook until softened, stirring frequently. Transfer to a baking dish, and stir in the cream sauce. Top with shredded cheese.
Place under the broiler, and cook until cheese is melted. Serve immediately.
