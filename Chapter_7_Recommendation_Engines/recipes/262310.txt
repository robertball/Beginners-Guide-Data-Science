Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa
4 cups water
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Soak quinoa in a bowl with water to cover until it starts to germinate and you see the grain tails, 8 to 10 hours.
Wash quinoa through a strainer. Pour quinoa into a pot and add 4 cups water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Let cool briefly.
Pour quinoa and water into a blender; add olive oil and salt. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend, about 1 minute. Let cool until safe to handle, and strain through a cheesecloth for an even better texture.

Description: 
A nutrient-packed alternative to milk. I use EVOO and a pinch of salt here but you can season to taste adding honey, cinnamon, vanilla, or any flavor you really love!
