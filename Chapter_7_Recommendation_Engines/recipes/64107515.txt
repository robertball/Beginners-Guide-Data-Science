Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
1/4 cup frozen (thawed) lemonade concentrate
2 teaspoons grated lemon peel
1 teaspoon lemon extract
2 eggs
1 pouch (1 lb 1.5 oz) Betty Crocker™ sugar cookie mix
1 1/2 cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour
1/2 cup chopped dried cherries

Directions:
1 Heat oven to 350°F. Line large cookie sheet with foil. In large bowl, stir butter, lemonade concentrate, lemon peel, lemon extract and eggs until well mixed. Add remaining ingredients; stir until soft dough forms.
2 Divide dough in half. On cookie sheet, shape each 1/2 of dough into a 12x2-inch log.
3 Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Cool 15 minutes.
4 Carefully lift foil to move cookie logs to cutting board. With serrated knife, carefully cut each log crosswise on a slight diagonal into 3/4-inch slices. Place slices cut side down on cookie sheet.
5 Bake 15 to 20 minutes, gently turning cookies over once during baking. Cool 2 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely. Store loosely covered at room temperature.
