Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 dried red chile peppers, broken into pieces
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon mustard seed
1 teaspoon coriander seed
1 sprig fresh curry leaves
1/4 teaspoon asafoetida powder
1 (1 pound) calabash gourd (anapakaya), cut into 3/4-inch pieces
1/4 cup milk
salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the red chile peppers, cumin seed, mustard seed, and coriander seed in the hot oil until they begin to splutter. Add the curry leaves and asafoetida powder; stir. Cook and stir the gourd pieces in the mixture until warmed and coated in the oil mixture. Pour the milk into the skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and allow the mixture to simmer until the gourd is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Season with the ground red pepper and salt; simmer another minute or so. If too much liquid remains, increase heat to high and cook until reduced to your liking.
