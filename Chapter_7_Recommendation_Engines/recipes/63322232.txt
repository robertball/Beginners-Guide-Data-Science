Ingredients:
2 pkg. Active dry Yeast
2 cups warm milk
1/2-cup sugar
1/2 t. salt
2 eggs - beaten
1/2 cup shortening, margarine or butter
7 to 8 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Put yeast and milk in a bowl.  Let sit for 5 minutes.  Add sugar, salt, eggs and softened butter and mix well. Gradually add flour while mixing.  Add flour until dough pulls together into a ball.
Knead for 5 minutes or until dough is smooth.
Put in a greased bowl, cover with a towel and allow to rise until double.
Punch down and let it rise again.
Remove dough from bowl and divide into thirds.  On a floured surface, roll one portion of the dough to 1/4” thickness.  Cut into 5"or 6” squares.  (Reserve dough you cut off to reroll.)
Give each square an extra roll with the rolling pin before filling.

Description: 
I first had runza while living in North Dakota in the 70's.  In the winter time I kept the house warm with the oven going all day long.  They are made with very simple ingredients. The first ones I ever made were filled with saurkraut, ground beef and onions.  They freeze well and everyone loves them.
