Ingredients:
3 lbs. skinless salmon, cut in 4 equal pieces
1 red pepper
1 green pepper
1 yellow pepper
1 large onion
Old Bay seasoning
Garlic powder
Soy sauce
Teriyaki sauce

Directions:
Preheat grill to low heat.
Cut up veggies and divide equally into four bowls (1 mixture for each piece of salmon).
Cut four pieces of heavy duty foil, big enough to hold each piece of salmon and veggies and fold over and crimp the three sides (about 16" x 16").
Place piece of salmon on each piece of foil.
Brush one side of salmon with soy sauce, followed by Old Bay seasoning, garlic powder, and teriyaki sauce.
Push salmon to the side and put half of the veggies from the bowl onto the foil.
Flip salmon over onto the veggies and repeat step 4.  Top salmon with remaining veggies from the bowl.
Fold the foil over and crimp all three sides.  Cook on grill for 10 minutes on each side.
Remove foil from grill into serving dishes and enjoy.
