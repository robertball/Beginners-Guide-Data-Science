Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch ground ginger
1 pinch ground black pepper
3 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup dates, pitted and chopped
2 cups shredded zucchini

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5 inch loaf pans. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and pepper in a bowl until evenly combined; set aside.
Beat the eggs, vanilla, sugar, and vegetable oil in a mixing bowl until smooth. Fold in the flour, dates, and zucchini until no dry spots remain. Divide the batter between the two prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
