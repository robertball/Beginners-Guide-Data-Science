Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (If batter is too thick add a little more milk)
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup milk
1/3 cup pumpkin puree
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 egg

Directions:
Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg and cloves in a medium bowl.
Whisk together the milk, pumpkin, butter and egg in a separate bowl. Fold this mixture into the dry ingredients.
Melt some butter in a skillet over medium heat.
Pour 1/4 cup batter for each pancake and cook approximately 3-4 minutes per side. (These cook longer than regular pancakes)
Serve with butter and (real) maple syrup.

Description: 
I'm not a huge pancake lover BUT I loved these pancakes.  They are light, fluffy and full of pumpkin flavor.  I adapted the recipe from Martha Stewart Living.
