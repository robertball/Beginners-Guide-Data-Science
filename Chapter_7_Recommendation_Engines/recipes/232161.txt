Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 egg, beaten
6 tablespoons turbinado sugar
1 1/4 cups mashed overripe bananas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt(R).
Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
Place butter and sugar in a blender; process until sugar is almost completely dissolved; pour into a bowl. Stir in mashed bananas and egg until well blended; pour banana mixture into flour mixture and stir until batter is just combined. Pour batter into prepared tube pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting cake onto a plate to serve.

Description: 
This recipe simply repeats a mistake I made trying to follow the Banana Banana Bread recipe with a deliciously moist result, turning a banana bread into a banana cake. Big banana flavor without a lot of time or effort!
