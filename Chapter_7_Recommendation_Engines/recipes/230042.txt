Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar, or more to taste
1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1 (12 ounce) package cranberries, divided
1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger tequila
1 1/2 oranges, zested

Directions:
Heat a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir sugar, orange juice, half the cranberries, and tequila in the warmed saucepan until mixture is slightly reduced, about 20 minutes. Add the remaining cranberries and orange zest; cook and stir until cranberries begin to pop, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
A family recipe we have used for years. We love it as a side dish to our turkey on Thanksgiving day. Also goes well on chicken, pork, and beef. Makes a great treat as an appetizer served with crackers, or can even be used over vanilla ice cream. I like to add the orange zest a couple tablespoons at a time, as not to overdo it. Adjust sweetness by adding 1 tablespoon sugar at a time at the end of cooking if needed.
