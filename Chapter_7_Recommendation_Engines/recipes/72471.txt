Ingredients:
3/4 pound sliced bacon
1 large head iceberg lettuce, shredded
1/4 cup sliced onion
1/4 cup thinly sliced celery
1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and sliced
1 (10 ounce) package frozen peas
1 cup mayonnaise, or to taste
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 tablespoons grated Romano or Parmesan cheese
4 tomatoes, cut into wedges
2 hard-cooked eggs, sliced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley for garnish

Directions:
Spread the lettuce out on a large serving dish or bowl. Sprinkle the onion, celery, water chestnuts and frozen peas (unthawed) over the lettuce in layers. Spread mayonnaise over the top like a frosting. Sprinkle with sugar and grated cheese. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
Before serving, sprinkle crumbled bacon over the top, and garnish with tomato wedges, slices of hard-cooked egg, and parsley.
