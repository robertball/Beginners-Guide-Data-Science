Ingredients:
1 bag (12oz) Cranberries (Fresh or Frozen)
1/2 cup Sugar
1/2 cup Brown Sugar
1/2 cup Orange Juice
1/2 cup water
1/4 tsp Vanilla
1 Cinnamon Stick
2-3 Slices of Orange Peel (use peeler)
Pinch of Salt

Directions:
Add the cranberries, cinnamon stick,  vanilla, orange juice and water to the instant pot.
Close the lid and select Manual on the Instant Pot (I have a Instant pot LP-Lux so the buttons may differ) and the +/- to select 1 minute (High pressure). When the cooking cycle finishes, turn the pot OFF. (Over cooking the cranberries will cause the skin to break)
Let the pressure naturally release for 7 minutes. Open the lid carefully.
Turn the Instant Pot back on and Select the Sauté button.  Add in the ½ cup white sugar and the 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Stir and the heat will instantly melt the sugar to form a thick cranberry sauce. Add a pinch of salt. Immediately turn of the Instant Pot to avoid overcooking.
Taste the cranberry sauce; if you prefer a sweeter sauce, add more sugar, 1 Tbsp at a time, stirring well. Taste and repeat if desired.
Transfer to a serving dish and top with the orange peel slices. Serve warm or cold. It will thicken as it cools.
Notes: If the cranberry skin burst the sauce can be strained. If you prefer a more bitter cranberry sauce add less sugar. Enjoy!
