Description: 
Another favorite that came from a friend's men's bible study. The guys would be served this on special occasions and its another favorite of my husband (the world's pickiest eater). Great dish for entertaining. Its elegant but so simple and easy to make. Serve over some angel hair pasta and a salad for a full meal.
