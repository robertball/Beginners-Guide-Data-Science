Ingredients:
2 packages (8 ounces each) manicotti shells
1/4 cup butter, cubed
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2-1/2 cups milk
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 pound bulk Italian sausage
4 cups cubed cooked chicken or turkey
2 packages (10 ounces each) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup (4 ounces) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
2 jars (26 ounces each) spaghetti sauce
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley

Directions:
Cook manicotti according to package directions. Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan. Stir in the flour until smooth; gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted; set aside. Drain manicotti; set aside.
In a large skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Add the chicken, spinach, eggs, mozzarella cheese and 3/4 cup white sauce. Stuff into manicotti shells.
Spread 1/2 cup spaghetti sauce in each of two ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. baking dishes. Top with manicotti. Pour remaining spaghetti sauce over the top.
Reheat the remaining white sauce, stirring constantly. Pour over spaghetti sauce. Bake, uncovered, at 350Â° for 45-50 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley.
