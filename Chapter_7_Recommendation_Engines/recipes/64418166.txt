o 1 cup chopped nuts (optional)
Icing
o 3 cups confectioners' sugar
o 1/2 cup butter, melted ( no subs)

3. Add vanilla extract.
4. Add flour, mix well.

8. When the brownies are almost done baking, prepare icing.
9. Bring to boil in the microwave, the butter, cocoa and 1 T. milk.
10. In a mixing bowl, add confectioners' sugar. Add the cocoa mixture to the sugar and beat well. Add 1 t. vanilla extract. Add the rest of the milk. Add enough to get the desired spreading consistency.
