Ingredients:
1 bunch (10 oz) Kale, rinsed and drained
nonstick cooking spray
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
Step 1: Preheat the oven to 300. Pour base ingredients into a large Ziplock bag.
Step 2: Pour flavor ingredients in, and shake/smoosh until they're relatively combined.
ex: spray leaves with nonstick cooking spray to coat lightly and sprinkle with salt
Step 3: Remove kale stems, and chop into large-bite-sized pieces (they'll shrink a bit while baking). Put the kale in the bag â€” don't press the air out.
**make sure kale is super dry after washing
Step 4: shake bag
Step 5: Once the chips are evenly coated, open the bag a bit and press air out. Re-seal, and now massage the kale through the bag. This will help the tough leaves take the flavor.
Step 6: spread leaves into a single layer on 1-2 large cookie sheets--noninsulated.
***line with parchment paper
Bake Kale 20-30 mins or just until Kale chips are crisp but not browned.  cool on cookie sheets on wire racks.
alt: skip cookie spray and use olive oil w/ 1/2 tbs olive oil.  add some pepper
another option is using a dehydrator for 5 hours.
can add parmesan cheese
