Ingredients:
2 Cornish game hens
1 (10.75 ounce) can golden mushroom soup (such as Campbell'sÂ®), divided
2 cups chopped baby portobello mushrooms
1 (7 ounce) jar pimento-stuffed green olives, drained and chopped
1 large zucchini, chopped
1 teaspoon garlic salt

Directions:
Coat the hens with about 1/4 of the mushroom soup.
Mix the remaining mushroom soup with mushrooms, olives, zucchini, and garlic salt in a bowl. Stuff the mixture inside the hens. Arrange hens, breast sides up, in the slow cooker. Spoon any remaining soup mixture over the hens.
Cook the hens in the slow cooker on High for 4 hours.

Description: 
This is my fiance's favorite slow cooker meal of mine. 
I usually serve it with the veggies over wild rice. You can turn this recipe for 2 into 4 by splitting the hens lengthwise after cooking.
