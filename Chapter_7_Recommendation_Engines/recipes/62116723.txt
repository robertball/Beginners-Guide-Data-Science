Ingredients:
3 8oz bricks of cream cheese (softened)*
1 cup of your favorite jarred salsa
* this recipe works well with regular, low-fat, Neufchatel and spreadable cream cheeses - but don't use whipped, the consistance is all wrong.

Directions:
Dump ingredients into a bowl, blend with electric mixer until pink and fluffy.  Chill for one hour so flavors blend.
Serve with tortilla chips, or nacho cheese flavored chips (Dorito's).
