Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 (1 inch thick) bone-in pork chops
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup apricot jam
1 cup Catalina salad dressing
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1 garlic clove, crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat oil in frying pan over medium-high heat. Season pork chops with salt and pepper; cook 2 to 3 minutes per side until well-browned.
Stir jam, salad dressing, onion soup mix, and garlic together in a bowl until well-blended. Place chops in a 9x13 inch baking pan lined with foil, and cover with apricot mixture.
Bake in preheated oven approximately 40 minutes, until internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), or pork is no longer pink in the center.
