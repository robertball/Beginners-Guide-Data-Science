1/2 Cup All Purpose Flour
1/4 Cup Sugar
2 Teaspoons Cinnamon
3/4 Cup Sugar

Dash Vanilla

Directions:
Prepare caramel sauce: in a small saucepan combine 3/4 cup sugar and 1/8 cup water over medium-high heat.
Stir with a wooden spoon and baste sides of pan with extra water to prevent sugar crystals from developing. Keep stirring until mixture is amber colored.
Stir in cream and vanilla.
Let cool to room temperature.
Bananas: Heat oil to 350-375 degrees F.
Meanwhile, combine flour, 1/4 cup sugar, and cinnamon on a plate.

Dredge slices in flour mixture and fry to golden brown in hot oil, turning once. Fry about 1-2 minutes per side.
Drain on paper towels.
Assemble: lay 2 banana slices on a plate. Place a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle of the two slices. Drizzle with caramel sauce, enjoy!
