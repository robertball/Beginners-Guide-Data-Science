Ingredients:
-1/4 c. milk
-3 tbl. cold butter
-1 c. flour
-1/2 c. dried fruit(your pick)
-1/4 c. sugar

-1 egg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
In a food processor add flour, butter, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Mix until butter is cut in.
Add egg, milk and mix once again until well incorporated. Dough should be springy but not sticky; if sticky to the touch add a little more flour. Once at right consistency add dried fruit, pulsate a few times to mix it in.
Remove from bowl and place onto buttered cookie sheet, form into a flat circle about 1 inch thick. Cut an 'X' acrossed dough to get 4 pieces. Sprinkle a little sugar on top.
Bake for 15-20 min.
