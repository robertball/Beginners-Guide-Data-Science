Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) cans white hominy, drained
water to cover
1 head garlic, cloves peeled
salt to taste
1 pound boneless pork shoulder, cubed
1 pound boneless pork loin, cubed
1/2 pound pork neck bones
1 large plum tomato
4 ounces dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded
1 clove garlic
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1 pinch ground cumin
2 cups water
Toppings:
1 head iceberg lettuce, finely shredded
1 small onion, diced
4 limes, quartered

Directions:
Place hominy in a large pot; cover with water. Add 1 head garlic and salt to taste. Cook over medium heat for 2 hours.
Place pork shoulder, pork loin, and pork neck bones in the hominy mixture and cook until meat is tender and cooked through, about 1 hour.
Place tomato and guajillo chiles in a pot and add enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Cook until chiles have softened, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.
Place tomato and chiles with salt, 1 clove garlic, oregano, and cumin in a blender; add 2 cups water. Blend until smooth. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve and set chile sauce aside.
Transfer pork to a work surface and shred with 2 forks. Discard the pork bones.
Pour chile sauce into hominy mixture; bring to a boil. Return shredded pork to pot. Simmer pozole until flavors have blended, about 3 minutes.
Ladle pozole into serving bowls and top with lettuce and onion and serve lime wedge on the side.
