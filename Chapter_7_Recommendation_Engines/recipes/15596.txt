Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages pimento cheese food

Description: 
A quick and easy spread for finger sandwiches. It's light, too. It's great in stuffed celery or small finger sandwiches on white, sourdough or pumpernickel bread.  I add a small, thin slice of stuffed olive in the center of sandwiches for a garnish.
