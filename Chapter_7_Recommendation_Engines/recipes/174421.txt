Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, chopped
1/4 cup dried cherries
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 (10 ounce) bag fresh baby spinach
2 tablespoons crumbled goat cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over very low heat. Add garlic, onion, cherries, and mushrooms; cook and stir, without browning garlic, until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Toss in spinach, and cook and stir until spinach is just wilted, about 3 minutes.
Remove from heat. Top with crumbled goat cheese just before serving.
