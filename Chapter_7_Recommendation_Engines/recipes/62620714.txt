Ingredients:
1 pound extra lean ground beef
1/3 cup Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup onion; chopped
1/4 cup mushroom; or ripe olives, chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon oregano
dash pepper
1 6 oz. can tomato paste
8  hamburger bun

Directions:
Mix everything together.  Spread on hamburger buns evenly.  Broil 5 inches from heat for 12 minutes or until meat is done. The bun edges burn easily. To avoid this, spread meat over the edge and/or wrap each bun with a thin strip of foil.
Optional: use french bread sliced lengthwise, 3 sliced tomatoes and 6 slices of mozzarella cheese cut diagonally into triangles.  After broiling meat mixture on bread, alternate cheese and tomatoes on top and broil until cheese melts.

Description: 
Ginny Howe made this often for her kids. She always made this on hamburger buns instead of french bread cut in half lengthwise, which is what the original recipe calls for.  She also skipped the sliced tomatoes and triangles of mozzarella cheese broiled on top.
