Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1 (2 ounce) can anchovy fillets (such as King Oscar®), diced (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 yellow onion, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
12 ounces baby spinach (such as Dole®)
4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and sliced
1/2 cup green onions, finely chopped
1/4 cup grated Asiago cheese

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble bacon.
Whisk red wine vinegar, seasoned rice vinegar, anchovies, and white pepper together in a bowl until dressing is evenly mixed.
Heat olive oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion and garlic until onion is transparent, 5 to 10 minutes. Lower heat to medium. Add spinach, working in batches, to onion mixture, tossing and mixing until spinach wilts, 1 to 2 minutes.
Transfer spinach mixture to a serving bowl; top with egg slices and bacon.
Pour dressing into the wok; bring to just under a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Pour dressing over spinach mixture; sprinkle with green onions and Asiago cheese.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe the same way I think a lot of cooks come up with new ideas - by sticking my head in the refrigerator and wondering what I could throw together with what I had. It turned out to be easy and very tasty so I thought I would share.
