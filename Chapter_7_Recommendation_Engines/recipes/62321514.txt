Ingredients:
1 bunch asparagus
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 TBS dijon mustard
2 tsp. white wine vnegar, preferrably Cardonnay od Pinot Grigio
1/4 grapeseed oil or very mild olive oil
1/4 mixed fresh herbs, preferably chives, chevril,parsley, and tarragon.
Fleur de sel

Directions:
heat the oven to 350 F.  To cook the asparagus, line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Lay asparagus on parchment paper and toss the spears with olive oil.  Season well with salt and pepper.  Cover asparagus with another piece of parchment and put them in the oven to steam-roast until color is bright green and they are tender, 6-12 minutes, depending on thickness; check by biting into a spear.
Meanwhile, make the vinaigrette by combining the shallot, mustard, and vinegar in a small bowl.  Whisk in the grapeseed oil.  Just before serving whisk in the hebs.  Drizzle the vinaigrette over the asparagus while it's still warm and finish with a light sprinkling of Fleur de sel.
