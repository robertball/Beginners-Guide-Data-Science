Ingredients:
4 medium sweet red peppers
9 lasagna noodles
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon olive or canola oil
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup butter or stick margarine
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 1/2 cups fat-free milk
1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cut each pepper into quarters; remove seeds. Place peppers, cut side down, on a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil 4 inches from the heat for 20-25 minutes or until skin is blistered and blackened. Immediately place peppers in a bowl; cover and let stand for 15-20 minutes. Peel off and discard skin. Cut peppers into 1/4-in. strips.
Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions; drain. In a saucepan, cook red peppers and garlic in oil for 1 minute; add the tomatoes, parsley, sugar, basil and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. In a saucepan, melt butter. Stir in flour, salt and nutmeg until smooth. Gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.
Spread 1 cup pepper sauce in a 13-inch x 9-inch x 2-inch baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Top with three noodles, 1-1/2 cups pepper sauce, 1 cup white sauce and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers. Top with remaining noodles, white sauce and pepper sauce.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes or until bubbly. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Let stand for 15 minutes before cutting.
