Ingredients:
1 potato, peeled and diced
1 1/2 cups water
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
6 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons shortening
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a medium saucepan cook potato cubes in water for about 12 minutes, or until tender.  Do not drain.  Cool mixture to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).  Set aside 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.  Mash potato and remaining liquid; if necessary add warm water to make 2 cups potato mixture.
In a large mixing bowl, sprinkle yeast on reserved 1/2 cup potato water.  Add mashed potato mixture, 2 cups of the flour, sugar, shortening, and salt.  Beat with an electric mixer on low speed  for 1/2 minute, scraping sides of bowl constantly.  Beat 3 minutes at high speed.  Stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can mix in by hand.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough. Knead for 6 to 8 minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic.  Place in a lightly greased bowl; turn once to grease surface.  Cover.  Let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Punch down, and turn out onto a lightly floured surface.  Divide dough in half.  Cover, and  let rest for 10 minutes.  Shape each half into a loaf.  Place in greased 8 x 4 x 2 inch loaf pans.  Cover.  Let rise until nearly double, about 35 minutes.  Before baking, brush tops with a little water and dust with additional flour.
Bake at 375 degree F (190 degrees C) for 40 to 45 minutes.  Cover with foil for the last 15 minutes of baking to prevent over-browning.  Remove from pan; cool on wire rack.
