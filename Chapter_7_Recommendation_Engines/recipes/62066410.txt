Ingredients:
1 - (2 pound)salami, casing removed
1 bottle (15 oz.) barbeque sauce
1 cup brown sugar
crackers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Slice the whole salami in about 1/4" slices, making sure you DO NOT cut all the way through.  Put the salami in a foil lined pan and bake uncovered for 1 hour. Drain fat.
Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine barbeque sauce and brown sugar.  Pour most of the sauce over the drained salami. Put the salami back in the oven and bake for about 45 minutes longer.  Use the remainder of the sauce to baste the salami about every 15 minutes until done.
Serve the salami on a platter or cutting board with a knife.  Let your guests cut off there own piece of the salami.  Serve with crackers.

Description: 
I found this recipe years ago.  My first thought was that it was strange, but decided to keep it anyway.  I have made this many times since and it is one of the first appetizers to go!  It is simple enough for football parties or nice enough for cocktail parties.  Be careful when you slice the salami so that all the slices are on the same side.  The salami has a tendency to twist!
