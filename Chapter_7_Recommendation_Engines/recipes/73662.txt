Ingredients:
3 tablespoons cracked pink peppercorns
3 tablespoons cracked green peppercorns
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 cup heavy cream
½ cup butter, divided
1 clove garlic, pressed
½ teaspoon dried rosemary

Directions:
Mix together the pink and green peppercorns. Spread over the both sides of the chicken breasts. Pound the chicken with a tenderizing mallet until it is half as thick as it was before.
Melt half of the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Fry chicken breasts for about 5 minutes per side, or until nicely browned and no longer pink in the center. Remove chicken to a serving dish, and keep warm.
Stir the remaining butter, heavy cream, garlic and rosemary into the skillet, mixing into the juices from the chicken. Simmer, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Pour sauce over the chicken, and serve.
