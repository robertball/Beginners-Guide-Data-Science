Ingredients:
1 pound sweet or hot Italian sausage links
1 medium green pepper, cut into 2-inch-long strips
1 large onion, cut in half and sliced
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed Cheddar Cheese Soup
1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
1/4 cup milk
4 Pepperidge Farm® Classic Sandwich Buns with Sesame Seeds

Directions:
Cook the sausage in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned. Pour off any fat.
Add the pepper and onion to the skillet and cook until the vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Stir in the soup, mustard and milk and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes or until the sausage is cooked through, stirring occasionally.
Place 1 sausage link into each roll. Divide the pepper mixture among the rolls.
