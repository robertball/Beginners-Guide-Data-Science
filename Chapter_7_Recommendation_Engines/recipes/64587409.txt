Ingredients:
1/4 cup good olive oil, plus extra for serving
1 1/2 cups chopped yellow onion (1 large onion)
2 tablespoons minced garlic (6 cloves)
3 pounds zucchini (unpeeled), 3/4-inch-diced
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 cup good dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio
4 cups good chicken stock, preferably homemade
1 cup chopped fresh basil leaves, lightly packed
1/2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup Greek yogurt, plus extra for serving
Shaved Parmesan, for serving

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
Add the onion and saute over medium-low heat for 8-10 minutes, until translucent but not browned.
Add the garlic and cook for one minute.
Add the zucchini, nutmeg, red pepper flakes, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper and saute for 4-10 minutes, until the zucchini is tender.
Add the wine, chicken stock, and basil, bring it to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, until the zucchini is very tender.
Pass the soup through a food mill fitted with the coarsest blade (you can also use an immersion or regular blender but the soup will have less texture).
Return to the pot and bring to a simmer.
Off the heat, whisk in the grated Parmesan and yogurt.
Check for seasonings and serve hot topped with a dollop of yogurt, shaved Parmesan, and a drizzle of olive oil.
Make it ahead: prepare the soup without the Parmesan and yogurt, and refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat the soup, whisk in the Parmesan and yogurt, and serve.
