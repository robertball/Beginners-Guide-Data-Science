Ingredients:
1/2 cup Honey Nut Crunch cereal, crushed
1 cup vanilla frozen yogurt
2 small firm bananas
1 Tbsp. butter or margarine
4 tsp. Honey
Cinnamon to taste

Directions:
Place crushed cereal in a shallow bowl.  Using an ice cream scoop make 2 (1/2 cup) yogurt balls and roll them around in cereal making sure all sides are coated well - press cereal into frozen yogurt as needed.  Place coated balls into a parfait dish and put in freezer to allow to harden. Meanwhile, add butter or margarine to skillet and melt on low.  While butter is melting peel and cut each banana lengthwise and then in half so you have four pieces.  Add pieces to melted butter in skillet and fry approx 2 minutes on each side until banana turns soft and color is buttery yellow.  Remove skillet from heat.  Take parfait dishes from freezer and arrange fried bananas pieces around each frozen ball.  Drizzle 2 tsp of honey over the top of each dessert and then lightly dust with a little cinnamon.  Serve immediately.
