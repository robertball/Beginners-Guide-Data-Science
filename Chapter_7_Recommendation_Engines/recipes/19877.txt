Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix
1/2 cup melted butter
1/3 cup milk
2 eggs
35 chocolate covered caramel candies (e.g. Rolo TM)
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup toffee baking bits

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Unwrap chocolate covered caramel candies and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine the cake mix, melted butter, milk and eggs. Stir with a wooden spoon until well blended. Press half of the mixture or a little bit more evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Bake for 6 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven and sprinkle the chocolate chips and toffee bits over the top. Press the caramel candies into the surface 5 across and 7 down. Do not press all the way to the bottom. Spread the remaining brownie dough over the top. Return to the oven for an additional 20 to 25 minutes, or just until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool before cutting into 35 squares.
