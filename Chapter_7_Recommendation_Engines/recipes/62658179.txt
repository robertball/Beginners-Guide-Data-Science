Ingredients:
2 6oz salmon fillets
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 teaspoon Tajin® (see footnotes)
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon Tapatio® hot sauce or any non-vinegar based hot sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
4 thin slices of tomato
1 thin slice of onion, halved
1 jalapeno, seeded and quartered lengthwise
Heavy duty aluminum foil

Directions:
Place salmon fillets in a glass baking dish; mix oil, lemon juice and hot sauce to coat both sides of salmon. Mix Tajin and garlic powder together and sprinkle on both sides of salmon.
Marinate in the refrigerator about 1 hour, turning occasionally.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place fillets in aluminum foil, place two slices of tomatoes, half of sliced onion, with two slices of jalapenos on top of each fillet, cover equally with remainder of marinade, and seal. Place sealed salmon in the glass baking dish, and bake 35 minutes or until easily flaked with a fork.
Using a metal spatula, transfer foil packets to a plate and serve.
