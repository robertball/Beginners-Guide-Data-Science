Ingredients:
1 Butternut Squash
2 Rainbow Trout Fillets or Salmon
Fresh Dill
Salsa:
2 medium tomatoes finely chopped
2 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro
1/3 cup red onion finely chopped
1 jalepeno pepper, finely chopped
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Set the oven to 450
Cut the squash in half, remove seeds
Combine salsa ingredients (feel free to change amounts according to taste, especially in regards to the onion, cilantro, lemon juice and olive oil)
Put the salsa in the hole of the squash, where the seeds were (leave some for afterwards)
brush the rest of the squash with a little bit of olive oil, then place finely snipped dill all over (I like lots, so can almost not see squash - but it is up to your personal tastes)
Bake squash for 1 hr
Meanwhile, brush rainbow trout fillets with olive oil then cover with finely chopped dill
When Squash has 15 min remaining, place fish in the oven to bake
Once Squash tender, and fish done take out of oven
Serve with fish on top of Squash, sprinkle with remaining salsa

Description: 
This is something a friend of mine showed me. Its super easy and healthy not to mention delicious. I try to eat according to the Paleolithic diet and this fits wonderfully. The portions are quite large, so it can easily feed more than 2 or you can have some for lunch the next day.
