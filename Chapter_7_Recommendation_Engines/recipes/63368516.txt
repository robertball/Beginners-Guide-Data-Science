Ingredients:
4-6 thick slices of Country Bread
1 cup milk, low fat
2 eggs
1 12oz package Apple Maple Chicken Sausage, sliced into 1/2” pieces
1 pineapple, peeled, cored, and cut into quarters lengthwise
2 tbsp unsalted butter
2 tbsp brown sugar
1 cinnamon stick
1 star anise
2 whole cloves
1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped
1/3 cup dark rum (divided)

Directions:
FRENCH TOAST
Wisk egg and milk in a bowl.
Dip slices of bread in egg-milk mixture and place on a greased medium high skillet or griddle until browned.
Set aside.
ROASTED PINEAPPLE & CHICKEN SAUSAGE SAUCE
Preheat oven to 350°F
In an ovenproof medium sauté pan over medium heat, melt the butter until it begins to bubble.
Place the pineapple quarters and apple maple chicken sausage pieces in the pan and carefully brown each side.
Remove from the heat and add the sugar, cinnamon stick, star anise, cloves, vanilla seeds, and about half of the rum.
Place the pan in the oven and roast for 10 minutes, turning the pineapple halfway through.
When the pineapple is soft and caramelized, remove the pan from the oven and stir in the remaining rum, scraping and swirling the pan to incorporate any browned bits into the liquid.
Allow to cook, then remove and slice the pineapple, reserving the liquid in the pan.
Serve pineapple sauce over French toast.
