Ingredients:
1 cup brown rice flour
¾ cup tapioca flour
2 tablespoons raw cane sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon xanthan gum
1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
½ teaspoon salt
2 very ripe medium bananas, mashed
¼ cup canola oil, plus more for brushing the waffle iron
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 ¼ cups unsweetened rice milk
1/3 cup walnuts, chopped (optional)
Maple syrup
Extra sliced bananas (optional)

Directions:
1. Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer’s directions. Preheat your oven to 200°F, and set out a rimmed baking sheet.
2. In a large bowl, combine the brown rice flour, tapioca flour, sugar, baking powder, xanthan gum, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a medium bowl, combine the bananas, canola oil, vanilla, and milk. Add to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Fold in the walnuts if using.
4. Use a pastry brush or paper towel to thoroughly oil the top and bottom plates of your waffle iron. Ladle ½ cup of batter onto the iron, and cook according to the manufacturer’s directions. Place the waffle on the baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while you make the remaining waffles. Serve warm with maple syrup and extra sliced bananas, if desired.
5. Stack leftover cooled waffles with a sheet of parchment paper in between each one, then place in an airtight container and freeze for up to 1 month.
