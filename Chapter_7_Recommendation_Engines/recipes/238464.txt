Description: 
Casa Ole (a restaurant) refused to fork over their recipe for the green sauce they serve, so I set to work in the kitchen and came up with this. I think it's exact, but we shall never know unless we ever get them to relinquish their version. Mine is better! Enjoy sauce with tortilla chips.
