Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package firm tofu
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup pineapple juice
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon tamari
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
2 green bell peppers, cut into strips
1 small red onion, sliced into thin rings
1 1/2 cups cooked white rice

Directions:
Place tofu between 2 plates. Place a weight on the top plate to press water out of tofu. Let sit, draining off water occasionally, 1 to 2 hours.
Slice tofu into chunky, bite-sized pieces.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute tofu until golden, about 5 minutes. Remove tofu and set aside.
Whisk pineapple juice, brown sugar, vinegar, cornstarch, tamari, and salt together in the same pan. Stir constantly over medium heat until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add pineapple chunks, bell peppers, and onion; reduce heat to low. Cook until onion and peppers are slightly soft, about 5 minutes. Add tofu and heat through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Serve over cooked rice.
