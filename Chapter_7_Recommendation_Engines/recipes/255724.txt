Ingredients:
1 large acorn squash, halved and seeded
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
1/4 cup chopped prunes
1/4 cup chopped raisins
1/4 cup chopped dried apricots
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
salt to taste
1/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place acorn squash cut-side down in a baking pan.
Bake acorn squash in the preheated oven until tender when pierced with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes. Flip to face up and cool until easily handled.
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Stir in prunes, raisins, apricots, garlic, and ginger. Cook until prunes, raisins, and apricots plump up and quinoa is tender, about 5 minutes.
Drizzle olive oil over quinoa mixture and add salt; mix well.
Scoop flesh of the acorn squash from the shells; cut into cubes and toss gently with quinoa mixture. Stuff empty shells with mixture. Sprinkle pecans on top.
