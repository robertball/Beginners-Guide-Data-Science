Ingredients:
4 walleye fillets
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pinch salt (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups crushed saltine crackers
vegetable oil for frying
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
Check the fillets to ensure all bones and skin have been removed. Cut the fillets into manageable pieces, if necessary.
Place the beaten eggs a bowl and set aside. Combine the flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in another bowl. Pour the cracker crumbs into a third bowl.
Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Dip the fillets into the flour mixture, then the eggs, and then the cracker crumbs and set fillets aside on a plate. Test the oil: it will crackle and pop when a cracker crumb is dropped into it. Carefully lower 2 fillets into the hot oil. Cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side, using tongs to turn the fillets. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat with remaining fillets. Serve with fresh lemon wedges.

Description: 
This is the recipe my dad has been using for 25 years. It's light and clean-tasting because there's no sense in masking the naturally delicious flavor of such an awesome Canadian delicacy! No tartar sauce needed!
