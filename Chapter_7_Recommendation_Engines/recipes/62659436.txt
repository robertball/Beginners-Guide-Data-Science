Ingredients:
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup warm water
2 pkgs (16g) active dry yeast
3-1/2 cups all purpose flour
2 tbsp cinnamon
1 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp ground cloves
3/4 cup milk, warmed
1/4 cup melted butter
1 egg
1 egg yolk
1/2 cup raisins
1/4 cup unsweetened coconut
Filling
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup water
1 cup coconut

Directions:
Dissolve 1 tbsp of the sugar in warm water. Sprinkle in yeast; let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.
In large bowl, blend together remaining sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and cloves; make well in center. Whisk together milk, butter, egg and egg yolk; pour into well. Pour in yeast mixture. With wooden spoon, stir until soft dough forms.
Turn out dough onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease all over. Cover with plastic wrap; let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
In the last 15 minutes of the dough rising, prepare coconut filling. Boil sugar and water for approximately 10 minutes; creating a simple syrup. Remove from heat and stir in coconut.
Punch down and turn out onto floured surface. Knead in raisins and coconut. Divide the dough into two portions and form into two loaves.  Using a serrated knife cut a trench into the centre of the loaves; fill with coconut filling and pinch dough to cover the filling. Allow loaves to rise for an additional 35 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees and bake for 25 minutes.
