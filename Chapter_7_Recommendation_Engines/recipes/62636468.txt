Ingredients:
1  cup all-purpose flour
1/4  teaspoon salt
water, as needed

Directions:
Sift the flour and salt into a bowl and slowly add enough cold water to make a stiff dough.
(A sticky dough makes a soft pasty dumpling.).
Knead in the bowl or on a lightly floured board until smooth.
Break off small pieces about the size of a walnut and roll between your hands. It should be similar to a long tube with pointy ends. They're usually about 3-4 inches long.
Immerse into salted boiling water and cook for 15-20 minutes.
Or add to soups and stews and cook for the same period or longer.

Description: 
There are many varieties of dumplings; the flour dumpling is the most popular in the Caribbean and the simplest to make. In Bermuda, most people call these sinkers because they don't rise to the top. I usually add a little sugar and sometimes parsley, but this is how a friend of mine does hers.
