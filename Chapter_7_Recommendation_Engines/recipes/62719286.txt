Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds beef tenderloin - cut into 2x1x1/2 inch strips
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
6 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup finely chopped shallots
2 cups shiitake mushrooms, sliced
1 cup chanterelle mushrooms, diced
1 cup beef broth
2 tablespoons Cognac
3/4 cup whipping cream
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
12 oounces wide egg noodles
1 tablespoon paprika (optional)

Directions:
Pat meat dry with paper towels.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat until very hot.  Working in batches, add meat in single layer and cook just until brown on outside, about 1 minute per side.  Transfer to baking sheet.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chopped shallots and saute until tender, scraping up bits, about 2 minutes.  Add mushrooms.  Sprinke with pepper and saute until liquid evaporates, about 12 minutes.  Add beef broth, then Cognac.  Simmer until liquid thickens, about 14 minutes.  Stir in cream and mustard.  Add meat and juice from pan.  Simmer over medium-low heat until meat is heated through but still medium-rare, about 2 minutes.  Stir in chopped dill.  Season with salt and pepper.
Cook noodles according to package directions.  Add remaining butter and toss.  Top noodles with beef mixture.  Sprinkle with paprika if desired.
