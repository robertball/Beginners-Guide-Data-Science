2 cups milk
2 bananas

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.

Description: 
Having vegan friends in college forced me to find some recipes that are friendly to their choice if I wanted to entertain. This recipe is delicious whether or not you are vegan. I've made it with almond, rice, soy, and regular milk and they are all very similar to identical in flavor and consistency.
