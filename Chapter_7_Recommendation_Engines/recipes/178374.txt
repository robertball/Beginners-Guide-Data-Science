Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 small head cabbage, cored and sliced thin
1 onion, thinly sliced
black pepper to taste
1 1/3 cups plain yogurt
2/3 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 cups flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
butter (optional)

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the cabbage and onion; cook and stir until the vegetables are soft and fragrant, about 10 minutes.  Season with pepper, and set pan aside to cool.
Whisk together the yogurt, milk, vegetable oil, and eggs in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside. Stir together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the wet mixture into the well, then stir until well combined. Fold the cooled cabbage and onions into the pancake batter.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and butter or oil if necessary. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side.
