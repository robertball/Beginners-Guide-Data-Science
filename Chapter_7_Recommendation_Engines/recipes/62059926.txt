Ingredients:
24oz package frozen hashbrown shreds, thawed
1/3 cup melted butter
1 1/4 cups pepper jack cheese, shredded
1 cup swiss cheese, shredded
1 cup smoked ham, diced
1/2 cup whole milk or half & half
2 large eggs
Season salt, to taste
1/4 teaspoon pepper
Crushed red pepper, to taste, if desired

Directions:
Thoroughly drain thawed hashbrowns.  Pressing between papertowels is helpful.  Fit hashbrowns into a well-greased 10-inch pie plate; forming an even, solid crust.  Brush crust with melted butter, making sure to brush top edge too.  Bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes.  Remove from oven and sprinkle with cheeses and ham; spreading evenly across crust. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Beat milk or half & half with eggs, salt, pepper and crushed red pepper (if using).  Pour egg mixture over the cheeses and ham.  Bake uncovered at the 350 degree temperature for 30 - 40 minutes or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean.
Buen Provecho!
