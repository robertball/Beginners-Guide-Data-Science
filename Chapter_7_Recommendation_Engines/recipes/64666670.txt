Ingredients:
8 frozen buttermilk biscuits, thawed (can use refrigerator biscuits as well)
1 [21 oz] can premium apple pie filling
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1 Tbsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/8 tsp nutmeg
1/4 cup walnut or pecan pieces [optional]
Glaze: [double if desired]
1/2 cup powdered sugar
2-3 Tbsp cream or half & half or 1-2 tsp whole milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Melt the butter, and brush on all sides of a 10-inch cast iron skillet.
In a bowl, mix together the brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg until blended.
Dip each biscuit in the butter, and sprinkle all sides with the cinnamon sugar mixture. Arrange side by side in the skillet.
Mix filling with vanilla.  Arrange over the biscuits.
Pour the remaining butter over all and sprinkle the remaining cinnamon-sugar on top.
Bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden and puffy.
Mix together the ingredients for the glaze. Drizzle on top.  Serve hot.

Description: 
These “easy as pie” apple pie biscuits are a weekend breakfast treat for my family.  The preparation is incredibly quick and simple.  I have made  these with canned biscuits, but, homemade is better, and if you have the time homemade filling  is better as well.  They’re good enough for company, or even as a dessert, for those who may not be inclined to bake from scratch.
