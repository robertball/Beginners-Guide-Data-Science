Ingredients:
20 pounds turkey
8 fresh rosemary sprigs (each 6 to 8 in. long), rinsed
6 cloves garlic, peeled
1 (8 ounce) onion, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
2 (5 ounce) lemons, rinsed and cut into 1-inch chunks
1/3 cup olive oil or melted butter
3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves
1 tablespoon shredded lemon peel
1 teaspoon coarse-ground pepper
Salt

Directions:
Remove and discard leg truss from turkey. Pull off and discard any lumps of fat. Remove giblets and neck (they're often packed in neck or body cavity) and save for gravy. Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry. Fill body cavity loosely with rosemary sprigs, garlic, onion, and lemons: if they don't all fit, tuck remaining into neck cavity. Fold skin flap under to hold in place. In a small bowl, mix olive oil, chopped rosemary, lemon peel, and pepper. Rub mixture all over turkey.
Place turkey, breast up, on a V-shaped rack in a 12- by 17-inch roasting pan (or one that is at least 2 in. longer and wider than the bird). Insert a meat thermometer straight down through thickest part of breast to the bone. (If using an instant-read thermometer, insert when checking temperature.)
Roast as directed in chart, 2 to 3 hours. Remove herbs and vegetables from cavities and discard.
Transfer turkey to a platter. Let stand in a warm place, uncovered, for 20 to 30 minutes, then carve.  If thigh joints are still pink (common in an oven-roasted bird), cut drumsticks from thighs, place thighs in a baking pan, and bake in a 450 degree oven until no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes, or put on a microwave-safe plate and cook in a microwave oven at full power (100%) for 1 to 3 minutes.
