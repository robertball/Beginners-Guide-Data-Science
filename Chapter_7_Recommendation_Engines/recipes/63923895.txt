Ingredients:
1 Tbsp fresh tarragon
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, about 8 oz each
2 inch piece of ginger root, peeled and finely chopped
3 Tbsp light soy sauce
1 Tbsp brown sugar
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 head cabbage
1 cup of other leafy greens (like baby kale)
1 cup unsalted cashews
2 large carrots, peeled and julienned
1 Tbsp sesame oil
salt and pepper

Directions:
Cut the chicken into small fine strips and place in a container for marinating.
Mix together tarragon, ginger, soy sauce, sugar, salt & pepper. Pour over chicken, refrigerate and allow to marinate for 2 - 4 hours.
Strain the chicken from the marinade, and stir-fry for over medium-high heat for about three minutes. Add marinade and boil for about 3 minutes to destroy any bacteria. Toss cashews & carrots with the chicken.
Prepare a bed of sliced cabbage and greens on four plates, drizzle a small amount of sesame oil over each. Place chicken, cashew, and carrot mixture on top of the cabbage and greens.
Serve & Enjoy.
