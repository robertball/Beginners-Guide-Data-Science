Ingredients:
24 Keebler® Toasteds® Buttercrisp, Onion, Sesame, Wheat or Reduced-Fat Wheat Crackers, finely crushed
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
1/3 cup Dijon mustard
3 tablespoons maple syrup or honey
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons melted butter or margarine (optional)

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to lowest position. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In small bowl, stir together crushed crackers and pecans. In separate small bowl, mix mustard, syrup, pepper and salt.
Pound each chicken breast between two sheets of plastic wrap to even thickness (about 3/4-inch). Dip chicken in mustard mixture, then in crumbs.  Place on oiled rack set over a large baking sheet. Drizzle with melted butter, if desired.
Roast on lowest oven rack for 25 to 30 minutes or until cooked through; cover with foil during last 10 minutes if chicken browns too quickly. Serve immediately.
