Ingredients:
8 eggs
2/3 cup milk
1/2 cup bottled pina colada drink mix
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed
12 (1/2 inch thick) slices French bread
2 bananas, sliced

Directions:
Whisk together the eggs, milk, and pina colada mix in a bowl. Heat a skillet over medium heat; melt butter in the skillet until the foam disappears. Soak the bread slices in the egg mixture, turning the slices over a couple of times.
Gently lay the soaked bread slices into the hot skillet 2 at a time and pan-fry until the french toast is golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer cooked french toast slices to a warmed platter while you finish cooking. Top each 2-slice serving with several slices of banana to serve.

Description: 
With just a few ingredients and little effort, this recipe makes a great summer breakfast. I created it while on holidays in Maui while making french toast for breakfast. I noticed the drink mix sitting on the counter from the night before and inspiration struck. Top with sliced bananas and maple syrup.
