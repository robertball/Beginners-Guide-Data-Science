Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon pepper, divided
1/2 cup half-and-half cream
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 pound ground beef
1 (4 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes

Directions:
In a saucepan, saute mushrooms in butter until softened. Stir in flour and 1/8 teaspoon pepper until blended. Gradually add the cream. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat and set aside.
In a bowl, combine the egg yolk, onion, 2 tablespoons mushroom sauce, salt and remaining pepper. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into two loaves. Separate crescent dough into two rectangles on a baking sheet. Seal perforations. Place meat loaf on each rectangle. Bring edges together and pinch to seal. Bake at 350 degrees F for 24-28 minutes or until a meat thermometer inserted into meat loaf reads 160 degrees F.
Meanwhile, warm remaining sauce over low heat; stir in parsley. Serve sauce with Wellingtons.
