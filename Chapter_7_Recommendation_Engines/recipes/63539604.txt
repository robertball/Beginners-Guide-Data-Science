Ingredients:
DOUGH
1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1/2 cup white sugar (115 grams)
2 1/2 teaspoons bread machine yeast
2 eggs, room temperature
1/3 cup butter, melted (75 grams)
1 teaspoon salt
4 1/2 - 5 cups bread flour (591 - 657 grams)
FILLING
1 cup brown sugar, packed (204 grams)
2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1/3 cup butter, softened (75 grams)
FROSTING
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened (85 grams)
1/4 cup butter, softened (57 grams)
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar (173 grams)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Put first three Dough ingredients into bowl of stand mixer fit with a dough hook. Allow to sit for 15 minutes.
Add next three ingredients; butter, salt and eggs. Mix for about 1 minute.
Add 4-1/2 bread flour and allow to mix for several minutes. If it still looks wet add additional flour. Finished dough should be smooth and slightly tacky.
Put dough into light butter bowl, flip over so both side are coated. Cover with a damp towel and allow dough to rise until nearly double in size. Punch dough down and allow to rise until double the original size.
After the dough has doubled in size turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
In a small bowl, combine butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. A food processer may be used.
Roll dough into a 16x24 inch rectangle. Spread dough with butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture.
Roll up dough and cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls, one of the cut side down, in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pan.
Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
While rolls are baking, beat together cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract and salt. Spread frosting on warm rolls before serving.
