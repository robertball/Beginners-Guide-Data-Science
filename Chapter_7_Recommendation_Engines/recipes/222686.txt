Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups bow-tie pasta (farfalle)
1 (5 ounce) can white tuna, drained, or more to taste
1 cucumber, cut into small pieces
1 1/2 cups ranch dressing, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and cool.
Mix tuna and cucumber together in a salad bowl; stir in cooked bow-tie pasta and ranch dressing. Chill at least 1 hour.

Description: 
A light pasta salad both adults and kids will love. This is my own creation I am sure many have already tried. You can add or take away from this recipe. I usually serve crowds of 10 to 20 people, but I love to entertain so I also always serve this, spinach dip, potato and green salad, chip with dip and wings... This dish is always a hit!
