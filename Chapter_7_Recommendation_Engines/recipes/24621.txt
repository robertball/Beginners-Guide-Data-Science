1 3/4 pounds beef sirloin steak
1/3 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons lemon juice

1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

2 tomatoes, sliced
1 small green bell pepper, sliced
1 carrot, sliced
1/2 cup sliced red onion
1/4 cup sliced pimento-stuffed green olives

Directions:

In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce.   Mix in the cheese.  Cover and place dressing in refrigerator.
Onto chilled plates arrange the lettuce, tomato, pepper, onion and olives.  Top with steak and drizzle with dressing.  Serve with crusty grilled French bread.  Enjoy!
