Ingredients:
1 ½ cups water
¾ cup quinoa
¼ teaspoon salt
2 cups broccoli florets
cooking spray
1 pound shredded rotisserie chicken
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of broccoli soup
1 ¼ cups shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
⅓ cup reduced-fat mayonnaise
2 tablespoons milk
½ teaspoon stevia powder
¼ teaspoon black pepper
1 dash freshly grated nutmeg
3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Rinse quinoa in a fine-mesh sieve until water runs clear. Combine 1 1/2 cups water, quinoa, and salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cover. Cook until tender, 18 to 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a shallow 8-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain.
Combine chicken, cream of broccoli soup, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, milk, stevia powder, pepper, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Stir in quinoa and broccoli. Spoon mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is bubbly and edges are golden, 35 to 40 minutes.
