Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound lean ground beef
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, chopped
1 cup green bell pepper, cut into thin matchsticks
1 cup red bell pepper, cut into thin matchsticks
2 cups matchstick-cut carrots
1 small head broccoli, cut into florets
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
salt and black pepper to taste
1 (15 ounce) can cut green beans, drained

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook the ground beef in the hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeno pepper, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, carrots, broccoli, apple cider vinegar, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, salt, and pepper to the pot. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are just losing their crispness, about 20 minutes. Stir in green beans about 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
My ex-husband grew up on the Pacific Rim and made this dish often. I'm going by memory, but I like this simple dish, and it's easy to clean up.
