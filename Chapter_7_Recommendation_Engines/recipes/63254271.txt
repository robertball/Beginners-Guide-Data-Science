Ingredients:
1 jalapeno, chopped and seeded if you don’t want it spicy
2 cloves garlic, chopped or crushed
1/4 cup fresh lime juice,1 or 2 large limes depending on how juicy they are
2 tsp balsamic vinegar
1/3 cup honey
1/4 tsp cumin
1 handful cilantro leaves, about a 1/4 cup…try not to use the stems it will make it taste soapy
Salt to taste, about 1/2 tsp
1/2 cup canola or olive oil

Directions:
Step 1: Place all ingredients except cilantro and oil in blender, pulse until well blended, add cilantro and pulse a few more times
Step 2: With blender on, slowly pour in oil until mixture maintains a dressing like consistency. (If using a food processor, start by pulsing the jalapeno and garlic before adding liquid.) Makes about 1 cup.
Serve: or over a salad, use as a marinade for chicken or come back for my next post and I’ll show you what I made with it.
