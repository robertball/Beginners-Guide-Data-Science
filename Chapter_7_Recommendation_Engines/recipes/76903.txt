Ingredients:
1 (1 ounce) packet dry au jus mix
1 pound thinly sliced roast beef
garlic powder to taste
salt and pepper to taste
1 (12 ounce) jar roasted red bell peppers, drained and sliced
8 ounces sliced extra sharp provolone cheese
4 torpedo rolls, split

Directions:
Preheat your oven's broiler. Prepare the au jus mix according to package directions. Add the sliced roast beef, and simmer until heated through.
Slice the rolls open, and place sliced side up on a baking sheet.  Divide the beef between the rolls evenly, placing a portion on each slice of roll. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Top with a single layer of roasted red peppers, then cover with slices of provolone cheese.
Place under the broiler, about 6 inches from the heat source. Broil until the cheese melts, and the edges of the rolls are lightly toasted. Place roll halves together to make sandwiches.
Pour leftover au jus into small cups for each person - I like to use custard cups. Serve with sandwiches for dipping.

Description: 
This is my family's favorite sandwich!  We like it served with a nice fresh Caesar salad.  Don't be intimidated by the extra sharp provolone's smell -  it's really awesome when melted into the sandwich!
