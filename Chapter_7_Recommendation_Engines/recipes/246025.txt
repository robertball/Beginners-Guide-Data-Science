Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) box BarillaÂ® Gluten Free Rotini
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 cup diced yellow onion
1 cup frozen peas, thawed
1 (10 ounce) package baby spinach
2 (6 ounce) tuna packed in oil, drained
2 cups heavy cream
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup Italian style gluten free bread crumbs
Salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to boil and pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Meanwhile, add half of the olive oil to a pan and saute onions over high heat until slightly translucent (about 4 minutes). Adjust the head to medium and add peas and spinach until the spinach is wilted, then add the cream.
Season with salt and pepper and bring to simmer. Gently fold in 2 cups of cheese.
Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions. Drain pasta and toss with sauce and tuna.
Place pasta in a 13 x 9 baking dish and top with gluten free bread crumbs, remaining olive oil, salt and pepper.
Bake at 400 degrees F until bread crumbs turn crispy and golden, about 10 minutes.
