Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package processed cheese food (such as Velveeta®)
2 tablespoons reduced-fat cream cheese
1 1/2 cups sour cream
1/2 cup cooked small shrimp
1/2 cup cooked crabmeat, flaked
1/2 cup cooked lobster, flaked
2 teaspoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 loaf (1/2-inch-thick) slices French bread, lightly toasted

Directions:
Combine processed cheese food, cream cheese, sour cream, shrimp, crab, and lobster in a crockpot. Cover and cook on Low heat until cheese is melted, about 1 hour, stirring occasionally to break up lumps. Once the cheese is melted, stir in seafood seasoning and Worcestershire sauce. Serve with French bread.
