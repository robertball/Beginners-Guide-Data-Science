Ingredients:
4 large zucchini
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
2 cloves garlic
1 / 4 teaspoon mustard powder
1 cup diced onion
1 fennel bulb, diced
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 tablespoon fresh thyme
2 tablespoons oat flour
1  1 / 4 cups chicken broth
1 (6 1 / 2-oz.) can pimiento
1 cup shredded mozzerella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Slice zucchini in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds, trying not to dig too deep into the flesh of the zucchini. Set zucchini skin side down on a baking sheet, drizzle with 2 teaspoons olive oil, and bake for 20 minutes.
In a medium skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Cook fennel seeds, garlic, and mustard powder in remaining olive oil for 1 minute, just to bring out the flavors. Add onion and fennel, and saut√© for 4 minutes. Add ground turkey, breaking large pieces apart with a flat wooden spoon.
Once turkey is crumbled, add thyme and sprinkle with flour, tossing to coat. Slowly pour chicken broth over the turkey mixture, stirring constantly, to create a sauce. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce heat to low.
Puree pimiento in a mini chopper and add to skillet. Cook 5 to 6 minutes, or until turkey is cooked through.
Remove zucchini from the oven. Spoon turkey mixture evenly into each roasted zucchini half, top with bread crumbs, and drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil over each. Place zucchini back into the oven, and bake 12 minutes or until steaming hot and bread crumbs are golden brown.
