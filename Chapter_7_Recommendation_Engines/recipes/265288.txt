Directions:
Grill hot dogs until browned and heated through, 5 to 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Grill buns, cut-side down, until lightly golden, about 1 minute.
Place hot dogs in buns and top with coleslaw and barbeque sauce. Drizzle with mustard.
