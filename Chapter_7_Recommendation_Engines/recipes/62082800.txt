Ingredients:
4 C. flour
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. cream of tartar
4 tsp. baking powder
1 C. lard
2 C. Buttermilk (sour milk may be used)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Mix dry ingredients together in order of recipe.  Cut lard in with a pastry blender. Sadie's advice - leave little chunks of lard in it (like peas).  Add buttermilk and stir in to form a moist elasticized dough.  Knead dough as little as possible.  On a floured surface, roll dough out about 1 inch thick and cut out biscuits with cookie cutter or round glass. Place on an ungreased pan. Do not let sit too long before baking.
Bake at 450 degrees 12 to 15 minutes.  Tops should be nicely browned.
