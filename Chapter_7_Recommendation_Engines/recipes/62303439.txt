Ingredients:
10 slices bacon, divided
2 lbs. ground turkey or beef
1 egg
1/2 c. breadcrumbs
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon italian seasoning
salt and pepper
6 slices luncheon ham
1/2 lb. swiss cheese slices

Directions:
Cook 6 slices of bacon (not crispy, leave a bit pliable) set aside.
Mix ground turkey, egg, breadcrumbs, garlic powder, italian seasoning and salt and pepper.  Set aside.
Lay the 4 remaining uncooked bacon slices lengthwise, side by side, on a piece of waxed paper.  Put meat mixture on top of uncooked bacon and spread evenly to make a rectangle approx. 10 x 14 inches.  Lay half the cheese slices on meat mixture leaving at least 1 inch on each side.  Lay the 6 slices cooked bacon widthwise on cheese.  Lay the 6 ham slices on top of bacon.  Lay the remaining cheese on top of ham.
Starting at on end, carefully begin rolling, lifting waxed paper as you go, tucking in the fillings as needed.  With your fingers, seal the seam and both ends so cheese doesn't seep out.  Place seam side down in foil lined baking pan.
Bake in 350 degree oven for 1 hour 10 minutes.  Carefully remove from pan and place on cooling rack.  Cover with foil and let rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving.
