Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups yellow lentils (moong dal)
13 cups water
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ghee
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 dash red pepper flakes, or to taste (optional)
2 tablespoons ghee
3 cups chopped spinach
2 teaspoons cumin seed
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste

Directions:
Rinse dal in a colander until water runs clear. Add to a large pot with water and bring to a full boil, about 5 minutes. Skim off any foam that forms, reduce heat, and add coriander, ginger, turmeric, and ghee. Boil gently for 2 hours.
Season soup with salt and red pepper flakes. Remove from heat and puree using a stick blender. Add spinach and return to a gentle boil over low heat.
Meanwhile, heat ghee in a small saucepan over high heat. Add cumin seeds and fry until brown, about 30 seconds. Turn off heat and immediately add cayenne pepper. Pour fried spices into the soup, cover, and let soak for about 5 minutes. Add lemon juice, stir, and serve.
