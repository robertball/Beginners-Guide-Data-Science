Ingredients:
3 cups chopped fresh rhubarb
1/2 cup white sugar, or to taste
2 tablespoons water
1 (3 ounce) package raspberry flavored Jell-OÂ® mix
1 cup cold water
1 cup chopped apple
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the rhubarb, sugar, and 2 tablespoons water. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 15 minutes, or until rhubarb is mushy. Mix well to form a sauce. Taste, and adjust sugar if needed. Reserve 1 cup. Save any extra for other uses.
In a medium bowl, stir together the raspberry flavored gelatin and 1 cup of the boiling hot rhubarb mixture until completely dissolved. Stir in 1 cup cold water, then mix in the apples and walnuts. Pour into a serving bowl, and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours, or until set. Garnish with whipped topping or creamy salad dressing before serving if you like.
