2 bananas, mashed
1/2 cups raisins

1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Set the slow cooker to low and add cubed bread pieces.
Whisk wet ingredients together.
Pour wet ingredients into the slow cooker with the bread, making sure each one is well incorporated and all the bread is coated.
