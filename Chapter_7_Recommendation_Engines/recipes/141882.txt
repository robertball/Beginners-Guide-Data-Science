Ingredients:
1/4 cup canola oil
1 1/2 cups white cornmeal
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/3 cups buttermilk
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a 9 inch cast iron skillet on the center rack.
When the skillet is hot, carefully remove the skillet from the oven. Pour the canola oil into the skillet and gently swirl the pan to coat the bottom and the sides. Return the pan to the oven for ten minutes.
While the oil is heating, mix together the cornmeal and salt in a medium bowl. Add the eggs and buttermilk and mix together to make a thin batter.
Carefully pull out the rack with the cast iron skillet and pour the batter into the preheated skillet.
Bake the corn pone until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. If desired, turn the oven to broil for the last few minutes of baking to brown the top.
Remove the skillet from the oven and shake the pan to loosen the corn pone from the skillet. Serve the corn pone warm from the skillet or turn out onto a plate.

Description: 
A bona fide Southern tradition! Authentic Southern corn pone is never sweet, and is baked in a cast iron skillet. Just like Grandma used to make!
