Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 small clove garlic, minced
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
1/4 cup bottled marinara sauce
1/2 (10.75 ounce) can water
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil, or more to taste
6 Italian-style seasoned croutons, or as needed
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute garlic in hot oil until tender and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir
Stir condensed tomato soup and marinara sauce into garlic; slowly add water. Mix oregano and black pepper into soup; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook until flavors blend, about 15 minutes. Stir basil into soup. Ladle into bowls and top with croutons and Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This tastes just like the tomato basil soup they serve at Applebee's®. The hubs loved it so that's saying something! I always add a pinch of sugar to tomato-based sauce, but I'm not sure that it needed it. Served it with baked fries with seasoned salt and grilled gouda cheese sandwiches on thick crusty bread, panini-style.
