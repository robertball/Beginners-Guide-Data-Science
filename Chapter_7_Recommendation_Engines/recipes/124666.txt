Ingredients:
12 whole chicken wings
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup butter or margarine, divided
2 tablespoons cooking oil
1/2 cup taco sauce
1/4 cup barbecue sauce
1/4 cup French salad dressing
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Directions:
Cut chicken wings into three sections; discard wing tips. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a skillet over medium heat, combine 2 tablespoons butter and oil. Fry chicken until brown, about 6-8 minutes on each side. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a saucepan, combine taco sauce, barbecue sauce, French dressing, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce and remaining butter; cook and stir over medium heat until butter is melted and sauce is blended. Pour 1/2 cup over the chicken wings. Bake, uncovered, at 300 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until chicken juices run clear. Serve with the remaining sauce.
