Ingredients:
10 cooked chicken breasts, cubed
2 cans cream of chicken soup
2 cups sour cream
1/2 cup white wine
2 rolls of crushed Ritz Crackers
1 stick of melted butter
Poppyseeds (use your own discretion)

Directions:
Heat oven to 350Â° F. Cut the cooked chicken into uniform squares, roughly bite size.
Mix sour cream, cream of chicken soup, and white wine together.
In a large glass baking dish (13x9), add chicken and pour liquid over chicken evenly.
Sprinkle crushed Ritz crackers and poppy seeds over mixture. The poppy seeds add a little color and texture to the dish, but are not mandatory.
Cook for 10 minutes, then pour melted butter over the crackers then cook for an additional 20 minutes.
Serve warm. Tastes even better the next day!
