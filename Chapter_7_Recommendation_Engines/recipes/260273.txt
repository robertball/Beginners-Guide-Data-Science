Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose baking mix (such as BisquickÂ®)
1/4 cup bran meal
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons ground flax seeds
1 tablespoon chia seeds
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup milk
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk baking mix, bran meal, sugar, flax seeds, chia seeds, and baking powder in a large bowl until well mixed.
Whisk milk, eggs, oil, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl until well combined.
Make a well in the center of the baking mix mixture; add egg mixture 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking well after each addition, until batter takes 1 to 2 seconds to fall off the whisk.
Heat a griddle over medium-high heat. Grease with butter. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle about 4 inches apart and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip gently and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
