Description: 
the recipe you are looking for is called foccacia bread.  There are several listed on this site.  Macaroni grill lets the customers dip the bread in olive oil with italian herbs in it.  The recipe I will give you is for a bread machine and my entire family loves it as much as Macaroni Grill's foccacia! If you don't have a bread machine, just mix the ingredients and let it rise twice before you bake it.
