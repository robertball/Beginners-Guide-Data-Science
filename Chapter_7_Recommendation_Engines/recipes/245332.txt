Ingredients:
2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts
water to cover
1 1/2 cups quinoa
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup chopped pecans
1 small butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as CraisinsÂ®)
1 (5.5 ounce) package crumbled goat cheese
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place chicken breasts in a saucepan; add water and bring to a boil. Lower heat to medium and simmer just until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove chicken breasts and set aside to cool, reserving water.
Measure 3 cups from reserved water and discard any remaining. Pour the 3 cups water back into saucepan. Add quinoa and bouillon; return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until water is absorbed and quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pecans and toss until fragrant and one shade darker, about 5 minutes. Remove pecans and set aside. Add butternut squash and 2 tablespoons water to the same skillet; cook and stir until just tender, adding more water if needed, 4 to 5 minutes.
Chop chicken breasts into 1/2-inch pieces.
Combine cooked quinoa, chicken, squash, and pecans in a bowl. Stir in cranberries, goat cheese, and parsley; season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This recipe is a recreation of a fabulous lunch I had at a favorite restaurant in the Milwaukee, WI area. My teenagers and husband loved it too! Serve warm or cold with balsamic vinaigrette.
