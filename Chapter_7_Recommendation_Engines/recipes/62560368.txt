Hungarian Potato Stew -- Paprikas Krumpli Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large onion, diced
1 1/2 tablespoons Hungarian paprika
6 large potatoes, diced 3/4 inch I like Red potatoes, but any will do.
1 large slice of Poblano or Anaheim pepper, cut lengthwise and amount added according to spicy taste
Seasoned salt and pepper, to taste
Water - enough to cover potatoes
Hot link sausages or hot sausages, or even hot dogs if you can't tolerate spicy foods
Optional: red pepper flakes to taste

Directions:
In a large saucepan, heat oil.
Saut√© the onions for 5 minutes.
Put all of the rest of the ingredients into the pot except for sausage, just barely covering the potatoes with water.
Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Loosely place lid on pot so that steam can come out. Avoid stirring as much as you can to keep the potatoes from breaking apart.
Cook for 30 minutes or until tender. In the last 10-15 minutes, add sausages cut into 1/4 inch slices and cook thoroughly.

Description: 
This hearty potato stew can be made in a snap and is a wonderful meal at any time of year.  We like it spicy in our family, so we use hot links and Poblano peppers.  Other families prefer a more tame Paprikas Krumpli and reduce the heat by using regular hot dogs (even vegetarian will work)! We love the broth, so I add more water but that is to taste. This is a very typical Hungarian family recipe and might be served as much as twice a month in nearly any home in Budapest. Serve with crusty bread and pickles.
