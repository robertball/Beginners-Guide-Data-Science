Ingredients:
5 pounds potatoes, peeled, cut into 2 inch chunks
3 hard-cooked eggs, peeled and finely diced
1/2 cup finely chopped dill pickle
2 cups mayonnaise
salt to taste

Directions:
Boil potatoes until soft, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove potatoes to a large bowl.
While the potatoes are still warm but not steaming, stir in the hard-cooked eggs with a fork. Mix in the dill pickle, then stir in the mayonnaise. Season to taste with salt. Continue to stir until potatoes are smashed and not many big chunks remain.

Description: 
Out of this world potato salad! My grandma made this for every occasion and now I have carried on with this tradition. I think that the goodness comes from the simplicity.
