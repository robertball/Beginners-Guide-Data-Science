Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package orange cake mix
1 (3 ounce) package orange flavored Jell-OÂ® mix
1 (1.5 ounce) envelope instant dessert topping
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup milk
4 eggs
2 cups sour cream
2 cups flaked coconut
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1/4 cup orange juice
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).Grease and flour two 9 inch round cake pans.
In a large bowl, mix together cake mix, flavored gelatin, and instant whipped topping. Add the oil, milk and eggs; mix for 3 minutes with an electric mixer. Spread evenly into the prepared pans.
Bake for 20 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cool cakes completely before removing from pans. Using a long serrated knife, split each layer in half horizontally.
To make the icing and filling:  In a medium bowl, stir together the sour cream, coconut, sugar and orange juice. Set 1 cup of this mixture aside. Use the remaining sour cream mixture for filling between the cake layers.
Fold the whipped topping into the reserved sour cream mixture, and frost the outside of the cake.

Description: 
This is my version of a very moist orange flavored cake, and  it is better the longer it sets before serving.
