Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 (10 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 onion, diced
1 pound lean ground beef
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3/4 cup milk, warmed
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef broth, warmed
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook mushrooms and onion in butter until onions are tender and mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes.
Crumble meat into pan, and season with dill; cook until meat has browned, about 4 to 5 minutes. Mix in flour, and then pour in broth and milk.  Simmer until sauce is bubbly and thick, about 2 to 3 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
