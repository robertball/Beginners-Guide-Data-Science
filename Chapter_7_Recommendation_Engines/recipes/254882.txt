Ingredients:
3 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon smoked Spanish paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
1 1/2 cups hard apple cider (such as Samuel SmithÂ®)
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can pinto beans, drained

Directions:
Place bacon in a large pot over medium-high heat; cook until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion; reduce heat to medium and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Increase heat to medium-high and add ground beef to the pot; cook and stir until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, and cayenne pepper; cook for 1 minute.
Pour diced tomatoes, apple cider, tomato sauce, and Worcestershire sauce into the pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until flavors combine, about 30 minutes.
Stir pinto beans into the pot. Simmer, uncovered, until beans are heated through, about 10 minutes.
