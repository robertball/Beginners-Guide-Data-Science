Ingredients:
2 tablespoons GOYA速 Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1 teaspoon GOYA速 Adobo with Pepper
1 teaspoon GOYA速 Minced Garlic
1/4 teaspoon GOYA速 Crushed Red Pepper
1 pound jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 large green and/or red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 lemon, cut into 8 slices
4 skewers

Directions:
In zip-top plastic bag, or plastic container with a lid, mix together oil, Adobo, garlic and pepper flakes. Add shrimp, tossing to combine; transfer to refrigerator. Chill shrimp at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes.
Remove shrimp from marinade; reserve any remaining liquid. Alternately thread peppers, shrimp and lemons on skewers, so that each skewer starts and ends with peppers and contains 4 shrimp pieces. Using pastry brush, brush reserved marinade onto shrimp and vegetables.
Prepare grill to medium-high heat, or heat a heavy-bottomed grill pan over medium-high heat. Place shrimp on hot surface and cook until shrimp turn pink and opaque, flipping once, 3 - 5 minutes.
