Ingredients:
1/2c butter or margarine
1c flour
3/4c sugar
2t baking powder
1/2t salt
3/4c milk
1 large (#2 size) peaches, undrained*

Directions:
Melt butter in round 3 quart casserole or 13 x 9 baking dish.  Mix flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Add milk and stir.  Pour over butter.  Place undrained peaches* over batter.   I sprinkle a cinnamon/sugar mixture over the top.  Bake at 350 for 45 minutes to 1 hr.
^I do not drain the peaches. I like the extra peachy-ness, but it's pretty goo-ey.  The recipe is not compromised, if you drain the peaches.
