Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups rolled oats
1 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 cup English toffee-flavored baking bits (such as HeathÂ®)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup butter
1 egg
1 cup persimmon puree
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk oats, flour, toffee bits, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves together in a bowl.
Beat brown sugar and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, 2 minutes. Beat in egg. Beat persimmon puree and vanilla into butter mixture.
Mix flour mixture into persimmon mixture until dough is just moistened and no streaks of flour or oats remain.  Drop spoonfuls of dough 1 1/2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until slightly browned on the edges, 8 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.

A great fall cookie but can really be enjoyed any time of the year if there's a supply of persimmon pulp in the freezer!
