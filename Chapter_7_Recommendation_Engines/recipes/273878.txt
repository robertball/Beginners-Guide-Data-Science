Ingredients:
1 medium eggplant, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 large tomato, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 (16 ounce) package fusilli pasta
1 (28 ounce) jar pasta sauce
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine eggplant, bell pepper, tomato, onion, celery, and garlic in a bowl. Season with basil, salt, and pepper and coat with olive oil. Place on a rimmed baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until just fork-tender, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drain pasta; combine with the roasted vegetables, pasta sauce, and 1/2 the mozzarella cheese in a casserole dish. Top with remaining cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling, about 20 minutes.
