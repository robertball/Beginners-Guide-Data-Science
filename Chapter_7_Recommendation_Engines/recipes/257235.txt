Ingredients:
1 cup white rice flour
3/4 cup teff flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup sweet rice flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips (such as Nestle速 Toll House速)
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine white rice flour, teff flour, cornstarch, sweet rice flour, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt in a bowl.
Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Slowly beat flour mixture into creamed butter mixture until dough is just mixed; fold in chocolate chips and walnuts. Drop dough by round spoonful onto the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, 9 to 11 minutes. Let stand for 2 to 3 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
These are a gluten-free version of the Toll House速 cookie recipe. My daughter was on a gluten-free diet for 3 years and in that time I converted many recipes. You can not tell the difference between these cookies and normal cookies.
