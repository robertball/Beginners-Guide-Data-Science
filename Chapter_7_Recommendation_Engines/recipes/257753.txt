Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can refried beans
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 pound frozen tail-off shrimp, thawed
1/2 cup sliced green bell pepper
1/2 cup sliced red bell pepper
1/2 cup sliced onion
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons fajita seasoning
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon pepper
1 (12 ounce) package crispy red tostada shells

Directions:
Mix refried beans and chili powder together in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until heated through, about 2 minutes. Cover to keep beans hot.
Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add shrimp, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and onion. Stir in soy sauce, fajita seasoning, and lemon pepper. Cook and stir until shrimp is evenly coated and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Bring shrimp mixture to the table in the hot skillet. Spread refried beans over tostada shells; pile shrimp mixture on top.

Description: 
This is a fun and tasty, easy-to-make recipe. Mexican fajita shrimp are served with a surprisingly crunchy tostada base! Timing is important with this recipe. You want your fajita mixture to sizzle when you serve, so make sure to prepare all your fixings (lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, and jalapeno peppers) before you cook the shrimp. Arrange fixings on a serving tray with shredded cheese and sour cream.
