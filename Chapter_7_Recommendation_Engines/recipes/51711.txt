Ingredients:
2 pounds potatoes, cubed
1/2 pound bacon
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 onion, sliced
2 cups sliced mushrooms
salt and pepper to taste
3 cups shredded American cheese
8 eggs

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook until tender but still firm, 12 to 15 minutes; drain.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Cut into small chunks; set aside.
Place potatoes into skillet, and cook on medium heat until browned. Flip potatoes occasionally to prevent sticking. Stir in green pepper, red pepper, onion, and mushrooms. Cook until vegetables are tender. Stir in cooked bacon, and season with salt and pepper. Cover with shredded cheese, and turn mixture until cheese is melted. Keep on low heat while cooking eggs.
Cook eggs to your preferred style. Place potatoes in a large serving dish, and top with eggs (2 per serving).
