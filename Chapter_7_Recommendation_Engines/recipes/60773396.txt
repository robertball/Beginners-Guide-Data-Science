1 large onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
2 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans, drained (undrained, or black beans, or mixture)
1 (46 fluid ounce) can tomato juice (not the whole can if you like thick chili)
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice (I'd use 2 cans and omit the juice)
1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree (the whole large can)
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1 tablespoon chili powder (or 1/4 cup plus 1 Tbsp added cumin)
