Ingredients:
1 calabash gourd, peeled and cut into cubes
1/2 cup split Bengal gram (chana dal)
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
3 cups water
2 tablespoons cooking oil
4 dried red chile peppers, broken into pieces
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon ground red pepper
salt to taste
1 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
Combine the calabash, chana dal, turmeric, and water in a pressure cooker. Seal the pressure cooker and cook at high pressure for about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer another 3 minutes. Remove from heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.
Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Fry the red chile peppers and cumin seeds until the seeds begin to splutter; add the ginger and garlic to the mixture and cook together 1 minute more. Stir the calabash mixture, ground red pepper, sugar, and salt into the mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook another 5 minutes before serving.

I first ate this curry at a friend's house in Delhi and loved it. It is a simple everyday curry. Serve with plain rice or hot phulkas.
