Ingredients:
1 pound bone-in beef shanks
1 pound boneless beef shanks
1 pound beef oxtail, cut into pieces (optional)
1 large onion, chopped
2 cups beef broth
2 large tomatoes, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 large potatoes, cut into chunks
1 yuca root - peeled, halved, and sliced
4 ears corn, cut into chunks
2 large carrots, cut into chunks
water to cover
2 cups chopped fresh cilantro
1 head cabbage, cut into chunks
5 zucchini, cut into chunks

Directions:
Combine bone-in beef shanks, boneless beef shanks, oxtail, and onion in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until beef is browned, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Stir beef broth, tomatoes, salt, and pepper into the pot. Simmer gently over medium heat, partially covered, until tomatoes break down, about 1 hour.
Stir potatoes, yucca, corn, and carrot into the pot carefully with a wooden spoon. Add cilantro. Pour in enough water to cover vegetables; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring carefully to avoiding mashing the vegetables, until potatoes are tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
Stir cabbage and zucchini into the pot. Simmer until zucchini is soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard bones before serving.
