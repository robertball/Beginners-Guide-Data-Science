Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
5 ripe bananas, or more to taste
2/3 cup coconut oil, melted
2 tablespoons coffee (optional)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
Mix flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.
Mash bananas to the consistency of oatmeal. Mix in coconut oil, coffee, and vanilla extract. Pour over flour mixture; stir together with a wooden spoon. Pour batter into the greased pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool for 20 minutes before slicing.
