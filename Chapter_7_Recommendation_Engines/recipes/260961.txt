Ingredients:
1/2 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
6 ounces thinly sliced salami

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Dust a flat work surface lightly with flour. Unroll puff pastry and roll out to a rectangle. Cover with salami slices, leaving a 1-inch border. Roll puff pastry up tightly like a jelly roll.
Slice puff pastry roll in 1/4-inch-thick slices and lay on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack until lightly browned and puffed up, 15 to 20 minutes.
