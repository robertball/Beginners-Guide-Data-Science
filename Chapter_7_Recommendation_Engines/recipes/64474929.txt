Ingredients:
1 Strip Steak (1 inch, boneless)
2 Cloves Garlic (smashed and finely chopped)
3 Sprigs Rosemary
2 Sprigs Thyme
4 Tablespoons EVOO
8 Tablespoons Butter
6 ounces Yellow New Potatoes (pre-boiled)
1 Lemon (zested)
Salt and Fresh Ground Pepper, Montreal Steak Seasoning, or your favorite seasonings

Directions:
Tie together 2 sprigs of Rosemary and Thyme with kitchen twine.
Preheat a cast iron pan over medium-heat. When hot, add 2 tablespoons of Olive Oil and 2 tablespoons of butter.
Season the Steak with Salt and Pepper (or Montreal Steak Seasoning, or your favorite seasoning) on both sides and add to the pan along with the garlic, 2 sprigs of Rosemary and Thyme.
Cook until Steak is seared, about 3-4 minutes. Add 2 more tablespoons of Butter and flip the Steak, basting with the aromatic Butter while the other side sears for 3-4 minutes or until steak is about 10 degrees below whatever temperature you like your steak (140 degrees for medium rare).
Remove from pan and let rest 10 minutes before slicing into 1/2-inch slices.
Smash pre-boiled new Potatoes with your hand to flatten.
Preheat a skillet over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of Olive Oil and 2 tablespoons of Butter. When hot, add the pressed Potatoes and the remaining sprig of Rosemary to the pan.  Season with Salt and Pepper.
Cook until the Potatoes are slightly caramelized on all sides. Remove Potatoes. Finish Potatoes with some Lemon Zest.
Serve Steak alongside Potatoes.
