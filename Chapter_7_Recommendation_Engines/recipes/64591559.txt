Ingredients:
1 lb (450 g) uncooked spaghetti
6 garlic cloves
2 pints grape tomatoes
1 tbsp (15 mL) olive oil
1 tsp (5 mL) salt, divided
1/2 tsp (2 mL) coarsely ground black pepper
1/2 cup (125 mL) loosely packed fresh basil leaves
Grated fresh Parmesan cheese (or nutritional yeast) (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Line large sheet pan with aluminum foil; set aside. Cook noodles according to package directions; drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, slice garlic. Combine garlic, tomatoes, oil, 1/2 tsp (2 mL) of the salt and pepper in a bowl; mix well. Arrange tomato mixture in a single layer over prepared pan.
Bake 14-16 minutes or until tomatoes burst. Remove pan from oven to a cooling rack; cool 5 minutes. Carefully transfer tomato mixture to food processor.
Add remaining 1/2 tsp (2 mL) salt and basil to food processor; cover and process until smooth. Combine noodles and sauce in a bowl; toss to coat. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.
