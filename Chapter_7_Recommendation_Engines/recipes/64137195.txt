Ingredients:
1 package yeast
3 cups bread flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon butter
8 ounces FLAT lager beer
1/4 cup chopped onions
8 ounces cheese (I use 4 oz Pepperjack & 4 oz Asiago)
2 jalape単o peppers, seeded

Directions:
1. Heat beer and butter together to 115 to 120 degrees. Any hotter will kill the yeast.
2. In this order add the following ingredients: Beer/Butter combo, sugar, salt, bread flour, yeast. (Create a pocket for the yeast in the bread flour and cover with flour.
3. Add 1/2 of the following ingredients: Cheese, onions, jalape単os.
4. Start your bread maker.
5. When the bread maker beeps about 30-40 minutes after starting add the remaining cheese, onions, and jalape単os.
6. After the baking is complete remove from the bread pan and let cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes. If you do not let it cool it will deform the loaf.
