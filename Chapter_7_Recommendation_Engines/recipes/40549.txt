Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta
1 pound mild Italian sausage, casings removed
2 (24 ounce) jars marinara sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil, divided
12 ounces ricotta cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, divided
1 dash salt and pepper
1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a large saucepan, heat marinara with 1 teaspoon basil until bubbling. In a medium bowl, mix together ricotta, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.
Spread bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish with sauce. Layer 1/2 of the ziti, 1/2, the sausage, 1/2 of the ricotta, and 1/2 the mozzarella. Spoon half of the sauce over top. Repeat layers. Sprinkle top with remaining 1/2 teaspoons basil and Italian seasoning.
