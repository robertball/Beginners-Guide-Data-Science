Ingredients:
4 bone-in, thick-cut pork loin chops (about 3 pounds)
2 teaspoons Archer Farms™ Steak Seasoning
1/4 cup Market Pantry Butter™, melted
1 small tomato, chopped
2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped
1 clove chopped garlic
1 dash salt

Directions:
Heat grill.
Rub pork chops all over with steak seasoning.  Grill, turning once, 12 to 16 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F.
Meanwhile, stir together remaining ingredients.  Butter may set if sauce cools to room temperature, making sauce cloudy.  If this happens, heat in microwave a few seconds at a time until butter just melts.

Description: 
Grilled bone-in chops deserve their reputation for flavor and juiciness, especially when served with a buttery tomato-basil sauce. For a smoky-good accompaniment, wrap a buttered baguette in foil and heat on the grill alongside the chops.
