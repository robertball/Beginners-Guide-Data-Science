Ingredients:
My family always asks for this to be cooked, so today I made one for lunch and one for tomorrow when I am at work, (dinner is Sprouts Rib Roast). I call this:
"Pasta Overload"
16 oz. bow tie pasta
8 full size meatballs cut in quarters
6 chicken strips (breaded or increased)
1 package meatballs
4 oz. cottage cheese
16 oz. ricotta cheese
8 oz. sour cream
4 oz Parmesan cheese (grated)
8 oz shredded mozzarella cheese
6 oz shredded cheddar cheese
1 chopped green pepper
1/4 yellow onion chopped
1/2 cup chopped fire roasted tomatoes.
Italian seasons
Garlic
Oil or butter
16 to 24 ounces of favorite or homemade pasta sauce.

Directions:
Boil water with pinch of garlic, teaspoon of oil or butter, pinch of Italian seasoning and a pinch of salt. Add pasta and cook until tender. Drain and set aside.
Fry quartered meatballs (basically a smaller ball) in a frying pan until thoroughly cooked. Set aside.
Chop and mix veggies in a bowl. Add diced tomatoes. Set aside.
Cut chicken strips into 1 inch pieces and either fry on stop top or bake in oven with garlic and Italian seasons. Ensure internal temperature is 165 to 180 degrees. Set aside.
Mix sour cream, cottage cheese, ricotta cheese, sour cream, 2 oz. Parmesan cheese,
8 pepperoni slices chopped, Italian seasons and garlic in a medium mixing bowl. Set aside.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees for approximately 14 minutes.
Use a large 9x13 baking dish (or two 8 inch round baking dishes). Layer each item as follows (not much different than a lasagna):
1. Approximately 1/3 of Pasta.
2. Approximately 1/2 of each meat.
3. Approximately 1/2 of veggie mix.
3. Approximately 1/2 of sour cream and cheese mix.
4. Approximately 4 to 6 ounces of pasta sauce.
5. Approximately 1 oz. of each cheese.
Repeat the layers one more time.
Add one last additional layer of pasta, the remaining pasta sauce, and then top with cheeses and spices.
Note: If using two 8 inch baking dishes or a combination of other size dishes, split ingredients to create the same layers in each dish.
Bake in 400 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes until internal temperature reaches approximately 160 degrees, then broil at 500 degrees for approximately 2 to 3 minutes (until cheese on top browns slightly).
Let cool and enjoy.
Caution: Eating too much will cause joy and possible food coma, but also bloating usually only matched by the food overload experienced on Thanksgiving!
