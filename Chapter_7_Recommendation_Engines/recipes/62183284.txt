Ingredients:
4 tablespoon butter
1 clove garlic, squeezed through a garlic press
4 tablespoons flour
4 cups whole milk, warmed slightly
1 chicken boullion cube
1/2 teaspoon salt (or more if needed)
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 cup grated parmesean cheese

Directions:
Start by warming the milk in the microwave for several minutes.  This will prevent any lumping when added to the butter and flour later.
Over medium heat, melt butter and add garlic.  Using a whisk, saute garlic for half a minute then add flour.  Whisk until smooth and cook for one minute.
Add warm milk and whisk quickly until smooth.  Add chicken boullion, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil and cook until thickened and creamy.  Lastly whisk in cheese and adjust the salt if needed.
If adding spinach, add at the very end with the cheese.
Pour over pasta and serve immediately.
