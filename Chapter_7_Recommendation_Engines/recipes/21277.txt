Ingredients:
2 cups dry black beans, soaked overnight
1 quart cold water, or as needed
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
5 cloves garlic, chopped
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1/2 cup white cooking wine
1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
In a medium stockpot, combine soaked beans (see Editor's Note), water, onion, green pepper, garlic, bay leaves, salt, cumin and oregano. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, until beans are tender, about 1 hour. Stir occasionally and add water as necessary so that the beans don't dry out or scorch.
When beans are tender, stir in wine, vinegar, and olive oil.
