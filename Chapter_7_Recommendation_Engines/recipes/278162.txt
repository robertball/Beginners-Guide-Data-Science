Ingredients:
3 pounds Fuji apples
2 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons unsweetened pectin
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Remove stems from apples and discard; wash. Peel and remove cores; reserve. Dice apples.
Place apples into a large microwave-safe dish and microwave for 20 minutes, stirring after 10 minutes.
At the same time, place peelings and cores into a pot with enough water to barely cover. Boil for 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove diced apples from the microwave and mash with a potato masher. Add sugar, pectin, ginger, and salt. Stir.
Pour cores, peelings, and liquid apple mixture into a Vitamix(R) and blend on high speed (8 or 9) until everything is well broken down to a thin applesauce consistency, 2 to 3 minutes.
Transfer the apple mixture to a deep skillet and bring to a rolling boil. Reduce heat and let simmer until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat, mix in lemon juice, and fill jars; clean the rims and seal.
