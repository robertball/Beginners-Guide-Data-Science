Ingredients:
10 Brussels sprouts
½ tsp salt
½ tsp garlic powder
½ tsp mustard powder
2 tbsp olive oil
(NOTE: Can use paprika, chili powder, cinnamon--be creative!)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Line a baking sheet with foil.
Rinse and dry the Brussels sprouts.
Trim the ends off of Brussels sprouts.
Gently separate the leaves of the sprouts and place in a large bowl. (TIP: Stop when you get to the small leaves at the core.)
In a small bowl, mix together the salt, garlic powder, and mustard powder.
Sprinkle the mixture (to taste) on the leaves and gently toss with hands. (TIP: Better to start with a light seasoning. Can add more after the next step.)
Drizzle olive oil over the seasoned leaves and gently toss with hands. (TIP: If you feel the seasoning, then you have added too much. Start with a little and can add a pinch more now, if desired.)
Evenly spread the seasoned leaves onto the prepared baking sheet.
Transfer to the preheated oven and bake (on the middle rack) for about 10 minutes.
You may want to finish the leaves under the broiler for a few seconds for maximum crispness. (TIP: Keep an eye on it. The chips can burn quickly!)
Place the chips in a bowl and enjoy with family and friends!
