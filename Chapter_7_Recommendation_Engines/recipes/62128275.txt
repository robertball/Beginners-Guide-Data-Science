4-5 medium red potatoes, scrubbed and diced

Directions:
In a large soup pot, over medium heat, saute the diced onion in the oil, with the stewing beef, until the onion is tender.
Fill the pot with water, to about 2 inches below the rim.
Add the spinach, potatoes, cloves, salt and pepper, and maggi, to taste.
Simmer on low until the potatoes are tender and the meat is well cooked.  Scoop out cloves.
Serve as is, or garnish with a bit of parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This is a family favourite that we received from a woman from the Dominican Republic.  It's a great way to eat spinach!  Very simple to prepare.  Tastes better the next day.
