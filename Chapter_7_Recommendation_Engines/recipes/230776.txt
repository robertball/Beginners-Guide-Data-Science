Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1 pinch salt
3 eggs, separated
1 1/2 cups milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Beat butter in a large bowl until smooth and creamy; stir sugar, flour, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt into butter. Beat egg yolks in a separate bowl until smooth; stir milk into egg yolks. Slowly mix egg yolk mixture into lemon mixture until thoroughly combined.
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Gently fold egg whites into batter. Spoon batter into 6 individual ramekins or souffle cups. Place filled cups into a large baking dish and pour enough hot water into dish to reach partway up the ramekins.
Bake in the preheated oven until desserts separate into a custard layer on bottom and a lightly browned sponge cake layer on top, about 45 minutes. Let stand about 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
My friend and neighbor Tracy made these for me because lemon desserts are my fav! It was amazing! There is a fluffy cake on top and a warm custard layer underneath! Yum! Turn out and serve with whipped cream or serve still in the dish. You can also bake this in one large souffle dish. Aunt Mariah likes to garnish with a thin slice of lemon.
