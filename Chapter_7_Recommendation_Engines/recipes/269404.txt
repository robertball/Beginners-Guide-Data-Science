Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter at room temperature
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons grated orange zest
1 teaspoon amaretto liqueur
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
3/4 cup sliced almonds, lightly toasted (optional)

Directions:
Combine butter, sugar, orange zest, amaretto, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl; beat using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. With mixer on low speed, add flour and mix until a dough starts to form. Mix in almonds using a spatula. Form dough into a log and freeze for 40 minutes, then place in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Shape dough into small balls and flatten slightly. Place balls 1-inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake until edges are golden, about 12 minutes.
Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
