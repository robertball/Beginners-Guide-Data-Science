Ingredients:
1 (3-4 lb) pork shoulder
2 teaspoons garlic, minced, dehydrated
2 teaspoons onions, minced, dehydrated

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, ground
1 teaspoon liquid smoke
1 liter Coca-Cola
1.5 cups bourbon
1 (20 ounce) bottle barbecue sauce

Directions:
1 Place roast in a 5 quart crock pot. Season with garlic, onion, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Add liquid smoke and pour in Coca-Cola & Bourbon.
2 Set Crock Pot on low heat and cook for 8-10 hours.
3 When ready to serve, remove roast from Crock Pot to a platter. Remove any bones and trim all fat. With a fork, begin "pulling" pork apart into thin shreds. Add barbecue sauce and fold into meat.
4
Serve pulled pork on a burger bun or on its own.

Note: If preparing this dish for a potluck, pour 1 cup of Crock Pot liquid into a measuring cup and discard the remainder. Then return pulled pork to Crock Pot, set on warm or low heat setting, add 1/2 cup of reserved liquid (to keep the meat from drying out) and cover until ready to serve. If the meat is in the Crock Pot for more than one hour, add more liquid as needed for moisture.
