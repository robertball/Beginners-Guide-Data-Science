2 1/2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Combine the ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sherry, sugar, garlic powder, and ginger in a microwave-safe coffee mug or glass measuring cup. Stir well with a fork and microwave on high for 1 minute. Stir again and set aside.
Let stand for 1 hour to allow the flavors to incorporate.

Description: 
I created this sauce in my own kitchen with ingredients I already had in my cupboard. The results are delicious and it has become a staple in my home. This recipe can easily be doubled. Try using it for dipping katsu chicken and egg rolls, or use it as a substitute for barbeque sauce. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
