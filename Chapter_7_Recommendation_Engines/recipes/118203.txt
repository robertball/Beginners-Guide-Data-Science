Ingredients:
1/2 cup apple juice concentrate
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 cup chopped fresh rosemary
8 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
3 (1 pound) pork tenderloin

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients; mix well. Set aside 1/3 cup; cover and refrigerate. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the pork and remaining marinade. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate overnight.
Drain and discard marinade from meat. Place meat in a roasting pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Pour the reserved marinade on top. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40 to 45 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite herb recipes and really showcases the rosemary. The tender pork also picks up a slightly sweet taste from apple juice concentrate.                              -Carolyn Scheider of Austin, Texas
