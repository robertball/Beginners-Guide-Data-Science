Ingredients:
2 cups sliced almonds
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup sunflower seeds
1/8 cup sesame seeds
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoons grass-fed butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1 cup raisins (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine almonds, pecans, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and sesame seeds in a bowl.
Heat honey and butter in a saucepan over low heat until butter is melted. Add vanilla extract, cinnamon, salt, cloves, and allspice. Stir together and remove from heat.
Pour honey mixture over the nut and seed mixture; mix well. Spread evenly over the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Let cool until granola crumbles easily. Add raisins after granola has cooled.
