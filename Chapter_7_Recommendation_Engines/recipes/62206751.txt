Ingredients:
1 unbaked 9-in. pie shell
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 large carrot, grated
1/2 cup celery tops and leaves, chopped
OR
1/2 cup chopped celery
1 (15 oz) can spinach, well-drained and squeezed dry
1 tsp freshly-ground pepper
1 tsp garlic salt
4 oz. shredded cheddar or jack cheese
1 cup plain yogurt
5 eggs
2 tsp dried parsley
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp dried marjoram
pinch of salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Have pie shell ready.
Heat a cast-iron skillet to medium heat, and add onions and garlic. Cook for one minute, then add grated carrot and celery and cook until celery stems are tender. Stir in spinach, garlic salt and pepper and then spread vegetable mixture in the bottom of the pie shell. Top with shredded cheese in an even layer.
In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, yogurt, parsley, oregano, thyme, marjoram and salt until well blended. Pour into pie shell on top of cheese.
Cover with foil, flexed upward so it doesn't touch the quiche; or cover with a second aluminum pie pan. Bake at 400 for 1 hour or until egg mixture has firmed up. Remove foil or pie pan and finish under broiler to desired brownness.
