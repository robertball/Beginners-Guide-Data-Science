Ingredients:
¼ cup ancho chili powder
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
½ teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon chipotle chili powder
⅔ cup canola oil, or more as needed
1 large lime, juiced
8  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Combine ancho chili powder, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and chipotle powder in a medium glass or ceramic bowl. Whisk in canola oil and lime juice until well combined; thin with additional canola oil if mixture seems too thick.
Arrange chicken in a glass or ceramic baking dish and pour the marinade over the chicken, covering it completely. Marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Arrange the chicken on the baking sheet; do not crowd. Discard any excess marinade.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 to 6 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe combines many of the spices that I grew up with and that have become a distinctive part of much of my cooking including dishes such as chili Colorado, posole, and Frontera(<sup>&trade;</sup>)-style carne asada. I would describe this dish as more Tex-Mex or New Mexican than Mexican. Serve on a bed of rice or slice thinly for use in tacos or to top a green salad.
