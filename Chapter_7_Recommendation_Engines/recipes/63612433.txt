Ingredients:
4 pork chops 1" thick
1 pint cherry tomatoes
1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons olive oil
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon minced fresh flat leaf parsley
1/2 medium onion, minced
1-2 minced garlic cloves
1/4 cup bourbon or whiskey (sub cider vinegar or broth)
3/4 cup beef or chicken broth
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Pat dry and season pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large skillet over medium high heat. Brown pork and almost cook through (about 120 degrees F). Remove and set aside.
If needed, add additional oil to pan. Turn heat back up to medium. Add onions and cook (deglazing pan) until translucent and tender, add garlic and cook 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Remove from pan, and set aside.
Add 1 t. oil to pan. Turn up heat to medium high. Add tomatoes to pan. Let them sear before turning. Continue in this manner until tomatoes start to crack open  and release their juices, and get soft, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle brown sugar over tomatoes and mix in well.
Add bourbon, and let simmer for about 2 minutes on high to cook off alcohol.
Add broth, onions and garlic. Bring to a high simmer until liquids are reduced by about half and tomatoes are completely soft. Turn heat down to a slow simmer, and add the pork chops and and their juices to the pan to finish cooking for about 3 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and serve immediately.
