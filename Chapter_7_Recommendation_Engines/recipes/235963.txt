Ingredients:
2 cups warm water (110 to 115 degrees F/43 to 46 degrees C)
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Whisk water, milk, brown sugar, honey, and 1/4 cup vegetable oil together in a bowl. Add whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, yeast, and salt; stir until dough holds together. Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth.
Pour 1 tablespoon vegetable oil into a bowl. Place dough into the bowl and turn to evenly coat with oil. Allow dough to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Punch dough and knead 4 to 5 times. Divide dough in half and form each half into a loaf. Place loaves into 9x5-inch loaf pans. Allow to rise until dough is about 1 inch above the pan, about 30 minutes.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly before slicing.

Description: 
This bread is great with butter and/or jam. I sometimes use sunflower oil in place of vegetable oil.
