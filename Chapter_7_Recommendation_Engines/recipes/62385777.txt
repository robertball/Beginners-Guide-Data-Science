Ingredients:
1 pound ground chicken
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1/2 cup of chop and squeezed spinach
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
4 ounces crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Mix the chicken, bread crumbs, egg, lemon juice, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, salt, pepper,  garlic and feta cheese together in a bowl; form the mixture into 5 patties.
Cook on the preheated grill until no longer pink on the inside and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
