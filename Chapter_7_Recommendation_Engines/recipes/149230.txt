Ingredients:
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Octoberfest Beer
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoningâ„¢
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 boneless pork loin chops, pounded thin
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup panko crumbs
2 eggs

Directions:
In large freezer bag, combine beer, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, Old Bay Seasoning(TM), salt, pepper, and pork chops.  Marinate for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  On a large plate, mix panko crumbs and Parmesan cheese.  In a shallow bowl, whisk eggs until creamy.  Remove pork chops from marinade. Dip each chop in egg, then press into crumb mixture to coat. Transfer chops to non-stick baking pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes on one side. Turn chops over and continue cooking for another 25 minutes.  Raise temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue cooking until pork chops  achieve an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) and the coating is crispy.
