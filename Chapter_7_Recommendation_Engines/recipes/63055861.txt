Ingredients:
1 20 oz can of Pineapple Chunks (drained)
1 12 oz can of Fruit Punch Concentrate
1-2 cups of Orange Juice (to taste)(I used Tangy Sunny D)
Add ice to fill blender (also to taste)

Directions:
Drain Pineapples and add into blender. Open fruit punch and pour into blender (works well if still slightly frozen) Add 1-2 cups of OJ to fill to liquids line or just above depending on how much you like. Add Ice to the top of the frozen line on blender. Blend on medium or high until ice is crushed into small slushy like pieces and fruit and juices are blended. Can be used right away but tends to melt faster if used right away, best if placed in the freezer for a couple hours.
