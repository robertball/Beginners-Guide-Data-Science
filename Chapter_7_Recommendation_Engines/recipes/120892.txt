1 cup sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

1 (15 ounce) can sliced peaches, drained and chopped

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the dry ingredients.  In another bowl, combine the eggs, oil and vanilla; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened (batter will be thick).  Fold in peaches.
Fill paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
