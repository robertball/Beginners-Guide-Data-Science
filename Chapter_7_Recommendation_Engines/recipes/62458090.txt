Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup quick cooking oats (uncooked)
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup salted peanuts, chopped
Topping:
1/2 cup caramel ice cream topping
1/2 cup salted peanuts, chopped
1 1/2 cups miniature marshmallows
3/4 cup milk chocolate chips

Directions:
1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2.  Combine all crust ingredients, except peanuts in a large bowl.  Beat at low speed until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Stir in the 1/4 cup peanuts.
3.  Press 1/4 of the crust mixture into the bottom of a greased 8 or 9-inch square baking pan.  Bake for 15 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.
4.  Meanwhile, place caramel topping in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high until warm (about 1 minute).
5.  Drizzle topping over hot, partially baked crust.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup peanuts, marshmallows and chocolate chips. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture.
6.  Continue baking for 15 to 20 minutes or until marshmallows are lightly browned.
7.  Cool completely and cut into bars.**

Description: 
This recipe was from a Land O Lakes cookbook my mother had while I was growing up.  I have been searching for years for this recipe and have finally found it!  Many fond memories come to mind making (and eating) these bars.  It is a fun recipe to make with children-helpers around.
