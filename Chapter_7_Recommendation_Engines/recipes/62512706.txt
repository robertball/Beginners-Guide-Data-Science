Ingredients:
1 - 1 1/4 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cubed 1" pieces
1 1/2 c. sliced carrots
1/2 c. frozen green peas
1/2 cup sliced celery
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup chopped onion
1/3 c. all-purpose flour
3/4 t. salt
1/4 t. black pepper
1/4 t. celery seed
1 3/4 c. chicken broth
2/3 c. milk
2 (9 inch)  unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
In a saucepan, combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery. Add water to cover and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain and set aside.
In the saucepan over medium heat, cook onions in butter until soft and translucent. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed. Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
Place the chicken mixture in bottom pie crust of a deep dish pie pan. Pour hot liquid mixture over. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Cover crust with foil first 10 minutes to avoid burning. Bake in the preheated oven on a baking sheet for 30 to 35 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 15-20 minutes before serving.
