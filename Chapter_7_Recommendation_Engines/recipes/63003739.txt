Ingredients:
4 green peppers
1 1/2 cups cooked long grain rice (3/4 cup uncooked)
1 lb of ground turkey
1 small onion, peeled and chopped
1 cup canned or fresh diced tomatoes
1 tsp salt or salt to taste
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 tbsp dried oregano
1/4 tsp  ground pepper
1 oz shredded mozzarella
1 oz feta cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Cut top off peppers and remove seeds, then add peppers to boiling water and cook for 3 minutes.
Cook ground turkey in pan and drain excess moisture and oil.
Add in onions, tomatoes, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper to ground turkey and cook until onions are translucent.
Remove ground turkey mixture from heat and then mix in cooked rice.
Arrange pepper cut side up in a baking dish, then stuff them with filling. Pack firmly in.
Cover hole with feta cheese, and then cover feta with shredded mozzarella.
Add about a 1/2 inch of water to the baking dish; the steam will keep the pepper moist in the oven.
Place in oven (preheated to 350 degrees F) and bake for about an hour.
