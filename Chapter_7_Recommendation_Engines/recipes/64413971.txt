Ingredients:
2 slices of bread
1 slice of cheese
1 hot dog

Directions:
Prepare hot dogs according to package directions.
Meanwhile, put the bread on the grill for a minute or two on each side.
Place the cheese slice on a second piece of bread.
When the hot dogs are ready, slice them down the center lengthwise, and then again horizontally. You will then have four pieces that should fit onto the bread next to one another.
Place the hot dog on the bread with cheese.
