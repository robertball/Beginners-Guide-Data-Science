Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 red onion, chopped
2 cups chicken stock
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1/2 cup fat free half-and-half
1 dash hot pepper sauce
1 pinch ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package goat cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock, pumpkin puree, and half-and-half. Season with hot pepper sauce, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has thickened, about 4 minutes. Toss goat cheese into pumpkin sauce and heat through. Serve over pasta.
