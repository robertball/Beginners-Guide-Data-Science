Ingredients:
4 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp. kosher salt
2 cups milk
1/4 cup reserved pan fat from roast beef or vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Sift flour and salt together.  In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until well blended. Whisk in the flour one cup at a time until frothy and well blended. Set aside.
Distribute the oil equally among 12 muffin cups, a little over a teaspoon per cup. Place in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes, until smoking. Remove from the oven and quickly ladle about 1/4 cup of batter into each cup.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven. Serve immediately. I turn my oven off and leave the door partially open with the yorkies inside to keep them from deflating while waiting for everyone to ask for seconds.
