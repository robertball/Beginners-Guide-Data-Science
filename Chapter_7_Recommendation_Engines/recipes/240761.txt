Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package rigatoni pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 pounds boneless chicken, cubed
Â¼ cup sliced fresh mushrooms, or more to taste
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (26 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1 pint half-and-half
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or to taste (optional)
1 (10 ounce) package fresh spinach, chopped
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (optional)
1 tablespoon shredded Parmesan cheese, or more to taste
8 leaves fresh basil, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate. Add mushrooms to skillet; saute until mushrooms are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; saute until fragrant and golden, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir spaghetti sauce, half-and-half, and Italian seasoning into mushroom mixture; cook and stir over medium heat until sauce thickens, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix cooked chicken and spinach into sauce and cook until spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes.
Stir pasta into sauce and add mozzarella cheese; stir until cheese melts. Garnish dish with Parmesan cheese and fresh basil.
