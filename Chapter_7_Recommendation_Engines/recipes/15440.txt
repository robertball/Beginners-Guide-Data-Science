Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons cream of tartar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a medium bowl, cream the butter with the white sugar and brown sugar. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, cinnamon and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, mix in the nuts. Divide dough into 3 equal parts, shape each piece into a log about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap logs in wax paper and chill for 3 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut dough logs into 1/4 inch slices and place them on an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until light brown.

Description: 
Once you prepare the dough, it can be saved (even frozen!) to be used later. Perfect for when your young student informs you he volunteered a dozen cookies ... tomorrow!
