Ingredients:
4 cups sour cream
1 1/2 cups milk, or more if needed
5 tablespoons semolina flour
1 egg
2 cups flour
Sugar, cinnamon and raisins for serving
Slices of fenalår, for serving

Directions:
Boil the sour cream over medium heat for 3 minutes in a covered pan. Whisk in half the flour and stir vigorously to avoid lumps.
Simmer, uncovered, for 5-10 minutes. At this point you can skim off any fat that's released to the top.
In the meantime, whisk the egg into the flour. Add the egg mixture, along with the semolina and the rest of the flour into the porridge.
Stir well to avoid lumps (you may want to switch to the wooden spoon)
Continue simmering and skim again if needed. You can add more milk to thin it out a little. Serve with a sprinkling of sugar, cinnamon and raisins and a side of fenalår.
