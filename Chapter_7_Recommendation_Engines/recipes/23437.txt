Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
3/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
3 tablespoons honey
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
2 cups diced cooked ham
1/2 cup honey barbecue sauce, divided
2 tablespoons butter
1 red onion, halved and thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained
2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/2 cup shredded Gouda cheese

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
Add the all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, honey, olive oil and salt to the yeast mixture; stir well to combine.  When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough out into a 14 inch diameter circle and place on a 14 inch pizza pan which has been lightly dusted with cornmeal or lightly oiled. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a small bowl, combine ham and 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce; set aside.
Melt butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat.  Saute onions and garlic in butter, stirring occasionally, until onions are brown and caramelized, about 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in ham and pineapple.
Spread remaining 6 tablespoons barbecue sauce over pizza dough.  Top with half of the cheeses.  Spread on ham mixture.  Top with remaining cheese.
Bake in heated oven for 15 to 18 minutes, until crust is lightly browned and cheese completely melted.  Let pizza sit for 5 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This is one of our favorite pizzas.  It's great with regular pizza sauce as well, but the barbecue gives it a delicious new twist which compliments the ham and pineapple perfectly.
