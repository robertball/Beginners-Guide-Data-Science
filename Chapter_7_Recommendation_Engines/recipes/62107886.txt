Description: 
Mayhaw jelly is considered the best jelly there is here in Louisiana. The small fruit that looks like tiny apples grows on trees, usually we lay a sheet on the ground and tap the limbs with a stick until the mayhaws fall on the sheet. Then collect them, about 3 pounds will give you the juice for a batch of jelly. The mayhaws are usually ready around the month of may.
