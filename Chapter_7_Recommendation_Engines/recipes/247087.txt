Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups walnuts
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 cups mashed overripe bananas, or more to taste
1/2 cup raw honey
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 cup plain yogurt
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted and cooled
2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread walnuts onto a baking sheet.
Toast in preheated oven until nuts start to turn golden brown and become fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Coarsely chop walnuts.
Place walnuts in a large bowl. Add whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg; mix until combined.
Mix mashed bananas, honey, eggs, yogurt, coconut oil, butter, and vanilla extract together in another large bowl. Add banana mixture to flour mixture, mixing with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until batter is just blended.
Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges and top are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes.
