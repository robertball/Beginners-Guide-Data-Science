Description: 
The name may sound strange, but I have been getting rave reviews when serving these meatballs at parties for over 10 years! Everyone who tries them, loves them! Similar recipes call for Chili sauce, but I have found Taco sauce to have better flavor. This will be one of the easiest recipes you will ever make. Give them a try...they are delicious!
