Description: 
Most everyone loves the taste of a salty sweet flavor. I have been using brine for years when making my turkey and chicken. I've tried this one or that one, but finally settled on taking the best elements of my 3 favorite ones to create my own with all the wonderful flavors of Thanksgiving.
