Ingredients:
3 cups peeled, cubed sweet potatoes
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup margarine, softened
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup margarine, melted
1 cup crushed pineapple, drained
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg, lightly beaten

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.
Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Mash sweet potatoes in a large bowl. Stir in the brown sugar, 1/4 cup softened margarine, 3 eggs, vanilla extract, and milk. Beat until  fluffy. Pour into prepared baking dish. Mix flour, 1/4 cup melted margarine, pineapple, white sugar, and 1 egg together in a bowl. Spoon over the sweet potato mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
My daughter requested a sweet potato souffle with pineapple on top similar to what her boyfriend's family makes.  This is what I came up with.  Now it is a holiday tradition in our family.
