Ingredients:
3/4 cup almonds
1/3 cup walnuts
4 cups rolled oats
1 cup chopped dried apricots
1 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup olive oil
1/3 cup apricot preserves
1/3 cup wheat germ
1/3 cup unsalted sunflower seeds
1/3 cup chia seeds
1/3 cup milled flax seeds
1/4 cup oat bran
1/4 cup black sesame seeds
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Spread almonds and walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast in the preheating oven until fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes.
Transfer almonds and walnuts to a very large bowl. Add oats, apricots, cranberries, honey, olive oil, apricot preserves, wheat germ, sunflower seeds, chia seeds, flax seeds, oat bran, black sesame seeds, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and nutmeg. Mix well with your hands.
Line the baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread granola mixture evenly across.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Stir the mixture; bake for 15 minutes more. Stir once again, then press the mixture down firmly. Return to the oven for 15 minutes more.
Let granola cool and dry for at least 2 hours. Crumble and transfer to an airtight container.
