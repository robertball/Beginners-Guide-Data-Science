Peanut Tofu Pasta Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
10 ounces spaghetti
1 cup water
Â½ cup crunchy peanut butter
4 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon crushed fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons peanut oil
1 pound tofu, diced
2  leeks, sliced into rounds
4  fresh Thai chiles, sliced into rounds (optional)
1 teaspoon sriracha sauce

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
Stir water, peanut butter, garlic, soy sauce, lemon juice, and ginger together in a bowl until smooth; set aside.
Heat peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry tofu in oil until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add leeks; cook and stir until the leeks soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir Thai chilies into the tofu mixture; toss to combine and cook until the chilies are hot, about 1 minute.
Remove skillet from heat. Add spaghetti and peanut butter sauce to the tofu mixture; toss until everything is evenly coated in sauce. Season with chile-garlic sauce to serve.

Description: 
Leeks are the secret ingredient that make this recipe really shine. I love it spicy, but this recipe can easily be tweaked to all spiciness tastes. Rice noodles can be used in place of spaghetti.
