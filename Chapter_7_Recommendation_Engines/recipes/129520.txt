Ingredients:
4 cups cubed fresh pumpkin
1 (10 ounce) potato, peeled and coarsely chopped
4 1/2 ounces fresh spinach, chopped
7 ounces crumbled feta cheese
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
8 eggs, lightly beaten
1 small red onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10-inch square baking dish and line it with parchment paper.
Place the pumpkin in a microwave-safe bowl; cover and cook in microwave on full power, stirring halfway through cooking time, until tender, about 5 minutes. Place the potato in a microwave-safe bowl; cover and cook in microwave on full power until tender enough to pierce with a fork, about 4 minutes.
Combine the pumpkin and potato in a large bowl. Add the spinach, feta cheese, Cheddar cheese, and eggs; stir. Transfer mixture to prepared dish; top with sliced onion.
Bake in preheated oven until firm, about 25 minutes. Allow to rest 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
In Australia, and some other overseas countries, pumpkin means squash. I like to use butternut squash because it's sweet. You can also substitute frozen egg whites for all those eggs and cut back on fat and calories. This would make a great brunch, but we like it for supper. It's even good cold.
