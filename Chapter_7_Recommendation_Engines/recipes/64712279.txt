Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, chopped
4 eggs
3/4 cup half and half
1 cup grated (or diced) Swiss cheese
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 1/2 cups chopped spinach
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp lemon pepper
Non stick spray

Directions:
In the instant pot, cook bacon on sauté mode until crisp. Remove bacon and allow grease to drain off.
Sauté the onion until browned. Remove the onion. Sauté the spinach. Remove the spinach and squeeze out excess liquid.
Clean out the instant pot liner.
In a medium bowl, beat eggs until yellow and frothy. Add half and half, vegetables, cheese, and seasonings to egg mixture. Add half of the cooked bacon to the egg mixture.
Spray stackable insert pans with non stick spray. Fill instant pot liner with 1/2 cup water. Divide mixture between stackable insert pans. Cover with lid and place inside water filled instant pot liner. Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes.
Once dish is cooked, remove from pans and add remaining chopped bacon on top.
If you don’t have an instant pot, you can cook this in a greased 9” pie plate at  350° for 30-35 minutes.

Description: 
The fresh bounty of vegetables at my local farmers market is the inspiration for this breakfast dish. This recipe uses a set of stackable stainless steel insert pans which can be found on Amazon. If you don’t have an instant pot it can be cooked in the oven.
