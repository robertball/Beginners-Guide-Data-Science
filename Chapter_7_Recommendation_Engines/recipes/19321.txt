Ingredients:
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic
1/4 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried basil
ground black pepper to taste
1 (29 ounce) can Italian-style stewed tomatoes, drained
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes
12 ounces angel hair pasta

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over low heat, warm oil and saute garlic; heat through until the garlic turns translucent, not brown. Add onion and cook over low heat until translucent; 5 to 10 minutes.
Add parsley, basil and ground black pepper; stir. Add tomatoes and cover; raise heat to medium and bring to a strong simmer. Lower heat and add red pepper flakes. Cover saucepan and cook for 25 to 35 minutes.
The sauce can be run in the food processor for 2 to 3 seconds to achieve a more uniform sauce or  let the sauce cook over medium-low heat uncovered for 10 minutes or until it thickens.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 6 to 8 minutes or until al dente; drain and serve with sauce.

Description: 
Plain, simple, no frills, basic red sauce that tastes great on a variety of pasta and is not watered down.  For making a good sauce, use canned tomatoes. Except for the summer months, the 'fresh' tomatoes are usually harvested when green and left a long time to ripen. Add more red pepper flakes if you like your sauce spicy!
