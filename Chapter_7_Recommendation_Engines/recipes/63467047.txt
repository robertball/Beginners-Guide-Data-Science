Ingredients:
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups cake flour , sifted
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup milk
1 Whoopie Pie Filling recipe
1/3 cup seedless raspberry jam

Directions:
Preheat oven 325Â°F. Lightly spray Whoopie Pie Pan with nonstick cooking spray.
In large bowl, beat butter and sugar with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg and vanilla; beat until well combined.
In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add half the dry ingredients into the butter mixture and mix on low speed. When dry ingredients are almost incorporated, stop the mixer and add the milk. Continue to mix on low speed until all ingredients are almost incorporated. Stop the mixer and add the remaining dry ingredients. Mix on low until just combined. Spoon 2 tablespoons of batter into each cavity; spread batter to the edges. Cavity should be about 2/3 full.
Bake for 11-13 minutes or until the top of the cake springs back when touched. Allow the cakes to cool in pan 8 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely before filling. To assemble pies, spread raspberry jam on one cake and filling on the other; sandwich together.
