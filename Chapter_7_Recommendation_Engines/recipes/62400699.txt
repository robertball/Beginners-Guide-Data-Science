Description: 
This is a wonderful sweet pickle recipe I got from my mother, who got it from a relative, who got it from a relative, and so on. It is very easy, a little time consuming, delicious, and makes a lot of pickles. The recipe says to put them in jars, but I just store them in a clean, gallon ice cream bucket.
