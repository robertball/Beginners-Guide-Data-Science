Ingredients:
1 pork tenderloin, about 1 lb.
3/4 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. crushed fennel seeds
1/2 tsp. ground cumin
2 tsp. sweet smoked paprika
1/4 cup toasted walnut pieces
1 garlic clove
1 jar (8 oz.) roasted red bell peppers, drained
4 1/2 Tbs. olive oil
1 Tbs. dry sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper

Directions:
Trim the fat and any silvery membrane from the pork tenderloin and cut into rounds 1/2 inch thick. In a small bowl, stir together 1/2 tsp. of the salt, the fennel seeds, cumin and 1/2 tsp. of the paprika. Rub the spice mixture into both sides of the pork loin rounds. Let stand at room temperature while you make the romesco.
In a blender or food processor, combine the walnuts and garlic and process until finely chopped. Add the bell peppers, 3 Tbs. of the olive oil, the vinegar, the remaining 1 1/2 tsp. paprika, the cayenne and the remaining 1/4 tsp. salt and process until smooth.
In a large fry pan over medium heat, warm the remaining 1 1/2 Tbs. olive oil. Working in batches if necessary, add the pork loin rounds to the pan in a single layer and cook, turning once, just until browned on both sides and still faintly pink in the center, about 2 minutes per side.
Transfer to individual plates and spoon the romesco on top. Serve immediately.
