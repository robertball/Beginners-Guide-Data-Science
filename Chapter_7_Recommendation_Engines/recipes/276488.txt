Ingredients:
2 (18 ounce) packages prepared polenta, divided
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound ground turkey
3 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 cup prepared salsa
3 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided
1 small tomato, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 3-quart glass casserole. Break up 1 tube polenta in the casserole and press evenly so it covers the bottom of the dish.
Slice remaining 1 tube polenta into enough thin slices to cover the top of the casserole; set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until glistening. Add onion and bell pepper and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds.
Lower heat to medium and stir in turkey, chili powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper. Cook and stir until turkey is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add black beans, drained tomatoes, and salsa and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes.
While turkey mixture is simmering, bake polenta crust in the preheated oven until firm, 7 to 10 minutes.
Remove polenta crust from the oven and sprinkle with 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese. Top with turkey mixture and lay sliced polenta on top.
Return to the oven and bake for 25 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 2 cups Monterey Jack and bake until bubbly, about 10 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with chopped tomato and cilantro.

Ground turkey, beans, polenta, and just the right seasonings make this dish amazing! My family devours this time and time again. I love the way the polenta makes a crust! Soooo good. I can't remember where the recipe came from but I have made it my own and perfected it. I know you will love it, too.
