Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; mix well.  Cream the butter, sugar and brown sugar in a mixer bowl until light and fluffy.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla.  Add the flour mixture gradually, mixing well after each addition.  Add the coconut and oats; mix well.  Add the cornflakes and butterscotch chips; mix well.  Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart onto a greased cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown and still chewy.  Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
