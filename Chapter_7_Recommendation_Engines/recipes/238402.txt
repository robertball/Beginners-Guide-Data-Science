Description: 
The idea for these grilled game hens is borrowed from my highly successful Cornell chicken experiments, and uses a similar acid/salt/oil/egg concoction. This time the part of egg is played by mayo. Needless to say, you can season this a million ways and use any combination of hot chilies, but the little kick the habanero adds is really nice.
