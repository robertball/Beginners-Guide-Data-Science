Ingredients:
10 Roma Tomatoes
2-3 jalapeno peppers (more for heat preference)
1 TBS lemon juice
1/2 large white onion, coarsely chopped
1 TBS chopped garlic
6 OZ broth (chicken or veggie)may not take all of it
1/4 c olive oil
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
2 Fresh Roma tomatoes (seeded and chopped)

Directions:
Heat oven to broil. Cut the 10 Roma tomatoes in half. Place on a foil lined baking sheet that has been sprayed with cooking oil. Lightly salt the tomatoes and broil for 45 to 60 minutes (yes you want them blackened). Add the jalapeno peppers to the broiler pan after 15 - 20 minutes.
While the tomato and peppers are blackening, add to a food processor the onion, garlic, lemon juice, oil and a small part of the broth, process until smooth and put into a bowl. When the tomato and peppers are done, put them in the processor and blend until smooth.
Add the tomato/ pepper mix to the onion mix. Stir in the cilantro and fresh tomato. If necessary add more broth.Add salt to taste.
Best served warm, but the flavors continue to blend. If you make ahead, warm a bit in the microwave. Delicious! Grab the chips and dig in.

My favorite Mexican spot had a wonderful warm dark salsa. It closed, so searching the internet I found this...It is worth the time and effort...
