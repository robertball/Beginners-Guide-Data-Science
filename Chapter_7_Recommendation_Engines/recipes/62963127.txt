Ingredients:
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons bread crumbs
1/4 cup smart balance light butter, softened
3 tablespoons olive oil reduced fat mayonnaise
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon celery salt
3 cloves fresh garlic, minced
4 tablespoons almond slivers, broken into small crumbs
1 pounds tilapia fillets
1 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning

Directions:
Preheat your oven's broiler. Line a broiling pan or with aluminum foil spray with olive oil spray or light coat with olive oil.
Saute garlic in a small amount of butter or olive oil.
In a small bowl, mix together the Parmesan cheese, sauteed garlic, bread crumbs, butter, mayonnaise, almonds and lemon juice. Season with dried basil, pepper, onion powder and celery salt. Mix well and set aside.
Arrange fillets in a single layer on the prepared pan. Cover pan with aluminum foil. Broil a few inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the fillets over, recover and broil for a couple more minutes. Remove the fillets from the oven and cover them with the Parmesan cheese mixture on the top side. Broil for 2 more minutes or until the topping is browned and fish flakes easily with a fork. Be careful not to over cook the fish.
