Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups raw cleaned whole pumpkin seeds
1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
1 tablespoon bacon grease
3/4 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring
1 1/2 tablespoons cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 tablespoon garlic salt
salt to taste

Directions:
Place the pumpkin seeds in a container with a lid, and mix in the Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, bacon grease, and liquid smoke flavoring. Cover the container, and allow to stand overnight.
Preheat the oven's broiler, and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Remove the seeds from the flavorings with a slotted spoon, and transfer into a bowl. Mix the cayenne pepper and garlic salt into the seeds, and stir to coat well. Spread the seeds over a baking sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle with additional salt.
Roast the seeds under the broiler until toasted and golden brown, about 8 minutes; turn the seeds over twice during broiling. Cool to room temperature.
