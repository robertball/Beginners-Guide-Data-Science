Ingredients:
1 pound smoked bacon (or use regular bacon and liquid smoke)
3-4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 medium onion sliced
3 tablespoons brown sugar
Tabasco sauce (according to taste)
1 cup brewed coffee
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup maple syrup
Black pepper to taste
extra water as needed

Directions:
In a non stick pan, fry the bacon in batches until lightly browned and beginning to crisp. Using a pair of scissors cut into 1 inch pieces.
Fry the onion and garlic in the rendered bacon fat on medium heat until translucent.
Transfer the bacon, onion and garlic into a heavy based cast iron pot and add the rest of the ingredients except for the water. Simmer for 2 hours adding 1/4 of a cup of water every 25-30 minutes or so and stirring. (you can use a crock pot as well but you will need to allow for more time)
When ready, cool for about 15-20 minutes and then place in a food processor. Pulse for 2-3 seconds so that you leave some texture to the “jam” or of course you could keep whizzing and make it a smoother and more paste like.
