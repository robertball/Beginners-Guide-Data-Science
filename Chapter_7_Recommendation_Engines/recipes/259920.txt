Ingredients:
10 pineapple rings in juice
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 cup salted butter, melted
2/3 cup white sugar
2 large eggs
1/2 cup coconut cream
1/4 cup whole milk
1 tablespoon coconut extract
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Base:
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup butter, melted
10 maraschino cherries
Whipped Topping:
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup pineapple juice
3 tablespoons coconut cream
1 tablespoon coconut extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 10 mini cake molds.
Drain pineapple rings, reserving 1/4 cup juice.
Combine flour and baking powder in a small bowl.
Combine 3/4 cup melted butter and white sugar in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended, about 3 minutes. Add eggs one at a time. Mix in reserved 1/4 cup pineapple juice, 1/2 cup coconut cream, milk, 1 tablespoon coconut extract, and vanilla extract. Add flour mixture gradually, mixing until batter is smooth.
Mix brown sugar and 1/3 cup melted butter together in a bowl until smooth. Spoon into the bottom of the cake molds. Place 1 pineapple ring in each mold. Place 1 maraschino cherry in the center of each ring.
Divide batter among cake molds using an ice cream scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Run a knife around the rims to loosen cakes; invert gently onto a plate.
Pour heavy cream into a chilled metal bowl. Add cream of tartar. Beat with an electric mixer until almost holding peaks. Add confectioners' sugar gradually, continuing to beat until soft peaks form. Fold in 1/4 pineapple juice, 3 tablespoons coconut cream, and 1 tablespoon coconut extract.
Serve whipped cream alongside cakes.
