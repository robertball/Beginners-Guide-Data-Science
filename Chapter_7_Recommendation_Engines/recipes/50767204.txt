Ingredients:
1 (1.5 ounce) package taco seasoning mix - low sodium
1 large can enchilada sauce
1 onion, chopped
1/2 red pepper, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup cooked rice (leftover works well)
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
chicken broth
1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese (or mozerella)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large skillet, brown the onion, red pepper and garlic in olive oil.  Mix in taco seasoning, rice and beans.  Moisten to smooth consistency with chicken broth.
Dip enough corn tortillas to cover the bottom of a 3 quart casserole dish in the remaining enchilada sauce. Arrange tortillas in the dish. Spoon in half of the rice/bean mixture, covering the tortillas. Spread half of the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses over the rice/beans. Cover with another layer tortillas dipped in enchilada sauce. Spoon in remaining rice/bean mixture and top with a final layer of tortillas dipped in enchilada sauce. Pour any remaining sauce over the layers and top with remaining cheese.
Cover and bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
