Ingredients:
1 c mung dal
5 T ghee
1 tsp cumin
1/4 c onion, minced
1 T ginger paste
1/2 tsp red chili pepper, ground
3/4 tsp amchur powder (ground dried mango)
1/2 tsp salt
1 c water
2 T chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Measure out all ingredients and so they're right at hand as you need them.
Soak the dal in a bowl covered by 2" of water for 2 hours.
Heat 2 T of ghee in a med size saucepan over med-high heat.  Add minced onions and fry, stirring, until they start to brown (about 10 mins).
Add ginger, ground chili, and turmeric and fry a couple minutes to release the full flavor of the spices.
Drain the soaked beans and add to the spices and onion.  Sprinkle the salt and amchur powder, then add 1 c water and bring to a boil.
Lower the heat and simmer, partly covered, for 15 to 20 minutes, then fully cover and cook another 5 or 10 mins.  Watch and stir occasionally to make sure it doesn't stick or cook dry.
Stir in the rest of the ghee and finish cooking the dal until it's fully cooked and soft.
Stir in the cilantro and serve with rice.
