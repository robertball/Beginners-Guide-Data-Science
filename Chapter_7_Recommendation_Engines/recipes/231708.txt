Ingredients:
1 whole wheat pizza crust
1 (4 ounce) jar basil pesto
1/2 cup artichoke hearts, drained and pulled apart
2 tablespoons chopped kalamata olives
2 tablespoons sliced pepperoncini, drained
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place pizza crust onto a floured work surface and spread with pesto. Arrange artichoke heart pieces over pesto; scatter kalamata olives and pepperoncini slices over pizza. Top with feta cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is crisp on the bottom and feta cheese has melted, 10 to 12 minutes.
