Ingredients:
Cake
1/2	cup  buttermilk , room temperature
4	large  eggs , room temperature
2	teaspoons  vanilla extract
2 1/4	cups  all-purpose flour
1 1/2	cups  granulated sugar
1 1/2	teaspoons  baking powder
1/2	teaspoon  baking soda
3/4	teaspoon  salt
16	tablespoons (2 sticks)  unsalted butter , cut into 16 pieces and softened
Frosting
12	tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks)  unsalted butter , cut into 12 pieces and softened
2	cups  packed dark brown sugar
1/2	teaspoon  salt
1/2	cup  heavy cream
1	teaspoon  vanilla extract
2 1/2	cups  Confectioners' sugar , sifted

Directions:
1. For the cake layers: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans. Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla in large measuring cup. With electric mixer on low speed, mix flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until combined. Beat in butter, 1 piece at a time, until only pea-sized pieces remain. Pour in half of buttermilk mixture and beat over medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Slowly add remaining buttermilk mixture to bowl and beat until incorporated, about 15 seconds.
2. Scrape equal amounts of batter into prepared pans and bake until golden and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool cakes in pans 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks. Cool completely, at least 1 hour.
3. For the frosting: Heat 8 tablespoons butter, brown sugar, and salt in large saucepan over medium heat until small bubbles appear around perimeter of pan (see photo at left), 4 to 8 minutes. Whisk in cream and cook until ring of bubbles reappears, about 1 minute. Off heat, whisk in vanilla.
4. Transfer hot frosting mixture to bowl and, with electric mixer on low speed, gradually mix in confectioners’ sugar until incorporated. Increase speed to medium and beat until frosting is pale brown and just warm, about 5 minutes. Add remaining butter, 1 piece at a time, and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
5. To assemble: Place 1 cake round on serving platter. Spread ¾ cup frosting over cake, then top with second cake round. Spread remaining frosting evenly over top and sides of cake. Serve.

Description: 
This Southern favorite boasts rich, toffee-flavored frosting spread over yellow cake layers, but the best partthe caramel frosting that develops a thin, crystalline crust on its exterioris notoriously troublesome to make. We wanted an easier, foolproof caramel icing that would stay creamy long enough to frost a two-layer cake.
