Ingredients:
1 1/2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (100 to 110 degrees)
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon butter, room temperature
1 tablespoon dry milk powder
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 egg, beaten
4 onions, thinly sliced
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water with 1 tablespoon of sugar. Combine 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon butter, 1 tablespoon powdered milk, and 2 cups all purpose flour. Stir in beaten egg and proofed yeast water. Mix and knead for 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed.
Transfer dough to a greased bowl and cover with greased plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more. Stir in red pepper.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.
Transfer dough to a floured work surface. Pat it into a rectangle; allow dough to rest, covered with greased plastic wrap, for about 10 minutes. Roll dough into a larger rectangle about 1/2-inch thick. Evenly spread onions on dough; roll up from the short end to form a log. With a sharp knife, slice into pinwheels.
Place rolls on prepared baking sheet; let rise a second time, about 30 minutes. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
