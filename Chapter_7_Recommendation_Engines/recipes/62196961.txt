Ingredients:
8 slice(s) (1-inch-thick) ciabatta, from a 12-ounce loaf cut into large chunks
5 tablespoon(s) extra-virgin olive oil
2 pint(s) grape tomatoes, halved
2 large garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoon(s) salted capers, rinsed and coarsely chopped
1 lemon, halved lengthwise and very thinly sliced
1/4 cup(s) chopped flat-leaf parsley
1/2 teaspoon(s) crushed red pepper
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
2 pound(s) center-cut skinless salmon fillet, cut into 2-inch chunks

Directions:
1.Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. In a large roasting pan, toss the ciabatta chunks with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Roast for about 5 minutes, until the bread is lightly toasted.
2.In a large bowl, toss the tomato halves with the garlic, capers, lemon, parsley, crushed red pepper, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Stir the tomatoes into the toasted bread. Roast for 10 to 12 minutes, until the tomatoes begin to soften and break down.
3.Meanwhile, in the same bowl, toss the salmon with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Nestle the salmon into the bread and tomatoes, spooning some of the tomatoes on top. Roast for about 6 minutes, until the salmon is just cooked through. Serve right away.
