Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup butter
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1 egg
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Mix flour, soda and salt. Cream 1/4 cup butter or margarine. Gradually add sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Add corn syrup and egg. Blend well.
Stir in flour mixture, coconut and vanilla. Drop by half teaspoonfuls onto greased backing sheets, leaving 2 inches between. Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) about 10 minutes. Cool on baking sheets 1 minute, remove quickly and finish cooling on racks (if wafer hardens, return briefly to oven).
Melt chocolate and 1 tablespoon butter in pan over very low heat, stirring constantly until smooth.  Drizzle over cookies.  Enjoy!
