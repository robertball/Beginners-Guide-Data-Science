Ingredients:
2 giant dark chocolate bars (approx 400g)
1 10oz bag of mini marshmallows
1 5 oz container of fresh baby kale

Directions:
Line baking sheet with waxed paper and set aside.
Finely chop up the kale and set aside. (I used my ninja electronic chopper because it makes things extra fine which is the desired result.)
Break up the chocolate into pieces, place them into a heatproof bowl and place the bowl on top of a small pan of simmering water, stirring frequently until the chocolate is melted.
When the chocolate is melted, turn the heat off and then add the kale to the chocolate, stirring it until it is well mixed together.
After the chocolate mixture is well blended, pour it onto the baking sheet and flatten it out with a spoon making sure it covers the entire bottom of the baking sheet.
Spread the mini marshmallows on top of the chocolate mixture, pushing them down with the spoon to ensure that they are well immersed into the mixture.
Place the baking sheet into the freezer for 20 minutes or until the chocolate has hardened.
Take the baking sheet out of the freezer, cut into pieces and serve.
