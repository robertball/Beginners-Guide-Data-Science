Ingredients:
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons powdered chocolate drink mix (such as Nesquik®)
1 pouch whipped cream stabilizer (such as Dr. Oetker® Whip It) (optional)

Directions:
Pour cream into a small bowl. Beat vanilla extract, confectioners' sugar, chocolate drink mix, and whipped cream stabilizer into cream with an electric mixer on high until soft but firm peaks form. Lift your beater straight up: the whipped topping will form soft, pointed peaks.

Description: 
I came up with recipe to wow my husband around our anniversary. Was looking for a sweet chocolate whipped topping that didn't taste chalky. This worked in my favor and it's been super secret until now. Top your favorite dessert item and store unused portion in the refrigerator in a covered dish. Enjoy.
