Ingredients:
1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak, cut into portion sized pieces
1/2 cup liquid amino acids (such as BraggÂ®)
3 tablespoons sesame oil
3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
2 large cloves garlic, grated
1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated

Directions:
Place steak into a thick resealable bag. Close bag and pound steak until it is about 3/4-inch thick. Remove from bag and score steak in a diamond pattern, cutting 3/4 of the way through the steak.
Combine liquid aminos, sesame oil, sesame seeds, garlic, and ginger in a shallow dish; stir to combine. Place steak into the marinade and turn to coat. Marinate for 8 hours in the refrigerator, turning occasionally.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Grill steak on the hot grill, cut side down, about 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.

Description: 
This fairly simple marinade produces a very tender, juicy grilled steak. I always double the recipe and put one in the freezer for another day.
