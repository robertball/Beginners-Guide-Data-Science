Ingredients:
4 (5 ounce) salmon fillets
5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided
3/4 teaspoon dried dill weed
3/4 teaspoon lemon pepper
10 tablespoons butter, divided
1 shallot, minced
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
5 tablespoons white wine, divided
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon dill weed
1 teaspoon parsley
1 teaspoon dried thyme
salt and white pepper to taste

Directions:
Place salmon in a shallow dish, and rub with 3 tablespoons lemon juice. Season with dill weed and lemon pepper. Cover, and allow to stand 10 to 15 minutes.
Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat, and saute shallot 2 minutes, until tender. Mix in remaining lemon juice, vinegar, and 1/4 cup wine. Simmer until reduced by at least 1/2. Stir in cream and milk. Season with dill, parsley, thyme, salt, and white pepper. Cook and stir until thickened. Whisk in 1/4 cup butter. Set aside and keep warm.
Heat remaining 1/4 cup butter in a skillet over medium heat. Place salmon in the skillet, skin side up, and cook 1 to 2 minutes, until seared. Set salmon aside. Deglaze the skillet with remaining 1 tablespoon wine, then mix in the cream sauce. Return salmon to the skillet, and cook 8 minutes in the sauce, or until easily flaked with a fork. Serve with the sauce.
