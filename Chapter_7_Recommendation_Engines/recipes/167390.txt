Ingredients:
5 lemons, juiced
1 tablespoon sea salt
3 large cloves garlic, minced
2 (8 ounce) fillets catfish
2 tablespoons lemon pepper seasoning (such as McCormick®)
2 tablespoons garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash®)
1 1/2 teaspoons Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®) (optional)
1 lemon, thinly sliced
1/4 cup shredded carrot
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 lemon, quartered

Directions:
Pour the juice of 5 lemons into a glass bowl; whisk in the sea salt and garlic. Add the catfish fillets, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 1 to 4 hours.
Preheat the oven's broiler for 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and set the oven rack to the lowest position.
Remove the catfish fillets from the marinade, and shake off excess; discard the remaining marinade. Place the fillets on a broiling pan; sprinkle with the lemon pepper seasoning, garlic and herb seasoning, and Creole seasoning. Arrange the lemon slices over the fillets.
Broil in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes. You may wish to turn the broiler on fully for the last few minutes if you like the edges of the fish blackened. Sprinkle the fillets with shredded carrot and parsley to garnish. Serve with lemon wedges on the side.
