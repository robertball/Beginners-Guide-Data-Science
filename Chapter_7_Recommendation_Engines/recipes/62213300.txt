Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter (1 stick), softened
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
48 miniature or "Fun-Sized" Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, unwrapped

Directions:
1. Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. In a large bowl, beat butter and peanut butter together until well combined, then cream with brown sugar and white sugar.
3. Add egg and vanilla until well incorporated.
4. Mix in flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt (at same time) with the butter mixture until dough forms.
5. If dough is not easy to work with, refrigerate until firm.
6. Form dough into 1-inch sized balls and place on an ungreased cookie sheet; bake for 8-10 minutes or until the bottoms of the cookies are light brown.
7. Right when the cookies are done in the oven, place one peanut butter cup in the center until the cookie flattens out a bit; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
