Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 (13.8 ounce) package prepared pizza dough
1/2 cup ajvar spread, or more to taste
1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
10 pickled hot pepper slices (optional)
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 large tomato, halved and sliced into thin wedges
salt

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with oil.
Stretch pizza dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread evenly with ajvar. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese, hot pepper slices, basil, and oregano on top.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add tomato slices and cook until lightly browned, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the tomato skins. Arrange the tomatoes on the pizza and sprinkle with salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until the mozzarella cheese is fully melted and bubbly, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool for a few minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This is a pizza that I randomly whipped up one night. It uses ajvar, a spicy Macedonian red pepper and eggplant spread that can be found in some grocery stores. The searing of the fresh tomatoes makes them easier to peel and prevents a watery pizza. I recommend using the wheat bran thick-crust pizza dough that I have also submitted, but whatever dough you usually use is fine.
