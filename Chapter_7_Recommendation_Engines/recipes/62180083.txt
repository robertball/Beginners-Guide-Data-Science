Description: 
Pies were an evrey day treat in Riley's time, and they are mentioned frequently in his poetry. When fresh fruit was unavailable for filling, home dried or canned fruit was used. When that was unavailable, people made custard and and sugar cream pie. Sugar cream pie has an enthuiastic following in Central Indiana to this day. This recipe is from a reastaurant that was once a way station for Pony Express, and has been a favorite for a few genartions in our family.
