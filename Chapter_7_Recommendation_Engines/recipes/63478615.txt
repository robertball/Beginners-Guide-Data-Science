Ingredients:
1 cup sweetened dried cranberries
2 cups hot water
1 medium onion
1 cup uncooked Arborio, or medium grain, white rice
1 Tbsp olive oil
2 ¾ cups chicken stock
¾ cup dry white wine such as Chardonnay
½ tsp each salt & coarsely ground black pepper
½ cup blanched slivered almonds
2 stalks celery
2 oz cream cheese
2 cups diced cooked chicken or turkey breasts
¼ cup finely chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Combine cranberries and hot water in Small Batter Bowl; set aside. Coarsely chop onion using Food Chopper.
Combine onion, rice and oil in Deep Covered Baker; stir using Small Mix 'N Scraper®. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 2-4 minutes or until onion is translucent. Add stock, wine, salt and black pepper; microwave, covered, on HIGH 13 minutes or until rice is still slightly firm, stirring once halfway through.
Meanwhile, toast almonds in (8-in) Sauté Pan over medium heat 5-7 minutes or until golden brown, stirring frequently. Remove from heat. Slice celery using Veggie Slicer. Cut cream cheese into cubes using Utility Knife. Drain cranberries using (7-in) Strainer; set aside.
Carefully remove baker from microwave using Silicone Oven Mitts. Add chicken and celery to baker; stir. Microwave, covered, on HIGH 3-5 minutes or until rice is tender and risotto appears creamy.
Carefully remove baker from microwave. Add cream cheese and almonds; stir until cheese is fully incorporated. Fold in cranberries. Garnish with parsley, if desired.
