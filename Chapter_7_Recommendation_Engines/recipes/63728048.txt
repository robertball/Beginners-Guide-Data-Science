Ingredients:
Crust:
1 Tbsp. cinnamon
3 Tbsp. sugar
2 cups crushed graham crackers
6 Tbsp. melted butter
Filling:
3 well beaten, room temp. eggs
1 cup sugar
3 8oz packages cream cheese, room temp.
1 16 oz. container sour cream
1 lemon
1 Tbsp. high quality vanilla
1 Tbsp. melted butter
Cherry, blueberry, or other favorite pie filing, optional

Directions:
To prepare crust:
1. Mix cinnamon, sugar, and graham cracker crumbs. Drizzle in melted butter and mix well.
2. Press into a 9 inch springform pan. Use the bottom of a measuring cup to flatten evenly.
3. Put in refrigerator to cool until filling is ready.
Filling:
1. Zest the lemon and squeeze out 1 Tbsp. of the juice, set aside. Place a large container of water on the bottom rack of the oven (I use a 9x13 pan) and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. With a mixer, beat together the eggs and sugar. Mix in the cream cheese until well blended.
3. Mix in the sour cream, lemon juice, zest, and vanilla. Beat until smooth. Fold in the melted butter and pour into the prepared pan.
4. Bake for 35-45 minutes. If you shake the pan, it should wobble a lot. Turn off the heat, keeping the cheesecake in the oven until it is no longer hot (about an hour).
5. Allow to cool in refrigerator overnight. Do not cover with foil until morning so that the condensation will not soak the top.
6. Serve with cherry, blueberry, or other favorite pie filling.

Description: 
This is a recipe that my mother was requested to make for every family gathering. The filling makes a great cheesecake base and adapts well to changes. I have used boxed & prepared brownies as a crust and put a chocolate ganache on top.
