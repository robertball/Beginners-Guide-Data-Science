Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 bag Earl Grey tea, ground to a powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/4 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup powdered sugar
2/3 cup strong brewed Earl Grey tea

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Sift flour, baking powder, powdered tea, salt, and nutmeg together in a medium bowl.
Mix butter and powdered sugar together in a small bowl until smooth. Cut butter-sugar mixture into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in brewed tea until a soft dough forms.
Knead dough briefly on a floured surface. Roll out into a circle about 1/2 inch thick. Cut out biscuits using a round cutter and transfer to the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
