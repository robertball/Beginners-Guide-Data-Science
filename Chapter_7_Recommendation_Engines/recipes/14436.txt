1 apple, cored and chopped
1 large orange, peeled, sectioned, and cut into bite-size
1/2 cup seedless grapes
1 nectarine, pitted and chopped
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
6 tablespoons plain low-fat yogurt

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the apple, orange, grapes and nectarine. If using a passion fruit, spoon out the flesh and chop.
Pour enough fresh juice to coat and prevent oxidation. Toss and refrigerate.
Serve with dollop of low-fat yogurt.
