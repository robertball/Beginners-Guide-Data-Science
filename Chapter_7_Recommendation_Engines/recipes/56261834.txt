Ingredients:
13-16 pound bone-in pork butt roast (aka shoulder roast)
3 tablespoon liquid HICKORY smoke flavoring
3 TBS salt
1 TBS ground ginger
2 TBS minced garlic
28 oz box chicken broth

Directions:
Score fat side of roast with sharp knife. Rub liquid smoke, ground ginger and salt into the skin of the pork. Place in large roasting pan and carefully pour chicken broth around outer edge of roast.  Cover with tight fitting lid or aluminum foil.  Roast at 325 degrees for 4-5 hours.  Cool before shredding. Sprinkle shredded meat with salt, if needed.
Toss with a smoky brown sugar BBQ sauce. (We like Sweet Baby Ray's or Masterpiece Hickory Smoked)

Description: 
Tender, juicy, flavorful even without sauce. Use bone-in roast for the best flavor.  Serve with a variety of sauces and Hawaiian Sweet Rolls.  Recipe makes 20 servings, but will not feed 20 people, because nobody will want just one serving!Modified from: Oven Kalua Pork
