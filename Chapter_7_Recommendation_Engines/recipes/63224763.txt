Ingredients:
1 16 oz bag large elbow macaroni
(if you can find wheat pasta that is healtier!)
2 cans Tuna in water, drained slightly
2 cans Cream of Mushroom Soup
1 1/2 Cups Evaporated (Canned) Milk
2 Cups Cheddar Cheese, shredded
1 1/2 Cups Frozen peas & carrots blend
Dashes of Garlic Powder
Dashes of Onion Powder
Salt & Pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350*
In a large pot over high heat boil the Large Elbow Macaroni.
In a medium sized bowl mix together the drained tuna, soup, evaporated milk, and 1 cup of the shredded cheddar chesse. Add the spices in, tasting for the flavor you like.
Just as the elbow mac is ready to take off the stove, add in the frozen peas & carrots, stirring briefly.  Now drain it all and set aside.
In a 9 x 13 baking dish pour enough of the soup mixture to spread over the bottom of the pan.  Pour all the drained noodles (with peas & carrots) into the baking dish, spreading out evenly.  Spread the soup mixture evenly over the top and then the other cup of shredded cheese over that.
Bake in the preheated 350* oven for 35-40 minutes or until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling through all the noodles! (you can clearly see that if you've used a glass baking dish, otherwise that might be difficult!)
