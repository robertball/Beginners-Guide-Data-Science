Ingredients:
2 cups milk
7 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 whole vanilla bean
3/4 cup castor sugar or superfine sugar
1 pinch salt
6 egg yolks
1 1/2 (17.5 ounce) packages frozen puff pastry
1/2 cup apricot preserves (optional)
confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
In a small saucepan, heat milk until small bubbles form. Drop in the vanilla pod, remove saucepan from heat, and set aside to cool until just warm. In a medium saucepan, stir together the flour, sugar, salt, and egg yolks. Beat for a moment, then gradually whisk in warm milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until the custard thickens, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking. Transfer custard to a bowl, and allow to cool, stirring from time to time.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Roll out the puff pastry into a single sheet about 1/2 inch thick; it should be the same size  as a 17x14 inch baking sheet. Place the pastry onto the baking sheet, and prick all over with a fork.
Bake in preheated oven for 28 minutes. Remove from oven, and cool pastry on the baking sheet.
When the pastry has cooled completely, transfer it from the baking sheet to a hard surface, and cut lengthwise into three 4 to 5 inches wide strips. Spread one strip thickly with custard. Place a second strip directly over the first; spread the top evenly with jam. Cover with the third strip, and dust with confectioners' sugar. With a very sharp knife, cut into 8 rectangular portions.

Description: 
French Vanilla Slices are called 'Mille-feuilles' and are made with puff pastry  sandwiched together with jam, cream, or confectioners' custard. They can be dusted with confectioners' sugar or iced with a glaze icing. For coffee-flavored custard, omit the vanilla, and add strong coffee essence to taste just before use. For orange-flavored custard, infuse the zest of an orange in the milk.
