Ingredients:
2 cups shelled raw peanuts
1 1/2 teaspoons peanut oil
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread peanuts on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake peanuts, stirring every 2 minutes, until golden brown and fragrant, 6 to 8 minutes.
Combine peanuts, peanut oil, sugar, and salt in a food processor fitted with a metal blade; process until peanuts are chopped and the mixture forms a ball, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the food processor bowl; continue processing to desired consistency, 1 to 3 minutes more.

Description: 
This recipe makes a wonderful peanut butter that's better than anything in the store. It's all natural, and doesn't separate like some of the so-called natural peanut butters you can buy. I like chunky peanut butter, so I mix the batch until it is very smooth, then mix in peanuts that have been chopped separately.
