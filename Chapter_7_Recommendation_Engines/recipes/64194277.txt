Ingredients:
4 (16 oz) cans pork and beans, DRAINED (not rinsed)
1 large onion, diced
1 lb. bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
6 McIntosh, Cortland or Granny Smith apples (chopped into chunks)
1/2 c. brown sugar (light or dark)
1/2 c. molasses
1/2 c. maple syrup
1 tbsp. cinnamon

Directions:
Place bacon into Dutch oven. Saute on medium heat for 5 minutes, then add onion.
Continue to saute until bacon is browned, but not crisped, and onions are transparent and starting to brown.
Add apples and continue to saute an additional 4-5 minutes, or until apples begin to soften.  (Do not overcook apples.)
Add remaining ingredients and simmer, uncovered, until heated through - approximately 20 minutes.
