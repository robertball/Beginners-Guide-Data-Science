Description: 
THIS RECIPE has a long tradition in our family. It was a special meal at my mother's table, and I enjoyed cooking it for my seven children. Now they prepare it for their families. I'm glad this recipe was easy to adjust for just the two of us. My wife and I enjoy it two or three times a week. -James Newton, Minocqua, Wisconsin
