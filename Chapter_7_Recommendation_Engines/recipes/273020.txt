Ingredients:
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 onion, chopped
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
5 cups milk
2 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 cups chopped, cooked broccoli
2 cups chopped, cooked ham
2 cups cooked white rice
1 cup crushed buttery round crackers
1/2 cup sliced almonds
6 slices cooked bacon, crumbled

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook until fragrant and almost translucent, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle flour over onion, then cook and stir for 3 minutes. Add milk gradually, whisking constantly to keep mixture from becoming lumpy. Cook and stir until the mixture is thick and smooth, about 15 minutes.
Add Colby-Jack cheese and cook and stir until cheese is melted and sauce begins to bubble, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Combine broccoli, ham, and rice in a large bowl. Add cheese mixture and stir to combine. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Top with crushed crackers, sliced almonds, and crumbled bacon.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Serve warm.
