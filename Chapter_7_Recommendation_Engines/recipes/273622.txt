Ingredients:
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 tablespoons red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
3 vine-ripe tomatoes, seeded
1 tablespoon butter, or to taste
1 cup dry white wine
olive oil
1/2 white onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 plum tomatoes, finely chopped
2 tablespoons dried basil
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried oregano

Directions:
Place shrimp in a resealable container or zip-top bag. Add red pepper flakes, lemon juice, and salt; toss together. Seal and let marinate for 1 hour.
Pulse vine tomatoes in a blender until smooth.
Melt butter in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add marinated shrimp and increase heat to medium. Cook and stir until slightly browned on the outsides but not cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove shrimp and set aside.
Add a splash of white wine to the frying pan and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom using a wooden spoon. Pour in olive oil. Add onion to the hot oil and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Pour in remaining wine and cook until reduced by half, 6 to 8 minutes.
Add the pureed tomatoes, plum tomatoes, basil, parsley, and oregano to the sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, stirring frequently, until flavors combine, about 25 minutes. Toss shrimp back into the pan and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes more.
