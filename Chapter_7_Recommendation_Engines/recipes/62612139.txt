Ingredients:
The basics:
* 4 pounds chicken wings, cut up (serves 4)
* 1-2 quarts vegetable oil for deep-frying
For the marinade:
* 1/8 cup ground coriander (2 Tbs)
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin
* 1 Tbs kosher salt
* 1/8 cup extra-virgin olive oil(2 Tbs)
For the sauce:
* 1/2 cup Hot Sriracha chili sauce (or to taste)
* 3/4 stick (6 tbl) unsalted butter, melted
* 1/4 cup chopped cilantro
* finely grated zest and juice of 1 lime
* 4 large cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
In a large zip-lock bag, combine coriander, cumin, salt and olive oil. Toss in the wings and massage the bag to coat. Refrigerate at least 4 hours, or overnight. Though the volume of the marinade seems small and barely coats the wings, it is critical to the success of this recipe.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place wings in a single layer on a large, rimmed baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Bake for about 30 minutes, until wings are firm, but not done. (They’ll finish cooking in the deep-fryer). Remove them from the oven and place on a platter to dry before frying.
In a clean bowl, blend cilantro, minced garlic, lime zest and juice, and melted butter. Add 1/2 cup Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, combine and set aside
Working in small batches, deep-fry wings until crispy and browned, 2-4 min. Drain briefly on paper towels, then toss the hot wings in the sauce. Let the wings sit for 2-5 minutes before serving so the flavors soak into the wings.
Serve hot, on a platter with your favorite condiments. Great with homemade blue cheese dip.

Description: 
Sriracha HOT chili sauce, crispy chicken wings, and tons of garlic make these hot and savory wings the best chicken wings we’ve ever eaten!
The wings are marinated , then baked for 20-30 minutes before being deep fried to crisp them up. For a healthier and even tastier version, grill instead of skip deep-frying. Then, you toss them in the Sriracha, butter, cilantro, garlic & lime sauce before serving.
