Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups white sugar, divided
1 cup butter
4 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon brandy
1 tablespoon rum
1 tablespoon anise extract
1 tablespoon lemon zest
4 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup raisins
1 cup candied fruit
1 cup candied cherries
3/4 cup toasted whole almonds

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an angel food cake pan.
Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in remaining 1 cup sugar, vanilla extract, brandy, rum, anise extract, and lemon zest.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Beat gradually into the creamed butter mixture. Fold in raisins, candied fruit, candied cherries, and almonds. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top springs back when gently pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
