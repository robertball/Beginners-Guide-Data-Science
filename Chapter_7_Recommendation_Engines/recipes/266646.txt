Ingredients:
1 kiwifruit, halved
2 pounds Korean-style short ribs (beef chuck flanken), cut into 3-inch segments
For the Chili Rub:
1 tablespoon ancho chili powder
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Rub kiwi halves over both sides of the short ribs. Pile ribs into a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Combine chili powder, sugar, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne in a bowl for the dry rub. Mix well.
Lay short ribs on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Sprinkle the dry rub all over the ribs.
Preheat a grill for medium heat. Cook short ribs, turning a few times, until deeply caramelized with dark grill marks, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
We tied the world record here for fewest ingredients in a marinade, with one, but thanks to the kiwi's enzymatic magic, that's all we need. Unlike some tropical fruit marinades, kiwi doesn't turn the meat into mush, and provides a nice, slightly sweet and acidic base for our ancho chili rub. Finish with a sprinkling of green onions and a side of barbecue sauce and potato salad.
