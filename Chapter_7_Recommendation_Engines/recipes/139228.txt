Ingredients:
5 yellow onions
5 red onions
12 eggs

Directions:
Remove the colored skins from the outsides of the yellow and red onions. Save the rest of the onion for other uses. Cut cheesecloth into 5 inch squares. Place a couple of pieces of onion skin onto a square of cheesecloth and set an egg on top. Gather the cheesecloth around the egg so that it is covered with onion skin. Secure with a rubber band. Repeat with remaining eggs and onion skins.
Fill a large pot with cold water and add the wrapped eggs. Cover and bring to a boil, then remove from the heat and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. Afterwards, rinse the eggs under cold water and snip off the rubber bands to remove the cheesecloth. Rinse and dry the eggs.

Description: 
For a beautiful marble effect on hard-boiled eggs at Easter time, wrap the uncooked egg in onion skins before boiling them. These eggs will not stain clothes or hands and they are perfect for an egg hunt because the dew from the grass will not change the colors and because they blend so well with rocks and leaves, they are a bit of a challenge for the older kids.  The yellow and red onions produce a stronger color than the white skins and some will be so beautiful that they are the only centerpiece you will need and you will wish you can keep it forever.
