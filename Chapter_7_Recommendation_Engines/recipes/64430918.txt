Ingredients:
1/2 cup hoisin sauce
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
2 teaspoons sesame oil
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons hot sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 (10 ounce) thick bone-in center cut pork chops
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons hot mustard powder (such as Coleman's Â®) or Chinese style, to taste
1 egg yolk
1/3 cup creme fraiche
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
cayenne pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine hoisin sauce, garlic, soy sauce, ginger, 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, rice vinegar, sherry vinegar, sesame oil, 2 teaspoons sugar, hot sauce, white pepper, and black pepper in a large bowl. Whisk thoroughly and set aside.
Place pork chops in a resealable freezer bag; pour slightly more than 1/2 the marinade into freezer bag over pork chops. Seal bag and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours. Reserve remaining marinade.
Combine 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 3 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons hot mustard powder, and egg yolk in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes; remove from heat.
Stir in creme fraiche, Dijon mustard, turmeric, and cayenne pepper. Refrigerate until needed.
Remove pork chops from marinade and pat dry using paper towel.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Cook pork chops on the preheated grill until browned grill marks appear, about 4 minutes per side.
Move pork chops from directly above heat source. Continue cooking over indirect medium heat, brushing the remaining marinade on each side, until no longer pink inside, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 135 degrees F ( C). Serve pork chops topped with mustard sauce.
