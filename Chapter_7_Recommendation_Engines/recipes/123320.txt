Ingredients:
20 whole chicken wings*
2 cups soy sauce
1/2 cup white wine or chicken broth
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons ground ginger

Directions:
Cut chicken wings into three sections; discard wing tips. Place wings in a large resealable heavy-duty plastic bag or 12-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a bowl, combine remaining ingredients; mix well. Pour half of the sauce over chicken; turn to coat. Seal or cover the chicken and remaining sauce; refrigerate overnight. Drain chicken, discarding the marinade. Place chicken in a 5-qt. slow cooker; top with reserved sauce. Cover and cook on low for 3-1/2 to 4 hours or until chicken juices run clear. Transfer wings to a serving dish; discard cooking juices.
