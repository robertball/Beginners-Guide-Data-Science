Ingredients:
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp salt
1/2 cup natural-style smooth peanut butter (I use Smuckers)
1/2 cup brown sugar (firmly packed)
1/3 cup honey
1 egg
2 egg whites
2 tablespoons extra light olive oil (or you can use canola)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts or almonds
1 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350.
Spray a 7 x 7 inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. (You can also shape this into an even square and place it on a baking sheet lined with wax and sprayed.)
Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt in a small bowl.
Beat the peanut butter, brown sugar and honey in a large electric mixing bowl until well blended.
Blend egg and egg whites in a small bowl (with a fork or whisk). Add to the peanut butter mixture along with the oil and vanilla extract.
Beat until smooth. Add the flour mixture.
Mix in oats, dried cranberries, and walnuts.
Scrape the batter into the baking dish (or pan). Make sure you spread the batter into an even layer.
Bake the bars until lightly browned and firm to the touch, 20 to 25 minutes.
Cool completely before cutting into bars.
Makes about 24, 2 x 2 inch bars.
