I am making this for one of my best friend's 40th birthday celebration! She loves the chocolate oranges you can get at Christmas time, so naturally I thought of these wonderful flavors when considering what kind of cake to make her. My internet search produced several recipes and out of those,this is the one that interested me the most. It's from a Food Network challenge, Mystery Client Cakes. I'll have to let you know how it turns out!!
