Ingredients:
1/2 cup rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 ounces julienned carrot
4 ounces julienned daikon radish
1 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons sriracha sauce, or more to taste
1 teaspoon hoisin sauce
1/2 cup fish sauce
1 1/2 pounds thinly sliced cooked pork loin roast
12 7-inch French rolls
8 ounces pâté (optional)
4 ounces thinly sliced cucumber
1 cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Combine rice wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon sugar, and salt. Add the julienned carrot and radish and marinate for 30 minutes. Drain well.
Combine mayonnaise, sriracha, and hoisin. Mix well. Feel free to add more sriracha if you prefer a spicier sandwich.
Mix fish sauce and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Pour this over the pork and toss well.
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F.
Split the rolls from the top, being sure not to cut them completely in half. Toast in the oven for 2 minutes, or until just crispy.
To assemble, spread some of the mayonnaise on one side of each bun. Spread the pâté on the other side. Divide the roast pork among the 12 buns. Top with cucumber slices, pickled vegetables, and cilantro.

Description: 
Our take on a classic Vietnamese street sandwich. The pâté, though optional, is highly recommended to take this sandwich up a notch. Pairs well with rosé all day!
