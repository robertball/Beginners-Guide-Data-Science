Ingredients:
1 cup self-rising flour
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 egg, lightly beaten
3/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Sift together the flour, sugar, and baking soda in a large bowl. Slowly add the egg and milk while stirring continually until smooth.
Place a skillet over medium heat. Lightly coat the surface of the skillet with butter. Pour 1/8 cup of batter into the skillet. Cook until bubbles begin to appear on the surface of the batter; flip and continue to cook until lightly browned on the bottom, 1 to 2 minutes each side. Reapply butter to the skillet between batches.

Description: 
My Aussie friend uses this recipe as her standard pancake recipe. Pikelets are the Scottish version of the southern British crumpet. They are also great for afternoon teas. Serve with fresh-squeezed lemon juice and sugar, or with butter and jam. I always thought that I had the best pancake recipe in the world until I tried these!
