Ingredients:
3 cups chopped carrots

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with 2 inches of water or just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add carrots, cover, and steam until tender, about 10 minutes.
Transfer steamed carrots to a food processor and process until almost smooth, scraping down sides periodically. Add 1/4 cup water from the saucepan and process until carrots are smooth. Repeat until desired consistency is reached.
Scoop 1/3 to 1/2 cup pureed carrots into sandwich-size resealable bags. Squeeze bag to remove excess air and seal. Flatten bags and stack in the freezer.
