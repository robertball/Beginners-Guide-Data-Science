Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
3/4 cup cold butter
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 (7 ounce) bar milk chocolate candy bar (such as Hershey's®), broken into squares
1 (6 ounce) package English toffee-flavored baking bits (such as Heath®)
1 cup chopped almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk flour and sugar together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender until crumbly; press into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
Mix sweetened condensed milk, egg, and almond extract together in a large bowl. Fold chocolate, toffee-flavored baking bits, and almonds into sweetened condensed milk mixture; spread over the warm crust.
Bake until cookie bars are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into bars. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator.
