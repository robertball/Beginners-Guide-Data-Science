Ingredients:
Caramel:
1Â½ cup sugar
Flan:
1 can of evaporated milk
1 can of condensed milk
8 oz. cream cheese
6 eggs
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
First prepare an 8 x 8 pan.  Melt sugar until is completely dissolved.  Sugar will start to klump, just keep stiring constantly until completely dissolved.  Pour over pan turning around to cover all over bottom and sides.  (Handle carefully as disolved sugar is extremely hot)  Set aside.
In the blender mix flan ingredients, just until all mix.  Do not over mix.
Pour over prepared pan. Bake in Mary Bath at 350 for 60-70 min.
As soon as it is ready turn into a shallow serving dish.  Caramel will pour over.
