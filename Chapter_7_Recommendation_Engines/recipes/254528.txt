Ingredients:
12 1/2 cups water
1 (1 pound) pumpkin, cut into cubes
2 pounds beef bottom round, cut into cubes
1/2 pound beef soup bones, trimmed of excess fat
2 tablespoons sea salt
1 (14 ounce) can MSG-free beef broth (such as Swanson®)
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 leaves Chinese thyme
ground black pepper to taste
4 ears corn, cut into thirds
2 large carrots, chopped
1 large potato, cubed
1 (3 ounce) package pumpkin beef noodles (such as Maggi®) (optional)
1 bitter melon, seeded and chopped
1 small radish, peeled and sliced into half moons
1 Scotch bonnet chile pepper, chopped
2 green onions, pressed flat with a knife

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Place pumpkin in a blender. Cover and blend until pureed.
Stir pureed pumpkin, beef, soup bones, and salt into the water; add beef broth, garlic, thyme, and ground black pepper. Cover the soup and simmer until until beef is nearly tender and cooked through, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Stir corn, carrots, potato, noodles, bitter melon, radish, Scotch bonnet chile pepper, and green onions into the soup; cook uncovered until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.

This is my one of my favorites soups to make. I do it my way, which is quick and easy but just as good.
