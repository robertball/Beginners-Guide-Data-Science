Ingredients:
1 c Hot Water
1 pkg Rapid Rise Yeast
1 1/4 T Sugar
3 T Softened Butter
1 1/2 t Salt
2 c Flour
1/2 c Cornmeal

Directions:
Combine water, yeast, and sugar, and let dissolve.
Add butter and salt, and mix until the butter is well combined.
Add the flour and cornmeal, mixing until smooth.
Cover and let rise until doubled in size, beat down, and repeat.
If you can't toss the dough it takes time to spread it out.
Place it on a pizza stone, with a coating of salted cornmeal for a more flavorful crust.
Precook spread out crust for 5 min. in 375 degree oven on lowest rack.
Add your choice of toppings, and bake 20-25 min. on lowest rack.
