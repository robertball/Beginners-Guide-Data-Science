Ingredients:
6 egg yolks
3/4 cup white sugar
2/3 cup milk
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pound mascarpone cheese
1/2 cup strong brewed coffee, room temperature
4 tablespoons rum
2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well blended.  Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils.  Boil gently for 1 minute, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.  Cover tightly and chill in refrigerator 1 hour.
In a medium bowl, beat cream with vanilla until stiff peaks form.  Whisk mascarpone into yolk mixture until smooth.
In a small bowl, combine coffee and rum.  Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with coffee mixture.
Arrange half of soaked ladyfingers in bottom of a 7x11 inch dish.  Spread half of mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers, then half of whipped cream over that.  Repeat layers and sprinkle with cocoa.  Cover and refrigerate 1-2 days before serving.
