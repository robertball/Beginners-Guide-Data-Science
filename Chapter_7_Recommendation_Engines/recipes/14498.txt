Ingredients:
1/3 cup honey
3 tablespoons orange juice
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon white wine
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons onion powder, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
8 thin cut pork chops

Directions:
Place honey, orange juice, vinegar, wine, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, tarragon, and mustard in a large resealable plastic bag. Slash fatty edge of each chop in about three places without cutting into the meat; this will prevent the meat from curling during cooking. Place chops in the plastic bag, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Preheat grill for high heat.
Lightly oil grill grate. Place chops on grill, and discard marinade. Cook chops for 6 to 8 minutes, turning once, or to desired doneness.

Description: 
These pork chops are great! I accidentally left them in the marinade for a day, a night, and the next day, and they were even better! They are very tender and tasty.
