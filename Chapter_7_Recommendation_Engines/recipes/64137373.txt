Ingredients:
1/4 cup raw lentils, soaked for at least two hours in water
1/4 cup raw buckwheat groats (not kasha), rinsed
1 liter water
1 tsp salt
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper medley (black, green, white and pink peppercorns)
1/4 tsp ground turmeric
1/4 tsp crushed red peppers
1/4 tsp ground mace
1/4 tsp dried crushed rose petals (optional)
1/4 tsp coriander
1/4 tsp paprika
3 Tbsp olive oil
1.5 ounces fresh baby spinach leaves, washed
1/2 cup cooked beets, shredded
1/2 cup carrots, shredded
2 Tbsp green onions, finely chopped

Directions:
In a small bowl add the oil with all the seasonings except the salt.  Mix well and set aside.
In a medium pot, cook the lentils in the water until al dente.  About 15-18 minutes.
Add the buckwheat groats and bring the water to a boil.  Once boiling add the salt.
Simmer the lentils and buckwheat for 10 minutes.
Turn off the heat source and let the lentils and buckwheat sit in the covered pot until all the water has been absorbed, about 5 minutes.  Do not open the lid until at least 5 minutes.
Pour the lentils and buckwheat into a large serving bowl.  Add the spinach leaves, carrots, beets and green onions.  Drizzle the oil/seasoning mixture together and mix well until all ingredients are well coated with the dressing.  Sprinkle the vinegar on top and mix again to distribute the vinegar.
Allow to rest to enhance the flavours at least 30 minutes.  Serve at room temperature for a more robust flavour.

Description: 
I needed a nourishing and complete meal-in-one that I could take with me on the go.  I prepare this the day before I travel and put it in the fridge overnight.  It has a great flavour that, when left to sit at room temp, bursts through even more. The spinach leaves are sturdy and resilient so don't wilt as would lettuce. I hope you like it.
