Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1 cup Arborio rice
2 1/2 cups chicken stock
3/4 cup white wine
10 strawberries, chopped, or more to taste
5 1/2 ounces diced cooked chicken breast
6 tablespoons Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice; cook and stir until rice becomes soft and slightly transparent, about 5 minutes.
Stir 1 cup of chicken stock and white wine into the rice mixture. Cook and stir, adding more chicken stock as it is absorbed, until rice is fluffy and soft, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat.
Mix strawberries and chicken breast into the rice mixture. Stir in Parmesan cheese, heavy cream, salt, and pepper until well mixed. Transfer to a serving dish.

Description: 
This is a unique risotto that also works equally well with scallops or prawns. It still tastes savory, but it's lovely and creamy and makes a beautiful Valentine's Day or special occasion starter. Give it a try! Garnish with sliced strawberries and fresh parsley.
