Ingredients:
1 1/4 lbs ground beef
1 medium onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground pepper
2 tsp fennel seeds
1 tsp paprika
1 16 oz can dice tomatoes
1 8 oz can tomato sauce
1 Tbsp parsley
2 tsp oregano
1 tsp basil
320g grated mozzarella or other melting cheese
350g cottage cheese
1 egg
12 lasagna noodles
2 Tbsp parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F
Begin to brown the beef on medium heat, then add the onions and garlic and finish browning.
Add the salt, pepper, fennel and paprika and mix, stirring for 30 seconds.
Reserve 1/4 of the can of tomato sauce. Add to the meat, the tomatoes, sauce and herbs, and let simmer for 20 minutes
While the sauce is simmering, prepare the cheese mixture by combining the cottage cheese, mozzarella, and egg together.
Pour the reserved tomato sauce into the bottom of a rectangular casserole. Layer 4 noodles, 1/3 the meat sauce, 1/3 the cheese mixture, noodles sauce mixture, noodles sauce mixture, and then sprinkle the parmesan overtop.
Let sit for 20 minutes. Bake for 25 minutes until the cheese is browned and bubbly, and let sit for 10 minutes before serving

Description: 
This is the type of lasagna I love -- meaty, with just the right amount of cheese, and diced tomatoes to keep it fresh. This recipe uses no-cook lasagna noodles
