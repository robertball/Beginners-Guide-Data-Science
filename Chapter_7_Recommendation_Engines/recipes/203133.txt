Description: 
This is a quick easy to make side dish that is always a hit at hoe-downs and hootenanys. One cup of each ingredient is added so it is easy to remember and fun to make with kids. If you are serving all the kin folk simply add two or three cups of each ingredient. Some folks also add whatever berries are in season to make it sweeter and more colorful for kids.
