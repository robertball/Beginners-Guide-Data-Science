Description: 
The Dinomite is an abnosome animal. On top of being able to leap kale mountains in a single bound, and crush unhappiness with just a spoon and a wet wipe the Dinomite is an excellent chef. His favorite desert, Dinomite's Fluffy Bites, had no earthly counterpart until this very recipe. There are many imitators, but I assure you this is the real deal. Dinomite and GISHWHES approved these fluffy bites bring joy, cure chronic toadiness, and enrich lives. They are perfect for tea parties, trips to mars and backyard BBQ
