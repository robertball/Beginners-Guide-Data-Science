Ingredients:
6 cloves garlic, crushed
1 onion, chopped
4 habanero peppers, seeded and minced
2 (15 ounce) cans chili beans in spicy sauce
1 (15 ounce) can dark red kidney beans
1 (15 ounce) can black beans
4 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (16 ounce) jar hot salsa
1/8 cup chili powder
1/8 cup coarsely ground black pepper
1/8 cup red pepper flakes
1/8 cup ground cumin
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
2 pounds ground beef

Directions:
In a large pot over medium heat, combine garlic, onion, habanero peppers, chili beans, kidney beans, black beans, diced tomatoes with green chiles, salsa, chili powder, black pepper, red pepper flakes, cumin and taco seasoning.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer.
While soup is heating, cook beef in a large skillet over medium heat until brown.  Drain excess fat, then stir beef into soup pot.  Simmer, covered, until flavors are well blended, about 1 hour.

Description: 
I threw this together on a cold day when I was itching for some chili. The spice measurements are approximate. I start out with 1/8 cup and go from there.  It cooks up fast and gets better when stored in the fridge and reheated. Top with shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream, if desired. Enjoy!
