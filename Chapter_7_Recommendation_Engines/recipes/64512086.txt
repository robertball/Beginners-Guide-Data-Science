Ingredients:
Boiling water (approximately 3 cups)
2 small/medium red onions (approximately 5oz / 150 g each or 10 oz / 300 g total before peeling)
3/4 cup white wine vinegar or cider vinegar
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon sea salt, kosher salt, or pickling salt
5 black peppercorns

Directions:
1. Boil the water.
2. Peel the onions and cut in half vertically. Slice thinly into half-moon slices.
3. Stuff the onion slices into a 500 milliliter (16-18 oz) mason jar.
4. Add the sugar and salt into the vinegar and stir until dissolved.
5. Add the peppercorns to the vinegar.
6. Pour some boiling water over the onions in the jar. Let rest for 10 seconds, and drain through a mesh strainer so that the onions stay in the jar. Repeat this step two more times so that the onions are slightly cooked.
7. Pour the vinegar solution into the onion jar. Shake well.
8. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before using so that the flavor develops. Keep refrigerated.
