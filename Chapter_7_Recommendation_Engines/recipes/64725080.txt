Ingredients:
1 lb ground veal
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2 tbsp milk
1/2 cup bread crumbs
3/4 cup cotija cheese, crumbled
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/2 red onion, minced
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
1/2 tsp ground chipotle
1.5 tbsp corn oil
1 fresh jalapeno, diced
1/2 red onion, sliced
1.25 cup broth
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
16 oz spanish style tomato sauce (such as Goya®)
1/8 cup chopped cilantro
1/4 cup cotija cheese, crumbled

Directions:
In a bowl, mix the veal, eggs, milk, bread crumbs, cheese, salt, pepper, garlic powder, minced red onion, cumin, cilantro, and chipotle powder. Form the meat mixture into walnut sized balls. You should get about 20 meatballs.
In a multi-cooker, start the sauté setting. Pour in the oil. Sauté the jalapeno and onion until they begin to soften. Add the quinoa and stir. Pour in the broth and half the tomato sauce. Mix well. Place the meatballs in the pot, pour the remaining sauce over them.
Cancel the sauté setting. Close and secure the lid. Select manual mode. Choose medium pressure (this will depend on your manufacturer the pressure should be about 8 psi or setting 4 out of 6) and cook for 10 minutes once the pressure has been reached. (It will take about 8-10 minutes to reach pressure depending on your machine and your altitude.)
Allow for natural release.
Serve the meatballs over the stewed tomatoes and quinoa. Top with remaining chopped cilantro and cheese
If your machine does not offer a variety of manual pressure settings, choose the high pressure but reduce cooking time to 8 minutes or so.
