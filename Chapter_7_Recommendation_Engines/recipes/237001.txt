Description: 
This is a traditional Gujrati chutney this is very spicy but can be adjusted to make sweeter, milder, or more garlicky.  It can be used as a dipping sauce or sandwich spread. The possibilities are endless. I've even roasted chickpeas with this as a coating. Taste chutney and adjust seasonings per your taste. Add more water for a thinner sauce.
