Ingredients:
2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
1 tablespoon baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons white sugar
½ cup butter, cut into pieces
1 cup raisins
½ cup currants
2 teaspoons caraway seed (optional)
¾ cup milk
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Stir together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl until evenly blended. Cut in the butter using a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Stir in the raisins, currants, and caraway seeds, then make a well in the center and pour in the milk and vinegar. Stir with a spoon until the dry ingredients are moistened.
Turn the dough out onto a well floured work surface, and knead gently 8 to 10 times. Divide the dough into two balls, and place onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C), and bake until the top of the bread is golden brown, about 15 minutes more.
