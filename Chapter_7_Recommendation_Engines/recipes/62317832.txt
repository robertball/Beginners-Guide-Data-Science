Ingredients:
* Gem lettuces; 4 small, or sub 1 small Iceberg lettuce
* Gherkins; 2, large, finely diced (you will also need some brine from the jar!)
* Capers; 1 to 2 Tablespoons, well rinsed and dried
* Parsley; 2 to 3 Tablespoons, chopped
---
Dressing:
* Brine from the gherkins; 2 teaspoons
* Extra Virgin Olive Oil; 2 Tablespoons
* Dijon mustard; about 1/2 teaspoon (sub any other relatively mild but creamy mustard)
* MAYBE (unlikely) some salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Cut the lettuce into pieces about 1/2 inch (1 cm)across, and put into a mixing bowl.
Add the diced gherkins and the rinsed and dried capers.
Mix up the dressing, adding seasoning if required. Note that the gherkin brine is probably seasoned enough. The final taste depends so much on the quality of the Gherkins that it is impossible to give exact measures for any these ingredients. So taste the dressing and adjust to YOUR taste.
Just before serving the salad, pour the dressing over the contents of the bowl, and toss thoroughly.
Finish by sprinkling the parsley over.

A stunningly simple and quick salad that seems to be heaven-sent as an accompaniment to grilled food, or crunchy fried things.
