Ingredients:
6 skinless chicken thighs
3 Yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled
1 small sweet potato, peeled
1 apple such as gala or fuji, peeled or unpeeled
4 Tbs brown mustard with horseradish
2 Tbs balsamic vinegar
5 cloves garlic
1 Tbs maple syrup
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Skin the thighs and cut them in half.  Place them in a bowl.
Peel the sweet potato.  Cut the Yukon gold potatoes and the sweet potatoes into similar size pieces for even cooking.  Cut the apple into 6-8 slices.  Remove the core and seeds.  You can peel it if you like. Place them in the slow cooker.
Put the mustard, vinegar, garlic, syrup, salt and pepper in a small food mill.  Grind until the garlic is blended.  Pour this over the chicken thighs and toss to coat.
Pour the chicken thighs with coating over the potatoes.  Turn the slow cooker to low.  Cook 6 to 8 hours.
