Ingredients:
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
1/2 cup pineapple preserves
1 tablespoon prepared horseradish

Directions:
Combine salt and pepper; rub over pork. Place in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Place one sprig of rosemary under the pork and one on top. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan, heat preserves and horseradish until preserves are melted; stir until blended. Remove top rosemary sprig. Brush pork with 1/4 cup pineapple sauce. Bake 10-20 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing. Serve with the remaining sauce.

Description: 
Pork gets a tasty treatment from a simple sauce of pineapple preserves and horseradish in this recipe. The brand of horseradish you use will determine the 'heat' level of the sauce.              --Bernice Dean of Garland, Texas
