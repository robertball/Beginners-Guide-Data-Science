Description: 
I love the bold taste of  Vietnamese dishes. This is packed with flavor and spice and is just beautiful in colors. I have tried doing individual bowls but prefer a family style serving. Serving with a quality Jasmine rice and spring roll in addition awesomeness.  Add a little sliced Habanero pepper if you want to increase your heat palate. (I'm from Texas and like heat)
