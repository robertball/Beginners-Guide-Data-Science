Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/2 to 2 cups blueberries (frozen is fine)
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1 cup white sugar
3 Tbsp. real mayonnaise (not salad dressing)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups cake flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Put the butter in an 8x8 glass pan and place pan in oven so butter can melt.
While butter is melting, in a medium bowl, cream together the butter and white sugar. Mix in the mayonnaise and vanilla until light and fluffy, at least 2 minutes.
Take pan out of the oven and add the brown sugar to the melted butter.
Add blueberries in on top of sugar. Spread evenly in pan. Set aside.
Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt, stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the milk.
Pour into the baking pan so that the fruit is completely covered.
Bake for 50-55 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted, comes out clean. Immediately invert onto a serving plate. Serve warm with ice cream or sauce.
