Ingredients:
For the Parmesan cannoli:
2 cups shredded Parmesan cheese
For the filling:
1 (4 ounce) package IdahoanÂ® Roasted Garlic Flavored Mashed Potatoes, prepared
2 tablespoons green onion, washed and chopped fine
1 tablespoon Italian parsley, chopped

Directions:
For the Parmesan cannoli: In a non stick skillet on medium high heat, scatter shredded Parmesan in a 3 to 4 inch diameter, keeping the cheese loose to create a lacy effect.
Cook until golden brown on one side and gently flip over to brown on the other side - about 1-2 minutes per side.
Using a wooden spoon handle, quickly and carefully wrap the each warm cannoli around the handle to form a cylinder. Gently slide off and set aside. Repeat to make approximately 25 cannoli.
For the filling: Stir the green onion and parsley into the prepared Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Cover and cool slightly.
When potatoes are cool enough to handle, but still warm, put them in a pastry bag and carefully fill the Parmesan cannoli tubes with the mashed potatoes.
Serve immediately.
