1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups halved grape or cherry tomatoes

1/2 cup chopped fresh mint
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a medium saucepan, and gradually stir in couscous and salt. Remove from heat; cover and let stand 5 min. Transfer to a medium bowl, and fluff with a fork.
