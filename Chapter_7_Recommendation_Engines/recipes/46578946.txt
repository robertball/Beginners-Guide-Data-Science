2 large carrots, diced
2 celery ribs, diced
1/2 cup butter, cubed
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups half-and-half cream

2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons poultry seasoning
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup frozen peas
1 cup frozen corn

Directions:
Place turkey carcass in a soup kettle or Dutch oven and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1 hour.  Remove carcass; cool. Set aside 3 qt. broth. Remove turkey from bones and cut into bite-size pieces; set aside.
In a soup kettle or Dutch oven, saute the onions, carrots and celery in butter until tender. Reduce heat; stir in flour until blended. Gradually add 1 qt. of reserved broth. Bring to a  boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.
