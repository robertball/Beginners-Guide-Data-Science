Ingredients:
1 medium sugar pumpkin, seeded and halved
3/4 cup honey
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups heavy cream
3 eggs, beaten
2 (9 inch) unbaked deep dish pie crusts
3/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place pumpkin halves cut side down on a medium baking sheet, and cover with foil. Bake 90 minutes, or until flesh is easily mashed with a fork. Cool, scoop pumpkin flesh from shell, and mash.
Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix mashed pumpkin, honey, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and salt. Gradually blend in heavy cream and eggs. Pour into crusts, and top with pecans.
Bake pies in the preheated oven 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.

Description: 
A combination of my family's two favorites! Pecan and pumpkin pie. I have substituted honey for sugar for a more down home flavor.
