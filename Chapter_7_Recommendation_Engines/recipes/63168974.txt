Ingredients:
Â¼ cup brown shallot (or onion), finely chopped
2-4 garlic cloves, finely chopped [optional]
3 TB. butter
1 TB extra virgin olive oil (or any other olive oil)
1 cup white wine (Chardonnay)
1/2 to 1 cup beef or veal stock, or 4-8 TB concentrated demi glace plus water to make approximately 1/2 to 1 cup of liquid
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup milk
3-4 oz. gorgonzola cheese (preferably Dolce or creamy)
Salt (to taste)
1/2 to 4 TB Ground pepper (to taste)
2-3 TB Fresh flat leaf (italian or continental) parsley (finely chopped)
3 TB Fresh chives (finely chopped) [optional]
4 TB Pistachios (roughly chopped or crushed)

Directions:
In two table spoons of butter and one table spoon of olive oil, over medium-high heat, saute shallot until just soft and translucent. Add garlic and saute for 1 minute more.  Pour wine and deglaze pan.  Allow wine to reduce down to the point that it is almost gone.  Add stock or demi glace/water.  Bring to boil and simmer for 5 minutes, or until slightly reduced.  Add cream, and then milk, to reach the desired body and volume of the sauce. Add the gorgonzola and stir until melting begins.  Allow the sauce to simmer to achieve a desired consistency (more simmering = thicker sauce, less simmering = thinner sauce).  Add pepper to taste.  Add the chives and half the parsley. Add half the pistachios and taste the sauce.  Add salt to taste, if necessary.  Finish with 1 tablespoon of butter.  Pour sauce over a good cut of beef, lamb, chicken or pork, or pasta, and dust with the remaining pistachio and parsley.

Description: 
I created this sauce after eating at a local Italian restaurant and becoming obsessed with their Tournedos Gorgonzola.  This is a rough facsimile of the dreamy sauce that smothered those tasty medallions.
