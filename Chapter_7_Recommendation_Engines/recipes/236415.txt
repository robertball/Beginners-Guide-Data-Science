Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
1 small sweet onion, diced
3 stalks celery, diced
1/2 large green bell pepper, diced
1/2 large red bell pepper, diced
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups 2% milk
2 pounds cooked and coarsely chopped lobster meat
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1/4 cup bread crumbs
2 teaspoons sweet paprika
1 tablespoon butter, cut into small pieces, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add onion, celery, green pepper, and red pepper; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large pot over medium-low heat; whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute. Add milk; cook until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes.
Stir vegetables and lobster into sauce; season with salt and pepper. Turn mixture into an 8x8-inch baking dish; sprinkle with bread crumbs, dot with butter pieces, and sprinkle with paprika.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes.
