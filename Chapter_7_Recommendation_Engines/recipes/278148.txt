Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tilapia fillets
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup bread crumbs
2 green onions, diced
1 egg
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon dried dill weed
2 teaspoons hot sauce

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Add tilapia fillets, salt, and pepper and cook until easily flaked with a fork, about 2 minutes on each side. Turn off the heat and shred the fish with 2 forks. Transfer to a bowl.
Toss the fish with bread crumbs, green onions, egg, lemon juice, feta cheese, garlic powder, dill, and hot sauce.
Form patties with your hand and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Set a skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining oil. Cook patties in the hot oil until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes on each side.

Description: 
Wholesome fish dishes do not have to be boring. I love crab cakes...I have made tuna cakes...so why not tilapia cakes? Add some feta and hot sauce and really make it an interesting fish dish. Serve with a dill sauce or simple sour cream.
