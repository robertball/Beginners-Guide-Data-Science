Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds venison, slightly frozen and sliced into 1/16-inch slices
8 garlic scapes, minced
1/3 cup canola oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
4 hamburger buns, split
4 slices sharp Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Place venison strips in a bowl; sprinkle with garlic scapes. Pour in canola oil and soy sauce; mix well. Cover bowl and let venison marinate for at least one hour.
Preheat grill fitted with fine grate grill topper to medium heat.
Evenly spread venison on the grill topper. Stir occasionally to evenly cook meat until no longer pink, about 10 to 15 minutes.
Warm hamburger buns on warming rack of grill. Divide venison among the buns and top with Cheddar cheese.

Description: 
I was looking for new ways to use the fresh hard neck garlic scapes harvested from my garden and came up with this recipe. The family loved it. It's quick, easy, and nutritious. It will work for beef as well. Serve as is, or add sauce of choice (Thousand island dressing is a nice touch).
