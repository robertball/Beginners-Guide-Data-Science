Ingredients:
INGREDIENTS:
For The Cookies
*1 cup unsalted butter, softened
*1 cup granulated sugar
*1 tsp baking powder
*1 tsp baking soda
*1/2 tsp salt
*1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
*1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
*1/4 tsp ground ginger
*1 large egg
*1 tsp vanilla extract
*1 cup canned pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)
*2 cups all-purpose flour
*2 tablespoons instant espresso powder
For The Pumpkin Spice Cream Cheese Frosting
*3 – 3 ½ cups powdered sugar
*6 ounces Neufchatel cheese
*1/4 unsalted butter, at room temperature
*1/2 tsp cinnamon
*1/2 tsp vanilla
*1/4 cup brewed pumpkin-flavored coffee (cooled)

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer on medium speed for 30 seconds. Add granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and espresso powder.  Continue mixing until combined.  Then add in the egg and vanilla, and mix until combined.  Finally, add in pumpkin and flour, and mix well until smooth.
2. Drop dough by heaping teaspoons, 2 inches apart, on parchment paper covered cookie sheets. Bake cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, or until tops are just set (do not overbake!).  Transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
To Make The Frosting:
With an electric mixer, beat together the powdered sugar, cream cheese, and butter on medium low speed.  Beat in the cinnamon, vanilla extract, and coffee until smooth.  Add in more powdered sugar if needed to get the right consistency to spread on the cookies (not too thick, not too thin).  If it ends up being too thick for some reason, just add a little bit more coffee.  Spread over cooled cookies, sprinkle with a little cinnamon, and serve.  Enjoy!
*Makes about 25 cookies, depending on the size you make.  I like to make mine a little bit bigger, so I only get about 20 cookies out of the batches I make.  Also, this recipe makes a lot of extra frosting, so you could probably get away with cutting the frosting part of this recipe in half if you wanted to.  I just like to make sure I have enough, and you could always find a use for the extra!
