Ingredients:
2 cups of lentils
fill the slow cooker with water except a inch from the top rim (lid)
1 T chicken stock
1 t oregano
1/2 t marjoram
1 t garlic powder
1 shake of seasoned salt (1 t)

Directions:
put all the ingredients in the crock pot of slow cooker and leave it alone. It the lentils should start to soften in the 3rd-4th hr. You come back later and have ready to eat lentil soup. IT's not hard, and if you want to 'thicken' the broth add a t of corn starch.

Description: 
If soup was too much work I wouldn't make it. Lentils and bean soups are work. Except for a slow cooker. It's like a bread machine for lentils and bean soups. Come back later and it's all done.
