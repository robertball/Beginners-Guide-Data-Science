Ingredients:
1 large sweet onion, diced
1 large orange bell pepper, diced
1 large yellow bell pepper, diced
3 Tbsp minced garlic
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp onion powder
2 tsp garlic powder
1 Tbsp dried oregano
3 tsp cumin
2 tsp salt
3 tsp black pepper
1/2 cup Goya Culantro Base
3 Tbsp lime juice
2 cans chopped green chiles
3 large boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite sized chunks
1/2 cup flour
1-110 ounce can white (great northern or cannellini beans) rinsed and drained
1-49.5 ounce can chicken broth
1 Tbsp better than bouillon chicken base
2 Tbsp better than bouillon vegetable base

Directions:
In a large stock pot, combine the onions, bell peppers, minced garlic, and olive oil.  Cook over medium heat until the vegetables have softened and are translucent (5-7 minutes) stirring frequently.
Add the dried seasonings/spices, Culantro base, chopped green chiles, and lime juice, mix well.  Add the chicken and flour stirring until fully combined.  Carefully add the remaining ingredients.  Cook over medium heat for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the soup has thickened.

Description: 
Flavorful with a slight bit of spice.  Perfect for cool fall nights.  Serve topped with shredded cheese and sour cream if desired.  I make this one large batch and freeze leftovers in smaller containers to enjoy later.
