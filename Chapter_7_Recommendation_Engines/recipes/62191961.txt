Ingredients:
Ok here's the recipe for one serving - I usually quadruple this for 3/4 bag of Costco meatballs
1 and 1/4 cup grape jelly
1 tbs chili powder (recipe calls for 2 but might be spicy for kids)
3/4 cup ketchup
4 tbs brown sugar

Directions:
Combine all ingredients cook on high in crock pot for 2-4 hours (depending on how much you make).   Stir often so it doesn't burn and stick to the sides of the pot.  You'll know its done when it's thickened.  When finished, pour over prepared meatballs.
