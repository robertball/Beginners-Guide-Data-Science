2 hard boiled egge, chopped

Place potatoes in a large Dutch oven and cover with water.  Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil on a medium low flame.  Cook until the potatoes are fork tender.  When the potatoes are done, let cool. Cook the eggs until hard boiled.  Let cool.
When the potatoes are cool enough to handle cut into 1" inch pieces and place in a large mixing bowl.  Mash the potatoes but leave a little bit of chunkiness to them.  Chop the eggs, celery, onion and parsley.  Add the mustard and mayo to the potatoes and mix very well.  Then add the dry ingredients. Add salt and pepper to taste. Chill for 2 hours and serve.
