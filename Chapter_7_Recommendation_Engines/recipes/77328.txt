Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/4 cup peanut butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups quick-cooking rolled oats
1 egg
1 (14 ounce) can EAGLE BRAND® Sweetened Condensed Milk (NOT evaporated milk)
4 cups chopped candy bars (such as chocolate-coated caramel-topped nougat bars with peanuts, chocolate-covered crisp wafers, chocolate-covered caramel-topped cookie bars, or chocolate-covered peanut butter cups)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In large bowl, combine butter and peanut butter; add brown sugar and baking soda and beat well. Stir in flour and oats.  Set aside 1 3/4 cups of the peanut butter mixture.
Stir egg into remaining peanut butter mixture in bowl; pat into a 15x10-inch baking pan.  Bake for 15 minutes.
Spread EAGLE BRAND(R) over the crust.  Stir together reserved peanut butter mixture and chopped candy bars; sprinkle over all.
Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool and cut.  Store leftovers loosely covered at room temperatures.
