Description: 
Although the recipe calls for blueberries and peaches, I have made this recipe with a number of other fruits.  In the summer any fresh berry is a good choice and in the winter I have used bananas and canned fruit.  It is sooooo easy and loved by all.  I always get a request for the recipe when I make this dessert.  A trifle bowl makes a great presenation, but any type of glass bowl will do fine.
