Ingredients:
2 Slices day-old white bread
1/2 Cup cream
1 Small onion, minced
2/3 Lb. ground beef
1/3 Lb. finely ground pork
Butter for browning
1 Egg
1 TBSP brown sugar (optional)
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp allspice
1/8 tsp ginger (optional)
4 TBSP. Chicken or beef broth
Flour, beef broth, salt and pepper for brown gravy OR packaged mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F
Crumble bread into a bowl (or coarsely chop in food processor). Add cream and wait until absorbed.
Cook minced onion in enough butter to brown slightly. Remove from heat and add spices.
Mix meat, salt, sugar, and onions together and then add beaten egg and cream mixture. Mix thoroughly and shape into balls.
Cook meatballs in butter, turning until all sides are browned, 5-7 minutes. Meatballs should be firm and springy, not soft to the touch.
Bake at 350 degrees for 40 mins in a dish with a cover or foil. Add a few tablespoons broth to the dish to  ensure that the meatballs stay moist.
Use drippings from the pan to make a roux for your favorite brown gravy recipe (or use a packaged mix). Stir 1/2 container sour cream (or to taste) into finished gravy just prior to serving so that the sour cream does not break down in the heat.

Description: 
Our family's traditional Christmas recipe, frequently doubled and kept warm in a crock pot. Worth the effort and the meatballs are even better the next day! Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the leftovers.
