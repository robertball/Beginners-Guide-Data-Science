Ingredients:
1 thin skinned orange, cut into eighths and seeded
1 egg
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup chopped pitted dates
1/2 cup butter
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Place orange pieces into the blender with the egg, buttermilk, dates and butter. Blend thoroughly until mixture is thick, fairly smooth with flecks. Pour out into a large mixing bowl.
In a separate bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cloves and ginger. Stir flour mixture into the orange mixture and stir or fold gently with a wooden spoon or spatula only until dry ingredients have combined. Don't mind any lumps that may be present. Fill muffin tins to just under rims with batter.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of muffin comes out clean. Let stand in pan for five minutes, then remove to wire racks for cooling.

Description: 
These little darlings use the whole orange! Caution: Do not taste the batter once it is ready to cook. It tastes so darn good you might not get the muffins made at all!
