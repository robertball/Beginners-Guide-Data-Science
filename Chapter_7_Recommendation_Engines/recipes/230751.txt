Ingredients:
1/2 pound beef round steak, diced
1/2 small onion, finely diced
1 tablespoon tomato-chicken bouillon granules (such as KnorrÂ®)
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup water
1 tablespoon beef stock concentrate
1/3 pound carrots, cut into 1/2-inch dice
3/4 pound sweet potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 1/2 cups water
3/4 cup finely shredded cabbage
2 cinnamon sticks
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
5 black cardamom seeds
1 cup brown rice

Directions:
Cook and stir steak, onion, and tomato-chicken bouillon together in a large pot over medium heat until steak is browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, 1 cup water, beef stock concentrate, carrots, and sweet potatoes to the steak mixture; cook and stir until carrots and sweet potatoes are softened, about 20 minutes.
Mix 1 1/2 cups water, cabbage, cinnamon sticks, paprika, cumin, black pepper, coriander, and cardamom seeds into the steak-sweet potato mixture; bring to a boil. Add brown rice and reduce heat to low. Cover pot and simmer until rice has absorbed the liquid, about 45 minutes. Fluff rice and remove cinnamon sticks before serving.

This one-dish stew is deliciously different. It is very healthy, also. My husband asked for seconds! Serve in soup bowls.
