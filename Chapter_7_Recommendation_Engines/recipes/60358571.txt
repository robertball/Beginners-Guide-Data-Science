Ingredients:
3 tablespoons meringue powder
4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
6 tablespoons water
Per others:
Royal Icing II is awesome. I have been using it for years and it works every time. Takes well to color. I use the original recipe to pipe the outline for my cookies. Then dilute it slightly with water to "flood" the inside. Dries nice and hard.

Directions:
Beat all ingredients at low speed  for 7 to 10 minutes, or until icing forms peaks.  Tip:  Keep icing covered with a wet kitchen towel at all times. Icing can dry out quickly.
