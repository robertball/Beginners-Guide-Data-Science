Ingredients:
3 pounds lean ground beef
1/3 cup olive oil
3 medium onions, chopped
3 large carrots, chopped
6 celery ribs, chopped
1 can (12 ounces) tomato paste, divided
9 garlic cloves, sliced
3 Tbsp dried parsley flakes
5 tsp kosher salt
3 tsp dried basil
3 tsp dried marjoram
1-1/2 tsp coarsely ground pepper
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
1-1/2 cups dry red wine
3 cans (28 ounces each) diced tomatoes, undrained
1-1/2 cups beef stock
6 bay leaves
3 cups  milk
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Hot cooked linguine
Additional grated Parmesan cheese, optional

Directions:
In a large pot, brown the beef until no longer pink, breaking into crumbles. Remove beef with a slotted spoon; set aside. Pour off drippings.
In the same stockpot, heat oil over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots and celery; cook and stir until tender. Stir in 1 cup tomato paste; cook and stir 3 minutes longer. Add the garlic, seasonings and beef.
Stir in wine. Bring to a boil; cook until almost evaporated. Add tomatoes, stock and bay leaves; return to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 3 hours or until desired consistency, stirring in milk halfway through cooking.
Remove bay leaves. Stir in cheese and remaining tomato paste; heat through. Serve with linguine and, if desired, additional cheese.
