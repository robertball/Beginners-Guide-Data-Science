Ingredients:
6 thick slices bacon, chopped
1/2 cup onions, minced
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
1 cup water
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until the fat begins to render. Stir in onions and garlic; let cook for 1 minute. Stir in beans and water. Let the beans cook until the water has evaporated and the beans are tender. If the beans are not tender once the water has evaporated, add a small amount more water and let them cook until tender. Season with salt and pepper (to taste) and serve.
