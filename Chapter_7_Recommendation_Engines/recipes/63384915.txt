Ingredients:
2 lbs. Boneless-Skinless Chicken Thighs
1/4 tsp. pepper
1/4 c. Soy Sauce
1/2 - 3/4 c. Cheap White Wine (I prefer Chardonnay)
1/2 c. Orange Marmalade
1 TBSP sesame oil
Sesame seeds

Directions:
Place thighs in bottom of 2" deep casserole dish, season with pepper, set aside.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Mix soy sauce, wine, marmalade, and sesame oil in a small saucepan & bring to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce heat slightly and simmer with lid off until reduced by about 1/2.
Pour approximately half of the sauce over the chicken, saving the other half for basting through out the cooking time.
Cook in oven for 45 min. to 1 hr. or until chicken is cooked all the way through, remembering to generously baste every 15 min.  Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the chicken after the last basting about 15 min. before you remove the chicken from the oven.
I like to serve over rice with steamed carrots and broccoli.

Salty and sweet, this tasty chicken recipe is one that the kids will go crazy over! Our kids ages 2-5 are very picky about their chicken but they can't get enough of this.  No leftovers with this recipe.
