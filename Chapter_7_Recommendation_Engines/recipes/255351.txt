Ingredients:
4 cups water
8 cups whole fresh cranberries
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon orange zest
1 orange, juiced
3 cups raw honey
1 cup fresh blueberries
1/4 cup tart cherry juice concentrate

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Add cranberries. Simmer over medium heat, stirring regularly, until cranberries burst, about 10 minutes. Stir in ginger, cloves, and orange zest. Pour in orange juice.
Microwave honey in a microwave-safe bowl until runny, about 30 seconds. Scrape into the pot with a spatula. Add blueberries. Simmer until flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and stir in cherry juice concentrate.
Transfer cranberry sauce to small bowls and chill until set, about 1 hour.
