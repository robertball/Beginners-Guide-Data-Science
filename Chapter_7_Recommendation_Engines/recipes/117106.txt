Description: 
Onion soup mix accents the flavor of this easy beef-and-rice combo shared by Carol Trussler, 'Just add a green salad, and your meal is ready,' says the Petersburg, Ontario cook. TIP: Don't have these exact ingredients on hand? Feel free to replace the frozen peas with corn or green beans, or use Swiss cheese instead of shredded cheddar cheese.
