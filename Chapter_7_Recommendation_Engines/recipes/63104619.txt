Ingredients:
12 Chicken tenderloins (or 6 chicken breasts)
1 cup Panko breadcrumbs, plain
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. paprika
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
2 egg whites
1 Tbsp. water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil then spray with cooking spray.
In a shallow dish such as a pie plate or deep plate, mix together the breadcrumbs and all the spices.
In another shallow dish or bowl, beat egg whites with water.
Dip each piece of chicken in the egg, then cover with breadcrumbs. Place on baking sheet.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until no longer pink inside. Larger pieces of chicken will take longer to cook.
Makes 6 servings, serving size 2 tenderloins (or one breast)

My 5 year old daughter's favorite dinner. When she sees these cooking in the oven she jumps up & down excited. Could also be made into homemade chicken nuggets if you cut the chicken into small pieces.
