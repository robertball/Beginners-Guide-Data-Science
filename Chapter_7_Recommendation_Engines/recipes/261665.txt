BBQ Chicken Puffs Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into 1/2-inch squares
1 cup shredded cooked chicken
¼ cup barbeque sauce
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste (optional)
½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a miniature muffin tin.
Cut puff pastry along the creases into 3 separate rectangles. Place onto a lightly floured surface. Roll 1 rectangle to 1/8-inch thickness using a lightly floured rolling pin. Cut pastry into 8 circles about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Repeat with the other 2 rectangles.
Press pastry circles into the greased muffin cups. Place 1 square of cream cheese in the bottom of each cup.
Mix shredded chicken, barbeque sauce, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the mixture into each cup until level with the top of the cup.
Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is heated through, 20 to 25 minutes. Spoon 1 teaspoon Cheddar cheese on top of each pastry 3 minutes before removing from oven.

Description: 
I made this recipe up when I didn't have enough time to run to the store. I just used leftover shredded barbeque chicken, some puff pastry, and other ingredients that I had in my kitchen. These were a hit at the party and the first appetizer to go!
