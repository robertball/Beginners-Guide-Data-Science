Ingredients:
15 pounds fresh tomatoes
2 cups chopped celery
3 large onions, peeled and cut into chunks
1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
2 medium beets
4 carrots
3 cloves garlic, peeled
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
1/3 cup lemon juice
6 quarts water, or as needed
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup salt, or to taste

Directions:
Use a juicer to process the tomatoes, celery, onion, green pepper, beets, carrots, and garlic. Place all of the juice into a large pot. Stir in the sugar, black pepper, horseradish, lemon juice, and enough water to make a thin consistency. Season with Worcestershire sauce to taste. Bring to a boil, and continue boiling for 20 minutes.
Ladle into 1 quart jars leaving 3/4 inch of headspace. Stir 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt into each jar. Wipe rims clean, and place lids and rings onto jars. Process in a pressure canner for 35 minutes at 10 pounds of pressure.
