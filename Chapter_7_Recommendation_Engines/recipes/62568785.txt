Description: 
This quintessential coconut cream pie calls for lots of half-and-half that is cooked up with other tasty ingredients into a lavishly rich cream filling. Then the shredded coconut is stirred in and the filling is spooned into a waiting crust. Top with whipped topping and toasted coconut - if you dare.Modified from: Old Fashioned Coconut Cream Pie
