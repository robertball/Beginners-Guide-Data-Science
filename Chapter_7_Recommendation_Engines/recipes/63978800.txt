Ingredients:
2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 large egg, beaten with 1 t water
12 oz bittersweet chocolate (chips work fine)
sugar for dusting

Directions:
Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment or oiling it lightly.  Cut each sheet of pastry into 12 squares and brush each with egg glaze.  Then sprinkle 1/2 oz of chocolate (a few chips) on each square and roll up tightly around the chocolate.  Place on the baking sheet, seam down.  Cover with plastic and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.  Refrigerate remaining egg glaze.
Remove pastries from fridge; preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Brush the tops of the pastries with remaining egg glaze, and then dust lightly with sugar and bake for about 15 min.  Better to cool them at least a bit, or the butter taste is a little overwhelming.
