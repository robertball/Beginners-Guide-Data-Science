Ingredients:
1/4 cup bourbon
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup chopped green onion
3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, chopped
4 (6 ounce) salmon fillets (about 1 inch thick)
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine first 8 ingredients in a large zip-top plastic bag, and add salmon to bag. Seal and marinate in refrigerator 1-1/2 hours, turning bag occasionally.
Prepare grill or broiler.
Remove salmon from bag, reserving marinade. Place salmon on a grill rack or broiler pan coated with cooking spray. Cook 6 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork, basting frequently with reserved marinade.

Description: 
The marinade/basting sauce for the salmon fillets is a study in contrasts: bright citrus and sweet, smoky bourbon.
