Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dry penne pasta
1 medium head garlic, peeled and chopped
1/2 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
In a skillet, saute garlic in oil on low heat, just hot enough to make the garlic sizzle; about 10 to 15 minutes.  Season with basil, oregano, parsley, and crushed red pepper, and remove from heat.
In a large bowl, toss cooked pasta with garlic and herb mixture, and let sit for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sprinkle with Parmesan, and serve.

Description: 
Pasta with herbs, delicious sauteed garlic, and plenty of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Chop the garlic so that some is minced and some is larger pieces. You can substitute 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning blend for the fresh herbs.
