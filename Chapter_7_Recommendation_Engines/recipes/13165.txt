Ingredients:
1 pound yellow split peas
1 onion, diced
4 onions, thinly sliced
4 tablespoons margarine
6 cups chicken stock
1 pound peeled, seeded and diced sugar pumpkin
1 pound salt beef, fat removed and diced
1 green chile pepper, chopped
3 dashes aromatic bitters

Directions:
Rinse and pick over the yellow split peas and soak overnight in clear water.
Saute the onions in the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the soaked split peas, chicken stock, pumpkin, salt beef, chili pepper and bitters. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until the peas are soft.
Allow the soup to cool and then puree in a blender. Adjust the seasoning and reheat and serve with a little nutmeg sprinkled on top.
