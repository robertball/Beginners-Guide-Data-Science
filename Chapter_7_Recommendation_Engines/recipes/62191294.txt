1 box Betty Crocker Fluffy White frosting mix
1/3 cup light corn syrup
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup boiling water
***1 box (16 oz or one pound) powdered sugar
1/2 cup walnut pieces or pecan pieces, or more if you wish.
*** A 1 lb. box of Powdered sugar has 15 servings of 1/4 cup. Do the math for that and it comes to around 3 & 3/4 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Beat frosting mix, corn syrup, vanilla and water in a small deep bowl on low until well blended. Then on high 5 minutes or unti stiff peaks form. Transfer to a larger bowl and gradually beat in sugar. Fold in nuts if you are using them.
Drop by teaspoonfull on to wax paper. The Divinity will not increase in size so drop them in whatever size you want for a finished product.
Let Divinity dry for about 4 hurs or until dry to the touch and firm. Turn the pieces over and let dry for about 12 hurs.
Store in an airtight container. this makes 5 tp 6 dozen pieces.

Description: 
Little white fluffy clouds of goodness. I had looked for ages to make good Divinity and never could until I found this recipe. I have served this to a friend who wouldn't think of using a no cook anything and she didn't know the difference. I found this on a package of Betty Crocker Fluffy White Frosting Mix. It is awesome and so good.
