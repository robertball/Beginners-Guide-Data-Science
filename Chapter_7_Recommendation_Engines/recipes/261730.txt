2 cups instant corn flour
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

1 cup almond milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons maple syrup

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch cake pan.
Mix corn flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.
Mix almond milk, oil, and maple syrup together in a small bowl. Fold into the corn flour mixture until batter is just moist. Spread mixture into the prepared cake pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I'm always looking for traditional foods I can make when my mom comes over for dinner. She is on a very strict gluten-free, vegan diet so there are not a lot of options that are simple or cheap. This cornbread turned out a little dense but soft, kind of like the outside of a tamale with a semi-crisp crust. The whole family enjoyed it!
