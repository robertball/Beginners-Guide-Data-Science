Ingredients:
Beef:
2 pounds cubed beef (can be cut into smaller pieces)
2 can Cream of Mushroom soup
1 can French Onion soup
--------------------------------
Rice:
1/2 cups white rice or rice of choice
1 small onion (chopped)
2-3 small pats of butter or margarine
1 can chicken or beef broth (your flavor choice)
10 oz. of water
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Beef:
*Take beef cubes and roll into a small amount of flour. Just enough to make a light coating on them.
*Place in an over safe container (bowl or pot)
*Add Cream of Mushroom soup and French onion soup
Place in preheated 300* degree oven and bake until beef is done and tender. If you find your oven setting HIGH - and beef seems to be scorching or burning on top. Place a cover over the dish. Recipe will have a thick creamy sauce.
-------------------------------------
Rice: 20 mins before beef is done:
On the stove top - Melt butter in a pot (I use cast iron for all my pots and pans) When all white foam has sizzled from the butter add your chopped onion. Cook onions stirring occasionally (careful not to burn or scorch) until translucent and clear. At this point add your broth and water. Bring to a rolling boil. Add your rice (Stir). Reduce heat to low and cover. Check often and stir when needed. Cook for about 15-20 mins. Salt and Pepper to taste.
You can spoon beef mixture over the rice - or serve on the side.
