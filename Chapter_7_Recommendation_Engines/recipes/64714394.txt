Ingredients:
1 cup almond flour
0.7 oz Swerve® confectioner’s sweetener
1 tsp vanilla essence
1.4oz unsalted butter, melted
7 oz full-fat cream cheese
¼ cup Swerve® confectioner’s sweetener
Juice and zest of 4 limes
1 tsp powdered gelatin
1 TB hot water
1 cup heavy cream
Finely grated zest of 1 lime, to garnish
10 drops lime vitality essential oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F.
Combine the almond flour, confectioner’s sweetener together in a bowl.
Whisk the vanilla essence into the melted butter
Add to the almond flour
Mix well.
Press the mixture down into a medium-size, round spring form tin (7-inches in diameter) compacting down in a firm, even layer.
Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, then remove and allow to cool completely.
Combine the cream cheese, confectioner’s sweetener, lime EO, the zest and lime juice in a bowl. Mix well and set aside.
Dissolve the gelatin in the hot water and keep aside.
Whisk the heavy cream to semi-stiff peaks, then add the gelatin (which should have cooled slightly) and whip to stiff peaks. This addition of gelatin stabilizes the cream.
Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese/lime mixture and pour into the baking tin on top of the crust.
Place in the fridge to chill completely (even better if its overnight).
To serve, remove the pie from the tin and peel away any parchment. Garnish your Low Carb Key Lime Pie with finely grated lime zest and cut into 8 decadently delicious slices.
