Ingredients:
6 Medium Russet Potatoes
1 Head of Garlic
6 Tbsp Unsalted Butter, room temp
1 tsp Sea Salt
1/4 tsp Ground Black Pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Poke holes in each potato with a fork.
Cut off the top of garlic head, then wrap tightly in foil.
Place potatoes and garlic on a rimmed baking sheet and bake on lower rack of oven until potatoes are tender, about one hour.
Remove potatoes and let cool for 15 minutes, while continuing to roast garlic in oven for an additional 15 minutes. Then cool in foil.
While the garlic cools, cut the potatoes in half length-wise, then quarter to make 24 short wedges.
Scoop out the flesh of the potatoes and reserve it for another use. Leave about 1/4" thick potato skins.
Increase the oven temperature to 425.
Squeeze the garlic out of it's skin into a small bowl and use a fork to mash into a paste with the butter, salt, and pepper.
Divide the garlic paste among potato skins using about 1/2 teaspoon each, spread evenly.
Roast the potato skins in a shallow baking pan until golden and crisp, about 20-25 minutes.

Description: 
I love potato skins, but am not a fan of cheese. This version uses garlic in place of the cheese and bacon found on standard potato skins.
