Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed Tomato Soup (Regular, Healthy Request® or 25% Less Sodium)
1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (7.5 ounce) package refrigerated biscuits
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until it's well browned, stirring often to break up meat. Pour off any fat.
Stir the soup, water, Worcestershire and black pepper in the skillet and heat to a boil. Spoon the beef mixture into a 1 1/2-quart casserole. Arrange the biscuits around the inside edge of the casserole.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the biscuits are golden brown. Sprinkle the cheese over the beef mixture.
