Ingredients:
2 2/3 cups all purpose gluten free flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup vegan shortening, softened
7-8 tablespoons of ice water

Directions:
Use a pastry blender to mix together the flour, salt and shortening. Slowly add the ice water as you mix to get the desired consistency: a crumbly but soft and tacky dough.
Once the dough is mixed, use your hands to separate  into two balls.
You can add more flour as you roll it out to keep it from sticking to your rolling pin and/or counter.
Cover your pie with foil so that the dough doesn't burn. Remove the foil for the last 20 minutes or so of baking.

Description: 
I made this vegan GF pie crust this year at Thanksgiving since we had some GF guests. Even the non-GF guests were impressed by how it turned out. The key is to use the GF all purpose flour  (not the 1:1 baking flour) and to use it immediately (don't chill it).
