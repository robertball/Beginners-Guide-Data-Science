Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup white sugar
1 cup flaked coconut
2 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup buttermilk
3 carrots, grated
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, with juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 muffin pans, or use paper liners.
In a large bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, allspice and salt. Mix in brown sugar, white sugar and coconut. In a separate bowl, combine eggs, oil, 1/2 cup buttermilk, carrots, pineapple, and vanilla. Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture and add the egg/buttermilk mixture.  Mix until batter is moistened. Fill muffin cups 3/4 full.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the tops spring back when lightly tapped. Allow to cool.
In a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 2 to 3 tablespoons buttermilk. Mix until smooth, then refrigerate until thickened. Drizzle over cooled muffins.
