Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
3/4 cup milk
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups.
In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, beat together oil, 3/4 cup sugar, egg and milk. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture, just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.
While muffins are baking, mix together 3/4 cup white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. While muffins are still hot, dip tops in melted butter and then in cinnamon sugar mixture.
