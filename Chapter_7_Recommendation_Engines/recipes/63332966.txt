Ingredients:
1 large eggplant- sliced in half
1 tsp olive oil or pan coating
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cracked black pepper
4 to 5 cloves of garlic
1 lemon- juiced (seeds removed)
1/3 cup pitted Kalamata olives (or large green Spanish olives with pimiento) and a little juice from the jar, too!

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Place eggplant halves cut side down on a sheet pan and either spray with pan coating or coat with olive oil on all sides.  Roast for 30 minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool before removing skins.
Place all remaining ingredients and eggplant pulp in a food processor and puree for a few minutes for a smooth dip or roughly chop for a tapenade style condiment.  Serve with Tuscan pane, pita chips, or  crostinis as an appetizer.

Description: 
Such a simple thing to make with a depth of flavor that makes even the beginning cook a gourmand.  I used to serve this in my Italian and Mediterranean restaurants with the bread baskets in lieu of butter or olive oil.  Not to be confused with Babaganoush, this dish is very low in calories and high in fiber & flavor, making it ideal for dieters.
