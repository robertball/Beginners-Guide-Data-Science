Ingredients:
2 tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 large potatoes, cut into wedges
1 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix paprika, olive oil, garlic powder, chili powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until marinade is smooth.
Place potatoes in a baking dish; add marinade and rub into potatoes. Sprinkle bread crumbs over potatoes and coat each wedge well.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C) and continue cooking until wedges are tender enough to puncture with a fork, about 30 minutes more.
