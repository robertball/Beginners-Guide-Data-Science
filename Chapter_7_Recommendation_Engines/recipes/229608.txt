Description: 
When a crazy old lady hits you in the head with her purse...and she's carrying a Colt 45 in it...that's the kind of kick you want when you drink a bloody mary. I like it spicy, and I hope you do too. Add vodka and whatever garnishes you prefer. Allow to chill for at least 8 hours so that the evil inside can mature. Drink it down, enjoy the heat, and be nice to your grandma.
