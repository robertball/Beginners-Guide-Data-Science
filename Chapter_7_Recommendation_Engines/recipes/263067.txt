Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 medium yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 red onion, cut into thin wedges
2 tablespoons harissa sauce, or more to taste
8 (1/4 inch thick) slices eggplant
1/4 teaspoon salt, divided
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
8 ounces Halloumi cheese, cut into 8 slices
8 slices multigrain seeded sandwich bread
4 tablespoons softened butter

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add bell pepper and onion; cook until very tender, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a separate skillet. Stir in harissa sauce.
Brush both sides of eggplant slices with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon each salt and black pepper. Add 1/2 of the eggplant slices to the skillet. Cook until browned and tender, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining slices; keep warm.
Sprinkle Halloumi with remaining 1/8 teaspoon each salt and black pepper. Add 1/2 of the Halloumi to the skillet and cook for 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining slices.
Layer eggplant slices, bell pepper mixture, and Halloumi on 4 bread slices. Top with remaining bread slices. Spread outsides of sandwiches with butter.
Transfer 2 sandwiches to the large skillet; cover sandwiches with a plate weighted with cans of food. Cook until heated through and toasted, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining sandwiches.
