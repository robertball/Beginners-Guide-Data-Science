Ingredients:
1 large butternut squash
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup shredded coconut
1 tablespoon garam masala
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups vegetable broth, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Cut ends off of butternut squash and peel with a vegetable peeler. Cut in half lengthwise, scoop out seeds and strings, and cut into 3/4-inch cubes. Put butternut squash into a 9x13-inch roasting pan and drizzle with olive oil; toss to coat. Mix in coconut, garam masala, curry powder, salt, and pepper; toss to cover squash evenly with the spices.
Roast in the preheated oven until butternut squash pieces pierce easily with a fork, 25 to 35 minutes.
Transfer roasted squash in batches to a food processor and add enough broth to cover squash. Process on low setting for 15 to 20 seconds. Repeat with remaining roasted squash. Transfer to a pot and heat until warm.
