Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup minced shallot
2 cups chicken broth, divided
2 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
6 ounces riced broccoli
1/2 teaspoon garlic granules
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, about 5 minutes.
Slowly pour in 1/2 cup chicken broth and stir to scrape up any bits of shallot. Add cream cheese and whisk to break up any lumps. Pour in remaining broth and whipping cream. Stir in Cheddar cheese, riced broccoli, and garlic granules. Simmer for 4 minutes.
Add xanthan gum and whisk continuously until soup is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately with freshly ground black pepper.
