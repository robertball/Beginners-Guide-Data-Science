Ingredients:
2 teaspoons canola oil
1 sweet onion, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
1/3 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoons water
1 prepared whole wheat pizza crust
1 (8 ounce) round Brie cheese, thinly sliced
1 cup fresh raspberries
1 fresh peach, sliced
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly oil a pizza stone or a baking sheet.
Heat canola oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion in the hot oil until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add rosemary, pepper, and salt.
Transfer onion mixture carefully to an electric blender, add water, and puree gently. Spread puree on prepared crust. Top with Brie cheese, raspberries, and peach slices.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly, 6 to 8 minutes. Top with fresh basil.

Description: 
This savory fruit pizza recipe is gorgeous, unusual, and very pleasing. It is good warm, room temperature, or slightly chilled. It makes a lovely centerpiece for brunch, an appetizer, or side dish. Perhaps it could be drizzled with honey or warm orange marmalade for an adult dessert. I am eager to read your reviews and variations on this recipe! Cheers!
