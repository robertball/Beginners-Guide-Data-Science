Ingredients:
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken
2 tablespoons taco seasoning mix
1 cup diced tomatoes with habaneros (such as RO*TEL(R) Hot)
1 cup finely chopped onion
½ cup finely chopped celery
½ cup shredded carrot
1 cup prepared salsa
¼ cup water

Directions:
Put chicken into the crock of a slow cooker. Sprinkle taco seasoning over the chicken. Layer diced tomatoes with habaneros, onion, celery, and carrot over the chicken, respectively; top with salsa. Pour water over the entire mixture.
Cook on Low until the chicken is easily shreddable, 6 to 8 hours. An instant-read thermometer should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Shred the chicken with 2 forks and stir with the salsa mixture.
