Ingredients:
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½  red bell pepper, seeded
¼ cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon heavy cream
salt and pepper to taste
4 slices white bread

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain, cool and chop.
Bring a small pot of water to a boil; add the bell pepper and cook until soft, about 10 minutes.
Combine the bell pepper, chicken, cream, and mayonnaise in a food processor. Blend until mostly smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Spread about half of the mixture on each of two slices of bread and sandwich with the remaining bread.

Description: 
This a great sandwich which is well known here in Chile. Creamy chicken with cooked bell pepper gives this sandwich a nice taste!! You can also make them with cocktail bread for a great appetizer! You can use up to double the mayonnaise for a creamier texture.
