2 tsp Grey Poupon or other Dijon mustard

6. Spoon 1/4 of the chicken on to the tortilla.over the right 2/3.

Begin rolling the burrito by  picking up the end closest to you and pulling over the chicken. Tuck in the right and left sides. Pull the edge folded over the chicken in to lock in the right and left sides. Begin rolling until the 1/3 with the cream cheese is wrapped up.  Set Wrap tightly in plastic wrap if traveling, or serve.Repeat for the other 3 wraps.
8a. Salad version: Wash lettuce thoroughly, and put greens on each place. Put 1/4 of the chicken into a ramekin and press to mold it. Turn it upside down in the middle of the greens.
