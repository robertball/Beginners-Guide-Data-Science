Ingredients:
1 stick butter - melted
1 teaspoon cinnamon (plus a little extra)
1 tablespoon milk
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 package cooking butterscotch pudding

Directions:
Mix the first 4 ingredients together, well, fold in 1 package cooking butterscotch pudding (the dry mix, do NOT make the pudding)
Place 1/2  butter mixture in the bottom of the pan. ( I added pecans too)  top with 9 Rhodes Rolls . Sprinkle with a little extra cinnamon, add the other 1/2 butter mixture. Add another layer of 9 Rhodes Rolls. Let sit over night on the counter and bake in the morning @ 350 for 1/2 hour.
Note: Rhodes rolls = frozen bread rolls.  They are in the frozen food section by the frozen bread dough. One package is enough for two batches.
