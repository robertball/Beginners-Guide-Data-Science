Ingredients:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup minced red onion
1/2 cup finely chopped tomato
2 tablespoons dill pickle relish
1/2 teaspoon ground piri piri chile pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia fillets
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons butter
4 slices pepperjack cheese
4 slices whole wheat bread, toasted

Directions:
Stir together the mayonnaise, onion, tomato, relish, and piri piri in a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside.
Season the tilapia fillets on both sides with the seafood seasoning and garlic powder. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the tilapia fillets until they are golden brown on both sides and no longer translucent in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place two slices of pepperjack cheese on top of each fillet, cover the skillet, and cook until the cheese has melted.
Place each tilapia fillet onto a slice of toasted bread, spread with the reserved sauce, then top with the remaining slices of bread.
