Ingredients:
1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
3 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons lemon pepper
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
6 (4 ounce) fillets salmon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix bread crumbs, pecans, and fresh parsley together in a small bowl.
Whisk olive oil, soy sauce, brown sugar, lemon pepper, thyme, basil, dried parsley, and garlic powder together in another bowl.
Pour the brown sugar glaze generously over each piece of salmon. Cover the top of each fillet with bread crumb mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes depending on thickness.
