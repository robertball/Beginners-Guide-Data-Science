Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 1/3 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees F)
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
FILLING:
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil
1 medium tomato, peeled and chopped
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 garlic clove, minced
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon dried basil
Dash pepper
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the sugar, oil, salt and 2-1/2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Meanwhile, in a skillet, saute onion in oil until tender. Add tomato, tomato sauce, garlic, salt, basil and pepper. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until thickened. Cool to 110 degrees F-115 degrees F. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into 12 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Place 3 in. apart on a greased baking sheet. Make an indention in center of rolls. Fill with 1 tablespoon filling. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 20 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to wire rack. Serve warm.

Description: 
I made these rolls from my Aunt Ethel's recipe. The tomato herb filling rises and spills over the top of the crusty roll tops. Folks have a hard time eating just one.
