Ingredients:
1 smoked turkey carcass
1 (32 fluid ounce) container vegetable broth
2 cups water
2 cups chopped fresh green beans
1 1/2 cups frozen corn
1 cup shredded carrot
1 cup white rice
1/2 cup chopped celery, or to taste
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, or more to taste
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place turkey carcass in a large soup pot and pour vegetable broth and water over the turkey frame. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat falls from the bones, 1 to 2 hours. Remove carcass, pick the meat from the bones, and discard bones. Chop turkey meat and return to broth.
Stir green beans, corn, carrot, rice, celery, onion, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper into soup; bring to a simmer and cook until celery is tender and rice is cooked, about 1 more hour. Stir cream cheese and Cheddar cheese into soup until melted and smooth. Season with black pepper.
