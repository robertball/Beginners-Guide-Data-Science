Ingredients:
3  cups Greek yogurt
3  tablespoons lemon juice (or juice of one lemon)
1  garlic clove, minced
1  large English cucumber, diced
1  tablespoon salt (for salting cucumbers)
1  tablespoon fresh dill
1 tablespoon fresh mint,
salt & freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Peel cucumbers and dice. Put them in a colander and sprinkle with the tablespoon of salt (draws water out).
Cover with a plate and sit something heavy on top.
Let sit for 30 minute Drain well and wipe dry with a paper towel.
In food processor or blender, add cucumbers, garlic, lemon juice, dill and/or mint, and a few grinds of black pepper. Process until well blended, then stir into yogurt.
Taste before adding any extra salt, then salt if needed. Place in refrigerator for at least two hours before serving so flavors can blend.
This will keep for a few days in the refrigerator, but you will need to drain off any water and stir each time you use it.
