Ingredients:
1 c white sugar
1 c light brown sugar
3/4 c cocoa powder
1 3/4 c flour
1 1/2 t baking powder
1 1/2 t baking soda
1 t salt
2 eggs
1 c milk
1/2 c vegetable oil
2 t vanilla
1 c hot coffee (or boiling water)
FROSTING
6 T butter
2 2/3 c powdered sugar
1/2 c cocoa powder
1 T espresso powder
1/3 c milk
1 t vanilla

Directions:
Heat oven to 350-degrees. Grease and flour two 9-inch pans.
Beat together eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla in large mixing bowl.
In separate bowl, stir together sugars, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add to egg mixture in mixer.
Stir in hot coffee and pour into pans.
Bake 30 - 40 minutes for round, 35-40 for rectangular. Cool for 10 minutes then remove from pans to wire racks.
FROSTING - Beat butter in mixing bowl. Add powdered sugar and cocoa alternatively with milk. Add vanilla. NOTE: I like to double the frosting recipe to ensure I have plenty for the cake.
