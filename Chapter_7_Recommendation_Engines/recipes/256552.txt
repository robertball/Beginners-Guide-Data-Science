Ingredients:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
4 teaspoons sweet pickle relish
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 tablespoon minced white onion
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1/8 teaspoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon dry mustard
1/8 teaspoon ground paprika
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 frozen hamburger patties
8 cups salad greens
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup chopped dill pickle chips

Directions:
Mix mayonnaise, pickle relish, ketchup, minced onion, olive oil, sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, dry mustard, paprika, salt, and pepper in a bowl to make sauce. Refrigerate until flavors combine, at least 30 minutes.
Preheat a large grill pan over medium heat. Cook hamburger patties, turning occasionally, until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Chop patties into bite-sized pieces.
Toss chopped hamburger patties, salad greens, Cheddar cheese, diced onion, and pickle chips in a large bowl. Top with sauce before serving.
