Ingredients:
3 cups uncooked wide egg noodles
1/2 pound ground turkey
1 medium onion, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2/3 cup nonfat dry milk powder
1/2 cup water
4 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese, cubed
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1 garlic clove, minced
1 1/4 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Cook noodles according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook turkey and onion over medium heat until turkey is no longer pink; drain. Stir in tomato sauce and Italian seasoning. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10 minutes. In a saucepan, combine milk powder, water, cream cheese, parsley and garlic. Cook and stir over medium heat until cream cheese is melted.
Drain noodles; add to cream cheese mixture. Transfer to an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Top with turkey mixture. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted.

Description: 
Back in the 1950's, when my husband was diagnosed as diabetic, we had five children at home to feed. I made this casserole often...and it satisfied us all. We all agree it's still as delicious today as it was then.
