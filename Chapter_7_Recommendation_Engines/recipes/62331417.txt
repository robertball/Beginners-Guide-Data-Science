Ingredients:
*  4 6-ounce salmon fillets, skin removed
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 cups fresh basil leaves
* 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
1.  Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Fill a bowl halfway with ice water. Set broiler on high. Place the salmon on a foil-lined broiler pan and season with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Cook, without turning, until the salmon is the same color throughout and flakes easily, 7 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness; set aside.
2. Meanwhile, add the basil to the pot and cook for 5 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the basil to the ice water. Drain and squeeze to remove any excess water. Place on a paper towel and pat dry. Place the basil, oil, pepper, and the remaining salt in a blender and puree until smooth.
3. Transfer the salmon to individual plates and drizzle with some of the basil oil. (You can cover and refrigerate the remaining oil for up to 2 weeks.)
