Ingredients:
1 tablespoon white sugar (optional)
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon (optional)
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cups quick cooking oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups dark brown sugar, packed
3/4 cup butter
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
6 very ripe bananas, mashed
3 eggs
2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups chopped dates
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup toasted flake coconut (optional)
1/4 cup dark brown sugar, divided
2 tablespoons chopped dates, divided
2 tablespoons chopped walnuts, divided
2 tablespoons toasted flake coconut, divided (optional)
1 tablespoon butter, melted (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease 4 loaf pans, 7x3-inch size. Combine 1 tablespoon white sugar with 2 teaspoons cinnamon in a small bowl. Dust the insides of the greased loaf pans with the cinnamon sugar.
Stir whole wheat flour, oats, all-purpose flour, baking soda, 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Beat 2 cups brown sugar with 3/4 cup butter in a separate mixing bowl until creamy. Beat in sour cream, bananas, eggs, and vanilla extract until smooth. Stir the dry ingredients into the banana mixture and fold in 2 cups dates, 1 cup walnuts, and 1/2 cup toasted coconut.
Spoon the batter into the prepared loaf pans. Sprinkle tops of each loaf with about 1 tablespoon of dark brown sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons each of dates, walnuts, and coconut. Brush each loaf with melted butter for a shiny glaze.
Bake loaves in the preheated oven until browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean,  about 1 hour.
