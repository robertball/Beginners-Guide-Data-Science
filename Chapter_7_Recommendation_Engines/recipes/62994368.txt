Authentic Tabbouleh Recipe

Ingredients:
1/2 cup fine (#1 grade bulgar)
6 ripe tomatoes
1/2 Small/Medium Onion finely minced
5 bunches Italian Parsley
1/2 bunch fresh mint, minced
1 bunch (or six stems) of green onion
Dressing:
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup vegetable or olive oil
3/4 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice
Salt, black pepper, and Cayenne pepper to taste

Directions:
1.  Wash and rinse the bulgar until the water becomes clear.  Place clean bulgar in medium/large bowl (I  like to use large bowls because it's easier to mix).
2.  Mince (or dice, but keep them small) tomatoes and add to bulgar.  Let this mixture sit for 30 minutes to an hour, allowing the bulgar to absorb tomato juice and allowing it to expand.
3.  Mince onions and then the greens in order listed (parsley, mint, green onion) and add to bowl.
4.  In a separate small bowl add tomato paste, olive oil, lemon and stir until the paste dissolves a little.  Add dressing to salad, then proceed to season.
