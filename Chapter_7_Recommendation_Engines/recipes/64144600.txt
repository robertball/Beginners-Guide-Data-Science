Ingredients:
In a large mixing bowl add:
1 pound ground lamb
1/2 pound loose pork sausage--hot or sweet
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/2 tsp. paprika
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper
1/4 C. finely chopped fresh parsley OR 1 TBL dry parsley flakes

Directions:
Mix the ingredients well, with your hands.  Roll the meat mixture into a ball and wrap tightly with Sarah wrap.  Allow the herbs and spices marry with the meat in the refrigerator for at least one hour, or up to 12 hours.
Divide the meat into six equal parts and form patties.
Grill or pan-fry until the juices run clear; about 6 to 7 minutes per side.  For juicer burgers, cover the plate of cooked burgers loosely with foil.  Allow to rest 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
