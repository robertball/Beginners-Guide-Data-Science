Ingredients:
Quinoa, about 1 1/4 cups UNCOOKED
Milk, 1 cup
Egg, 1 large
Granulated Sugar, 1 tbsp
Salt, 1 pinch
Baking Powder, 1/2 tsp

Directions:
Process quinoa in a food processor until it becomes a fine powder. Measure out 1 cup of the quinoa flour.
Combine quinoa flour with the remaining ingredients, stirring well to prevent lumps.
Cook pancakes on a griddle or in a pan sprayed with cooking spray, spooning on batter in desired size. Flip pancakes when bubbles start to appear on side facing up and cook on second side until done through and bottom is brown and has released from the pan.
