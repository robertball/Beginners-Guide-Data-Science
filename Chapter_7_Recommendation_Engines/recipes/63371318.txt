Ingredients:
2/3 c. crunchy peanut butter
1/2 c. honey
1   c. whole wheat flour
1/4 c. oats
1/2 c. sesame seeds, raw
1/2 t. cinnamon
1/4 t. salt (optional)
3   T. ground flax seed

Directions:
Combine the flour, oats, cinnamon, flax seed, and salt (if desired)in a medium sized serving bowl using a fork. Add the peanut butter and honey and mix together until thoroughly combined. Take a teaspoon and shape the mixture into balls using your hands.
Set aside.
Meanwhile pour about half of the sesame seeds into a large frying pan and dry roast them over low heat, making sure the seeds are evenly distributed. Stir or shake the pan every minute or so. It should take less than 5 minutes.
Keep in mind that sesame seeds, like any oily nut or seed, continue to cook for a minute or so after being removed from the heat source.
Set these aside to cool slightly and roast the other half of the sesame seeds.
Now take and roll the peanut butter balls in the roasted sesame seeds, coating them thickly all over.
