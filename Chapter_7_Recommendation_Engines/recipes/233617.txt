Description: 
This is an easy cold dip that my husband begs me to make every holiday. I originally got the recipe from my mother-in-law, and I substituted chives for the green onion since I am allergic to onions. They can be added back into the recipe if desired. I serve this with celery sticks, baby carrots, sliced peppers, and crackers.
