Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed, divided
3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into chunks
1  onion, diced
1  red bell pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2  carrots, chopped (optional)
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons curry paste
Â¼ cup maple syrup

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, red bell pepper, and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add carrots and cook over low heat until carrots are slightly tender, about 5 minutes more.
Mix chicken, cream, and curry paste into onion mixture and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Add maple syrup and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
My sister made this for me one time and I have made it for others and the recipe has been passed on so many times.  My sister ate this at a friend's house and tried to re-create it without the recipe. She tried so many times and discovered that making it great had to do with the cream! Serve with basmati rice with saffron.
