Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 red bell pepper, chopped
2 bunches asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
1 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon pepper
3 tablespoons butter
1 pound grilled chicken breast strips
1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup pecan halves (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, red pepper, and asparagus; cook and stir 5 minutes until the garlic softens and mellows. Pour in the chicken broth, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Simmer until the vegetables have softened, then add the basil, salt, pepper, butter, and chicken. Cook and stir a few minutes until the chicken is hot. Stir in the cooked pasta, then fold in the Parmesan cheese and pecan halves to serve.

Penne pasta tossed with asparagus, red peppers, pecans, and Parmesan cheese in a delicious sauce that is creamy without being over-powering. This has been a tremendous hit every time I've made it.
