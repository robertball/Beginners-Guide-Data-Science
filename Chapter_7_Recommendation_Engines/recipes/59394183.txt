Ingredients:
2 1/4cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup margarine, softened
1/4 cup vegetable shortening
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
1/4 cup molasses
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together the flour, ginger, baking soda, cloves, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine, shortening,1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, then stir in the water and molasses. Gradually stir the sifted ingredients into the molasses mixture. Shape dough into walnut sized balls, and dip the tops of the balls in the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar. Place the cookies 2 inches apart onto an un-greased cookie sheet, and flatten slightly.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
