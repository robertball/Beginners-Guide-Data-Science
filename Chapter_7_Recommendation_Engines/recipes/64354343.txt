Ingredients:
1/4 cup raw cashews
1 1/2 cups cold water
2 ounces pimientos (half of a 4 oz. jar)
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast flakes
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chilies (optional but SO GOOD!)

Directions:
Soak cashews in hot water while combining the remaining ingredients (except chiles) in a blender. If you donâ€™t have a high powered blender, soak cashews for an hour or two in hot water first.
Add cashews to blender and process on high for 1-2 minutes.
Cook in a sauce pan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thick. Add chiles and serve or use in other recipes that call for cheese sauce.
