Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) container pineapple-flavored cream cheese (such as PhiladelphiaÂ®)
3 (12 inch) flour tortillas
1/2 pound thinly sliced deli ham
3 green onions

Directions:
Spread cream cheese onto each tortilla and top with ham. Lay 1 green onion on 1 end of each tortilla. Starting with the green onion end, roll tortilla into a log. Cut ends from each roll to make a clean edge. Cut each log into 1/4- to 1/2-inch pieces.

Description: 
These little appetizers are quick and very easy. What goes better together than pineapple and ham? They can be made 'seasonal' by using different flavored tortilla with different coloring. The logs can be made ahead of time and refrigerated overnight. Cut when ready to serve.
