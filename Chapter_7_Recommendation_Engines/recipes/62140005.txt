Ingredients:
1 1/2 lb coarse wholemeal flour
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 pint buttermilk (approx.)

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare a baking tray by dusting lightly with plain flour.
2. mix together the dry ingredients, then add the buttermilk, gently stirring until just mixed together. If the dough feels stiff or dry, add a bit more buttermilk.  It should be a fairly soft and wet dough
3. Form into a round on the baking tray, then cut a cross in the top with a buttered knife.
4. Bake for 45 minutes, or until bread is browned, and sounds hollow when tapped. (Note: if you do not like a hard crust, place a pan of hot water on the rack in the oven under your bread.  This will keep the crust soft.

Description: 
This recipe is over 300 years old!  I found it in an old cookbook and cherish it dearly. Bear in mind this is a very dense, very rustic loaf, and creates a very hard crust.  But it is fun for an authentic irish treat.  Because of the recipes age, all of the rising comes from the buttermilk, rather than bread soda (baking soda).  If you prefer a lighter loaf, you may add 1 t. of bread soda to the dry ingredients and substitute 1/2 lb. of wholemeal flour with white flour.
