Ingredients:
1 head of cauliflower
2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
2 Tbls butter
8 oz. low-fat sour cream
salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
1 Tbls chopped chives

Directions:
Place cauliflower in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water.  Cover for approximately 15 minutes.  When you can pierce the cauliflower with a fork, it is done.  Remove the basket and let the cauliflower  drain.  Put cauliflower, garlic, and butter in a bowl and with an electric mixer, mix them together on low.  Add salt, pepper, and sour cream. Turn mixer to high and whip until smooth.  Taste to see if it needs more salt.  Stir in chives.  Serve hot.
