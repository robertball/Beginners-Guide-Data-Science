Ingredients:
1 lb. chicken cooked and shredded
1/2 cup sour cream
1 small can mild green diced chili peppers
1 small can diced black olives
1 clove chopped garlic
1/3 cup chopped cilantro
1 cup shredded mexican cheese
1 jar verde salsa (Mrs. Renfros is my favorite)
flour tortillas

Directions:
Mix chicken, sour cream, chili peppers, olives, garlic, cilantro, 3/4 cup cheese, and 1/2 the jar of salsa.
Spoon out enough salsa into the casserole dish to barely cover the bottom.
Spoon chicken mixture into tortillas, roll up, and line up in the casserole dish.
Sprinkle the remainder of the cheese on top of the enchiladas.
Bake in oven at 350 until browned on edges (about 20 minutes)

Description: 
These are great enchiladas!  I like them better with verde sauce instead of the normal red enchilada sauce.
