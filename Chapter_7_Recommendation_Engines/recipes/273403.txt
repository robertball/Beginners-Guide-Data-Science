Ingredients:
Dipping Sauce:
1/2 cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt
1/4 cup jarred roasted red peppers - drained, patted dry and chopped
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
Chicken Tenders:
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pound chicken tenders
1 cup Italian-seasoned panko (Japanese bread crumbs)
1 large egg, lightly beaten

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine Greek yogurt, red peppers, balsamic vinegar, basil, salt, pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder in a mini food processor. Blend until smooth and refrigerate dipping sauce until ready to use.
In a small bowl combine 1/4 teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle over chicken tenders and toss to coat evenly. Set aside.
Toast panko crumbs in a skillet over medium-high heat until a golden brown color, 4 to 5 minutes. Place panko into a shallow dish. Crack egg into a separate shallow dish. Dip chicken tenders first into egg, letting excess drip off, then coat with panko. Place tenders on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, turning over halfway through, 12 to 15 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve with the dipping sauce.
