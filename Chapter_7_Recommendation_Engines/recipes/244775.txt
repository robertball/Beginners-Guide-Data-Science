Ingredients:
3 cups gluten-free flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch ground nutmeg (optional)
2 1/4 cups white sugar
1 cup applesauce
3 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups shredded zucchini

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
Mix flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Beat sugar, applesauce, eggs, oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir in zucchini. Slowly mix flour mixture into zucchini mixture until well blended; pour into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.

Description: 
Got this recipe from someone else but made some changes to it, to make it not taste gluten-free. My family loves bread and my husband is always looking for something that taste 'normal'. So this is as close as it gets for muffins.  They are actually really good. The extra applesauce really makes it moist and not too dry! The batter will look runny but when you take them out of the oven they will be nice and soft. I can't keep them long, they go so fast!
