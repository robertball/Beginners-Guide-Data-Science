3 tablespoons shrimp paste
2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons black soy sauce
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/2 pounds pork spareribs, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon peanut oil (groundnut oil)
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Mix shrimp paste, fish sauce, black soy sauce, and sugar together in a bowl. Add spareribs, stir to coat, and marinate for 20 minutes.
Mix cornstarch, peanut oil, and water together in a separate bowl; stir into spareribs and marinate, 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove spareribs from marinade and discard marinade.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add spareribs, cover, and steam until cooked through, about 15 minutes.
