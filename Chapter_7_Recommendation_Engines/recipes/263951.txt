Ingredients:
6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup cold cream cheese
1 tablespoon iced water
1 1/2 teaspoons cider vinegar

Directions:
Place a medium bowl into freezer to chill.
Wrap cubed butter in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Place 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour in a medium bowl; add salt and whisk to combine. Rub in cream cheese using clean fingers until mixture develops coarse crumbs. Place cream cheese mixture and chilled butter into a gallon-size resealable plastic bag.
Flatten the cream cheese-butter mixture into thin flakes through the bag, using a rolling pin. Freeze until mixture is firm, about 10 minutes. Pour mixture into the chilled bowl. Sprinkle with water and vinegar, tossing lightly with a spatula. Knead until dough holds together and is slightly elastic.
Place dough back into the plastic bag and flatten into a disk. Refrigerate, 45 minutes to overnight, before using.
