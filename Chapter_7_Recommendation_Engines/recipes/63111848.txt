Ingredients:
20oz Cubed Stewing Beef (Can substitute with Lamb, but changes flavor slightly)
4 slices of Bacon
1 yellow onion
2 cloves garlic minced
1 tbsp Butter or Oil
2 cups Red Wine (cheap merlot works great)
1 can Stewed Diced Tomatoes
2 cups Mushrooms Sliced
1 cup Dired plums
1 1/2 tsp mustard powder
1 tsp dried sage
1 tsp cloves, powdered
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
Chop the yellow onion into large chunks. In a large pot, melt the butter and cook the garlic and onion until lightly brown. Chop the the 4 strips of bacon into small pieces and cook out the fat.
In a second pot (I use a crock pot for this), pour wine and bring to a simmer. Chop the dried plumbs into quarter sections and add to wine. Cook on medium heat (high heat for crock pot) approx 10mins. Add the sliced mushrooms and cover.
In the bacon pot, add the can of stewed tomatoes with all liquid. Add the meat
and let everything cook until meat is brown on the outside, about 20 minutes. Once browned, add bacon pot to the Red Wine pot.
Add the salt and pepper and spices once you've combined everything to a single pot. Cook 2 1/2 hours on medium heat if using a stove. 2 hours on high heat if using a crock pot.
Serve with bread, rice, or potatoes.

Description: 
I experimented with the ingredients that I had in an attempt to make a stew that resembled the Lamb and Plum Stew from The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. The stew in the book used Lamb, but I opted to use beef since it's easier to find. It's rich and warms your belly, and super easy to make if you've got time to let it simmer.
