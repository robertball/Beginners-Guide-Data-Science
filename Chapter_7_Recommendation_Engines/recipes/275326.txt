Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
⅓ cup candied ginger
2 ½ teaspoons apple pie spice
2 teaspoons baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
2 ¼ cups light brown sugar
⅔ cup vegetable oil
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
⅓ cup applesauce
3  eggs
½ (12 ounce) package miniature semisweet chocolate chips (optional)
1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
¼ cup maple syrup
1 ½ teaspoons apple pie spice
¼ cup water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®).
Combine flour, ginger, apple pie spice, baking soda, and salt in a food processor. Pulse until finely ground and set aside.
Beat brown sugar and oil together in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add pumpkin, applesauce, and eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition until well combined. Mix in flour mixture, followed by chocolate chips. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool for about 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 90 minutes.
Combine confectioners' sugar, maple syrup, and apple pie spice in a bowl for glaze. Whisk until smooth, adding water 1 teaspoon at a time until desired consistency is reached. Drizzle glaze over cooled cake.
