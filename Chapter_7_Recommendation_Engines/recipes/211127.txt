Description: 
Perfect for taco bars! This can be easily adapted to a slow cooker, but the pressure cooker really seals in the flavor and cuts down on cooking time. All the leftover broth from the pressure cooker is packed full of flavor, great as a starter for chile verde, and freezes well. Serve carnitas with white corn tortillas, guacamole and pico.
