Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups diced extra-firm tofu
2 carrots, diced
1 stalk celery, diced
1/3 cup chopped broccoli florets
1/4 head red cabbage, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
2 tablespoons dried parsley
2 tablespoons dried savory
1 tablespoon dried rosemary
2 (32 fluid ounce) containers chicken stock
1 pound dried split peas
2 cups fresh spinach
1 cup red quinoa
1 ancho chile pepper (dried poblano pepper)
1 dried cayenne pepper
1 bay leaf
water, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add tofu; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in carrots, celery, and broccoli; cook until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add cabbage, garlic, parsley, savory, and rosemary; cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
Pour chicken stock into the pot. Add split peas, spinach, quinoa, whole ancho chile pepper, whole cayenne pepper, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until split peas soften and break down, about 1 hour. Add water if soup appears too thick.
Season soup with salt and pepper. Discard ancho chile pepper, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf before serving.
