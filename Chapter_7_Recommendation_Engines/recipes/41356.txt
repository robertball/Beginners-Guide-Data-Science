Ingredients:
1/2 cup lime juice
1/2 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons honey
2 garlic cloves, minced
6 (4 ounce) boneless pork loin chops
SAUCE:
3/4 cup reduced sodium chicken broth
1 garlic clove, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons honey
1/2 teaspoon lime juice
1/8 teaspoon browning sauce
1 dash pepper
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first four ingredients. Add pork chops. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and discard marinade. Grill chops, covered, over medium heat or broil 4 inches from the heat for 6-7 minutes on each side or until juices run clear.
For sauce, combine the broth, garlic, honey, lime juice, browning sauce and pepper in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil. Combine cornstarch and water until smooth; stir into broth mixture. Return to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with pork chops.
