Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
2 cups shortening
2 egg yolks
1 cup molasses
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cream of tartar
4 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 cup sour milk
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
1/2 cup water
18 large marshmallows
2 egg whites
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup white sugar and shortening until smooth. Stir in the egg yolks and molasses. Combine the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and ginger; stir into the molasses mixture alternately with the sour milk. Cover and chill for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). On a lightly floured surface roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into rectangular shapes (I like to use a Spam can). Place cookies 1 inch apart onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
To make the frosting, combine 1 1/2 cups sugar, vinegar, water and marshmallows. Mix well and place over a pot of simmering water. when the marshmallows have melted, stir in the egg whites. Remove from heat and beat with an electric mixer for 7 minutes. Stir in the vanilla and confectioners' sugar until well blended. Frost cooled cookies.
