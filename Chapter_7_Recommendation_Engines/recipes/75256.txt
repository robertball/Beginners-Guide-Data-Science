Ingredients:
1 gallon whole milk
1 lemon, juiced
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
1 onion, finely chopped
1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1/2 cup canned whole kernel corn
1/2 cup frozen peas
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
In a large saucepan, bring the milk to a boil. Stir in the lemon juice. Continue cooking 15 minutes, stirring constantly, until curds have formed. Using a cheese cloth, separate the cheese from remaining liquid, and set aside.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stirring constantly, cook the cumin seeds and onion in the skillet until golden brown. Mix in the bell pepper, corn, and peas. Season with garam masala, turmeric, and chili powder. Continue to cook and stir 10 minutes, until vegetables are tender.
Mix the cheese into the skillet. Reduce heat to low, cover, and continue cooking 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro to serve.
