Ingredients:
8 thick slices pancetta
3 tablespoons olive oil
12 shiitake mushrooms, sliced
15 crimini mushrooms, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
15 kalamata olives, pitted and halved
2 tablespoons capers
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2 cups fresh spinach, stems removed
2 cups arugula
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the pancetta in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Chop into small pieces.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the shiitake and crimini mushrooms in the hot oil for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add the garlic, olives, capers, lemon juice, and balsamic vinegar; cook another 8 minutes.
Combine the spinach, arugula, bacon pieces, and the mushroom mixture in a large bowl; toss until the spinach and arugula leaves are coated. Sprinkle the feta cheese over the salad; season with black pepper to serve.
