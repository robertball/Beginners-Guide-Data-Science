Ingredients:
2 tablespoons kosher salt
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons sweet paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder or minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon adobo seasoning (optional)
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 rack (6 to 7 pounds) pork spareribs
Barbeque sauce

Directions:
Make the spice rub; Mix together and set aside.
Rinse the spareribs and pat them dry.  Rub them with about 1/4 cup of the spice blend and place them meaty side up on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet.  Let the the ribs sit, uncovered in the refrigerator for a few hours.
To bake the ribs and finish cooking them on the grill, preheat oven to 250F.
Place the baking sheet with the ribs in the oven and bake until tender, 2 1/2 hours.
When ready to grill, preheat the grill to medium.
Arrange the ribs on the grill meatier side down.  If you want more glazed ribs, baste them with the barbecue sauce.  Grill the ribs for 15 minutes with the grill lid closed.  Turn the ribs over, baste the meaty side with the barbecue sauce, and grill until the ribs have good grill marks, 15 minutes longer with the lid closed.  Check the grill frequently; once the barbecue sauce is added, it can cause flare-ups.
Remove the ribs from the grill and let them sit for 5 to 10 minutes or so.  Warm the remaining barbecue sauce in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Slice the ribs and serve them passing a pitcher of the warm barbecue sauce on the side.
