Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
8 canned sliced pineapple rings (drain and reserve juice)
1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts
1/2 cup flaked coconut, divided
2 canned sliced pineapple rings, chopped
12 maraschino cherries
1/2 cup reserved pineapple juice
1/2 cup coconut water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 ripe banana, mashed
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour the melted butter into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Sprinkle the brown sugar evenly over the butter.
Arrange 8 pineapple rings in two rows in the baking dish.
Sprinkle the macadamia nuts, half of the flaked coconut, and 2 chopped pineapple slices between the rows of pineapple rings.
Place a maraschino cherry in each pineapple ring, then scatter the remaining cherries over the coconut mixture. Set baking dish aside.
Whisk together the pineapple juice, coconut water, vegetable oil, and eggs in a large bowl. Stir in the mashed banana, yellow cake mix, and remaining flaked coconut until well blended.
Slowly pour the batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then run a paring knife between the cake and the edge of the pan.
Cover the cake pan with a large serving plate, and invert it to tip the cake out of the pan and onto the plate with the pineapple slices showing.

Description: 
On my way to a Hawaiian-themed party, all I could think of was Pineapple Upside Down Cake. The recipes did not seem Hawaiian enough. The additions of coconut, banana and macadamia nuts brought the tropics to the recipe. I can't tell you how many people raved at the party. The whole cake is gone.
