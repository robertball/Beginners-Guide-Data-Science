Description: 
This simple sandwich is the love child of a blueberry blintz and a cream-cheese-and-jelly sandwich. To make this sandwich, only the very freshest bread and the very freshest sour cream should ever be used. Also, proper blueberry blintz-wiches are always prepared immediately before eating, never ahead of time.
