Ingredients:
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 yellow bell pepper, diced
3/4 teaspoon butter, divided
8 tomatoes, peeled and sliced
1 medium onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups chicken broth
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Place the red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper in a large pot with 1/4 teaspoon butter, and cook, stirring constantly, until peppers are slightly charred. Mix in tomatoes, onion, garlic, and chicken broth. Season with salt, sugar, cloves, oregano, and basil. Bring to a boil, and cook 20 minutes, until tomatoes are soft.
Mix the milk and cornstarch in a small saucepan, and stir until smooth. Place saucepan over medium heat, and stir in remaining 1/2 teaspoon butter. Continue to cook and stir until thickened. Mix into the pot with vegetables.
Strain about 1/2 the vegetables from the soup and transfer to a blender. Blend until smooth, and return to the pot. Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and let sit about 5 minutes before serving.
