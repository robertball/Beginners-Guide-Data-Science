Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked spaghetti
2 (24 ounce) jars RAGÚ® Old World Style® Traditional Sauce
2 cups mozzarella cheese
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Heat the sauce in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the cream cheese and stir until melted. Pour pasta and sauce into an oven-safe baking dish and mix well.
Bake for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and top with mozzarella cheese. Bake until the sauce is thick and the cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes.
