Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons milk powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3 1/3 cups bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons garlic powder (optional)
4 ounces crumbled feta cheese (optional)

Directions:
Place the first set of ingredients into the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select DOUGH cycle; press START. Do not put in the olive oil, garlic powder or feta cheese.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. When the cycle has ended, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and divide into 2 halves. Roll each half out into a circle that is about 9 or 10 inches across. Brush the top of each circle with olive oil.
Place the bread circles oil side down onto the grill. Brush the other side with olive oil, and watch carefully. When the bottom side is browned, turn over the bread, and grill the other side until golden. If desired, sprinkle with garlic powder and feta cheese.

Description: 
A flatbread that starts in the bread machine and ends up on an outdoor grill. My sister 'discovered' this bread when she had a batch of bread dough rising in her bread machine when the power went off for the whole day. Incredible.
