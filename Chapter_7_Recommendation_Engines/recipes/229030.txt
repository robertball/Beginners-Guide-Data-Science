Ingredients:
4 cups ground beef
1  onion, chopped
4 cups shredded cabbage
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
2 cups warm water (100 to 110 degrees F/40 to 45 degrees C)
⅓ cup butter, melted
⅔ cup instant dry milk powder
¼ cup white sugar
1 ½ teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1  egg, beaten
4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir ground beef and onion until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in cabbage and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Continue to cook and stir until cabbage is tender, about 20 more minutes. Set mixture aside to cool.
Mix warm water and butter in a large bowl. Combine dry milk powder, sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and yeast in another bowl; stir into butter mixture. Add egg and gradually stir in flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until dough is smooth.
Roll dough out to 1/4-inch thick on a lightly floured surface; cut into 4-inch squares. Scoop beef mixture into each dough square. Bring corners of a dough square together at the top and pinch corners together to seal. Place on a baking sheet, seam side down. Repeat with remaining beef mixture and dough. Cover rolls with a damp cloth and allow to rise for 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
