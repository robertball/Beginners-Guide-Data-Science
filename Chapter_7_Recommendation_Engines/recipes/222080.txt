Ingredients:
3 pounds chuck roast
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup reduced-sodium beef stock
2 onions, chopped
2 pounds potatoes, peeled and cubed
3 carrots, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Season the chuck roast with salt and pepper.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; brown roast on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer roast to a slow cooker. Pour the beef stock into the skillet, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the broth and onions into slow cooker; cover and cook on Low for 5 hours. Add potatoes, carrots, celery, and parsley. Cover and cook on Low until roast is tender and cooked through, 3 additional hours.
