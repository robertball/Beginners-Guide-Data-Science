Ingredients:
1 pound fettuccine pasta
¼ cup butter
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into strips
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
4 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
1  green bell pepper, sliced
1  red bell pepper, sliced
½ cup butter
1 pint heavy whipping cream
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1  egg, beaten

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken and garlic in butter until chicken is browned. Add mushrooms, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper; cook and stir until vegetables are tender.
Melt remaining 1/2 cup butter with half the heavy cream in a large saucepan over medium heat. Gradually add Parmesan cheese, alternating with pieces of cream cheese, stirring constantly. Stir in remaining heavy cream, simmering until sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir chicken and vegetable mixture into cream sauce.
Transfer pasta to the saucepan and stir in egg. Cook and stir for 1 minute and serve immediately.
