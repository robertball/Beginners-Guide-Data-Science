Yucatan Potato Salad Recipe

Ingredients:
6 russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 fresh poblano chile peppers
3 hard cooked eggs, chopped
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped red or sweet onion
3 medium sweet pickles, chopped
12 green olives, sliced
1/4 cup lime juice
1 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 T chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon mustard powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the potatoes into a saucepan, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Place the peppers into the oven so that they sit directly on the rack. Roast, turning every 10 minutes or so, until evenly charred. Place in a paper bag to sweat, then remove the peel when they are cool enough to handle. Remove the stem and seeds, and chop.
In a large bowl, combine the still warm potatoes, peppers, eggs, celery, red onion, sweet pickles and olives. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the lime juice, vegetable oil, chopped cilantro, salt, pepper and mustard powder. I like to use a high speed mixing wand to help it emulsify. Pour over the potato salad, and stir to coat. Adjust seasoning to taste and serve.

Description: 
This is not your regular potato salad. Potatoes are combined with roasted peppers, olives, onion and sweet pickle in a lime dressing. Try this when you want to be a little different.Modified from: Yucatan Potato Salad
