Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons cold butter or margarine
2/3 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
coarse salt

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour, cheese, baking powder, sugar and salt. Cut in butter until crumbly. Stir in milk just until moistened. Knead on a floured surface for 1 minute; divide in half.
Roll each portion into a 12-in. x 8-in. rectangle; cut each into 8-in-long strips. Fold strips in half, pinching the edges, and twist into pretzel shapes. Place on greased baking sheets. Brush with egg and sprinkle with coarse salt.
Bake at 400 degrees for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve immediately.
