Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fresh or frozen skinless salmon fillets, about 1-inch thick
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon snipped fresh oregano
Freshly ground black pepper
Fresh blueberries
Fresh oregano (optional)
Blueberry Tzatziki:
2 (5.3 ounce) containers VOSKOSÂ® Nonfat Blueberry Greek Yogurt
1 teaspoon finely shredded lemon peel
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup crushed blueberries

Directions:
Thaw fish, if frozen. Prepare Blueberry Tzatziki (see Step 4 below); chill.
Preheat broiler. Rinse fish; pat dry with paper towels. Measure thickness of fish. Brush fish with oil and lemon juice; sprinkle with oregano and pepper.
Place fish on the greased unheated rack of a broiler pan. Broil 4 inches from heat until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Allow for 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness of fish, turning once if fish is 1 inch thick or more. Serve fish with Blueberry Tzatziki and blueberries. Garnish with fresh oregano (if desired).
Blueberry Tzatziki: Whisk together the VOSKOS(R) Nonfat Blueberry Greek Yogurt, lemon peel, and garlic in a bowl. Stir in crushed blueberries. Cover and chill until serving time or up to 24 hours.
