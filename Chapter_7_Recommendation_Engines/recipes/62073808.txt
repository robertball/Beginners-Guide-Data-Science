Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. small new potatoes (I like red ones)
1/3 cup olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 tsp. chilli powder
1/2 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. paprika
2 Tbsp red or white wine vinegar
1 red or green pepper, seeded and sliced
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook whole, unpeeled potatoes in boiling water until almost tender, 20-25 min.  Drain, cool, and cut into chunks.  In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add potatoes, gently turning, until golden.  Meanwhile, stir together garlic, spices, and vinegar.  Add spice mixture to potatoes along with sliced pepper.  Cook for about 2 more minutes, or until potatoes and peppers are thouroughly coated with spices.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Serve hot or cold.

I sometimes make this dish instead of Spanish rice.  I also like this side dish with BBQ chicken or pork.
