Ingredients:
8 lemons, halved
8 limes, halved
1 lemon, sliced
1 lime, sliced
1 1/2 cup sugar
4 cups water, plus more to taste

Directions:
Heat grill to medium. Put sugar in a saucepan and press each citrus half into the sugar, then set on grill to char, cut side-down, until browned, about 5 minutes. Put the citrus slices on grill and char on each side for 30-60 seconds.
Add 2 cups of water to the saucepan containing the sugar and place pan on grill. Whisk until sugar is dissolved and remove from grill.
Juice all of the citrus into large pitcher; you’ll have about 3 cups. Strain if you wish. Add 2 cups water and the sugar syrup, ½ cup at a time, until the limeade is to your desired sweetness. Add more water if you’d like, then pour over ice and garnish each glass with a grilled citrus slice.
