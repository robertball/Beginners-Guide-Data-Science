Ingredients:
1 package refrigerated cinnamon rolls with icing
1 package bacon

Directions:
Put bacon on a rack in a foil-lined baking sheet and place the sheet in a cold oven.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F . Cook bacon for 5 to 10 minutes while the oven heats. Remove when it's lightly cooked but not crisp. Blot off excess grease with paper towels.
Unroll cinnamon doughÂ into a flat sheet. Cut strips in half widthwise. Place a piece of bacon on each dough strip. Roll up the dough to enclose the bacon. Place rolls in a lined or greased muffin pan.
Bake according to cinnamon roll package directions, or until golden brown.
Let cool for a few minutes before topping rolls with the icing that came with the rolls.
