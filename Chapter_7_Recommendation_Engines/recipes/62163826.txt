Ingredients:
1/2 lb of thin pan fry steaks, cut into strips
170g of hard chow mein noodles ( it was a package of 8 - 4" squares - I used 3)
1 cup of broccoli florets
1/4 white onion, chopped
4-5 garlic cloves, chopped
1/4 cup of soy sauce
2 tbsp of oyster sauce
2 tbsp of hoisin sauce
1 tbsp of red wine vinegar
2 tsp of chili sauce (optional)
1 tbsp sesame oil
1 tbsp honey or brown sugar
1 tsp of freshly ground pepper
1 tbsp of garlic powder
1-2 tbsp of olive oil

Directions:
Mix the oyster sauce, the soy sauce, the hoisin,the chili sauce, red wine vinegar, sesame oil, honey, garlic powder & pepper together in a small bowl. Brush the mixture onto the steak strips and broccoli and refrigerate for 4 hours to overnight. Reserve some marinade for the noodles.
Heat a pot of water to boil. When boiling, add the chow mein noodles and cook as per package directions - mine were 3 minutes.
While the water is heating up, add oil to a Wok or deep dish pan and set to medium. Add onion and let cook for a few minutes, add garlic and beef/broccoli mixture and let cook for 1-2 minutes before adding the cooked noodles.
Strain the chow mein and toss into the pan with the beef mixture. Add the remaining sauce and toss with some tongs and let cook for another minute.

Description: 
I just mixed familiar Asian flavours together to make this oh so simple dish. Sometimes simplicity makes the best dishes. This is fast dinner to whip up any night to break the normal dish routine.
