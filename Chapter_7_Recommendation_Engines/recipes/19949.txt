Ingredients:
1 beef tongue
5 fresh green chile peppers
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 white onion, sliced thinly
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 small tomatoes, halved and sliced
2 (15 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained
salt to taste

Directions:
Wash tongue and place in a large pot of water to cover.  Simmer until no longer pink, about 50 minutes per pound of tongue.  Remove from water and let rest until cool enough to handle.  Peel skin from tongue and trim gristle.  Cut into 1/4 inch slices.
Place whole peppers in a skillet over medium-high heat and roast, turning, until all sides are charred.  Let cool, rub off skins.  Remove stems and seeds.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Saute chile peppers, onion and garlic until onion is translucent.  Stir in tongue and continue to cook until tongue is brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cook until limp, 5 minutes.  Pour in corn and heat through, 2 to 5 minutes.  Season with salt.  Serve immediately.
