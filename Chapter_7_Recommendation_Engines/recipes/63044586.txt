Ingredients:
16 fl oz water, simmering (195°F to 205°F)
4 tbsp coarse ground French or Vienna roast coffee
1 eggshell (rinsed and crushed)
1 pinch of wood chips, hickory or apple
¼ tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp honey (1 tbsp for each mug)
2 tbsp cream (1 tbsp for each mug)
Pinch of powdered cinnamon (to taste)

Directions:
Just before starting to brew, mix 1 tbsp of honey and 1 tbsp of cream in each serving mug.
In a french press coffee maker place the coffee grounds, eggshells, wood chips and vanilla extract.  Pour in the hot water and stir.  Let it steep for four minutes then stir again and plunge.
Pour the hot, dark liquid into each of the serving mugs and stir to mix with the cream and honey.
Serve with a small container or shaker of powdered cinnamon so that it may be added to taste.

Description: 
The first time I tasted coffee I was very disappointed.  The flavor was not at all similar to the smell and instead was quite bitter.  This recipe, however, makes a beverage that fulfills the promise made by the smell of coffee.
