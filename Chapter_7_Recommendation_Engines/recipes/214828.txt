Ingredients:
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup Italian dressing
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon molasses
2 pounds flat iron steak, cubed
1 tablespoon dried chopped onion
4 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise and toasted
1 cup prepared coleslaw (optional)

Directions:
Mix the ketchup, Italian dressing, soy sauce, and molasses in a small bowl. Place the steak in slow cooker, sprinkle with onions, and pour the ketchup mixture over the steak.
Turn the slow cooker to High and cook for 1 hour. Reduce the heat to Low and continue cooking until the meat is tender, about 4 hours. Serve on hoagie buns and top with 1/4 cup coleslaw, if desired, for a Southern BBQ flavor.
