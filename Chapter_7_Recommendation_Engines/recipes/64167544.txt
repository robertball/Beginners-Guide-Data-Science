Mix all the flours together with a whisk until completely combined.
Add the soft butter to the flour mixture using your fingers.
Once the butter and flour are mixed together add the sugar and mix well.

Make sure that the dough is not tacky to the touch.  Add more rice flour if necessary by sprinkling a tsp at a time until achieving the right consistency.

Description: 
This is a gluten free version of the Italian pasta frolla. I use it for making crostata di frutta or Fruit Tortes.  It has a sandy texture true to the traditional Italian recipe.  I developed this flour mixture after running out of cornmeal which is common in most GF versions of this pastry.  Enjoy!
