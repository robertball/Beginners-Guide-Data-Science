Ingredients:
2-3 slices of bacon (try apple or maple-smoked for the best flavor)
2 slices of whole wheat or whole/multi-grain bread
2 tablespoons peanut butter, creamy or chunky
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat.
Add bacon slices and fry both sides until crisp and golden.
Remove cooked bacon from pan and place on paper towels to drain away fat.
Toast slices of bread in a toaster until golden brown.
Smear peanut butter, then honey on one slice of toast.
Add bacon slices.
Top with second slice of toast.
Enjoy!
