Ingredients:
1 lb  linguine
2 whole  chicken breasts
1/4 cup  butter
1/4 cup  oil
2 cloves  garlic -- minced
2 bunches  broccoli -- chopped
1 lg  red pepper -- 1" pieces
1 tsp  salt
1 whole  lemon juice
parmesan cheese

Directions:
Put on water for linguine.  Bone chicken and cut into 1" pieces.  Heat butter and oil in large skillet, add garlic & saute 2 min.  Add chicken and cook, stirring constantly, until golden.  Add broccoli & red pepper. Cover and cook to desired tenderness, but be aware that the longer the broccoli is cooked, the more it loses its flavor.  Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle with lemon juice and cook 2 min.  when water comes to a boil, cook linguine, then drain pasta.  Add chicken and vegetable sauce to pasta and toss to coat evenly.  Serve with grated Parmesan cheese.
