Ingredients:
5 cups finely chopped roasted almonds
2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
4 eggs
1 (1 ounce) bottle almond extract, or to taste
1/4 cup white sugar
45 whole almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Mix chopped almonds, 2 cups white sugar, and cocoa powder together in a bowl; add eggs and almond extract and stir until batter is well mixed. Form teaspoonfuls of batter into small balls.
Place 1/4 cup sugar in a bowl and roll balls in the sugar. Press a finger into the center of each ball, making an indentation. Place 1 almond in each indentation. Arrange cookies 2 inches apart on the baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to crisp, about 15 minutes.
