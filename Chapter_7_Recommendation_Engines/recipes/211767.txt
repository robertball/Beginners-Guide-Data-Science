Ingredients:
4 slices bacon (optional)
6 Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
1/4 cup butter
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and finely chopped
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into small pieces.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
Layer potatoes in the prepared casserole dish.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add jalapeno peppers, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour until smooth. Season with salt, cumin, chili powder, and pepper; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in milk, stirring until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
Remove sauce from heat. Add Colby-Monterey Jack cheese gradually, making figure 8 motions with a spoon until cheese is melted. Pour sauce over potatoes.
Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until potatoes are tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Top with bacon.
