Southwestern Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked quinoa (rinsed if needed, check the package)
1 cup low sodium chicken stock (for cooking quinoa) - OPTIONAL
Water (for cooking quinoa)
1 red bell pepper, chopped into small dice
1 can black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onion
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
OPTIONAL DRESSING - fresh squeezed lime juice, ancho chile powder, cumin, salt or seasoned salt

Directions:
Cook quinoa according to package directions.  I substitute chicken stock for half the water to add some extra flavor.
Drain the beans into a colander placed in the sink and rinse well with cold water, until no more foam appears.  Let beans drain until they are quite dry (or pat dry with paper towels if you want to speed it up.)
Cut out the stem and remove seeds from the red bell pepper and cut into very small dice (about the size of the black beans.)  Slice the green onions into thin slices and wash, dry, and chop the cilantro.
When the quinoa is fairly cool, combine quinoa, black beans, diced red bell pepper, and sliced green onion in a bowl.  At this point, add the dressing if you'd like.  Gently stir in the chopped cilantro and serve.

Adapted from www.kalynskitchen.com/2012/04/recipe-for-southwestern-quinoa-salad.html.  I liked the salad ingredients in this recipe, but I didn't like the taste of the dressing because it had too much olive oil.
