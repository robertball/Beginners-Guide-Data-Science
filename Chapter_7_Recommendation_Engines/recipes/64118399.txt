Ingredients:
1 pound bulk Italian sausage
8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
4 eggs
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup pizza sauce (recipe follows)
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning and/or basil
3 1/2 ounces pepperoni, chopped
1/2 cup green pepper, chopped (2 ounces)
8 ounces whole milk mozzarella cheese, cut into small cubes
1/2 cup red onion, slivered (1 ounce)
Crushed red pepper, optional
PIZZA SAUCE
8 ounce can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoons granular Splenda or equivalent liquid Splenda
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried basil, or to taste
*Bring all of the ingredients to a boil in a small saucepan. Partially cover the pot and simmer over low heat for 1 hour.

Directions:
Brown the sausage with the mushrooms; drain the grease. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs, cream, pizza sauce and seasonings in a medium bowl. Grease a 7x9" deep baking dish (or 7x12" shallow baking dish) and put in the meats, mushrooms, peppers and the mozzarella cubes. Pour in the egg mixture and mix well. Top with the red onion. Sprinkle with a little more garlic powder, Italian seasoning and a little crushed red pepper flakes, if you like. Bake at 350ยบ for 45-55 minutes until nicely browned and a knife inserted in the center comes out almost clean. Mine still had a bit of liquid in the center but it was done. Let stand about 5 minutes before serving.
