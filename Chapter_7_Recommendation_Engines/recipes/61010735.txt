Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
3 pounds boneless pork butt, trimmed
1 (18 ounce) bottle mild barbeque sauce

Directions:
Pour can of beef broth into slow cooker, and add boneless pork butt. Cook on High heat for 4 hours, or until meat shreds easily. Remove meat, and shred with two forks. It will seem that it's not working right away, but it will.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer the shredded pork to a Dutch oven or iron skillet, and stir in mild barbeque sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until heated through. Serve on mini slider buns.
