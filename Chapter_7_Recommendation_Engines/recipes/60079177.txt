Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf French bread, cut diagonally in 2 inch slices
6 eggs
1 cup milk
1 cup half-and-half cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup butter
1 1/3 cups brown sugar
3 tablespoons light corn syrup

Directions:
Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange the slices of bread in the bottom. In a large bowl, beat together eggs, milk, cream, vanilla and cinnamon. Pour over bread slices, cover, and refrigerate overnight, turning once.
The next morning, remove bread from fridge while oven preheats to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake, covered, for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine butter, brown sugar and corn syrup; heat until bubbling.  Remove bread from oven, turn bread, pour sauce over and return to oven for 20 minutes.

Description: 
I got this recipe from my sister in law. She and my brother had it at their gift opening after the wedding. I make it any time we have people staying with us, and it is always a hit. You may sprinkle the top with pecans if you wish.Modified from: Baked French Toast
