Ingredients:
8 pieces of chicken (boneless chicken breast quarters)
4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup flour
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp salt
1 small onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, chopped
12 pitted and chopped dates or apricots
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 liter bottled carrot juice

Directions:
In a gallon size resealable bag, combine flour, cumin, cinnamon, ginger and salt.
Pat dry the chicken pieces and add them to the bag. Seal and shake until uniformly coated with the flour mixture.
In a large pan or dutch oven heat oil and at medium temperature, brown flour coated pieces of chicken on all sides, until medium brown (you might have to work in batches). Set chicken aside.
Add chopped onion and garlic and sautee until onions are translucent.
Deglaze the pan with the balsamic vinegar, simmer until almost dry.
Add the carrot juice. Let it boil until it reduces to half. Add the dates/apricots and keep simmering until there's 1/3 of the original amount of liquid. Lower the heat and add the chicken. Sauce will thicken,  so stir occasionally and gently until you get a nice thick carrot glaze (it will be deep brown).
Enjoy!

Description: 
After searching the web for recipes that include carrot juice (had too much and nobody at home drinks it), I found two that used it with chicken. I decided to combine them both and got one of the best kitchen experiments in my life. Served it with saffron rice. Worth a try!
