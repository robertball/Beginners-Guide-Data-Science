Ingredients:
1/2 cup grated zucchini, squeezed dry
1/2 cup grated carrots, squeezed dry
1/2 cup grated onion
2 large cloves crushed garlic
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
1/4 cup light mayonnaise
1 cup oats
1 1/4 lbs ground turkey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Combine zucchini, carrots, onion, garlic, brown sugar, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, cumin, paprika, pepper, and salt. Stir in egg, mayonnaise, and oats. Mix in turkey.
Spray muffin tins with non-stick cooking spray. Spoon meat mixture into muffin tins, to about 1/4 inch from the top.
Bake 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven, cool ten to fifteen minutes, and remove from muffin tins.
Muffins will be a bit soft initially, but will firm up after sitting.

Description: 
In honor of Sneak Some Zucchini onto Your Neighbor's Porch Day, I came up with these healthy little meat muffins, which in addition to the dreaded zucchini also contain oats, freshly grated carrots, light mayo, and ground turkey. My teenaged son, who hated my old meatloaf recipe, tasted one, confiscated it (I was just getting ready to eat it!), then came back for a meatloaf sandwich.
