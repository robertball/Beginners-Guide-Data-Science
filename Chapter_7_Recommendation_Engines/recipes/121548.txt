Ingredients:
1/2 cup water (70 to 80 degrees F)
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1 egg
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons nonfat dry milk powder
4 1/2 teaspoons sugar
1 tablespoon ranch salad dressing mix
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3 cups bread flour
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
EGG WASH:
1 egg
2 tablespoons water
Poppyseeds or sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first 10 ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed).
When the cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly greased surface. Cut into 12 pieces; shape each into a round ball. Place in greased jumbo muffin cups or 4-1/2-in. disposable aluminum foil pans. (If using foil pans, place on two baking sheets.)
Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together egg and water. Brush over buns; sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds if desired. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
