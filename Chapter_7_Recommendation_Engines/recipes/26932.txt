Ingredients:
6 costeno amarillo chile peppers
1/2 pound tomatillos, husked
1 clove garlic
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a medium iron skillet over medium high heat, cook the costeno amarillo chile peppers, stirring constantly, until dark brown. Do not allow peppers to burn. Remove from heat and set aside.
Place tomatillos in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Cook 5 minutes, remove from heat and drain.
Place chile peppers, tomatillos and garlic in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth.
Transfer chile pepper mixture to a medium bowl. Mix in onion, cilantro and salt. Chill in the refrigerator until serving.

Description: 
This exciting salsa is bursting with flavor! If costeno chile peppers are not available, try substituting de arbol peppers -- they work just as well! This spicy salsa is great with fish, meat or chicken.
