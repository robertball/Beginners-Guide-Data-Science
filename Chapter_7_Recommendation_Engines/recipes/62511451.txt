Glaze:
3/4 cup ketchup

2 tbs milk
1 1/4 lb lean ground beef (85% or leaner)
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/2 cup onion, chopped

1/2 cup bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup canned diced tomatoes, drained
1/4 cup fresh flat leaf parsley, chopped
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees
In a small bowl combine ketchup, brown sugar, cider vinegar and Worcestershire sauce.  Mix until well blended. Set aside.
In a separate small bowl combine bread crumbs and milk.  Set aside.
In a large bowl add beef, salt, black pepper, onion, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, bell pepper, tomatoes, parsley and egg.  Add the breadcrumb and milk mixture to bowl. Mix well by hand until all ingredients are thoroughly combined.  Place in an un-greased loaf pan, cover with glaze and bake for one hour.
Let cool on a wire rack.  Serve warm.

Description: 
The best meatloaf ever!  No really.  This recipe has been years in the making.  I've tried every meatloaf recipe out there, but none of them wow'd me.  So in pursuit of the worlds best meatloaf, I created this recipe which I think is simply the best.  The very epitome of comfort food (you know the kind that makes you feel warm and fuzzy?).  Maybe it's only awesome to me, I don't know...I'll let you be the judge ;)

Serve with creamy garlic mashed potatoes or buttered egg noodles for a throwback experience :)
