Ingredients:
3 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/4 stick)
2 cups chopped yellow onions (1 large)
2 T cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
2 cups whole milk
1 bag baby spinach, chopped
1 cup freshly grated Asiago cheese
1 t kosher salt (regular is what I had)
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees
Melt 1.5 T. butter in a heavy-bottomed saute pan over medium heat.  Add onions and saute until translucent, about 10 minutes.  Add spinach and heat until wilted. Remove from pan; add remaining butter. When melted, add the flour and nutmeg and cook, stirring, for 2 more minutes.  Add the milk and cook until thickened.
Add the spinach/onions to the sauce.  Add 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese and mix well.  Season to taste with the salt and pepper.
Transfer the spinach to a baking dish and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan on top.  Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, or until hot and
bubbly.  Serve immediately.
