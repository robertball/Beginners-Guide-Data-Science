Description: 
Seriously, the juiciest pork tenderloin that I've ever made! The zero minutes is NOT a typo! The tenderloin cooks during the searing, pressure build up, and pressure release. The internal temperature upon removing from the pot was 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), but was at 148 degrees F (64 degrees C) after the resting time.
