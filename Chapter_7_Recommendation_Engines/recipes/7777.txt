Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package marble cake mix
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-OÂ®
1 cup boiling water
1 (1.3 ounce) envelope whipped topping mix
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
2 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Prepare and bake marble cake as directed on the box.
Poke holes in the cooled cake with a fork.  Dissolve the strawberry gelatin in 1 cup  boiling water.   Pour the gelatin over the cake, and refrigerate for 2 1/2 hours.
Combine whipped topping, vanilla pudding, milk, and vanilla in a mixing bowl.  Mix with an electric mixer on high speed for 3 to 5 minutes, until frosting is thick enough for spreading.  Frost the cake, and serve.  Store any leftovers in the refrigerator.

Description: 
This cake is fantastic to have all year long - but I use it primarily in the summer because it's kept refrigerated so it's nice and cool.
