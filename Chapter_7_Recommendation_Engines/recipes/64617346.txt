Description: 
Guys. Forget everything you know about cooked carrots. Forget cutting them into little pieces. Forget boiling them. Because from now on, this recipe for whole roasted carrots is the only one you’ll ever need. The smoky, flavor-packed result makes an excellent side dish to salmon or pork tenderloin. Should there be any leftovers, top them with a fried egg and serve with toast for breakfast, or chop them and add to a salad for lunch.
