Ingredients:
2 eggs, beaten
1 1/2 cups crushed saltines
2 pounds whitefish fillets, cut in half lengthwise
oil for frying
TARTAR SAUCE:
1 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish
1 tablespoon finely chopped onion

Directions:
Place eggs and cracker crumbs in separate shallow bowls. Dip fillets into eggs, then coat with crumbs. Let stand for 5 minutes.
In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F. Fry fillets, a few at a time, for 2 minutes on each side or until fish is golden brown and flakes easily with a fork. Drain on paper towels. In a small bowl, combine the tartar sauce ingredients. Serve with fish.

Description: 
Our family has an annual fish fry that centers around my mom's recipe. I think she makes the finest fried fish around. it's flaky and flavorful with a golden cracker-crumb coating, and her homemade tartar sauce is a fitting complement.
