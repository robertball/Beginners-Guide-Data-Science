Ingredients:
1/4 cup cooked crumbled bacon
1 cup cubed cooked chicken
1 (4 ounce) can small shrimp, drained
3 cups bean sprouts
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 (14 ounce) package egg roll wrappers
1 quart oil for deep frying

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the bacon, chicken, shrimp and bean sprouts. Season with soy sauce and garlic salt, and mix until well blended. Place a few generous teaspoons onto the center of one egg roll wrapper at a time, and roll up according to the package directions.
Heat enough oil to cover the rolls completely in a large heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Fry rolls a few at a time, turning once, until golden brown. Remove with tongs to drain on paper towels. They are delicious plain, or with plum sauce for dipping.
