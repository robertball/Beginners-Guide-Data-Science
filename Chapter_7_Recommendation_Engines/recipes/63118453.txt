Ingredients:
Crust:
1 3/4 to 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 envelope pizza crust yeast
1 1/2 tsp sugar
3/4 tsp salt
2/3 cup very warm water (120-130 degrees)
3 TBL extra virgin olive oil
Toppings:
1 TBL extra virgin olive oil
2 fresh or individually frozen boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1/2 cup barbecue sauce
1/8 cup (2 TBL) red onion, sliced
1 cup (4 oz) shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup shredded mild cheddar cheese
2 TBL chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Combine 1 cup flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add very warm water and 3 TBL oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead on floured surgace, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes.
Pat dough with floured hands to fill greased pizza pan or baking sheet. Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough.
Heat 1 TBL oil in skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook 5 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Remove chicken to cutting board and let rest 5 minutes. Cut into bite-size pieces.
Spread barbecue sauce over crust. Top with onions and cheese. Evenly top with pieces of chicken.
Bake on lowest oven rack for 12 to 15 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and crust is brown. Spirnkle with cilantro before serving.
