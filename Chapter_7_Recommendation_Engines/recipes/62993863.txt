Ingredients:
12 tablespoons margarine or butter
1 1/2 cup plain flour
8 oz Cream Cheese
... 1 cup Chopped Nuts (I'll be using pecans)
1 Large tub of Cool Whip
2 small boxes instant coconut pudding mix
1 1/3 cup powdered sugar
3 cups milk
1 large bag of coconut

Directions:
Mix flour, nuts, and butter with a pastry blender. Press lightly into a 9 x 11 casserole dish. Bake for 20 minutes at 350. Let cool completely. In a separate bowl, mix cream cheese, powdered sugar, and 1 cup of cool whip. Spread mixture over cooled crust. Crust is not solid so spread carefully. Sprinkle 1 cup of coconut over the mixture. Wisk together pudding and milk until slightly thick but still pourable and pour over coconut layer. Place in refrigerator until cold. Spread the rest of the cool whip on top and then another layer of coconut.
