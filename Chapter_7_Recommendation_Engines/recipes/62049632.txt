Tasty Homemade Calzone Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
16 oz. ricotta cheese
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 tablespoon black pepper
1 pinch table salt
(toppings of your choice - onions, green peppers, pepperoni are our favorites)
(pizza crust of your choice - either browse recipes here for homemade or puchase at store)
(pizza sauce of your choice - I recommend "Pasta/Pizza Sauce" by Jandee)

Directions:
Steam any vegetables until tender and cook/slice/prepare any meats ahead of time for ease of assembly.  While steaming veggies, continue with recipe.
Prepare your favorite pizza dough (I recommend "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" found in Bread section).  Roll and knead into a dough ball and divide the dough ball into two halves on floured surface.
Flatten each dough section into 6" circles.
In a separate bowl, combine ricotta and mozzarella cheese, black pepper, and salt.
Spread cheese mixture evenly over the two dough circles leaving approximately a 1/2 inch border of no cheese.  Drain and include any vegetables, keeping in mind that the center will not cook as well if overstuffed.  If in doubt, include less.
Fold dough circle in half and seal with fingertips, trying to keep any cheese out of the pinched seal.  Lightly pat the calzone to even the filling inside.  Check seal for any leaks.
Carefully place calzone on a lightly greased baking sheet and cut two 1/2 inch vents on top.
Bake in 425 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
Serve with your favorite pizza sauce on the side for dipping.
