Ingredients:
500mL milk
125mL sugar
60mL cornstarch
1mL salt
1 egg
25mL butter or margarine
5mL vanilla
1 banana
1 baked pie shell

Directions:
Slice a banana into the bottom of the baked pie crust.
Fill a double boiler 1/3 full of water and heat until boiling.
Pour the milk into the top of the double boiler and heat until bubbles form around the edges. Do not stir the milk!
Stir the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a mixing bowl. Gradually add this mixture to the milk to avoid lumping. Stir constantly for 15 minutes or until thick. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes longer.
Place the egg in a bowl and beat quickly.
Add about half the hot mixture to the beaten egg, stirring constantly.
Stir the egg mixture into the hot mixture that is left in the top of the double boiler. Cook 2-5 minutes longer.
Add the butter/mararine and vanilla. Stir. Cool.
Pour the cooled filling into the pie crust.
Cover with saran wrap and place in the fridge to chill.
