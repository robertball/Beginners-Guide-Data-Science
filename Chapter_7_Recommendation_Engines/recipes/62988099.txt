Ingredients:
¾ cup water (75- 85 degrees)
1 Tbsp oil
1 tsp lemon juice
1 Tbsp dry milk
1½ Tbsp brown sugar
1 tsp salt
2¼ cups bread flour
1¾ teaspoon yeast
¼ cup dried cranberries
¼ cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Put all ingredients in Bread machine to make dough.
Shape as desired.
Bake at 350 degrees for 15-25 Minutes.
I doubled the recipe, rolled into 24 balls. Put into greased cupcake pan and cut an X on the top with scissors before letting them rise again. (It is supposed to look like a cloverleaf roll. We'll see.)
