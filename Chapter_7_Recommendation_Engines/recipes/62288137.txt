Ingredients:
1/2 lb butter (or 1 1/2 sticks)
2c onion, diced
2c celery, diced
3-4 cloves garlic, quartered
5T flour
2-12oz cans tomato paste
1c white wine (or 1c water with 4 tsp wine vinegar)
2 quarts water
Better than Bouillon chicken base
1-2T sugar
white pepper (or ground black)
dried basil, ground in mortar n pestel
dried oregano, GIMNP
garlic powder
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup half&half;
fresh basil (optional)

Directions:
1. Melt 3/4 stick of butter slowly. Saut√© onion and celery in a skillet until very tender. Toward the end, add the garlic.
2. Liquify vegetables in a blender with 1 cup water to facilitate liquification.
3. In 4-quart pot, melt 3/4 stick (or as much as needed up to 1 1/4 sticks) butter slowly. Do not brown. Add flour. Cook 2-3 minutes.
4. Add tomato paste. Stir together with flour. Stir on medium to medium-high heat for 15-20mins, tending toward 20mins, until tomato paste has taken on a purplish tinge, indicating a deep caramelization.
5. Add wine; cook 2-3 minutes, until you can no longer smell the vinegar-y acidity wafting up.
6. Add chicken broth, sugar, seasonings. Cook 5 minutes, bringing it up to a simmer.
7. Add heavy cream and half&half. Simmer 15-20 minutes.
8. At this point the soup will be very flavorless. This is due to the lack of salt.  Add chicken base until the soup no longer tastes watery.  Reseason with basil and oregano.  Add garlic powder to taste (about 1/4 cup).
