Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package gnocchi pasta
4 tablespoons butter
1 cup sliced baby portobello mushrooms
3 cups baby spinach
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add mushrooms and saute for 2 minutes. Toss in spinach, basil, garlic, Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until spinach is wilted and sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Add gnocchi and stir until coated in sauce; cook for 2 more minutes.
