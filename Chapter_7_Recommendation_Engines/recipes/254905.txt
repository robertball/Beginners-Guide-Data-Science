Ingredients:
1  boneless, skinless chicken breast half
Kosher salt, to taste
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste (optional)
Smoky paprika (optional)
1 tablespoon olive oil
4  cherry tomatoes, quartered
1 cup chopped lettuce
¼ cup cooked black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (4 ounce) Libby's(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Sweet Corn Vegetable Cup
1  lime, juiced
¼ cup olive oil
Bacon bits (optional)
1 cup tortilla chips

Directions:
Season chicken breast with salt, freshly ground black pepper and smoky paprika (optional).
Heat a grill pan and add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add chicken breast and cook 6 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from grill pan and allow chicken to cool.
Place tomatoes, chopped lettuce, beans, and Libby's corn into bowl.
In separate small bowl whisk together lime juice, olive oil, salt and pepper.
Place cooled chicken breast onto cutting board and cut into 1-inch pieces.
Pour dressing over veggies and lettuce and toss. Add chopped chicken to salad. Sprinkle cheese and bacon bits (optional) over salad.
Serve salad with tortilla chips or add them into salad.
