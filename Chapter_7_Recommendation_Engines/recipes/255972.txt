5 eggs, beaten
1 (10 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
1 cup shredded Cheddar and Jack cheese

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place 1 pie crust into an ungreased 9-inch pie plate.
Mix prepared sausage, 5 eggs, mixed vegetables and cheese together in bowl; season with salt and pepper. Pour into crust. Top with remaining pie crust and crimp edges to seal. Cut 3 slits in top crust. Brush with remaining 1 beaten egg.
