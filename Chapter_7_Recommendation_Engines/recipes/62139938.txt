Ingredients:
3 Mars bars
1/4 cup butter
2 cups minimarshmallows
5 cups Rice Crispies cereal

Directions:
Melt chocolate bars, butter and marshmallows over the stove in a heavy pot on low/medium heat. Stir constantly, and remove from heat once all ingredients are fully melted and combined. Add the cereal, stir until evenly coated. Press into a 9x9 pan, cool, and enjoy :) Do NOT refridgerate, you can tweak this recipe to your tastes. If you prefer a richer square, add less cereal, if you want to make the recipe stretch a little further, add extra Rice Crispies.
