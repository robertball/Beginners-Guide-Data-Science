Ingredients:
4 Salmon fillets.  Skin on or off
2-3 tbsp butter
1 cup dry white wine
Dill Sauce - prepared from:
1 cup sour cream
3-4 tsp prepared dill spice
(e.g., McCormick "It's a Dilly"
in grocery spice section)
Alternative for dill sauce above ... use your favorite dill sauce or dip recipe, but leave out the mayonaise.

Directions:
Prepare the dill sauce ahead of time and set aside.
Melt butter in large frying pan.  Add salmon filets.  If skin still on, then skin side down ... for less than one minute.  Turn salmon skin side up.  You can remove the skin easily after short cooking time.
Saute the salmon until flesh is browned.  Lift gently to determine if brown. When browned, gently turn salmon and cook on other side.  Do not over cook.  I prefer flesh in center of salmon to remain cool.
Remove salmon to your serving plates.
Deglaze the pan with white wine.  Add dill sauce to the liquid in pan and whisk thoroughly.  Strain the resulting mixture through a wire mesh screen.
Spoon the sauce over the salmon.
Serve with pan sauted whole mushrooms and grilled plum tomato on side.
