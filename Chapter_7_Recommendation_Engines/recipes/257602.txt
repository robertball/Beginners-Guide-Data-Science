Ingredients:
1 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloin, silver skin removed, cut into 2-inch medallions
salt to taste
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary, or more as needed
1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme, or more as needed
1 tablespoon avocado oil
1 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups bone broth
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon cassava flour (such as Otto's)

Directions:
Season pork medallions with salt. Brush Dijon mustard around the sides of each medallion. Roll in rosemary and thyme until mustard is covered.
Heat avocado oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add medallions; cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Flip with tongs. Cook until second side is browned, about 3 minutes more. Reduce heat; arrange mushrooms around medallions. Season with salt and pepper.
Whisk bone broth, balsamic vinegar, and cassava flour together in a bowl until smooth. Pour over and around mushrooms; stir with a wooden spoon to distribute evenly. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until pork is no longer pink in the center and sauce thickens up, about 8 minutes.
