Ingredients:
8 chicken drumsticks
1/4 cup hot pepper sauce
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons yellow cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Remove skin from chicken and place in a resealable plastic bag. Pour sauce over chicken, seal bag, and refrigerate to marinate for at least 1 hour, up to 24 hours. The longer the chicken marinates, the spicier it will be.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the flour, cornmeal, and salt in another resealable plastic bag. Add the drumsticks, seal bag, and shake to coat.
Fry the chicken, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes or until juices run clear. Turn occasionally to brown evenly.

Description: 
I found this recipe a while back and had to try it. My husband and I fell in love with it. He has to have it at least twice a week. Sometimes I use boneless, skinless chicken breast in place of the drumsticks--the breasts take less cooking time. Enjoy!
