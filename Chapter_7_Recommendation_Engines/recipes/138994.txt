Description: 
And you thought only bees could make honey!  This is a recipe used by my husband's grandmother.  That was when you could actually purchase clover in a regular grocery store! Use ONLY organic flowers. No sprays whatsoever.  Use white clover that is beginning to turn brown to add color to the honey.
