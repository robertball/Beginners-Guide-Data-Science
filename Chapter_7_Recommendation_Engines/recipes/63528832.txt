Ingredients:
3 eggs
3 oz cheddar cheese, grated
3 teaspoons canola oil
any breakfast meats and seasonings to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Whisk the eggs with cheese and any other seasonings and fillings you like. (They should vary widely according to your taste. See my notes below for suggestions.)
Liberally grease each space in a 12-up mini muffin tin.
Pour the egg mixture into the mini muffin tin. Bake in the oven for about 12 minutes, until the top is just starting to brown. They will get very puffy if they don't have many fillings.
If you can manage to not eat them all right away, store in the fridge and microwave when you need them.
