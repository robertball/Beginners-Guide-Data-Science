Ingredients:
2 bundles asparagus
2-3 packages prosciutto
DaVinci Dutch Gouda
or Denmark's Finest "Herbs & Spices Havarti"
olive oil

Directions:
preheat oven to 350 degrees.
cut and wash asparagus.
cut the prosciutto into 3-4 inch pieces (usually in half).
cut the cheese in to small pieces; about 2 inches long, 1/4 inch thick. piece of cheese should not be thicker than the width of asparagus stalk, and small enough to not stick out of the prosciutto.
place cheese on asparagus stalk below the leaves, "secure" the cheese to the stalk by wrapping the prosciutto around the stalk. no need for toothpicks! prosciutto will stick to itself.
place on a foil lined baking sheet.
continue to wrap all asparagus with proscuitto & cheese, making one layer on the baking sheet, until you run out of ingredients.
drizzle with olive oil.
bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes or until prosciutto is crisp, and asparagus is tender.
allow to cool before serving, enough to pick up with fingers.
