Ingredients:
1 pound thick sliced bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
4 (12 inch) flour tortillas
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 head iceberg lettuce, shredded
1 tomato, diced

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and set aside.
Place 1 tortilla on a microwave-safe plate. Sprinkle tortilla with 1/4 cup cheese. Cook in microwave 1 to 2 minutes, or until cheese is melted. Immediately top with 1/4 of the bacon, lettuce, and tomato. Fold sides of tortilla over, then roll up. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Cut each wrap in half before serving.

Description: 
I love wraps, but am allergic to mayonnaise, so I designed this wrap to be glued together with melted cheese instead.
