Description: 
Like a caramel apple in a bowl! Perfect treat when you are looking for something to satisfy your sweet tooth. 

This recipe is based on a salad I got from Winn-Dixie. Since I couldn't find a recipe for it, I decided to make my own. The caramel dressing is based on the brown sugar fruit dip. Pink Lady apples work well for this recipe. To peel or not to peel? I prefer the salad with the peels on.
