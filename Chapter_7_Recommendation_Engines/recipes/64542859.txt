Ingredients:
1.5 # stewing beef
1 # butternut squash, peeled and cubed
two stems rosemary, finely chopped
1.5 tsp dried thyme
24 oz. beef broth
half a bottle of preferred beer
2 TBSP tomato paste
2 TBS Worcestershire
1 tsp beef bouillon
1.5 TBSP Earthly Delight seasoning (The Spice & Tea Exchange)
1 tsp everyday seasoning (Trader Joe's)
1 tsp. smoked sea salt
0.5 tsp pepper
0.5 # baby carrots
1 # new potatoes, cut in half
0.25 # sliced mushrooms
1 medium onion, small dice
3 cloves of garlic, crushed
1 TBSP flour

Directions:
Add broth, all seasoning and herbs, beef and butternut squash. Boil, then simmer for one hour. Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees. Saute onion and mushroom, then garlic last. Add sauteed vegetables, potatoes and carrots to the pot. Sprinkle in the flour, and blend well as to avoid lumps. Boil, then transfer pan to the oven, w/o a lid. It will appear a little thin. Bake for an hour and a half, stir and serve with buttered, crusty bread.
The butternut squash with dissolve during the cooking time, and thicken the stew naturally.
A pot pie can be made with leftovers. Rolling blue cheese between two pie crusts, then use it as the top crust. Make slits in dough and bake at 350 degrees for approximately 1 hour.
