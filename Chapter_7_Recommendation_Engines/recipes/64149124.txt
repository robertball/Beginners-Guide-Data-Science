Ingredients:
For the crust:
1 1/2 sleeves of Saltine crackers
1/2 cup softened unsalted butter
3 Tbsp. sugar
For the filling:
1 can (14-oz.) sweetened condensed milk
4 egg yolks
1/2 cup lemon or lime juice, or a mix of the two
Fresh whipped cream
Coarse sea salt

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350°. In the bowl of a food processor or using your hands, crush the crackers finely. Add sugar, and knead in butter until the crumbs hold together like dough.
2. Press cracker mixture into a 9-inch pie pan. (Or use an old-fashioned 8-inch tin pie pan.) Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Bake at 350° for 18 minutes or until crust turns golden. While the crust cools (it doesn’t have to cool completely), beat the egg yolks into the condensed milk. Add the citrus juice, and beat until well combined. Pour filling into shell, and bake for 16 minutes or until filling is set.
3. Refrigerate pie until cold. Dollop with whipped cream and sprinkle with sea salt before serving.
