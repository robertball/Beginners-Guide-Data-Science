Description: 
When I was in the Army I always loved to have my eggs with creamed beef Or SOS. There was also a version called Chipped Beef that used salted dry beef. chipped beef was more favored by the old brown shoe Army. But after the newer soldiers enlisted Creamed Beef became the new favorite of the army. The navy had a version of Minced Beef that used tomatoes, mace or nutmeg. When the Armed Forces Recipe Service was published in February 1969 the serves standardized it's recipes. My wife does not like country gravy or creamed beef.
