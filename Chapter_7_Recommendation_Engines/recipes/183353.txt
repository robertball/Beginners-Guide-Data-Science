1 (4 ounce) jar chopped pimentos, drained

Beat the cream cheese and Cheddar cheese together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy.

Description: 
This pimento cheese is great as a sandwich, as a spread on crackers, or stuffed into celery.  Our kids can't get enough of it.  I like it best served as a sandwich with a big bowl of my homemade chili.
