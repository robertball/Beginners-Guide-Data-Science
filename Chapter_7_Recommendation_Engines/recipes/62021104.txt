Ingredients:
3/4 Cups yellow or white cornmeal
1 1/4 cups all purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 tsp salt
4 tsp baking powder
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1/4 plus two Tbs. shortening or bacon grease

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients in a bowl, add the eggs, milk, and 1/4 cup of the shortening or bacon grease. Mix just til blended. Do NOT overbeat!!! The result will be crumbly, tough cornbread instead of tender. Let this rest for a few minutes. Meanwhile, place the remaining shortening or bacon grease in a 10 inch cast iron skillet. Place the skillet in a preheated 425 degree oven. Leave until the grease starts to smoke. Remove from oven, and immediately add the batter to the pan. It should sizzle. Immediately place pan in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes.
