Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon orange zest
1 cup coconut
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; stir into the butter mixture. Finally, mix in the orange zest, coconut, oats and pecans. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges begin to brown slightly. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 2 to 3 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
