Ingredients:
2/3 cup water
1/3 cup cornstarch
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets
2 ActiFry spoons vegetable oil
1 orange
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon cornstarch
Sliced green onion
Toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Whisk water, cornstarch, flour, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until smooth.
Add cauliflower florets and stir until coated.
Transfer cauliflower to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Chill for 30 minutes.
Put cauliflower in your ActiFry. Drizzle with vegetable oil and cook for 22 minutes or until browned and tender.
Meanwhile, zest orange, measure 1 teaspoon and set aside. Juice orange to measure 1/4 cup.
Combine orange juice, soy sauce, rice vinegar, ketchup, brown sugar, sesame oil, and garlic in a saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Stir cornstarch with 1 teaspoon water until dissolved. Whisk into the sauce and cook for 2 minutes, or until glossy. Remove from heat and stir in orange zest.
Toss cauliflower with warm sauce and garnish with green onion and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.
