Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups golden raisins
2 cups dried currants
1 cup orange zest
6 ounces candied lemon peel
3/4 cup chopped candied citron
1/3 cup candied angelica
1/3 cup red candied cherries
1/3 cup green candied cherries
1/2 cup brandy
4 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground mace
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
10 eggs, separated
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/3 cup sherry
1 cup sherry

Directions:
Place raisins and currants in a bowl, and add enough water to just cover them.  Soak overnight.
Chop orange and lemon peel quite fine; do the same with the citron, angelica, and both types of cherries.  Pour 1/2 cup brandy over fruit, and allow to stand overnight.
Sift together flour, mace, and nutmeg.
Beat egg yolks until thick and light, then beat in 1 cup of sugar a little at a time.  Stir in lemon juice.  Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form.
In a large bowl, cream the butter, and then add 1 cup sugar a little at a time; beat until smooth.  Combine yolk mixture with creamed mixture.  Add flour and 1/3 cup sherry alternately to the creamed mixture.  Stir in all the fruit, and fold in stiffly beaten egg whites.  Pour batter into a well greased and floured 10 inch mold or tube pan. This cake can also be made in 2 large loaf pans.
Place a pan of hot water in the bottom of a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven.  Place cake pans in oven, and bake about 20 minutes.  Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C); continue baking 100 minutes for large cake, or 40 minutes for loaf cakes.  Cakes are done when a toothpick comes out dry. Turn cake(s) out on rack to cool.
Wrap cake(s) in cheesecloth soaked in sherry, and store in airtight container for a month or more.  If the cheesecloth dries out in the mellowing period soak it again with the same spirits, and rewrap the cake.
