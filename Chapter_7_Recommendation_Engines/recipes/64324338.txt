Ingredients:
1/2 Cup White Sugar
1/3 Cup Ginger Evans® Premium Baking Cocoa
3 Tablespoons Cornstarch
2 Cups 2% Milk
2 Teaspoons Marcum® Pure Vanilla Extract

Directions:
In a microwave-safe bowl, whisk together sugar, cocoa, vanilla extract and cornstarch. Whisk in milk a little at a time so that the mixture does not have any dry lumps. Place the mixture in microwave and cook for 3 minutes on high and then stir. Cook for another 2 minutes, stopping at 1 minute to stir to thicken before continuing to cook remaining for minute. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming and chill in the refrigerator. Allow to chill for 2 hours before serving.
Notes
Put the finishing touch on the pudding with Coburn Farms Aerosol Whipped Cream Topping.
