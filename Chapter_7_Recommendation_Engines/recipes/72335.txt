Ingredients:
Brine:
1/4 cup kosher salt
1/4 cup brown sugar
3 cups warm water
2 (3/4 pound) pork tenderloins
Marinade:
1/2 cup chunky peanut butter
1/4 cup sake
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons peanut oil
2 tablespoons Thai chili paste
2 tablespoons Sriracha chili sauce
4 cloves garlic, finely minced
2 tablespoons fresh ginger root, finely chopped
1/4 cup finely chopped green onions
1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Dissolve the salt and brown sugar in 1/4 cup warm water.  Pour into a large resealable plastic bag with remaining 2 3/4 cups water.  Place pork in bag, seal, and refrigerate overnight.
In a small, microwavable bowl, combine peanut butter, sake, soy sauce, vinegar, honey, peanut oil, chili paste, chili sauce, garlic, ginger root, green onions, and cilantro.  Microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute to melt peanut butter; mix thoroughly.
Reserve 1/2 to 3/4 cup of this peanut sauce to serve as a sauce for the cooked meat; refrigerate until ready to use. Pour remaining sauce into a resealable plastic bag. Remove pork from brine; discard brine. Rinse pork, pat dry, and place in the bag with the peanut sauce marinade. Refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat grill for medium heat. Take pork out of peanut sauce marinade; let sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Pour marinade in small saucepan.  Heat to a boil, and boil for 3 minutes.  If marinade gets too thick, add a little milk to thin.
Lightly oil grill grate, and arrange tenderloins on grill.  When pork reaches 125 degrees F (50 degrees C), baste with the boiled marinade.  Watch pork carefully after basting so that it doesn't burn.  Use a bbq spatula to roll the pork around while cooking.  Grill pork tenderloins until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C); this should take about 15 minutes. Pull off the grill, and let sit for 5 minutes before slicing into thin rounds.
Warm the reserved sauce in the microwave, and place a dollop of the sauce on each plate. Place pork slices on top of sauce to serve.

Description: 
A wonderfully moist barbecued pork with an Asian kick!  Although this pork needs to be started 2 days ahead of serving, the recipe is very easy and so worth the wait! Wonderful served with udon noodles dressed with sesame oil and soy sauce.
