Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 large leek - cut lengthwise, washed, trimmed, and thinly sliced
3 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves stripped
2 teaspoons minced garlic
4 (16 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
10 leaves basil, minced
heavy whipping cream, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir leek, rosemary, and garlic until leek is tender and translucent, about 15 minutes.
Add diced tomatoes and cayenne pepper; bring to a simmer. Add minced basil; continue simmering until soup is reduced by half, about 1 hour.
Remove half of the soup and puree in a blender until smooth. Return pureed soup to the saucepan. Stir in cream to desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and ground black pepper.

Description: 
I just invented this recipe because I love rosemary and leeks together, and it seemed like a tomato-rosemary-leek soup would taste divine. And it did.
