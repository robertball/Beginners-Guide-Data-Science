Ingredients:
2 tomatoes, chopped
6 dried chile de arbol peppers
1 onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
salt to taste
water to cover
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or to taste
2 (6 inch) corn tortillas, cut into strips
4 eggs

Directions:
Combine tomatoes, chile de arbol peppers, onion, garlic, chicken bouillon, and salt in a saucepan; add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes and peppers soften, 5 to 10 minutes.
Transfer chile peppers to a blender using a slotted spoon; blend until smooth. Pour in tomato mixture; blend until smooth.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir corn tortillas in the hot oil until crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Crack in eggs; stir until scrambled and set, about 5 minutes. Strain blended sauce over tortillas and eggs; mix well.
