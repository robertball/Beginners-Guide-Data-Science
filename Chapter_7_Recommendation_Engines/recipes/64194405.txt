Description: 
This is my mother's versatile, hearty, vegetable beef soup recipe. This is a great recipe for when your garden is putting out a ton of veggies in the fall. You can also use canned items, but fresh is always best! Feel free to add other veggies like okra, green beans or whatever you like. You can even use wild game meat like venison in place of beef. Omit the meat and the soup base, add barley or beans, and you have a great vegan version!
