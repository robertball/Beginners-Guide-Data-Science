Easy Albondigas Recipe

Ingredients:
2 T vegetable oil
1.5 lb prepared cooked frozen meatballs
1 medium onion, diced
3 ribs celery, chopped
1 large red or yellow bell pepper, diced
2 jalapenos, minced, seeds and all
.5 T red pepper flakes
1 T whole cumin seeds
1 t dried mexican oregano
2 quarts chicken broth
2 small cans mexican tomato sauce
salt and pepper, to taste
cilantro leaves, chopped, to garnish

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil on medium to medium-high heat in a large heavy pot or dutch oven until the surface is shimmering.  Fry meatballs until browned, turning often.  Remove with slotted spoon to the side when done.
Saute vegetables, pepper flakes, cumin, and oregano in same pot until onions are translucent and celery is tender.  Make sure to crush the oregano into the pot with your palms to release flavor when you add it.  I also recommend cracking the cumin with a mortar and pestle or in a plastic bag using a rolling pin or some other sort of blunt instrument - it makes a difference.
Add the meatballs back in along with the tomato sauce and simmer for 2-3 minutes, then add the chicken broth (incrementally - see notes) to the pot and stir to incorporate.  Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer for 45 minutes or more, stirring occasionally.  Adjust seasoning to taste, garnish with cilantro, and enjoy.

Description: 
This is my quick and easy take on the popular Mexican soup Albondigas.  I had a lot of chicken broth left over from another recipe earlier in the week and I was thinking about a soup to use it in.  This ended up being a super-easy dinner for a care free Friday night.
