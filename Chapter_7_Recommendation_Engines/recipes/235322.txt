Ingredients:
1 whole artichoke heart, trimmed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 cup vegan mayonnaise (such as Follow Your Heart® Veganaise®)
1 cup shredded mozzarella-style vegan cheese (such as Daiya®)
1 pinch salt
1 pinch lemon pepper seasoning, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add artichoke heart. Cover pot and cook artichoke until tender and leaves pull off easily with a fork, about 45 minutes. Run artichoke under cold water and remove and refrigerate all the leaves. Scoop and discard the hairy part of artichoke heart.
Heat olive oil in small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.
Blend artichoke heart, onion mixture, vegan mayonnaise, mozzarella-style vegan cheese, salt, and lemon pepper in a blender until almost smooth. Transfer dip to a bowl and refrigerate for flavors to blend, about 1 hour. Serve dip with artichoke leaves.

Description: 
I added a twist or two to a recipe from my co-worker, Kubo. My niece is vegan so I like to find dishes that she can eat too. This can also be served with tortilla chips.
