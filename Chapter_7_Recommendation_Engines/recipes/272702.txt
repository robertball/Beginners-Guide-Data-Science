Ingredients:
3 eggs, room temperature
1 banana, mashed
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons melted butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup sifted coconut flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 6 muffin cups.
Blend together eggs, banana, honey, butter, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until combined.
Combine coconut flour, baking powder, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Whisk into banana batter until there are no lumps. Fold in walnuts. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean and tops are golden brown, about 20 minutes.
