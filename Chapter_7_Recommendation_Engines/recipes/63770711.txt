Ingredients:
3 T flour
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Place flour in a small saucepan.  Begin to whisk in milk over medium to medium/high heat.
Continue whisking mixture for, oh - just about 5 minutes or so.  It'll thicken up to something like a cross between paste and pudding.
Remove from heat, place in a bowl, and let cool *completely* (mine took about 1/2 hr).  Stir every now and then if desired to keep a crust from forming.
Once cool, place softened butter and sugar in mixing bowl and (using whisk attachment, not beater), combine well.
Add flour mix and vanilla, mix to incorporate, then scrape down sides of bowl.
Increase speed to medium high and continue to beat for a good 5 to 6 minutes.  Test by feeling to make sure there are no granules of sugar left.
