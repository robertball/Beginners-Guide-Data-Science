Ingredients:
1 large can Las Palmas Green Enchilada Sauce (medium flavor)
2 7oz cans diced green chilis,
Monterey Jack Cheese shredded (I use a lot, 32 oz)
Salsa (of your choosing)
1 large onion diced
Sm Sour Cream
2-4 chicken breasts (boiled in water), shredded after cooled
6in (king size) corn tortillas

Directions:
Combine enchilada sauce with sour cream in a sauce pan and cook through;
saute diced onion in a small amout of oil (so they will not be crunchy);
Heat two corn tortillas in microwave (sandwiched in between two paper towels) for 15 sec on high;
Spoon enchilada sauce onto a plate and coat tortilla on both sides;
Fill each tortilla with onion, chilis, shredded chicken, salsa, and cheese;
Roll tortillas and place seam side down in 9x13 pyrex or metal dish.
When dish is filled, cover with remaining green sauce, & cheese.
Cover with Aluminum foil and bake in 350 oven for 45 mins.
Remove foil covering in last 15 mins of baking to brown.
* I freeze remaining cooked enchiladas in freezer ware.
