Vegan Brownies No Oil or Fat Added Recipe

Ingredients:
¾ cup whole-wheat pastry flour or unbleached all-purpose flour
½ tsp baking soda
¼ tsp salt
¼ cup cocoa powder
2 tsp instant coffee (optional, but coffee really enhances the chocolate flavor)
2 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp water
¾ cup sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp flax meal plus 6 tbsp water, whisked together
½ cup chopped, lightly toasted walnuts

Directions:
Sift all the dry ingredients, including the flour, coffee, cocoa, baking soda and salt, into a bowl and set aside.
In another bowl mix together the maple syrup, water, sugar, flax meal mixture, and vanilla extract.
Whisk together until well mixed.
Add the flour-cocoa mixture to this in 3 batches, mixing well after each addition using a ladle or spatula.
Stir in  the walnuts. The batter will be really thick.
Prepare an 8 X 8-inch baking pan by lining it with aluminum foil. Leave an overhang on each side of the pan so you can easily lift the brownies out after they are baked. Spray some non-stick cooking spray on the foil.
Pour the batter in and, using a spatula or the back of a spoon, spread evenly in the pan.
Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool thoroughly. Lift out the brownies using the foil overhang as handles, and cut into squares. Dust with some powdered confectioners' sugar for a pretty finish.
