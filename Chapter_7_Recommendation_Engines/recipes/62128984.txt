Ingredients:
1 package of flaked coconut 14 oz
1 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk
zest of 1-2 limes aprox 1 tbs
2 tbsp of freshly squeezed lime juice
1 tsp of vanilla extract
3 lg egg whites
pinch of salt
8 oz of white baking chocolate

Directions:
Heat oven to 325 degrees
Combined the flaked coconut, can of sweetened condensed milk, lime juice and zest, and the vanilla extract. Mix till incorporated well.
Beat the egg whites and salt till stiff peaks.
Fold into macaroon batter till incorporated.
Drop by tbsp onto a parchment lined baking sheet (parchment is a must to keep the macaroons shape and prevent sticking)
Place on middle rack in oven for aprox 30 min or till golden brown.
Cool cookies on wire rack.
Melt the white chocolate in a glass or ceramic microwavable bowl for aprox 1 1/2 min. Stir after 1 min. Chocolate is ready when smooth and glossy after stirring.
When cookies are cool I did the bottoms in the chocolate and place back on the parchment paper, drizzle the tops of the macaroons with the remainder of the white chocolate and let harden on the parchment paper.
Store well covered at room temperature for 2-3 days. They won't last that long!!
