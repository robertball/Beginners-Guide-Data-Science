Ingredients:
1/4 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)
4 slices bread
1 banana, sliced
1/4 cup chocolate milk
2 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Spread chocolate-hazelnut spread on 1 side of each slice of bread. Arrange banana slices over chocolate-hazelnut spread on 2 of the slices. Place remaining slices atop bananas to form 2 sandwiches.
Whisk chocolate milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Dip sandwiches in milk mixture and turn as necessary to coat completely.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook sandwiches in hot butter until both sides are golden brown and banana and chocolate spread have softened, 4 to 6 minutes per side.
