Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 bone-in chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped green pepper

1/2 cup uncooked rice
1 1/4 cups chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/8 teaspoon chili powder

Directions:
Combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken and shake until well coated. In a skillet, brown chicken in butter over medium heat. Remove chicken; set aside and keep warm. In the pan drippings, saute onion, green pepper and garlic until tender. Add pimientos and rice. Reduce heat; cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in broth, turmeric, chili powder and remaining salt; bring to a boil. Pour into an ungreased 2-qt. baking dish; top with chicken. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until chicken juices run clear and rice is tender.
