Ingredients:
1.5 cups glutoneous flour
½ tsp of salt
1 tsp of pandan paste  if you like it green
1 cup of coconut milk  you might need more or less
About 16 pieces of 6”x 8” banana leaves - blanch in hot water, wipe dry and grease with oil
Ingredients for Filling :
2 cups of fresh grated coconut
1 cup of palm sugar (gula Melaka) or brown sugar  cut into chunks
4 tbsp of water

Directions:
1. To make the filling cook the palm sugar and water until sugar dissolved. Add in the grated coconut, stir and cook until almost dry, then add in the cornstarch mixture and stir until the mixture thickens. Set it aside to cool.
2. To make the dough, put the glutinous rice flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Slowly add in the coconut milk; knead well until it forms into smooth dough. If you like the dough to be green adds in the pandan paste. Continue to knead until the color blend into the dough.
3. To make the kuih, pinch a small piece of dough (size depend on how big you want), roll it into a smooth ball and then flatten the dough. Add 1 tbsp of filling in the center of the dough. Gather up the edges to seal the filling inside.
4. Fold a piece of banana leaf into cone shape, oiled side inside. Place the filled dough ball in it, pushing gently to fill the tip of the cone as much as possible. Fold the edges over the base to close (you may secure it with a toothpick) Repeat the same to the rest of the dough.
5. Arrange the cone on a steamer tray and steam for 15 minutes in a slow boiling water.
6. Remove from steamer and allows to cool before serving
