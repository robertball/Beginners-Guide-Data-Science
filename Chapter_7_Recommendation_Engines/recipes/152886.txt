Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cornmeal
1 teaspoon baking soda
4 eggs
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (14.75 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
1 cup margarine, melted
2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chilies
2 onions, chopped
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Whisk together the cornmeal and baking soda in a small bowl; set aside. Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl; stir in the whole kernel corn, cream-style corn, buttermilk, melted margarine, green chiles, and onion. Stir in the cornmeal mixture and 2 cups of the Cheddar cheese until only slight lumps of cornmeal remain; pour into the prepared baking dish.
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until firmed and lightly browned, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven, and sprinkle with the remaining cheese; let stand 15 minutes before serving.
