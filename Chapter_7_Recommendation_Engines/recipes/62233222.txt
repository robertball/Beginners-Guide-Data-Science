Ingredients:
½ medium  cabbage
cumin
1 clove, minced garlic
1/2- 1 tsp salt
1 tsp chili powder
2 tbs mayonnaise
1 tsp hot sauce or to taste (I prefer Sriracha hot sauce, but others are good, though, it might change it with louisana hot sauce)
½ onion
1 carrot
fresh cilantro, about ½ of one bunch from the super market, or roughly 3-4 heaping tablespoons of minced leaves
1-2 tbs lemon juice (to taste)

Directions:
Chop cabbage finely into short strips, chop carrot into little chunks. Mince garlic and finely slice onion. Add garlic, salt, cumin and chili powder to cabbage and mix up. Then, add mayonnaise and hot sauce. Next, add Lemon juice. Then, add carrot and cilantro.
Finally, add lemon juice, blend and taste. Cole slaw tastes best if you make it ahead of time, so that the flavors have time to blend. If you do not like spicy food then add a little hot sauce at a time.
