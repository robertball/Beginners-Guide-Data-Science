Ingredients:
SOUP:
1 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-1/2-inch cubes
5 cups chicken broth
2 cups water
4 medium carrots, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
2 celery rib, chopped
1 tsp minced fresh parsley
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp poultry seasoning
1/4 tsp pepper
DUMPLINGS:
2 large  eggs
1/2 cup cottage cheese
2 Tbsp water
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray, cook chicken until no longer pink. Add the broth, water, vegetables and seasonings. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
Meanwhile, for dumplings, in a large bowl, beat the eggs and cottage cheese until blended. Add water and salt. Stir in the flour and mix well.
Bring soup to a boil. Drop dumplings by tablespoonfuls onto the boiling soup. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in dumplings comes out clean (do not lift cover while simmering)
Note: Can also be made in crock pot, adding dumplings to soup for additional hour after cooking soup on low for 6-7 hours on low (or 3-4 on high).
