Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 Roma tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup roasted pasilla chile sauce (such as HerdezÂ®)
1/2 cup frozen corn
1/2 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 white onion, chopped
1/2 red onion, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
1 (15.5 ounce) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 cup cottage cheese
1 cup sour cream
5 (7 inch) whole wheat tortillas, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add Roma tomatoes, chile sauce, corn, yellow bell pepper, green bell pepper, white onion, red onion, jalapeno pepper, and cumin. Cook and stir until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add refried beans and pinto beans; stir to combine. Remove bean mixture from heat.
Mix 1 cup Cheddar cheese, cottage cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl.
Cover the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish with 1/3 of the bean mixture. Top with a third of the cheese mixture and a thin layer of tortillas. Repeat with another third of the beans, another third of the cheese mixture, and tortillas. Repeat again with remaining beans, remaining cheese mixture, and a final layer of tortillas. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese on top. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes more.
Remove from oven and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I meant to make burritos one night but I was in a hurry, so I layered everything together in a casserole dish to save time. The result was this Mexican layered casserole and a yummy go-to dish that is easily customizable for things I usually have on hand. You could add chicken or beef if you'd like, but we eat it as-is! Top with chopped cilantro and chopped green onions.
