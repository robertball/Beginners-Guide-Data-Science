Ingredients:
1 can (15 oz) or 1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1/4 tsp sea salt
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 Tbsp tahini
1 Tbsp hot sauce
1 Tbsp lemon juice
1/2 cup  jarred roasted red pepper
2 Tbsp olive oil
Cayenne pepper, to taste, for serving

Directions:
Combine all the ingredients except the oil  and cayenne in a food processor. Pulse a few times to combine and then scrape down the sides. With the motor running, stream in the oil through the feed tube.
Continue to run the motor until you reach the desired consistency.
Add more salt, lemon juice, or hot sauce, to taste, and then sprinkle with cayenne pepper before serving.

Description: 
Here is another variation on an old time favorite dip of mine: hummus.  It has the tangy, burn-your-lips spiciness of buffalo sauce.
