Description: 
These were on the oatmeal box when I was just a small kid in the 50's   When I make these for bake sales, they're always one of the first to go.  Always attached a recipe to each package and everyone always seems to say.........OHHHH!!!  I REMEMBER THESE!!!  You can also use walnuts instead of the peanuts.
