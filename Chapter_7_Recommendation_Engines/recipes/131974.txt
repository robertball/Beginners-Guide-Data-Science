Ingredients:
3/4 cup soft goat cheese
1 tablespoon brandy
1 tablespoon honey
24 dried figs
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a small bowl, stir together the goat cheese, brandy and honey. Cut the stems off of the figs, and fill them with the flavored goat cheese using a pastry bag or small spoon. Cut each fig in half lengthwise. Dip the cheese side in walnuts to coat, then arrange them on a serving tray with the nuts facing upwards.
