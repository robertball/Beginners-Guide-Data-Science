Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 1/3 cups coconut milk
2 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups almond flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3 cups grated coconut
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans with cooking spray.
Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in coconut milk and eggs.
Mix all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Stir into the butter mixture until batter is thoroughly blended. Fold in coconut and raisins.
Divide batter evenly between the greased loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool completely before slicing, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
After trying someone's coconut bread recipe that didn't turn out well, I changed the proportions, added a few new ingredients, and came up with this version. Delicious! It works well as muffins or bars, too. Just decrease the cooking time and bake until the inside is no longer gooey.
