Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups warm water (70 to 80 degrees F)
2 tablespoons nonfat dry milk powder
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons shortening
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
1/2 cup chopped sweet red pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/3 cup pizza sauce
1/2 cup diced pepperoni
1 cup shredded pizza cheese blend
1/4 cup chopped ripe olives
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first seven ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed).
In a small skillet, saute the onion, mushrooms and peppers in oil until tender; cool. When bread machine cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Let rest for 5 minutes.
Roll each portion into a 16-in. x 10-in. rectangle; spread with pizza sauce. Top with onion mixture, pepperoni, pizza cheese and olives. Roll up each rectangle jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal. Cut each into 12 slices (discard end pieces).
Place slices cut side down in two greased 9-in. round baking pans. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
