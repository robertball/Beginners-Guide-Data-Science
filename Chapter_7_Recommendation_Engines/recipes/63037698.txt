Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Cream cold butter or room temp butter (do not microwave to soften,this alters the butter) with brown sugar, sugar and vanilla. In seperate bowl mix together flour, soda and powder and set aside. Add eggs to butter and sugar mixture. Add flour  mixture. Mix well and then add chips. Scoop out about 1 heaping tablespoon for each cookie and place on a cookie sheet with either nonstick foil or non stick cookie matte. Sprinkle with a little sea salt. Bake until edges of cookies are golden brown and tops of cookies are just turning a hint of golden.

Description: 
I would always be so frustrated when I would make a batch of cookies and they would come out flat and crispy instead of thick and chewy. Every once in a while a batch would come out perfect, but only by mistake and poor measuring. So I finally came up with the petfect method of making great cookies. I hope this recipe helps all those frustrsted by flat cookies. I use my kitchenaid mixer to whip these up in no time.
