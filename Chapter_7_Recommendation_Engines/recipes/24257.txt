Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups corn oil
1 1/8 cups white vinegar
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (16 ounce) bottle creamy Italian-style salad dressing
1 egg

Directions:
In a 1 quart container combine the corn oil, garlic and sugar.  Shake well.  Add vinegar and shake well again.
Fill the container the rest of the way with Italian dressing, leaving just enough room to add one egg.  Add the egg, and blend with a blender or hand-held blender for about 2 minutes.
