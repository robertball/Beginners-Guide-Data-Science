Ingredients:
4 slices cooked bacon, halved
4 boneless chicken breasts
1 Tablespoon Montreal style steak seasoning
4 slices Jalapeno Jack Cheese
1 cup fresh salsa

Directions:
Sprinkle seasoning over both sides of chicken breasts.
Grill over medium coals 10-15 minutes or until juices run clear and then top each breast with 2 pieces each of the halved bacon (1 slice total) and the jack cheese.
Remove from heat as soon as the cheese is melted (1-2 minutes) and top with 2-3 tablespoons of salsa.
