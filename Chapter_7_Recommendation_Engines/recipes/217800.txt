Ingredients:
2 pounds asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 teaspoons sesame seeds
2 tablespoons peanut oil
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sesame oil

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Lightly cook the asparagus into the boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and immediately plunge the asparagus into a bowl of ice water until the asparagus is cool; drain and pat dry.
Toast the sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes; transfer to a dish and set aside to cool.
Heat the peanut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and asparagus to the skillet, season with salt and cook until the ginger is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; toss with the sesame oil and sesame seeds to serve.
