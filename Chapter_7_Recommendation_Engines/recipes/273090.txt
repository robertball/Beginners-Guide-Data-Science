Description: 
Frozen chicken cooked in slow cooker on high. 
I came up with this on a snowed-in day when I could not make it out to our local BBQ restaurant. Each serving is enough for two slider buns or one regular hamburger bun. Top with your favorite BBQ sauce, like Sweet Baby <sup>&reg;</sup>ay's(<sup>&reg;</sup>). I use my husband's homemade BBQ sauce. Serve with slaw, corn on the cob, or chips. And don't forget the sweet iced tea!!!
