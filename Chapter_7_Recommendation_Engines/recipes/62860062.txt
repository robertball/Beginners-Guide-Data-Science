Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa
1/4 cup flaxseed
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup nonfat plain soy yogurt
1/2 cup fresh berries
1/2 teaspoon honey

Directions:
preheat the oven to 375F
Place the quinoa in a mesh strainer and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear; this is easier to discern if you place a bowl in the sink beneath the strainer.  When the water in the bowl is clear, the quinoa is sufficiently rinsed.  Drain the quinoa well, shaking the strainer to get out as much water as possible.
Transer the quinoa to a medium mixing bowl.  Add the flaxseed, honey and olive oil.  Use a spoon to mix until well combined.  Spread the mixture in a thin layer on a rimmed baking sheet.  Bake until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes, stirring once.  Transfer the crunch to a large plate to cool.  Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
Place the yogurt in a small serving bowl.  Top with the quinoa crunch and the berries.  Drizzle the honey over and serve.
