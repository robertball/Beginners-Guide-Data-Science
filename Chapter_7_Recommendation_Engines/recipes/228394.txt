Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup hot water
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1 large cucumber, thinly sliced
1 red onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
Whisk sugar, hot water, white vinegar, and salt in a bowl until sugar has dissolved. Stir cucumber and onion into the sauce. Refrigerate at least 1 hour to soften the texture of the vegetables and reduce pungency of the onion.

Description: 
This salad is a refreshing side to spicy Thai food. I prefer it without hot peppers or peanuts since its major purpose for me is refreshment. It's especially quick to make if you can slice the cucumbers and onions in a food processor.
