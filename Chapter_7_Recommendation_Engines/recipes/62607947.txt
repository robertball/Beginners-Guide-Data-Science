Ingredients:
1 18.25 oz package yellow cake mix, with pudding
3 eggs
1 tbsp vanilla extract
1 21 oz can caramel apple pie filling (use regular apple pie filling, if caramel is unavailable)
1 cup white chocolate chips
1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts
4 tbsp butter
6 tbsp milk
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 3.5 oz package instant vanilla pudding

Directions:
Grease 9x13 pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix together: cake mix, eggs, 1 tbsp vanilla extract, apple pie filling, white chocolate chips, and nuts. Stir until just combined. Pour batter into greased 9x13 pan.
Bake in 350 degree oven 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool.
To make glaze: in a saucepan, over medium heat, melt butter, and mix in 6 tbsp milk and 1 cup brown sugar. Bring to boil, and boil vigorously for 1 minute. Remove from heat, and beat in 1/2 cup powdered sugar. Cool slightly, and beat in 1 tsp vanilla, remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and pudding mix.
Spread glaze over cooled cake.

Description: 
I first made this last year for my friend's birthday. I used suggestions found in reviews for Quick Back Forest Cake, submitted by Donna. Then I frosted it with a version of Caramel Frosting I, submitted by MaryKaye.
