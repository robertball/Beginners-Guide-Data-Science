In a small bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Combine the egg, milk and shortening; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.

Description: 
I FOUND this recipe among our old family favorites and adapted it to make a small amount. It's quick and easy to prepare, but we still consider it a special treat.    I make it for breakfast and to satisfy a sweet tooth. Topped with a fresh fruit sauce, it's a wonderful dessert! -Eugene Presley, Council, Virginia
