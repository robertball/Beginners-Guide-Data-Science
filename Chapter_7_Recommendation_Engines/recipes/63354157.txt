Description: 
I have been looking for a long time for a protein bar, or at least something close, that didn't taste either flat or just plain-old bad.  Tweaked this one to get around my tree-nut allergies, and finally have the recipe I'd been seeking!  These are yummy, and my teenage daughter even likes them!
