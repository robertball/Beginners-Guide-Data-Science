Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 (12 ounce) can tomato paste
3 cups water
2 (1.5 ounce) packages spaghetti sauce mix
1 tablespoon sugar
4 teaspoons dried parsley flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 eggs, beaten
1 (16 ounce) package dry cottage cheese
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles, uncooked

Directions:
In a large saucepan, brown ground beef; drain. Add tomato paste, water, spaghetti sauce mix, sugar, parsley, salt, garlic powder and pepper. Simmer, partially covered, for 20 minutes. Stir occasionally. In a bowl, combine eggs with cottage cheese, half of the Cheddar cheese and half of the mozzarella. Set aside. Spoon one-third of the meat sauce into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Place half of the uncooked noodles over sauce. Top with one-third of meat sauce and press down. Spoon cottage cheese mixture over all. Cover with remaining noodles and meat sauce. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Bake, covered, at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Uncover; sprinkle with remaining Cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. Bake an additional 15 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
I like this recipe because it can be prepared a day ahead and baked just before serving, so it's a great way to avoid that last-minute rush when attending a potluck. Using packaged spaghetti sauce and noodles that are not pre-boiled makes preparation especially quick.                        --Denise Goedeken                                                          Platte Center, Nebraska
