Description: 
This recipe balances the cream cheese and sugar. I first used it on a red velvet cake and it turned out nicely. I do not stir the nuts in the frosting when making cupcakes,instead I sprinkle nuts on the cupcakes after frosting. It looks better that way and I also sprinkle the cupcakes with red sprinkles.
