Ingredients:
3/4 cup ketchup
1/2 cup soy sauce
3/4 cup sugar
1 tsp. salt
grated ginger
crushed garlic
3 lbs. pork baby back ribs (or more)
Rib seasoning

Directions:
Mix sauce ingredients until well blended. Keeps well in refrigerator until needed.
Ribs: Season racks of ribs with seasoning. Place racks in large aluminum pan covered tightly with foil. Bake in a 300 F oven for 2 hours. Uncover. Liberally baste with sauce. Bake uncovered in a 350 degree oven for 1 more hour until sauce looks caramelized.
If cooking more than 3 racks of ribs, cook for 2 1/2 hours in in a 300 degree oven. After basting with sauce, cook for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes (place foil back on top) before cutting.
