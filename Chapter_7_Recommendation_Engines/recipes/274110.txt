Ingredients:
½ cup whole-milk plain kefir (such as Lifeway(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 tablespoon hot sauce
1 ½ pounds chicken tenders
2 (3.25 ounce) packages pork rinds, crushed
3 ounces finely grated Parmesan cheese
1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
¾ teaspoon cantanzaro herbs (such as Savory Spice Shop(<sup>&reg;</sup>)) or Italian seasoning
½ teaspoon sweet smoked paprika

Directions:
Combine kefir and hot sauce in a shallow bowl. Add chicken tenders and marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour, or longer if preferred.
Pour crushed pork rinds into a resealable shallow container. Mix in Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, cantanzaro herbs, and paprika.
Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C), about 3 minutes.
Drain chicken from kefir mixture and dredge through the pork rind mixture.
Air fry in the preheated fryer for a total of 17 minutes, turning chicken at the halfway point.

Description: 
This keto-friendly fried chicken is so tasty you may not even realize it's not the real deal. Cooking it in an air-fryer also speeds up the cooking time. This recipe is for boneless chicken. Bone-in chicken pieces will result in a longer cook time. I use a microplane to grate my Parmesan. Serve with your favorite sides.
