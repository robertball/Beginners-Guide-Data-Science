Ingredients:
4 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/2 - 3/4 t salt
1/4 t pepper
6 slices thick bacon
2 leeks, white and light green parts, thinly sliced
1 cup shredded fontina cheese (any shreddable white cheese can be substituted)
1/4 cup uncooked orzo

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Place a 9-inch pie plate in the oven to heat.
Cook the orzo until done in boiling salted water.  Drain.
Cook the bacon until crisp.  Drain on paper towels, let cool, & crumble into ~1/2" pieces.
Drain off all the bacon fat except for 1T.
Saute the leeks until limp, about 8 minutes.
Beat the eggs with the milk, salt and pepper.
Remove the pie plate from the oven, and add the leeks, spreading to an even layer.
Top with the bacon, then the orzo, then the cheese.
Pour the egg mixture over all.  Shake the plate to settle and remove air bubbles.
Bake for approximately 20 minutes, or until mostly set.
Switch the oven setting to broil, and broil for about 2 minutes, until the top is set, and starting to brown slightly.
Let cool 5 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
Leeks and bacon and cheese!  What could be better?  Be sure to use a good quality *thick* bacon.  The orzo can be omitted to lower the carb count.
