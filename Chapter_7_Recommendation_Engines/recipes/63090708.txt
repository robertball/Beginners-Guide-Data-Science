Ingredients:
2 tablespoons finely minced fresh ginger
Zest of 1 lemon
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups water
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 cup butter
1 cup sugar
1 cup dark molasses
3 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°.
Zest a lemon and finely chop the ginger.
In a separate bowl, combine minced ginger, lemon zest, flour, cinnamon, baking powder, ground cloves, and salt. Set aside.
Bring water and baking soda to a boil. Take off heat and set aside.
Cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add molasses and continue creaming until light in color.
Add flour mixture and water and soda mixture, alternately, in three parts. Mix well between additions.
Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well between additions. Scrape bowl and mix well for 2 minutes.
Butter or oil a 9" x 13" cake pan. Line the bottom with parchment paper for easier removal.
Pour batter into greased, lined cake pan. Batter should come up to the halfway point in the pan. Spread evenly. Bake at 350° for 45-60 minutes or until toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
Cool for 30 minutes in the pan. Slice into squares and serve warm with lightly sweetened, fresh whipped cream.

Description: 
This is a slightly modified version of the recipe from BANG! in Denver, Colorado for a wicked ginger bread that uses fresh ginger!  Serve with a dollop of home-made whipped cream, and dust a little powdered sugar on the top.  Best when it's warm with a dollop of lightly sweetened fresh whipping cream.
