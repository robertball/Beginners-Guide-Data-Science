Ingredients:
4 beaten eggs
3 c sugar
1 c oil
2 c pumpkin
2/3 c water
3 1/2 c flour
2 1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1 T cinnamon,
1 t ginger
1 1/2 t fresh grated nutmeg
1/2 t ground cloves
1 c nuts (optional)

Directions:
Mix well the first five ingredients until smooth.  Mix all the dry ingredients together and add them to the wet.  Roast the nuts to bring out their flavor.  Add the nuts to the mix. Recipe says ungreased loaf pans, but they come out better if they are sprayed with cooking spray first.
Bake 55 min. at 350 degrees.
