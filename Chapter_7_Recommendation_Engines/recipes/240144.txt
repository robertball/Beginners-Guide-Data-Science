Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound mushrooms, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt to taste
1 ¼ cups apple cider
4 slices Swiss cheese

Directions:
Season chicken all over with garlic salt and black pepper.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook chicken in hot butter until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate.
Melt remaining butter in the same skillet; cook and stir mushrooms, garlic, salt, and black pepper together in hot butter until mushrooms are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour cider into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until cider reduces, 3 to 5 minutes.
Return chicken to skillet, reduce heat to medium, cover the skillet with a lid, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Place 1 slice of Swiss cheese on each piece of chicken, cover the skillet with a lid, and cook until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes.

Description: 
It was apple cider season and I wanted to cook with it so I came up with this chicken dish. Would be good with pork chops too. I hope you enjoy it!
