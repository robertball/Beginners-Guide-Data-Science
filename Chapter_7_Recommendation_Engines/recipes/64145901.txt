Ingredients:
2 9" pie crusts
soft white pulp from 3 young coconuts
1 13.5 ounce can coconut cream
2 14 ounce cans condensed milk
1 12 ounce can evaporated milk
1 tsp salt
2 TBS cornstarch
4 eggs
2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
First, make two 9 inch pie crusts.  I use the coconut oil pie crust from the Whole Foods website. Chill the pie crusts.
Cut away the husk from the coconuts and drain the juice (which you can fridge and drink later).  Break open the coconuts and carefully remove the white pulp.  Put the pulp into a food processor and pulse until the pulp is in very small pieces.  Pour into a large bowl.
Turn on the oven to 400 degrees.  Bake the empty pie crusts for 10 minutes, then remove and let sit while the filling is being prepared.
Into the bowl with the coconut pulp, add the coconut cream, condensed and evaporated milk, and salt.  Use a wooden spoon to avoid metal discoloring of the coconut pulp. In another bowl, beat the eggs and add the cornstarch and mix fully until lumps are gone.  Pour the egg mix into the coconut mix.  Slowly heat, with occasional stirring, in the microwave.  When the mixture has come to a boil and thickened, remove from the microwave and stir in the vanilla.
Pour the hot coconut mix into the pie crusts and bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes or until the temperature in the middle of the coconut custard registers 160 degrees.
Let the pies cool and then chill before serving.
