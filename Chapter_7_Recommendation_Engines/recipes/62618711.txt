Ingredients:
1 cup Amish Friendship Bread Starter
3 eggs
1 cup oil
1/2 cup milk
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups flour
1-2 boxes instant chocolate pudding
1 cup whole cherries, pitted, defrosted and drained
1 cup whole almonds, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Preheat over to 325° F (165° C).
In a medium-sized bowl mix Amish Friendship Bread starter, eggs, oil, milk, vanilla and almond extracts.
In a large bowl mix sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, flour, and pudding.
Add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated. Fold in cherries and almonds.
Grease two large loaf pans and dust with a sugar-cocoa mixture of 1/2 cup sugar and 1 1/2 tsp cocoa powder.
Pour the batter evenly into the pans.
Bake for one hour or until the bread loosens evenly from the sides and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.
