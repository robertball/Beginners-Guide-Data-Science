Description: 
As a hot-sauce addict and after YEARS of experimenting,I have finally come up with the perfect balance of scorch and yumminess. This jelly should be poured onto a brick of cream cheese and served with your favorite cracker. You will need a food processor or blender to mince all these peppers before measuring into blender. Gloves to protect your hands are also strongly recommended.
