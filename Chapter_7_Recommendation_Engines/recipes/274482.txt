Ingredients:
Cinnamon Roll Dough:
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 tablespoons active dry yeast
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 cup melted butter
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups warm milk
5 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
Filling:
5 apples - peeled, cored, and diced
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
6 tablespoons melted butter, divided
1/2 cup brown sugar, divided
Caramel Topping:
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon light corn syrup (optional)
1 cup whipping cream
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine warm water, yeast, and 1 tablespoon sugar in a small bowl. Set aside to activate, about 5 minutes.
Mix butter, 1/2 cup sugar, eggs, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Stir in activated yeast mixture. Stir in warm milk. Add flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well.
Knead dough on a well-floured surface, adding flour until dough is no longer sticky. Place dough in a well-greased bowl and let rise, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
Meanwhile, combine apples and sugar for filling in a large saucepan. Let stand until juice starts to release. Place over medium-high heat and stir frequently until mixture comes to a boil. Boil hard for 1 minute, stirring frequently. Stir tapioca, lemon juice, and cinnamon into the mixture. Boil hard for 1 minute more; remove from heat.
Punch down risen dough and separate into 2 pieces. Roll out 1 piece into a large rectangle, about 9x13 inches and 1-inch thick. Spread 3 tablespoons melted butter all over the dough. Spread 1/2 of the apple mixture as evenly as possible over dough. Sprinkle 1/4 cup brown sugar evenly over apples. Roll dough as tightly as possible and squish seams together. Use a sharp knife or a piece of unflavored dental floss to slice dough into about a dozen 1-inch-thick rolls. Place rolls into a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with second piece of dough. Let rise until doubled in size, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden, 20 to 22 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix sugar, water, and corn syrup together in a medium-large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, whisking until sugar is dissolved. Let mixture boil until it turns caramel-colored, 5 to 12 minutes, watching so that it doesn't burn. Reduce heat to low; slowly stir in cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Continue to simmer caramel topping until thickened, about 1 minute more.
Remove cinnamon rolls from the oven and drizzle with caramel while hot.
