Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package broad egg noodles, cooked, rinsed, drained (Kosher for Passover)
1 pound ground beef
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
5 medium potatoes, cubed
1 medium onion, minced
1 (10 ounce) can tomato sauce
16 ounces processed cheese, cubed

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain, and set aside.
Brown ground beef in a large skillet over medium high heat, stirring to crumble; drain, and set aside. Heat oil in a separate skillet over medium high heat. Cook potatoes for 2 minutes, then stir in onion. Continue cooking until well browned, then carefully drain excess oil.
Combine potatoes with ground beef mixture, and stir in tomato sauce and cubed cheese. When cheese has melted, stir in noodles and continue cooking 15 minutes more. Serve immediately.
