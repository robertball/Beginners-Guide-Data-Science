Ingredients:
1 15.5oz can chickpeas
1/3 cup tahini (sesame paste, should be available in the ethnic section of your grocery store)

1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup Italian (flat leaf) parsley
2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
1/8 tsp cinnamon
Food processor or blender

Drain the beans.  Add all ingredients to the food processor or blender and puree until smooth.  For a thinner consistency, add 1 Tbsp of water at a time.  So fast and easy!  Keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.
