Ingredients:
3/4 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups warm water
1 tablespoon white sugar, or more as needed (optional)
3 1/4 cups bread flour
3/4 tablespoon salt
1 cup raisins
5 large dried figs, roughly chopped
1 teaspoon cornmeal for dusting, or as needed

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add sugar to activate yeast. Add bread flour; sprinkle salt on top. Pour in raisins and figs; mix well.
Knead dough for about 10 minutes. Place in a large glass bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 3 to 4 hours.
Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Pick up the side of the dough that's farthest from you and fold it inward, about 3/4 of the way across. Fold the last quarter of the dough all the way back over the far side, creating batard, or torpedo, shape. Press down on the seam with the side of your palm to seal it.
Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Sprinkle some cornmeal over the dough and cover loosely; let proof for 45 minutes. Sprinkle more cornmeal onto a baking sheet; flip dough onto the sheet so the seam side faces up. Use a scoring tool or serrated knife to cut a few slashes into the top of the dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown and bottom sounds hollow when tapped, about 20 minutes. Let the loaf cool for at least 30 minutes, as it will continue to cook when it comes out of the oven.

Description: 
This simple recipe yields a nice, rustic, crusty bread. Measurements are in cups instead of by weight because this is more about the ratio than the exact weight measurement.
