Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup water
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, diced
1 pound ground beef
12 pitted kalamata olives, diced
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 cup raisins
3 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir flour into water in a small bowl until dissolved.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and saute onion in oil until softened, about 5 minutes; add ground beef, olives, cumin, and paprika. Cook and stir the beef mixture until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
Pour flour-water mixture into the beef and stir to coat evenly. Add raisins, stir, and cook until the raisins are plump, about 5 minutes. Fold eggs into the beef mixture; season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool before using to fill empanadas.

Description: 
This is my grandmother's recipe for Peruvian beef empanada filling. Use homemade pie crust or, in a pinch, refrigerated pie crust to make these Peruvian turnovers. Lightly dust powdered sugar over the baked empanadas and serve with lime wedges for authentic flair.
