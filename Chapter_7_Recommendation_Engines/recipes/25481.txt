2 pounds ground lamb
1 cup raisins
5 ounces goat cheese
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1 red onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
3/4 tablespoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
salt to taste
coarsely ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
In a medium bowl, mix together ground lamb, raisins, goat cheese, mayonnaise, red onion, garlic, cilantro, cayenne pepper, cumin, ground coriander, salt and black pepper. Divide the mixture into approximately 6 even portions, and press around skewers.
Place skewers on the grill. Cook approximately 4 minutes per side, or until the cheese has melted, the raisins are tender and lamb has reached desired doneness.
