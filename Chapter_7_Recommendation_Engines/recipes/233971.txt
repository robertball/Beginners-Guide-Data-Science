Description: 
Quick and easy hollandaise sauce. Makes enough for 2 servings of eggs benedict or asparagus. I've tried several ways to make hollandaise sauce; this method works every time and is very quick. My kids love it. I put poached egg on toast or biscuit and top with sauce. I also add crumbled sausage with jalapeno and garlic.
