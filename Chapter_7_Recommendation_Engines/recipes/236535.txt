Ingredients:
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, or more to taste
1 (8 ounce) container whipped cream cheese
¾ cup crumbled feta cheese
1  tomato, diced
1 (6 ounce) can chopped black olives
¼  onion, chopped
¼ cup chopped fresh spinach

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cut each chicken breast from one side through the middle horizontally to within one-half inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book.
Mix cream cheese, feta cheese, tomato, olives, onion, and spinach together in a large bowl. Spoon cheese mixture onto 1 side of each opened chicken breast. Fold each chicken breast closed and place on a piece of aluminum foil.
Cook the chicken breasts on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
A delicious creamy blend of Greek flavors rolled up in chicken. I just threw this together last night and it turned out amazing. I made 3 chicken breasts and still have a huge bowl of filling. I am going to try to make several other dishes with it. Tonight - stuffed burgers. Tomorrow - filling on rye bread topped with shrimp or cucumber as an appetizer. It might also be delicious with lamb, fish, or in a pita wrap with lettuce. Experiment with this filling because it is delicious all on its own. Serve with Greek salad or side dish of choice.
