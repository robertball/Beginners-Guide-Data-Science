Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/2 cup rolled oats
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce
2 eggs?
3 tbsp low sodium peanut butter
2 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and lightly grease 2 large baking sheets.  (I used my large Pampered chef stoneware bar pans)
In a large bowl, mix together all the dry ingredients, add the water, apple sauce and Vanilla extract.  Lightly mix, then add the peanut butter and eggs.
Mix together on a medium speed until the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
Turn the dough onto a floured surface and kneed for approximately one minute until its no longer sticky.
Roll out the dough to ¼ inch thickness and cut into mini size shapes with your favorite cookie cutter.  Should make approx 85 bite size cookies.
Bake for 15 minutes at full heat, then turn the oven off and leave the cookies in the oven for a further 30 minutes.
Leave cookies in the baking tray for 10 minutes before cooling on a wire rack.
