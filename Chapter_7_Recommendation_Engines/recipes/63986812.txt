Ingredients:
4 slices thick cut bacon.
4 medium unpeeled red potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 medium onion, diced
Pepper / salt to taste
1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium-high heat until crispy.  Remove and set aside, leaving bacon grease in pan. Add the potatoes, onion and pepper; toss to coat. Cover and cook for 8-10 minutes or until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally. Uncover; cook until potatoes are browned, about 6 minutes.
Top with bacon (crumbled) and cheese. Remove from the heat. Cover and let stand for 2-3 minutes or until cheese is melted.
