Description: 
This is traditional Peruvian spicy cheese sauce, often served over boiled and sliced potatoes. The recipe was created based on my experiences living in Peru and makes for a delicious and easy dinner starter. Serve at room temperature or cold over boiled potatoes and top with sliced boiled eggs and kalamata olives; dust with paprika (or rocoto if you have some).
