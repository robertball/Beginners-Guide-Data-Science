Gluten Free Rhubarb (or Pineapple) Upside Down Cake Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 Cups gluten free flour mix
I use one bag each Bob's Red Mill Brown Rice Flour, White Rice Flour, Sweet Rice Flour and Tapioca Flour with 2.5 Tablespoons Xanthum Gum.
1 Cup Organic sugar
1/2 Cup butter
About 3 Stalks Rhubarb,cut in 1 inch pieces
(or one can pineapple)
2 Teaspoons baking soda
1/2 Teaspoon Salt
1 Teaspoon vanilla
1 Egg
1 Cup yogurt, kefir or milk
1/2 Cup coconut oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Melt the butter in a large cast iron frying or dutch oven
Add the sugar and the fruit. If you are using rhubarb allow the rhubarb to cook in the sugar mixture until it is soft.
Mix dry ingredients together.
Add milk, vanilla and egg.
Stir thoroughly, you don't need a mixer
Drop the cake mixture onto the fruit/sugar mixture in the frying pan. Spread it out gently, but don't worry about getting it too smooth. The globs will spread out while it is baking.
Bake for about 25 minutes, or until brown on top and a toothpick comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and invert on a serving platter. Be careful the syrup on the bottom, which will become the top, is very hot!
Allow to  cool slightly, or serve at room temperature.
I serve it with vanilla kefir from Grace Harbor Farms on the top.

Description: 
This recipe is a major hit, always.

If you want to use regular flour instead of the gluten free, it will work very well. I did it that way for 30 years before we went gluten-free
