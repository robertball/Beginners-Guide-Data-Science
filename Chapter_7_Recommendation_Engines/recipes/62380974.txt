Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cup shortening
4 egg whites
3/4 cup milk
3/4 cup strawberry syrup
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 squares BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Chocolate
2 (8 ounce) packages PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened
1/3 cup sugar
2 1/2 cups cool whip
1 package instant chocolate pudding
1/2 cup oreo crumbs (optional)

Directions:
Make the cake:
Sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Cut in shortening until fine crumbs are formed.
Add eggs, milk, syrup, and vanilla. Beat at low speed for 1 minute, then high for 2 minutes, scraping the bowl frequently. Stir in additional flour if needed.
Pour batter into 3 greased and floured round 9 inch pans. Bake in preheated 350 degree F oven (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes.
Make the filling:
Microwave chocolate in small microwaveable bowl on HIGH 1 minute; stir until chocolate is completely melted. Set aside.
Beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add chocolate; mix well.
Gently stir in cool whip, pudding mix, and cookies.
Cover the top of one cake with the filling, then place the next cake on top; continue layering with the second and third cakes.
