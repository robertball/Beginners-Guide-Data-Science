Ingredients:
3 1/2 pounds fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and chopped
6 tablespoons lemon juice
1 vanilla bean, halved lengthwise and seeds scraped out
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
2 habanero peppers, stemmed and seeded
2 (3 ounce) pouches liquid pectin
5 cups white sugar
2 cups packed brown sugar

Directions:
Put peaches in a Dutch oven or soup pot; stir in lemon juice, vanilla bean, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and cardamom.
Place habanero peppers in a blender; top peppers with peach mixture. Blend until mostly smooth; transfer mixture back to the Dutch oven. Stir pectin into peach-habanero pepper mixture; bring to a full rolling boil. Quickly stir white sugar and brown sugar into mixture; return to a boil, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes.
Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area, and wait 1 to 2 weeks before opening for best results.

Description: 
I developed this recipe when I was low on funds one holiday season and needed an inexpensive gift for family and friends. I now make several batches every years at several peoples request. It has become a huge hit at bake sales as well. Don't be afraid of the fact that it has habanero peppers in the recipe. The heat is very subtle and just adds to the flavor of the jam. It's also great spread over a block of cream cheese served with crackers for an easy appetizer for parties. Try it instead of sugar in your baked bean recipe and you will not be disappointed.
