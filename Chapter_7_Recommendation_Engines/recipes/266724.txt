Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) uncooked pie crust
1/3 cup sour cream
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons snipped fresh chives
2 ripe tomatoes - seeded, juiced, and sliced 1/2-inch-thick
1/8 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper, or to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
4 slices bacon strips, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange pie crust in a 9-inch pie plate.
Spread sour cream evenly over the crust. Sprinkle 1 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and chives over the sour cream. Arrange tomato slices evenly on top. Season with pepper. Add basil and bacon crumbles. Top with remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted and starting to brown, 30 to 35 minutes.

Description: 
Each year, I look forward to tomato season so I can make this delicious fresh tomato pie. For vegetarians, it may be made without the bacon with great results. However, using canned or hot-house tomatoes will significantly alter the flavor. Delicious side dish, or as a light dinner. I like to serve with a green salad and fresh multigrain bread.
