Ingredients:
1 cup ricotta cheese plus
2 tablespoons ricotta cheese
1/2 cup skim milk
2 eggs, separated
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon canola oil, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat a griddle to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) or place a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat.
Stir ricotta cheese, milk, and egg yolks together in a bowl until combined.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; stir in ricotta mixture.
Whisk egg whites in a bowl until frothy; fold into ricotta mixture.
Oil preheated griddle with about 1 teaspoon canola oil; pour 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle for each pancake. Cook until evenly golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes; turn and cook until evenly golden on other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter, oiling griddle between batches.

Description: 
This is a well loved recipe! I have an old, small crumpled piece of paper with this recipe hand written out from some years ago, not sure where it came from! I have my own scribbles and scratches on it, so I must have changed it somewhere in time, but this is how I have been making it the last 10 years. It is our favorite pancake recipe. So light, a little tangy, and very satisfying. Perfect with some fresh blueberries or strawberries.
