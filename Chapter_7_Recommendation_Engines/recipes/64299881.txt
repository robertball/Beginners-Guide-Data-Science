Ingredients:
3 (or 4) pounds boneless thick-cut country-style ribs
2 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 large onion, sliced
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 cup ketchup
1/4 cup worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 dashes pepper
2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In glass 9x9 baking dish, spread 1 tablespoon olive oil on bottom. Place ribs over oil, separating them slightly. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over top of ribs, rubbing to spread. Sprinkle seasoned salt lightly over all.
Place sliced onions on top of ribs. Bake ribs at 450 degrees for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in medium saucepan over medium heat, combine ketchup, worcestershire sauce, chili powder, salt, pepper  and balsamic. Bring to boil. Set aside.
After 30 minutes of baking, pour BBQ sauce over ribs, reserving about half. Return to oven. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake another 60 minutes (or longer, depending on thickness of ribs), until meat is tender. Baste every 15 minutes while cooking.
Transfer ribs to plate and pour BBQ sauce over all. Serve immediately.
