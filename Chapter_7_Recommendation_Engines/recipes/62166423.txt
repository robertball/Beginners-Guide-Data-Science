https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 purple plums
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup water
1 small handful almonds
3 tsp fresh ginger
6 oz froz. lime juice concentrate
2 Tbls lemon juice
2-3 Tbls soy sauce
6 oz Italian dressing
3-4 lb beef round eye roast

Directions:
- marinade beef in salad dressing for 3-4 hours (i always make my own salad dressing, if store bought, make sure it has Balsamic Vinegar)
- throw all other ingredients in blender to make sauce. blend until reasonably smooth.
- remove beef from marinade, save marinade
- line roasting pan with foil. place beef on foil. pour approx 1/2 of sauce on beef. cover well with foil. bake at 250 degrees for 2.5 - 3 hrs. (when meat thermometer reads 150 degrees, roast beef is med rare)
- remove roast from oven.
- to make sauce: if remainder of blended sauce equals two parts, then add one part drippings from roast and one part marinade. (or add equal parts roast drippings and marinade to blended sauce, such that your mix is 1/2 blender sauce and 1/2 marinade & drippings. not sure which is clearer.)
- cook sauce mixture on low, stirring occasionally, for approximately 15 minutes.
- pour sauce on roast, or use for dipping.
seriously, this is tender and makes a helluva fantastic gravy or au jus.

Description: 
This recipe will help you create a slightly exotic, flavorful and above all, tender and juicy beef roast. The sauce is savory and tangy. Please be sure to use an Italian dressing (or make your own marinade) containing balsamic vinegar. The results are astonishing, given the ease of preparation. I generally serve this delicious roast and sauce with roasted vegetables and rice. Please enjoy!
