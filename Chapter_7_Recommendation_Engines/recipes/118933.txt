Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter or stick margarine, softened
2 cups sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup baking cocoa
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup 1% buttermilk
1 cup hot water
FROSTING:
1 1/4 cups sugar
3 egg whites
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Coat three 9-in. round baking pans with nonstick cooking spray and sprinkle with flour; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar until crumbly, about 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Add water; mix well. Pour into prepared pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.  cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
For frosting, in a heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, egg whites, water, corn syrup and cream of tartar. With a portable mixer, beat mixture on low speed for 1 minute. Continue beating on low over low heat until a candy thermometer reads 160 degrees F, about 5 minutes. Pour into a large mixing bowl; add extract. Beat on high until stiff peaks form, about 7 minutes. Spread frosting between layers and over top and sides of cake.
