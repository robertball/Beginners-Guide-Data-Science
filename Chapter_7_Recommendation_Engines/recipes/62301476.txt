Description: 
Our recipe calls for ground ancho chile pepper. Ancho chile, the dried pod of a chile indigenous to Mexico, has a sweet, fruity flavor and a mild heat. It is also called poblano when fresh. If you can't find ground ancho chile pepper in your supermarket, you can substitute Mexican-style chili powder.
