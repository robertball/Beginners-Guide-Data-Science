Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
2 zucchini, chopped
2 carrots, chopped
2 celery stalks, chopped
fresh spinach, chopped (about 2 cups)
1 can (28 oz) organic diced tomatoes, undrained
1 can (15.5 oz) cannellini beans
1 carton (32 oz) organic chicken broth
4 cups tomato juice (I use my mom's homemade tomato juice, but I'm sure V8 would work just fine)
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon salt (optional)
1/4 teaspoon pepper (optional)
2 cups uncooked rotini

Directions:
1.  Add olive oil to pan; heat over medium heat.  Add garlic and onion and cook about 2 minutes, until onion is tender.
2.  Stir in remaining ingredients except pasta.  Heat to boiling.  Reduce heat; cover and simmer 45 minutes.
3.  Heat to boiling, stir in pasta and return to boiling.  Simmer uncovered 10 to 15 minutes or until pasta is tender.
