Ingredients:
Kale, love, 2 cups salt water, rainbows, various fruits and vegetables, a dinosaur bone/fossil, whatever ya got in the fridge/pantry and taco bell's mild sauce

Directions:
preheat oven to coldest setting(I know you've been wanting to know what that was), set up kale in strips on a baking sheet. Dump cups of salt water on kale. Now using the dino bone/fossil squish all of the fruits and vegetables together in a large bowl. Dip each individual kale strip into the mixture one at a time and place back onto sheet. Now look in your fridge/pantry, close your eyes and grab something. Add that on top of your kale. Now use that rainbow you have been saving and watch it for awhile to raise your moral (after seeing kale get all messy like that must have really made you down huh?). Next you MUST add your love. Without it the dish will self destruct halfway through the cooking process. Now, put your masterpiece into the oven. Finally, use the taco bell mild sauce as a dip for your dinomite's fluffy bites!
