Description: 
You've had Margherita pizza. But have you had Margherita spaghetti? You are going to LOVE this recipe. This is a new twist on an all-time favorite pizza with lots of fresh basil. I think this is one of the best pasta recipes ever. This dish has 3 major elements: the pasta, the veggies/herbs, and the cream sauce.
