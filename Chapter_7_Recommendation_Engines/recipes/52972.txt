Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked basmati rice
2 eggs
4 ounces smoked haddock, or other white fish
1 bay leaf
1 cup milk, or as needed
1 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon curry powder
4 green onions, chopped
1/4 cup frozen green peas
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup low-fat plain yogurt

Directions:
Prepare rice according to package directions. Drain, and set aside to cool. Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. Set aside.
Place the haddock in a small skillet with the bay leaf. Pour in enough milk just to cover the fish. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, and cook gently until fish flakes. Remove fish from the pan, flake with a fork, and set aside. Discard milk and bay leaf.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in curry powder, then add the peas and onions. Fry for a couple of minutes, then add the cooked rice, eggs, and fish. Stir gently, and season with salt and pepper. Heat through, and serve with yogurt.
