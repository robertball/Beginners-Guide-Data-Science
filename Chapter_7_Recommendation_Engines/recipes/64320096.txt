Three Milk Cake Recipe

Ingredients:
Either cake mix or ingredients for a white cake or sponge cake
1 can condensed milk
1 can evaporated milk
1 cup whole milk or half and half
1 cup whipping cream
1/2 cup sugar

Directions:
Bake the cake as directed on box. Once you’ve made your cake, take a toothpick and poke little holes every inch or so in the cake.
Mix your three milks together–1 can condensed milk, 1 can evaporated milk and one cup whole milk. If you like, you can add a bit of brandy, amaretto or whatever other flavor you enjoy at this point.
Slowly pour the three milk mixture over the cake until the cake is saturated. Don’t overdo it, or you’ll have cake soup. You do want the cake to be very, very moist. You’ll probably end up with some leftover milk. No worries–just don’t drink it if you’re on a diet!
Whip one cup of whipping cream (isn’t this milk number four?) until stiff, and then add sugar to taste. A third to a half a cup works well. I add powdered sugar because it’s never grainy. You can also put a teaspoon of vanilla for some extra flavor.
You can either spread the whipped cream directly on the cake, or add a layer of flavor here. Strawberries can be sliced on the cake before the whipped cream is added, or a layer of tropical jam, such as pineapple or guava can be added first.
Once the whipped cream is one the cake, the traditional thing to do is to top with cherries. However, you can sprinkle cinnamon, cocoa, orange skin peelings…whatever works with the flavors you have chosen.
