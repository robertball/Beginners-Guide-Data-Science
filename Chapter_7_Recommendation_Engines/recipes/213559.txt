Ingredients:
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 tablespoon white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Whisk together the brown sugar, white sugar, baking powder, milk, egg, olive oil, and vanilla extract. Stir in the flour 1/2 cup at a time until the batter reaches the desired thickness. The batter should look like cake batter (not too thin, but not too thick).
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side.

Description: 
This recipe comes from a hand-written addition to my mother's Home and Garden cookbook (you know the one with the red and white checkers that used to be given as wedding presents back in the 50's). Her book is older than I am. Anyway this is simply the best pancake recipe I've ever tried. I have tried a few, but always come back to this one.
