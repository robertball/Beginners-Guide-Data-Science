Ingredients:
1 slice white bread, torn into small pieces
1 clove garlic, minced
3 tablespoons boiling water
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 medium red onion, chopped
1/4 cup dried cranberries, chopped
2 ounces Brie cheese, cubed
2 tablespoons tomato ketchup
2 sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Combine the white bread, garlic, and boiling water in a mixing bowl; mash with a fork to combine. Add the turkey, red onion, cranberries, Brie, rosemary, ketchup, salt, and pepper; mix thoroughly with your hands. Shape the mixture into 6 patties.
Cook under the preheated broiler until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
I made these when I was looking for something interesting to do with ground turkey. They are very moist and delicious on home-baked bread buns.
