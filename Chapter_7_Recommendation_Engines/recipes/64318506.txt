Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped onion
4 tablespoons butter
1 med. to lg. butternut squash (split in half, baked, and scooped out)
4 cups chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 cup unsweetened apple sauce
1/2 c. half-n-half

Directions:
Split butternut squash lengthwise, scoop out seeds, and place in a microwave safe container. Cook until squash is soft (add a little water to the pan if desired). Cool, then scoop out interior of squash. In a large saucepan, saute onions in butter until tender. Add squash, broth, marjoram, black pepper and cayenne pepper. (If you like it more peppery, double cayenne). Bring to boil; simmer for  20 to 30 min. to set flavors.
Puree squash and cream cheese in a blender or food processor in batches until smooth. Return to saucepan, stir in applesauce and half-n-half, and heat through. Do not allow to boil.
