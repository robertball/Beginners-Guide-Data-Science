Ingredients:
1 pound fresh or frozen skinless cod, orange roughy or other mild fish fillets
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
2 teaspoons HERB-OX® Chicken Flavored Bouillon Granules
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons mayonnaise or salad dressing
2 tablespoons sour cream
1 teaspoon lime juice
1 1/2 cups shredded coleslaw mix
8 (6 inch) flour tortillas, warmed

Directions:
Heat oven to 450 degrees F.  Thaw fish fillets, if frozen.  Rinse fish and pat dry with paper towels.  Cut fish fillets crosswise into 1-inch slices.  Place fish in single layer in a greased shallow pan.  Combine margarine, bouillon, cumin and garlic powder.  Brush over fish.  Bake for 4-6 minutes or until fish flakes easily when pierced with a fork.  Meanwhile, combine mayonnaise, sour cream and lime juice.  Add coleslaw mixture; toss to coat.  Spoon coleslaw mixture onto each warm tortilla.  Top with fish.  If desired, serve with salsa.
