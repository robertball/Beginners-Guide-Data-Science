Ingredients:
1 Package Kale (aprox. 2 bunches or 6 cups)
3 Hardboiled Eggs, chopped
3 Slices Crisp Bacon, chopped
1/3 cup Muscat Grapes (any seedless grapes)
2 T Chopped Parsley
¼ cup Grated Parmesan Cheese
¼ cup and 2 T  Roasted Pumpkin Seeds
4-6 Tablespoons Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing
Salt and Ground Black Pepper to Taste
Optional: Rosemary flowers for garnish

Directions:
Place 3 room temperature eggs in a pot of boiling water.  Remove pot from heat and let sit for fifteen minutes to cook eggs.  Place in ice water to cool in order to avoid gray yolks.
Cook bacon on medium low heat until crisp on both sides.  Blot any remaining oil with a paper towel and then chop into small pieces.
Chop parsley, cut grapes in halves and grate parmesan cheese and set aside.
Prepare kale by washing, drying with a paper towel or salad spinner, and removing thick stems.  Chop leaves in thin, ribbon-like pieces
Toss all the ingredients before serving, starting with the kale and dressing.  Toss well, making sure all kale is covered.  Then add all additional ingredients and toss, reserving the cheese and pumpkin seeks for the final toss.
