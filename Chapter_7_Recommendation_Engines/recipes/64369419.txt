Ingredients:
CARAMEL:
1/2 cup sugar
2 Tbls cup water
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 Tbls butter
CUSTARD:
6 large Egg Yolks
6 T. Sugar
1½ C. Whole Milk
1½ t. Vanilla

Directions:
CARAMEL:
in a small heavy saucepan, combine sugar and water; stir gently to moisten all the sugar. Cook over medium-low heat, gently swirling pan occasionally, until sugar is dissolved. Cover; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook 1 minute.
Uncover pan; continue to boil until syrup turns a medium amber color. Immediately remove from heat and carefully stir in cream and butter.
CUSTARD:
Place the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and whisk until pale yellow, 2-3 minutes.
Place the milk in a medium saucepan and bring just to a boil.
Slowly whisk the hot milk into the egg/sugar mixture.
Transfer the mixture back to the saucepan and stir over medium heat until custard thickens, about 4 minutes. Custard should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Mix in the vanilla, then stir in the caramel sauce and serve warm or cold over apple cake.
