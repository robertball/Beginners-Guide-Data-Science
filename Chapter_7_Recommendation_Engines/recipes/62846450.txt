Ingredients:
4 oz turkey sausage
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped mushrooms
1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/3 cup water
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3/4 cup egg substitute
1/2 egg white substitute
1 cup fat free milk
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup fat free mozzarela cheese

Directions:
In a nonstick skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink. Remove with a slotted spoon to paper towels. Discard drippings. In the same pan, saute potatoes, onion and garlic in oil until potatoes are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add water, seasonings and sausage; cook and stir over medium heat until the water has evaporated, about 1 minute.
In a bowl, combine the eggs, egg whites, buttermilk, flour and Parmesan cheese. Stir in sausage mixture. Fill muffin cups coated with nonstick cooking spray three-fourths full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a knife comes out clean. Carefully run a knife around the edge of cups to loosen frittatas. Serve with salsa.
