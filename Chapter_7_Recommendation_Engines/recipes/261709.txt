Ingredients:
Preserved Lemon Vinaigrette:
3/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup minced chives
1/4 cup diced preserved lemon
1/4 cup Champagne vinegar
10 pounds sockeye salmon fillets
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
Preserved Lemon Beurre Blanc:
1/2 (750 milliliter) bottle white wine
3/4 cup sliced shallots
1 pound butter
1/2 cup minced chives
1/4 cup diced preserved lemon
1 cup chopped parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk olive oil, 1/2 cup chives, 1/4 cup preserved lemon, and Champagne vinegar together in a bowl.
Lay salmon fillets on the prepared baking sheets. Pour vinaigrette over the top. Season with salt and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until flesh flakes easily with a fork, 8 to 14 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillets.
Bring white wine and shallots to a simmer in a large saucepan. Cook until volume is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add butter, whisking constantly until melted. Move saucepan on and off the heat so sauce is just hot enough to melt butter, but never simmering.
Stir 1/2 cup chives and 1/4 cup preserved lemon into the beurre blanc. Season with salt and pepper.
Transfer salmon fillets to a large platter. Pour beurre blanc on top. Garnish with parsley.

Description: 
We made this recipe for a party, so it's enough for 40 people, but the recipe can easily be scaled down. Beurre blanc is basically a white wine reduction that has been emulsified with butter. Pairs well with a white Burgundy or Chardonnay, or a seasonal beer.
