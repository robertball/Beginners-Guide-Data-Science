Ingredients:
1 potato, peeled and cubed (optional)
1 (18 ounce) jar creamy peanut butter
1 egg white, beaten until foamy
1/2 cup margarine
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar, or as needed
1 (12 ounce) bag chocolate chips

Directions:
Place potato into a saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. Mash potato in a bowl until no lumps remain; set aside to cool.
Mix peanut butter, egg white, margarine, and confectioners' sugar in a bowl to make a stiff mixture that holds its shape when formed. Mix in the cooled mashed potato.
Cover and refrigerate peanut butter filling overnight.
Place chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl and heat in microwave on high power for 1 minute; stir. Continue to heat and stir the chocolate chips in 15-second intervals until just warm and smoothly melted; do not overheat.
Scoop up about 1 tablespoon (or desired amount) of peanut butter filling, form into an egg shape, and dip into the melted chocolate. Set chocolate-covered egg aside on waxed paper to set up. Repeat with remaining filling and chocolate. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
You can make these easy peanut butter eggs yourself any size or shape. They are a MUST HAVE during the Easter holiday...I used the least amount of paraffin wax I could to make the chocolate shiny. Add coconut, nuts, or raisins if desired.
