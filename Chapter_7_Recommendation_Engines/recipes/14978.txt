Description: 
This was a childhood memory that I was craving, so I called my nanny and she gave the recipe to me.  The second I tasted it, I was flushed with happy thoughts.  It tastes like caramel!  Enjoy with slices of apples for a healthy snack!  Be creative: You can add peanut butter, nuts or chocolate sauce, or try using strawberry flavored cream cheese.  Have fun and enjoy!
