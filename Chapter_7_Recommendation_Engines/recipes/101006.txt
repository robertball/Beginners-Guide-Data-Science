Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cubed
2 tablespoons lemon juice
6 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
1 cup cornstarch
2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
2 medium shallots, finely minced, divided
1/2 bunch green onions, sliced, divided
vegetable oil for pan-frying
1/4 cup champagne vinegar
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Toss the tofu with lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce in a small bowl, set aside to marinate.
Combine the cornstarch and bread crumbs with 1 minced shallot and half of the green onions in a bowl.  Toss the tofu with the cornstarch mixture to generously bread; reserve the remaining marinade.
Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Fry the tofu cubes on all sides until golden brown, remove to drain on a paper towel.
Whisk together the remaining marinade with the vinegar, 4 tablespoons of soy sauce, sugar, and chili oil; set aside.  Toss together the salad mix, cucumber, tomato, and tofu cubes in a large bowl; add the dressing and toss to combine.
