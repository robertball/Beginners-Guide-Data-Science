1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine Parmesan cheese, paprika, garlic powder, salt, parsley, and pepper in a flat shallow dish; mix well.
Coat each pork chop with olive oil. Dredge both sides of each chop in the Parmesan mixture and set on a plate.
Place 2 chops in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 10 minutes; flipping halfway through cook time.
Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining chops.
