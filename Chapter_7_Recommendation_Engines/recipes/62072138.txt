Ingredients:
16oz heavy cream
1 stick butter or margarine
1 clove fresh garlic
1 can parmesan cheese

Directions:
First DO NOT USE fresh parmesan cheese it will clump and you will have one big huge ball of cheese.
Melt the butter and heat the garlic a little together in medium size pot.
Add the heavy cream stirring do not let it boil.
Add the parmesan cheese slowly little at a time to let it melt and kind of disolve into the cream and butter stirring alot to keep from sticking to bottom of pot.
toss over any kind of pasta and enjoy.
hint: tri color pasta makes for a beautiful dish.
eat it plain or serve with chicken or vegetables (peppers and onions are the best)
