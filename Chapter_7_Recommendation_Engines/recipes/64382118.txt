Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can black beans, drained, rinsed and patted dry
1/2 green bell pepper, cut into 2 inch pieces
1/2 onion, cut into wedges
3 cloves garlic, peeled
1 egg
3/4 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon cumin
1 teaspoon Thai chili sauce or hot sauce
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/2 tsp salt
1/8 tsp pepper

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mash black beans with a fork until thick and pasty.
In a food processor, finely chop bell pepper, onion, and garlic. Then stir into mashed beans.
In a small bowl, stir together egg, chili powder, cumin, and chili sauce.
Stir the egg mixture into the mashed beans. Mix in bread crumbs until the mixture is sticky and holds together. Divide mixture into four patties.
Place patties in an airtight container with parchment paper layered between each. Let freeze overnight. When ready to eat remove from freezer (do not allow to thaw) and follow directions below.
If grilling, place patties on foil, and grill about 8 minutes on each side. If pan frying, pre-heat pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Spray lightly with oil and add patties.Turn heat down to medium and cook for 8 minutes on each side. While cooking on first side, lightly spray side up before turning.
