Ingredients:
12 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup white wine
3 cups diagonally sliced asparagus
6 sprigs fresh thyme

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Tear off 6 large pieces of foil. Divide garlic, olive oil, wine, asparagus, and thyme and arrange them on each piece of foil. Fold over each foil packet to seal. Place the packets on a baking sheet and roast for 20 to 25 minutes until the asparagus is tender, but still a little crisp. Carefully open packets and serve asparagus with juices poured on top.
