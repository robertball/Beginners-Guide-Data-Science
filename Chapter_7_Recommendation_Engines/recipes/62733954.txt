Ingredients:
2 cucumbers peeled & halved lengthwise, seeded and thinly sliced crosswise
1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced or chopped
1 large red bell pepper cut in thin strips
1 carrot cut in thin strips
1/4 c rice wine vinegar
2 packets Truvia
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
salt and pepper

Directions:
I actually use a peeler on the cucumber and carrot to slice it into thin strips that are kind of like lettuce :) The red pepper and onion are finely chopped to give a little texture difference.
Combine the ingredients in a large bowl and toss. Fresh mint is a nice addition as well.
