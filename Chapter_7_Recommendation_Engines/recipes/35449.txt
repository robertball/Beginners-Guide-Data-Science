Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
5 cups Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1 cup cinnamon chips (such as Hershey'sÂ®)
3 tablespoons butter
Cinnamon Chip Streusel:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup brown sugar
6 tablespoons butter
2/3 cup cinnamon chips
Vanilla Sauce:
2 eggs
1 cup half-and-half cream
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C.)
In a large bowl, mix together 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour and cinnamon. Stir in sliced apples until coated with sugar mixture. Stir in 1 cup cinnamon chips. Pour filling into prepared pie crust, and dot with 3 tablespoons butter.
To make streusel topping: mix together 3/4 cup flour and 3/4 cup brown sugar in a mixing bowl. Cut in 6 tablespoons butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in remaining 2/3 cup cinnamon chips. Sprinkle streusel topping over apple filling.
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking for until filling is bubbling and streusel is golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes more. Allow to cool for at least 1 hour before serving.
While the pie is cooling, prepare the vanilla sauce. In the top of a double boiler over medium heat, whisk together eggs, half-and-half and 1/2 cup sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce has thickened. Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla. Spoon sauce (warm or cooled) over slices of pie.

Description: 
Not your typical apple pie! Cinnamon chips are scattered throughout the pie and in the streusel, giving the apples the cinnamon flavor they deserve.
