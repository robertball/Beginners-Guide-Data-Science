Ingredients:
8 (3 ounce) fillets salmon (about 3/4-inch thick)
Freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 3/4 cups Swanson® Chicken Broth (Regular, Natural Goodness™ or Certified Organic)
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 teaspoon grated orange peel
Orange slices for garnish

Directions:
Place the salmon in an 11x8-inch (2-quart) shallow baking dish. Sprinkle with black pepper and drizzle with oil. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.
Stir the cornstarch, broth, vinegar, brown sugar, orange juice and orange peel in a 2-quart saucepan over high heat to a boil. Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens.
Place the salmon on a serving platter and serve with the sauce. Garnish with the orange slices.
