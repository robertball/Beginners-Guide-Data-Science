Ingredients:
1 eight ounce package cream cheese
1 1/2 cup unsalted butter
3 cups sugar (sifted)
6 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon orange extract
1 teaspoon lemon extract
3 cups cake flour (sift before measuring)

Directions:
Have all ingredients at room temperature. DO NOT PREHEAT OVEN!
Add butter and cream cheese together in a bowl and beat with an  electric mixer for about four minutes on medium speed.  Add sugar one cup at a time and beat until light and fluffy, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Put eggs in a cup and beat with a fork, lightly.  Add eggs to mixture a little at a time and beat after each addition.  Do not over beat, but you should beat about a minute after each addition.  Add flavorings to this mixture and beat.  Add flour to this mixture one cup at a time and scrape down the sides of the bowl after each cup.  Do not over beat.  Beat just until the flour is incorporated into the batter.  Overbeating will make the cake heavy.
Pour cake batter in a greased and floured 10 inch tube cake pan.  You can grease the pan with Crisco or a small amount of softened butter and dust lightly with flour.  Put cake in a cold oven and bake for 80 minutes at 325 degrees and check. Usually it should cook for about 90-95 minutes depending on your oven temperature. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted comes out clean.  Serve plain or with strawberries and whipped cream.  Enjoy!

Description: 
This is a moist pound cake with a very good flavor.  I always make this cake for my family at holidays and they absolutely love it. It can be made ahead and wrapped in foil or plastic wrap for a few days.
