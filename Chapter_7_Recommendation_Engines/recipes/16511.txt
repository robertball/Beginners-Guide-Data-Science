Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup ketchup
1/2 packet dry onion soup mix
3 slices leftover bread (heels are great), torn into bite-size pieces
1 teaspoon Italian-style seasoning
1 tablespoon water
water as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine the beef, ketchup, soup mix, bread, Italian-style seasoning and water. Mix well. Shape into a loaf and place into a 9 inch pie pan OR a 9x13 inch baking dish. Baste the top of the meatloaf with ketchup.
Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for one hour, or until the edges are just crispy and the top has a crust.
Cool for 15 to 20 minutes before cutting.

Description: 
This is the meatloaf I taught myself how to make when I tried to duplicate my Daddy's meatloaf! It's a perennial family favorite! It's wonderful sliced cold the next day and used in a warm, toasted sandwich with a little butter.
