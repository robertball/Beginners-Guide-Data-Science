Ingredients:
3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
3/4 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1/4 tsp cumin
1/8 tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp dried oregano
2 tbsps vegetable oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 carrot, minced
1 celery stalk, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 oz mushrooms, sliced
1 6 oz can tomato paste
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup low sodium chicken stock

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2. Mix together salt, cinnamon, black pepper, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and oregano. Generously season both sides of chicken breasts, patting the seasoning on all sides. Reserve extra seasoning for sauce.
3. In a large oven-safe skillet, heat 2 tbsps vegetable oil over medium heat until oil begins to slightly shimmer. Place chicken breasts in skillet and cook 3 minutes, or until browned. Flip, and cook an additional 3 minutes. Remove chicken breasts from pan, and set aside.
4. Add onion, garlic, carrot, celery, and mushrooms to skillet. Cook 2 minutes, or until onions become slightly translucent. Add in wine, and scrape browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Allow wine to reduce slightly, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste, chicken broth, and reserved seasoning. Cover skillet with aluminum foil or oven-safe lid, place in oven, and bake at 375 degrees for 35 minutes. Remove cover, and bake an additional 15-20 minutes, or until sauce is bubbling and chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees.

Description: 
A delicious and nutritious way to eat chicken breasts! Since this makes a lot of sauce too, it's really great served over brown rice, garlic mashed potatoes--or my favorite, polenta! Top with a grating of Romano or Asiago cheese just before serving for the best results!
