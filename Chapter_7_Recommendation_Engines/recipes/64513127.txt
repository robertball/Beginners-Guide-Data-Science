Ingredients:
Cookies:
3/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp. vanilla
2 3/4 cups four
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
Frosting:
1 1/2 cups icing sugar
3 tbsp. butter, softened
1 tbsp. vanilla
1 tbsp. milk
Food coloring, optional
Colored sugar sprinkles, optional

Directions:
Cookies:
Cream butter and sugar together well.
Mix in eggs and vanilla, beating until light & fluffy.
Mix flour, baking powder and salt together.
Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture and blend well.
Chill for an hour to make handling easier (I've skipped this step & it worked ok, but def chill it if it's too soft).
On lightly floured surface, roll the dough to 1/4" thickness.
Cut with cookie cutters.
Bake @ 375 x 8 - 10 minutes or until very lightly browned.
Cool on wire racks.
Frost.
Frosting:
Mix all ingredients (except food coloring), adding additional milk to thin to desired spreading consistency.
Beat until creamy and smooth.
Add coloring, if using.
Frost cookies, add colored sugar sprinkles, if using
I like to let these sit in single layers for a few hours, if possible, before stacking in storage containers between wax or parchment paper layers.

Description: 
Stir up a batch & grab some fun cookie cutters! I've also included the frosting recipe. These are even more moist after sitting several hours after frosting. These freeze quite well.
