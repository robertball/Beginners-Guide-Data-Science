Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie crust pastry
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground cinnamon
2 eggs
5 Bartlett pears, peeled and chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press pie crust pastry into a 9-inch pie dish and refrigerate while preparing filling.
Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, flour, nutmeg, allspice, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into butter mixture until incorporated; fold in pears. Pour filling into chilled crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set in the middle, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool completely before serving, about 1 hour.
