Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated pizza dough
2 (6 ounce) cans crabmeat, drained and flaked
1 cup canned pizza sauce
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained and roughly chopped
1 (8 ounce) package light cream cheese, cubed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a pizza pan or cookie sheet.
Spread both cans of dough out to cover the prepared pan, sealing any seams. Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the crust, and dot with cream cheese cubes. Sprinkle shredded crabmeat over, then pineapple pieces.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the crust is lightly browned.
