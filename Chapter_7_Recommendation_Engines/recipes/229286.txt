Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons milk
1 large egg
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon raspberry extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup fresh raspberries
1/2 cup white chocolate chips
5 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon raspberry extract
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour 12 muffin cups.
Combine 2 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk both amounts of milk with  egg in another bowl; stir into flour mixture with 1/4 cup melted butter, 1 teaspoon raspberry extract, and vanilla extract until just moistened. Batter will be lumpy. Fold in raspberries and white chocolate chips; spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Mix 5 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon raspberry extract in a bowl. Use a pastry cutter to chop 2 tablespoons butter into mixture until it resembles a coarse crumble; sprinkle over muffins.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 18 to 21 minutes.
