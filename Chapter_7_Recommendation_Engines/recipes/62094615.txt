Ingredients:
1 chopped onion
3 cloves minced garlic
2 1/2 tsp chili powder
1 tsp dried oregano
28 oz can Rotel
32 oz chicken broth
1 1/3 c. water
2 c. Instant Rice (I used Minute Rice)
12.5 oz can of chunk chicken breast
1 c. frozen corn
6 corn tortillas cut into strips
vegetable oil for frying tortilla strips
Shredded Monterey Jack Cheese

Directions:
In your crock pot combine first 10 ingredients. Stir together. Set crockpot on high and cook for about 5 hours. If you want to leave all day you can set crock pot on low and cook for 8-10 hrs. At the end of cooking time, cut corn tortillas into strips. Heat oil in a frying pan on medium heat. Place tortilla strips into oil about a handful at a time. Cook until crispy. Pull out of oil and place on a paper towel. When soup is done, ladle soup into individual bowls and top with tortilla strip and cheese. Enjoy!
