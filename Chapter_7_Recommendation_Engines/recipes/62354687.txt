Ingredients:
1 cup seasoned bread crumbs
2/3 cup heavy cream or half/half
1 pound ground chuck
1 pound ground sirloin
1 pound Fontina or mozzarella cheese cut into 16 small pieces
3 teaspoons fine sea salt
Grinding coarse black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Put the bread crumbs in a medium size bowl and pour the cream over them. Mix with a fork; the mixture will not be soupy.
Add the ground chuck, sirloin, and salt and pepper. Mix just to combine the ingredients. Divide the mixture into 16 equal pieces and roll each in the palm of your hand to make compact  2 1/2-inch balls.
Insert your thumb into the middle of each meatball and push in a piece of cheese. Close the meatball encasing the cheese and smooth the top.
Place the meatballs on a rimmed, nonstick baking sheet. Bake them for 20-25 minutes or until nicely browned. Serve hot as is or put them in tomato sauce and serve with pasta
