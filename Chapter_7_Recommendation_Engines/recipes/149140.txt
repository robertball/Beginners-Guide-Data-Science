Ingredients:
2 slices day-old white bread, cubed
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay™
1/2 teaspoon dried mustard
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
2 dashes liquid hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco™
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 pound fresh lump crabmeat
4 (6 ounce) fillets rockfish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 baking dish.
Mix the bread cubes, parsley, seafood seasoning, mustard, pepper, lemon juice, pepper sauce, butter, and mayonnaise together in a mixing bowl. Gently stir in the crabmeat until well blended, being careful not to break the crab chunks.
Place the fish fillets on a clean surface, and spoon 1/4 of the crab mixture onto one side. Starting on the side with the crab mixture, roll up the fillet around the crab filling. Place the rolled fish into the prepared dish open side down.
Bake in preheated oven until light brown and bubbly, and fish flakes with a fork, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
People along the Chesapeake can be tight-lipped with their crab imperial recipes. I coaxed this one out of a old waterman. Substitute sole or flounder when Pacific rockfish is not in season.
