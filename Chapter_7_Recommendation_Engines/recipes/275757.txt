Combine water, mushrooms, celery, onions, carrots, bouquet garni, garlic, bay leaves, salt, and pepper in a large soup pot and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Reduce to a gentle simmer and cook until reduced by 1/2, 45 to 50 minutes.

Description: 
When I am transforming a meat dish into vegetarian, there are certain shortcuts I know: I can use QuornÂ® or TVP for chicken, and vegetable stock for chicken stock. And, I can use organic mushrooms in place of stewing beef. But for a long time, I didn't have a replacement for beef stock. Sure, I could use vegetable stock, but it wasn't earthy enough, it was too light. So, I invented the stock below for a rich earthy stock for vegan use!
