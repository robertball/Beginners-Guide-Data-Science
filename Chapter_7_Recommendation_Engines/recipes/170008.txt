Ingredients:
1 pound raw peanuts, in shells
1 (3 ounce) package dry crab boil (such as Zatarain'sÂ® Crab and Shrimp Boil)
1/2 cup chopped jalapeno peppers
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1/2 cup salt
2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
1/2 cup red pepper flakes

Directions:
Place peanuts, crab boil, jalapenos, garlic powder, salt, Cajun seasoning, and red pepper flakes into a slow cooker. Pour in water to cover the peanuts and stir to combine. Cover and cook on Low until peanuts are soft, at least 24 hours. Stir occasionally, and add water as needed to keep peanuts covered. Drain; serve hot or cold.

Description: 
This is the real deal that is found in the heart of Florida.  I made this recipe to resemble the taste of my favorite boiled peanuts found in the Ocala National Forest.  My family agreed this recipe was one of the best!
