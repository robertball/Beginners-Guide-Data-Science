Ingredients:
1/3 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons yellow mustard
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/3 cup milk
1/3 cup ketchup
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 cup regular or instant rolled oats
1/3 cup finely chopped onion
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. For the glaze, combine the 1/3 cup ketchup, brown sugar, and the 2 teaspoons mustard in a small bowl. Set aside until ready to use.
Combine eggs, milk, the 1/3 cup ketchup, and the 1 teaspoon mustard in a large bowl. Stir in ground beef, rolled oats, onion, salt, and pepper; mix well. Gently press mixture in an ungreased 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Bake for 30 minutes. Drain off fat.
[Cleaning tip: Wipe off any grease or spills on the countertop with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*.]
After 30 minutes of baking, spoon the glaze evenly over the meatloaf. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes more or until a thermometer registers 160 degrees F. Let the meat loaf stand for 15 minutes. Drain off fat. Carefully slice meatloaf and use a spatula to transfer to a serving platter.
