Ingredients:
6 cloves garlic
salt to taste
2 teaspoons paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3/4 cup chopped parsley
1 lemon, juiced
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 pounds red potatoes, sliced 1/2 inch thick
1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares
1 large green bell pepper, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
4 stalks celery, cut into 2 inch pieces
1 pound tomatoes, each cut into 8 wedges
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, paprika, cumin, and cayenne in a food processor bowl.  Process until mixture forms a paste. Add herbs, and pulse a few times to blend. Add lemon juice, vinegar, and 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil; blend.  Season to taste with salt.
In a large bowl, combine potatoes, peppers, and celery. Season with salt, and toss with herb sauce. Transfer to a large shallow baking dish.  Scatter tomatoes among the potato mixture. Drizzle 1 to 2 tablespoons oil over top, and cover with foil.
Bake for 35 minutes. Remove foil.  Continue baking until vegetables are tender, 20 to 30 minutes.  Serve warm.
