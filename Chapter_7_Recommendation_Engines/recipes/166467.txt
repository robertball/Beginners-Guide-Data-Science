Ingredients:
2 cups broccoli florets
1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
1 tablespoon Montreal steak seasoning
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine the broccoli and bell pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle the steak seasoning, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper over the vegetables; drizzle with the olive oil and toss to coat. Spread the vegetables into a shallow baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the vegetables are tender and beginning to brown, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
Tender, flavorful, delicious, and a nice twist to steaming vegetables. This has become the new favorite way to prepare broccoli in our house. Try substituting asparagus or stir-fry vegetables too!
