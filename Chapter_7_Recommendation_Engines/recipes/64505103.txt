https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1½ pounds fresh red jalapeño peppers, stemmed, seeded, and roughly chopped
8 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
? cup apple cider vinegar
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 large dried Medjool date, pitted
2 tablespoons Paleo-friendly fish sauce (wheat-free and sugar-free)
1½ teaspoons kosher salt

Directions:
If you are sensitive to spices, put on some latex/non-latex gloves.
De-seed and de-vein jalapeños for a medium heat, leave as much or as little to make your sauce spicier.
Place all your ingredients into a high-speed blender and blend until smooth. If you have to use a food processor (like me), blend a bit longer to achieve the smooth texture.
Pour sauce in a pan over medium heat and allow it to come to a boil.
Reduce and simmer for 5-10 minutes.
Test for seasoning.
Let cool and store in a air tight container in the fridge for up to a week.

Description: 
Adapted from Nom Nom Paleo. Michelle is my hero. I love sriracha, and when I am doing a Whole 30 it is off my can have list. But she has saved me! If you don't know what sriracha is, its a delightful spicy sauce that can add a bump to any dish...great for mixing with homemade mayo for a dipping sauce.
