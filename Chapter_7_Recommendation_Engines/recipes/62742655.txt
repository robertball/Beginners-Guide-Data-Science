Ingredients:
1 cup Sriracha Cream Cheese
6 oz drained, flaked lump crabmeat
1 T soy sauce
1 clove minced garlic
4 green onions, green part only, sliced
1/4 tsp minced lemon zest
1 tsp toasted sesame oil
36 won ton wrappers
1 egg white beaten
Vegetable or peanut oil for frying
Sriracha-Sesame Vinagrette

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the Sriracha cream cheese, crabmeat, soy sauce, garlic, green onions, lemon zest, and sesame oil. Arrange each wonton wrapper diagonally so it forms a diamond shape. Place a generous teaspoon of filling just above the center. Brush the outer edges of each wrapper with a small amount of the egg white. Fold the filled wontons in half, forming each into a triangle, pressing to seal the edges tightly.
Preheat the over to 200 degrees F. Heat oil to 375. Fry the wontons in batches for 3 to 5 minutes until crispy and golden. Keep cooked wontons on a wire rack on a baking sheet in the pre heated oven.
Serve with Sriracha-Sesame Vinagrette.
