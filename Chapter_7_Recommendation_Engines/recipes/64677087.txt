Ingredients:
1 package Italian meatballs, 48 oz
1 small onion, chopped
1 small bell pepper, chopper
1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 loaf Italian bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 (8 ounce) package Neufchâtel cheese, softened
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tsp Italian seasoning
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1/2 cup water
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Arrange bread cubes on a 11" x 15" baking sheet in a single layer. Bake until browned, about 5 minutes.  Grease a 9" x 13" baking dish and place bread cubes in a single layer.
Combine onions, bell peppers, Neufchâtel cheese, mayonnaise, Italian seasoning, Parmesan cheese, and pepper in a bowl.  Spread over bread cubes. Sprinkle 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese over the Neufchâtel cheese mixture.
Combine spaghetti sauce, water, and garlic in a bowl; add meatballs. Pour spaghetti sauce mixture over bread. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella cheese over casserole.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
A mixture of the classic Meatball sub and lasagna. Great for left-overs as well (if you have any). Using the pre-made meatballs cuts the time down.
