The Perfect Brownie Recipe

Ingredients:
1½ cups sugar
¾ cup flour
¾ cup Ghirardelli cocoa powder
3 eggs
¾ cup butter, melted
¾ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Combine the sugar, flour, cocoa, eggs and melted butter and mix. Do this by hand, until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the wet, and stop. You don’t need to beat it (Kneading flour produces gluten, the springy protein that makes bread chewy.)
Stir in the chocolate chips.
Line a 9×13 baking dish with parchment paper.  As long as you cover the bottom you should be good, as it will pull away from the edges while baking.
Pour the batter and spread it out. Don’t try to spread it like mayo on bread, or you’ll move the parchment around. Poke at it with the tip of a rubber spatula.
Bake at 325° for 20-30 minutes. It’s done when a toothpick inserted in the tallest part comes out clean. Keep in mind you’ve got chips in there. If you hit one with the toothpick it will have melted chocolate on it. You might need to poke a couple of spots to make sure you aren’t hitting a chip.
Very carefully lift the parchment out of the baking dish. Get a spare set of hands if you can.
Peel the edges and let cool for a few minutes before slicing.
Pour yourself a glass of milk, and enjoy!
