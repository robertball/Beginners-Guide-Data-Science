Description: 
This recipe of hand-mashed red potatoes with skins with a flavor mixture of bacon bits, cheese, and French onion rings could be served as a main dish if you are a potato-lover like me. This is the only way my family will allow me to serve potatoes in our house. The amounts I have suggested are only guidelines; you will adjust these over time to your taste.
