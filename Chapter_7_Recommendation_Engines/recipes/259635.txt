Ingredients:
1/2 hot dog
2 cups water
1 (3 ounce) package ramen noodles
6 cauliflower florets
1/4 cup chopped baby spinach

Directions:
Place hot dog half on a flat work surface. Cut a slit from the bottom to within 1 inch of the top. Turn the hot dog half 90 degrees to the uncut side and repeat. Cut each of 4 "legs" halfway down the middle to make 8 octopus "legs".
Bring a small pot of water to a boil; add hot dog octopus. Cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain.
Bring 2 cups water to a boil in the same pot. Add ramen noodles and cauliflower; cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in ramen seasoning until dissolved. Remove from heat; add spinach. Let stand until spinach wilts, about 3 minutes.
Assemble bento box with ramen noodle mixture and octopus hot dog.

Description: 
Getting ready to take a family vacation to the beach? Kickstart the kiddos' enthusiasm by serving them an ocean-themed lunch. It's a good way to sneak in some spinach (seaweed) to boot. Get creative with the rest of the bento by using baked fish crackers, grapes for sea pebbles, seaweed chips, all things ocean related cookie cutters including fish, turtle, shark, star for starfish, lobster, etc.  for other items to go in the box. Don't forget that special sweet treat. I used gummy octopus but Swedish fish and gummy worms would work well too.
