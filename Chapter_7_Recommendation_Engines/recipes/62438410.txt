Ingredients:
4 large eggs
2 cups durum semolina (pasta) flour
1 tablespoon olive oil
Sea salt

Directions:
In a food processor, add the eggs, flour, and olive oil. Mix until the sound changes to a rumble (the dough will look like course cornmeal, you do not want it to come together in a ball). Test the consistency of the dough by pinching it together. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour and pulse. If it's too dry, add a couple teaspoons of cold water.
Pour the dough mixture onto a floured surface and shape into a ball. Knead until smooth, then divide into four (4) equal parts. Let rest for 5 minutes.
Run through a pasta machine on the thickest setting about 4 to 5 times. Then, continue to run through the rollers once, moving the rollers closer together each time until the dough is about as thick as a CD (on a KitchenAid pasta roller, this would be the #5 setting).
You can now flour and cut the dough into strips by hand or with a pasta cutter. This pasta will only take 2-3 minutes to cook in boiling water.
