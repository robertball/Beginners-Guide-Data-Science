Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Olive Oil
1 cup chopped yellow onion
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped carrots
1.5  2 quart(s) low sodium chicken broth
1/8 tsp dried Rosemary
1/8 tsp dried Thyme
1/4 tsp dried Sage
1/4 tsp dried Parsley
1 Bay Leaf
1.5 quart low sodium chicken broth
1/4 tsp salt and pepper  more to taste
1 28 oz store-bought rotisserie chicken
1 packing of medium-sized egg noodles

Directions:
In a large stock pot or dutch oven on medium heat, add oil, onions and celery. Sauté until onions are translucent. Add chopped carrots and herbs sautéing a couple minutes more, careful not to over-brown the veggies. Add in chicken broth. Add salt and pepper to taste.
While simmering, pull the meat from the chicken and add to the soup. Let simmer, covered, while the noodles are cooking.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add egg noodles and boil for 7 to 8 minutes, or until al dente. Drain, and set aside for serving.
