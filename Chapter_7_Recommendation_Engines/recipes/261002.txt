Ingredients:
4 egg whites
1 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups almond flour, or more as needed
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form. Gradually add sugar, 1 teaspoon at a time, while continuing to beat at high speed. Combine ground almonds and cinnamon in a bowl and fold into the egg white mixture with a spatula. Add more ground almonds if mixture is too runny.
Use 2 teaspoons to place little mounds of almond mixture 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and baked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Carefully remove from baking sheets and cool on wire racks.

Description: 
These German almond cookies are dairy free and gluten free and are baked during Advent in preparation for Christmas. They are quick and easy to make with only 4 ingredients and taste delicious. Try one to make sure it is baked all the way through, as it can be hard to tell. In Germany they are baked on backoblaten, little round wafers (there are gluten-free ones), but you can bake them directly on parchment paper as well. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
