Ingredients:
1/2 cup semolina flour
2 tablespoons semolina flour
3 tablespoons sesame seeds, divided
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1 egg, separated
1 cup lukewarm milk
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1 teaspoon water

Directions:
Mix 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons semolina, 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, sugar, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk in oil, egg, and egg white. Stir in warm milk slowly until a liquid dough forms.
Cover the bowl with a plate or plastic wrap; let stand at room temperature until frothy, about 1 hour.
Stir in 2 3/4 cups flour with a wooden spoon until a sticky dough forms. Cover again and allow to rest for 30 minutes.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking mat.
Sprinkle 1 tablespoon flour over the dough and your hands. Mix dough, adding flour as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Shape into a round loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet. Cover loosely with a towel and let rise for 1 hour in a warm place until loaf doubles in volume.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Beat egg yolk and water in a bowl with a fork; brush over the entire surface of the loaf. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sesame seeds on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until loaf is golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.
