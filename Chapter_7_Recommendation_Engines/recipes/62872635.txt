Description: 
I LOVE the garlic sauce that comes on many dishes at a favorite restaurant in Seattle.  I've tried to master it at home and this is what came!  Goes great with steamed veggies, rice, meats, tofu ect. or as a dipping sauce for appitizers.  Make it vegetarian by substituting veggie broth or just plain water for the chicken stalk.  Enjoy!
