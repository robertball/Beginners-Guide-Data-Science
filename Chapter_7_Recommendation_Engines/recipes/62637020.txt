1 cup powdered sugar
3 tablespoons warm water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Description: 
This is really good! Very simple to make and very chocolatey, yet not too sweet. I ran out of vanilla and used almond extract instead which was delicious! I used it on the Moist One Bowl Dark Chocolate bundt Cake recipe I got from Kittencal. This is definitely a recipe I'll use again.
