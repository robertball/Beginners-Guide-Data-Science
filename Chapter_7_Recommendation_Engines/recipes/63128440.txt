Ingredients:
3 c. bread flour, + more for work surface
2 tsp. sugar
1/2 tsp. instant or rapid-rise yeast
1 1/3 c. ice water
1 Tbl. vegetable oil, + more for work surface
1 1/2 tsp. table salt
cornmeal for dusting peel

Directions:
TO MAKE DOUGH: in food processor, process flour, sugar, & yeast until combined, about 2 sec. Slowly add water through feed tube; process until dough is combined & no dry flour remains, about 10 sec. Let dough stand 10 min.
Add oil & salt to dough & process until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears sides of bowl, 30-60 sec. Remove dough from bowl & knead briefly on lightly oiled countertop until smooth, about 1 min.
Shape dough into tight ball & place in large, lightly oiled bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap & refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days.
TO BAKE PIZZA: One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to 2nd highest position (about 4-5 inches below broiler), set pizza stone on rack, & heat oven to 500 degrees.
Remove dough from refrigerator & divide in thirds. Shape each into smooth, tight ball. Place on lightly oiled baking sheet, spacing them at least 3 in. apart; cover loosely with plastic wrap coated with nonstick cooking spray; let stand for 1 hr.
Coat 1 ball of dough generously with flour & place on well-floured countertop. Using fingertips, gently flatten into 8-in. disk, leaving 1 in. of outer edge slightly thicker than center. Gently stretch disk into 10-in. round, working along edges & giving disk quarter turns. Transfer dough to peel dusted with cornmeal & stretch into 12-in. round.
Top dough with sauce, cheese & toppings.
Slide pizza onto stone & bake until crust is well browned & cheese is bubbly & beginning to brown, 12-14 min., rotating pizza halfway through. Remove pizza & place on wire rack for 5 min. before slicing and serving.
Repeat to shape, top, & bake additional pizzas.

Description: 
From America's Test Kitchen -- a simple-to-make pizza with a perfect crustâ€”thin, crisp, & spottily charred on the exterior; tender yet chewy within. High-protein bread flour gives a chewy, nicely tanned pizza crust. Knead the dough quickly in a food processor (it is important to use ice water in the dough), then let it proof in the refrigerator to develop flavor.  Placing pizza on a pre-heated stone near the top of the oven, allows the top of the pizza to brown as well as the bottom
