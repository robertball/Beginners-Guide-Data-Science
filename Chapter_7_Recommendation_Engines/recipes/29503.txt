Description: 
This is a recipe for shrimp with a seasoned bread stuffing. I love to serve this dish when I have guests for dinner because I can prepare the shrimp early in the day. I've always received rave reviews over this recipe and have shared it often. You may add diced lobster or scallops to the cracker mixture just before baking. Serve with drawn butter.
