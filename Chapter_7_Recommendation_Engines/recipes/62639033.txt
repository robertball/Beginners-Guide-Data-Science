Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup sliced onion
2 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
2 tablespoon garam masala
1 teaspoon curry powder
(can add chili powder if you like it spicier).
cayanne
salt
garlic powder
3/4 cup red wine
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar (can use balsamic)
1 1/2 cup chicken broth
(optional: Flour to thicken sauce)

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned lightly brown, about 7 minutes. Remove onion from skillet, and set aside.
Increase heat to medium-high. Season one side of the chicken thighs with half of the garam masala and curry powder, salt, pepper cayanne and garlic powder. Place the chicken seasoned-side down into the skillet, and season the other side with the other half of the dry seasonings. Continue cooking chicken until browned, about 4 minutes on each side. Pour in the red wine and red wine vinegar (or balsamic vinegar). Simmer for about 30 seconds, scraping up the browned bits from the pan. Stir in the prepared onion and chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer the chicken thighs until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes taking lid off pan half way through to thicken glaze.(can add a little flour to thicken sauce and pour over chicken served on rice, white, jasmine or basmati).
