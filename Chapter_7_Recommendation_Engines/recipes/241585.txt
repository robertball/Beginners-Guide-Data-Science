Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until underside is set and a golden crust forms.
Add the remaining butter and gently turn rosti; cook for an additional 5 minutes or until the rosti are golden brown and bubbles are actively forming in the centre of each disk. Drain on paper towel.
