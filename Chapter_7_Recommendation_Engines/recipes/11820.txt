Ingredients:
8 ounces ziti pasta
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style stewed tomatoes
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
4 ounces fresh spinach, washed and chopped
2 ounces cream cheese
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Bring a large pot filled with salted water to a boil.  Add ziti and cook until tender but still firm, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium sized non-reactive pan, combine tomatoes and hot pepper flakes. Warm over medium-low heat, breaking up tomatoes if necessary.
Drain pasta and return to hot pan.  Add spinach, cream cheese and nutmeg.  Cook, stirring, over low heat until spinach wilts, 1-2 minutes.  Pour tomato sauce over spinach ziti. Stir and toss gently to mix.
