Ingredients:
4 boneless pork chops, 1-inch thick
Lemon pepper seasoning
2 tablespoons butter
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 3/4 cups Swanson® Chicken Stock
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup dried cranberries or dried cherries

Directions:
Season the pork with the lemon pepper. Cook the pork in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat for 20 minutes or until it's well browned on both sides and cooked through. Remove the pork from the skillet and keep warm.
Heat 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet. Add the garlic and cook until it's tender. Stir the stock, vinegar and cranberries in the skillet and heat to a boil. Cook for 10 minutes or until the sauce is slightly thickened.
Stir in the remaining butter. Serve the pork with the sauce.
