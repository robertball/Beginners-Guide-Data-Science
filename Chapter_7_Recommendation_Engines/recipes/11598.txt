Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
8 ounces cream cheese, cold
1 cup margarine, chilled
1 tablespoon milk
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
2 cups apricot preserves
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Cut in the cream cheese and margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle on the milk and vinegar. Work the dough by hand until it holds together in a ball. Divide dough into 4 pieces and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (190 degrees C).
On a lightly floured surface, roll out each piece of dough into a rectangle measuring 7  1/2x10 inches.  Cut the dough into 2 1/2  inch squares. Place a 1/2 teaspoon dollop of apricot preserves onto the center of each square. Fold each corner to the center and pinch together.
Place cookies on an unprepared cookie sheet, and bake for about 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Drizzle with glaze when cool.
In a small bowl stir together 3/4 cup of confectioners' sugar with 2 tablespoons of water until smooth. Drizzle over the cookies.
