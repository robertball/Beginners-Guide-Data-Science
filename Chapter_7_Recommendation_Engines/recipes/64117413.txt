Ingredients:
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1/8 cup light brown sugar
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp baking powder
1 cup buttermilk
2 large eggs
3 1/2 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
Butter for griddle

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, whisk together granulated sugar and cocoa powder until well blended.  Then add brown sugar, flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder.  Whisk again until combined.  Make a well in the center of the bowl and put to the side.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, oil and vanilla.  Pour wet mixture into center well of dry ingredients and mix until just blended (do not overmix.....some lumps will remain).  Allow batter to rest while griddle is heating up.  Butter griddle and drop about 1/4 cup at a time onto hot griddle.  Cook until bubbles begin to appear on the surface.  Flip pancake and cook until done.  Serve warm with your favorite pancake syrup, whipped cream and berries of your choice.  **Best results when batter is made the night before and placed covered in the refrigerator. **

This is my spin on having chocolate for breakfast!  It's a cross between a pancake and a brownie.  I hope you like them as much as my family does.  Enjoy!! :)
