Ingredients:
1 whole chicken (about 2 kg)
2 tbsp soya sauce
1 lemon, squeezed
1/2 kg minced pork
1 box (42.5 g) raisins
1 medium tomato, diced
1 medium onion, diced
2 cloves garlic
2 large eggs
1 pc chorizo de bilbao, chopped fine
1 carrot, cut into julienne pieces
60g cheddar cheese, shredded
salt and pepper to taste
1 tbsp corn flour
250ml chicken broth

Directions:
Remove the breast bones of chicken. Rinse and pat dry with paper towel.
Pour soya sauce and lemon juice over the chicken, rubbing inside the cavity as well. Set aside.
Mix minced pork with remaining ingredients. Stuff chicken with this mixture. Sew opening to secure the mixture inside.
Bake at 180 degrees C for 60 minutes. Cover chicken with foil if it is getting brown too quickly. Cool slightly before serving. It will be easier to slice. Slice chicken crosswise when serving.
Prepare sauce with drippings. Add 1 tbsp corn flour. Add broth and boring to a boiil, stirring constantly until sauce thickens. Serve hot
