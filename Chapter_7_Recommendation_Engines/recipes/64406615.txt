Carrot Dogs Recipe

Ingredients:
4 carrots (cut into bun lengths)
1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar and a dash of salt)
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon water or canned/cooked bean liquid
2 tablespoons coconut aminos (can sub soy sauce but use unseasoned vinegar)
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (or 1/2 clove garlic minced)
a dash or two liquid smoke
pepper to taste
Ezekiel sprouted hot dog buns

Directions:
Fill a pot about half-way full of water, heat it on high until it boils. Turn down to medium heat and add the carrots. Cook until you can just pierce it through with a fork. You want it to still have a snap when you eat it. Run cold water over them to stop them from cooking more.
Combine the other ingredients to make the marinade. Use a container that has a tight lid so you can easily shake it without spraying it all over your kitchen. Marinate at least 3 to 4 hours, though they are fine for almost 2 days.
Put the carrots in the container and marinade for a few hours to up to a few days. If you marinate them longer they take on more of the vinegar flavor. If the carrots are very skinny I would not marinade them for more than 1 1/2 days so they don’t taste too sour.
To serve heat the carrots in a 350 degree oven or on a grill pan on a hot grill until heated through. It should take about 10 to 15 minutes.
Serve in a toasted hot dog bun with your favorite toppings. They’re great the southern way  topped with chili and cole slaw!
