Place bacon in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, and fry until browned, but not crisp. Drain on paper towels; crumble.
Stretch pizza dough out over a pizza stone, pan, or cookie sheet. Spread the shredded cheddar over the crust, sprinkle bacon evenly over the pizza then arrange the tomatoes over the bacon.
Bake pizza for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the crust is golden and cheese is melted in the center. While the pizza is in the oven, toss the shredded lettuce and onion with ranch. Top the finished pizza with the dressed lettuce, and serve immediately.
