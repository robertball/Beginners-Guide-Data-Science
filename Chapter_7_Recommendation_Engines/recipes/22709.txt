Ingredients:
1 pound angel hair pasta
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 bulbs shallots, minced
1 pound shiitake mushrooms, thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 cup white wine
4 (6 ounce) cans marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1/4 cup small capers

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over low heat; sweat garlic and shallots until they start to become aromatic.  Increase heat to medium and add mushrooms and thyme; saute until mushrooms begin to soften, about 3 minutes.  Deglaze pan with wine and simmer 2 minutes.  Stir in artichokes and capers and simmer 2 to 3 minutes more.
Pour mushroom mixture over pasta and serve.
