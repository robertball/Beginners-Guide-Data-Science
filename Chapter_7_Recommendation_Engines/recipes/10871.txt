Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 egg yolk
1 cup chopped pecans
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup toasted wheat germ
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup apple butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cream the butter with the yolk and vanilla.
Place the sugar and the pecans in a food processor and grind to a fine texture. Add the wheat germ, flour, and the salt and process again just to mix. Add the pecan mixture to the butter mixture.
Roll this dough into balls a little more than 1 inch in diameter. Place on ungreased sheets about 2 inches apart. Using your thumb, make a dent in the top of each ball.
Bake until a little brown , 15-20 minutes.  When they come from the oven, use a spoon or another tool to open the dent you made ( it tends to close during baking). Let rest on the sheet for about 4 minutes and then remove to a rack. Cool completely. Spoon the apple butter into the indents and serve.

Great with homemade apple butter, but store-bought is extremely good too!
