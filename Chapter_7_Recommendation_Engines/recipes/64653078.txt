Ingredients:
3 cups of rolled oats
3 cups of all-purpose flour
1/2 cup of brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 cups of shortening
1/2 cup of cold water

Directions:
Mix together the   rolled oats, flour, brown sugar, salt and baking powder.
Add in the shortening and water, mix till it forms into a ball.
Roll out to 1/4 inch thick using rolled oats on board to prevent sticking.
Cut into circles or squares. I use a water glass .
Bake at 375 degrees for 15 min.
It seems like this will never come together, but it does just takes a few minute.
