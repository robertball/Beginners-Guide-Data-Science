Ingredients:
2 ounces light rum
½ ounce hibiscus syrup
½ ounce freshly-squeezed lime juice
3 dashes Angostura® aromatic bitters
4-6 ounces ginger beer

Directions:
Inside a highball glass, add rum, hibiscus syrup, lime juice and bitters. Add ice to bring liquid volume up halfway. Stir to combine.
Top with ginger beer.
Add your choice of garnish, such as a lime twist or a fresh hibiscus flower. Serve with a straw.
Cook's note: See my recipe for hibiscus syrup.

Description: 
Bucks refer to drinks that combine lime and ginger beer, so a dark & stormy with lime is an example of a buck. In this version, I introduced aromatic bitters and homemade hibiscus syrup for extra flavor and a blush of color.
