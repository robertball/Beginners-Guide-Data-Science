Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground round
6 cups water
1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added stewed tomatoes, undrained and chopped
1 (4.4 ounce) package minestrone soup mix
1/2 cup uncooked ditalini (very short tubular macaroni)
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained and squeezed dry

Directions:
Cook ground round in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until the meat is browned, stirring to crumble. Drain well, and return meat to pan. Stir in water, stewed tomatoes, and soup mix, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in ditalini and chopped spinach, and simmer for 7 minutes or until the pasta is tender.
