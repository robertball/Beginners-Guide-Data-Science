Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups broccoli florets
2 1/2 cups cauliflowerets
1 small onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, minced
6 tablespoons butter, divided
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a large saucepan, bring 1 in. of water, broccoli and cauliflower to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5-10 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain and set aside.
In a large saucepan, saute onion and garlic in 2 tablespoons butter until tender. Stir in flour until blended; gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat. Stir in the Parmesan cheese, broccoli and cauliflower; set aside.
Melt remaining butter. Place one sheet of puff pastry on a piece of waxed paper; brush with butter. Spoon half of the vegetable mixture along one long side of pastry. Sprinkle with mozzarella and cheddar cheeses. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting from the long side topped with the vegetables; pinch seams and ends to seal. Brush top with melted butter. Carefully place seam side down on an ungreased baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and vegetable mixture.
Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 5 minutes. Slice with a serrated knife.
