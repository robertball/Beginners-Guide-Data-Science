Ingredients:
1 pound tripe - honeycomb - beef or veal if you can get it.
5 cups water
1/2 tablespoon white wine vinegar
3 dry bay leaves
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup onion - chopped finely
2 cloves garlic - minced
3-4 large plum tomatoes - either canned or fresh
1 can green peas
4 leaves basil - fresh
1 sprig parsley - fresh and chopped
1/2 teaspoon oregano flakes - dry
1 teaspoon butter
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the 5 cups of water to a boil, adding the white wine vinegar and the bay leaves. Add the tripe and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. after this time the meat should be tender. Remove from the pan, and let cool until you can slice it diagonally.
In a frying pan, heat the olive oil and gently cook the onion, then add the garlic. Cook until soft, but not brown. Add the sliced tripe, cooking for 2 minutes, stirring all the while. Pour off the oil, and add the white wine. Simmer for one minute.
Add the remaining ingredients, and cook for five minutes. Serve at once, whole hot.
This is a great dish to serve with a great loaf of artisan Italian bread.
