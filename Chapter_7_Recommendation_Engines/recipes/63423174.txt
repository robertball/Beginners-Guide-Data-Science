Ingredients:
6 cans of whole or cut green beans
1 lb. thick or thin sliced bacon
3 pk-ages of Sazon'Goya (found in Spanish markets or local grocery store in spanish goods aisle)
1 tsp of GOYA Adobo all purpose seasoning
1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper

Directions:
First cover your rack in conventional oven or regular oven with aluminum foil,lay bacon in strips across foil,(DO NOT PRE-HEAT OVEN).After strips are layered across foil turn oven to 400 degrees and bake till lightly crisp.About 15 - 18 mins. While bacon is baking drain the liquid from green beans into deep sauce pan,while leaving green beans in original can,bring liquid to a slight boil and add Sazon'Goya,Goya Adobo,and cayenne pepper and stir till dissolved.Once Spices are dissolved then add green beans.Once bacon is done baking add the remaining grease from bacon into deep sauce pan with the green beans.Finely cut up bacon with kitchen scissors into green beans and mix in lightly.Cook the green beans down where there isn't much juice,use your judgement,I do.
