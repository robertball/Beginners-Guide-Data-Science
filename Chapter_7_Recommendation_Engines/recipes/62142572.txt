Directions:
Grease 9 X 13 pan.  Heat oven to 350.  Cream butter, egg and sugar. Add vanilla and sour cream and mix well. Stir in dry ingredients.  This makes a dough.
Spread 1/2 dough in pan.  Dough will be sticky.  Pat with floured fingers.  Mix filling ingredients together and spoon over dough.  Drop remaining dough over filling by spoonfuls; it will spread while baking.  Mix first 3 topping ingredients: sprinkle over cake.  Sprinkle pecans over topping.  Bake for 45 minutes.
