Ingredients:
•	1 large zucchni grated, excess water removed (Note: To do this, after you grate the zucchini, put the grated zucchini into paper towels and squeeze to release the water)
•	1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
•	1 cup panko bread crumbs
•	sprinkle of ground nutmeg, about 1/8 teaspoon (Note: If you add too much it can quickly take over the taste, less is more)
•	1/4 teaspoon paprika
•	1 clove garlic, minced
•	1 egg
•	salt and pepper to taste
•	1-2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
1.	Combine all ingredients, except olive oil, in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Using a heaping tablespoon form the mixture into 8 patties.
2.	Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Once heated, add patties and cook until golden brown. About 3-4 minutes per side. Serve.
These are great when served with a dollop of ranch dressing. Enjoy!
