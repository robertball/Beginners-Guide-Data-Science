1 tbs chile powder
2 tbs brown sugar
1/2 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 tablespoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
4 lbs pork ribs
1 cup barbeque sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 270 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Mix chile powder, brown sugar, black pepper, cumin, dry mustard, in a small bowl until combined.
Place ribs meat-side down on aluminum foil. Prick back of rib rack several times with a knife. Trim excess fat.
Generously apply coating of dry rub to all sides of rib rack.
With rib rack meat-side down, fold foil TIGHTLY around it to create a tight seal. Transfer to sheet pan.
Bake in preheated oven until tender and cooked through, about 2 hours. Remove and cool 15 minutes.
Open foil, drain and discard any accumulated juices and fat. Brush barbeque sauce on all sides of rack.
Place rack meat-side up and return to oven, leaving foil open. Set more foil loosely on top. Set oven to Broil. Bake for 15 minutes.
Cut rack into individual rib segments and serve with more barbeque sauce.
