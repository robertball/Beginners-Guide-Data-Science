Ingredients:
1 - 15oz can garbanzo beans (chickpeas)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1-1/2 teaspoon guajillo spice mix (recipe in box)
3/4 tablespoon cayenne pepper (may use less if desired)
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
juice of 1/2 lime

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Drain and rinse garbanzo beans.  Place them in a bowl, drizzle olive oil over them, toss to coat them.  Add spices and lime juice, toss again to get mixture evenly throughout.
Put the chickpeas onto a baking sheet and into the oven for about 40 minutes. About halfway through, give them a shake. At the end of the 40 minutes, taste and If they are still soft, put them back in the oven. They should have just a little bit of a soft center. When they cool, they will crisp up more.
