Ingredients:
3 cups leftover roast pork cut into strips
16 ozs. mushrooms; sliced
1 tsp. dried thyme
4 Tbsp. unsalted butter
1 sm. onion; chopped
1 cup white wine
1 cup chicken stock or broth
2 Tbsp. tomato paste
1 cup sour cream
1 tsp salt
8 oz. egg noodles
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Put a pot of water on high and when it boils, add egg noodles and cook per package instructions.
Meanwhile, add mushrooms to a large, dry, non-stick skillet and sprinkle with salt.
Cook over medium-high heat and cook until mushrooms begin to brown and give up their liquid (about 6 minutes). Turn mushrooms, sprinkle with thyme, and add 1 tablespoon butter. Cook until browned - about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms onto a plate.
Reduce heat to medium. Add remaining butter, onions and tomato paste and cook until translucent, stirring frequently - about 5 minutes.
Return mushrooms to skillet and add wine. Increase heat to medium high and cook until wine is reduced by half - 5 minutes. Add broth and cook five minutes more.
Reduce heat to low, add meat, and simmer 5 minutes more.
Remove from heat, stir in sour cream, taste and adjust seasonings. Serve over noodles.
