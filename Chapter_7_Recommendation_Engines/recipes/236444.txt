Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 pound ground pork
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1/2 (2 pound) package frozen diced southern-style hash brown potatoes
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1/4 cup minced onion
1 teaspoon soy sauce, or to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups hot cooked rice

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pork, garlic, and cumin until pork is browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork mixture, including oil, to a pot.
Mix potatoes, tomatoes, and onion into pork mixture; cook and stir over medium heat until potatoes are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Add enough soy sauce to color and season pork and potato mixture.
Stir parsley, oregano, and cilantro into pork and potato mixture; season with salt and pepper. Serve over cooked rice.

Description: 
A Peruvian meal that my Japanese mother loved. This is her quick, altered version of the meal. Unfortunately she never measured the ingredients, so I always have to guess and taste-test this at every step. You can substitute ground turkey for pork if desired. I usually end up adding more cumin, garlic, and soy sauce right before serving.
