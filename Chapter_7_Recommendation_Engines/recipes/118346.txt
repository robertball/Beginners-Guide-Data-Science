Description: 
I'm what you'd call a 'ballabusta' in the Jewish culture--a woman who is a good homemaker. I make this traditional dish along with other Jewish specialties for an annual Hanukkah/Christmas part with our friends.                              -Lauren Kargen                               Williamsville, New York
