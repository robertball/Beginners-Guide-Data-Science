Ingredients:
5 tbsp unsalted butter, sliced, plus more for greasing pan
4 cups (6-8) peeled nectarines
1 pint raspberries
2/3 cup granulated sugar, divided
2 tbsp cornstarch
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
3/4 tsp salt, divided
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup fine cornmeal
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
6 tbsp low fat buttermilk
1 tbsp raw sugar

Directions:
Heat oven to 375F. Butter a 9"-square baking pan.
In a bowl, toss nectarines, raspberries with 1/3 cup granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and 1/4 tsp salt and combine; add to pan.
In another bowl, whisk remaining 1/3 cup granulated sugar, flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, and remaining 1/2 tsp salt.
In a food processor pulse sugar-flour mixture 10 secs; add sliced butter; pulse until dough pieces are the size of peas, 1 min.  Add buttermilk; pulse a few more times until just combined. Use a 1/3-cup measure to portion the dough into 10 round biscuits; place on top of fruit. Lightly press biscuits with fingers to flatten tops; sprinkle cobbler with raw sugar.
Bake until juices bubble thickly and biscuits are golden brown, about 50 mins. Serve warm or at room temp.
