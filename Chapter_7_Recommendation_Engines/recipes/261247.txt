Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar, or to taste
3/4 cup buttermilk
3 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided
1 (15 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
2 cups grated carrots
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with cupcake liners.
Mix sugar, buttermilk, eggs, oil, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Stir in pineapple, carrots, and coconut.
Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture gently into the carrot mixture. Fill lined muffin cups about 3/4-full of batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool, at least 25 minutes.
Blend confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, butter, and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Frost the cooled cupcakes.
