Ingredients:
1 ½ c all-purpose flour
1 c granulated sugar
1 ½ t baking powder
¼ t salt
½ c butter, softened
1 c milk
2 eggs
1 t vanilla
1 box of Quaker Instant Oatmeal  Dinosaur Eggs
4 packages (any flavour you desire) Pop Rocks (for topping)
1 can French Vanilla frosting
Cupcake liners

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a large bowl or stand mixer, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Mix on low speed with an electric hand mixer or in your stand mixer, mix in butter, milk, eggs and vanilla; beat until smooth, approximately 2 minutes. Open the packets of Quaker Instant Oatmeal with Dinosaur Eggs and remove the eggs. You can do this with as many packages as you want from the box, probably half the packets will suffice. Throw them in the bowl for the last few seconds of mixing.
Spoon into 12 paper-lined muffin cups, filling about three-quarters full. Bake in centre of preheated oven for approximatetly 18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out cleanly. Remove from oven and let the cupcakes cool completely.
When the cupcakes have cooled, frost with the French vanilla frosting (using a piping bag if you want to be fancy). When the cupcakes are frosted and ready to serve, top with Pop Rocks to give your Dinomites a little Dinobite! Do not put the Pop Rocks on unless you are ready to serve, as they will become soggy and stop popping if in the frosting for too long!
