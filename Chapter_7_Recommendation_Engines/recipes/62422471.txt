1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter flavored shortening
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups apple, peeled and chopped (I use Braeburns)
Topping:
2 Tbsp butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Cream brown sugar and shortening thoroughly.
Add beaten egg.
Sift together dry ingredients and add to creamed mixture.  Blend well.
Blend in apples.
Pour into a stoneware pan (I use the Pampered Chef, round, deep-dish baker.)
Topping:
Blend brown sugar and butter.  Mixture will be lumpy.
Add nuts and cinnamon.
Sprinkle on top of batter.
Bake at 350F for 30-35 minutes.
