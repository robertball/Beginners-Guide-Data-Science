Ingredients:
Banana Filling:
2 cups milk
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant banana pudding mix
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Vanilla Frosting:
1 cup milk
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 (8 ounce) container whipped topping
Cupcakes:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup mashed ripe bananas
2/3 cup plain yogurt

Directions:
Combine milk, banana pudding mix, and vanilla extract in a bowl and mix until smooth. Refrigerate banana filling at least 30 minutes before using.
Combine milk, vanilla pudding mix, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Whisk in confectioners' sugar. Fold in whipped topping until no streaks remain. Refrigerate frosting for at least 30 minutes before using.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
While filling and frosting are chilling, prepare the cupcake batter. Whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl and set aside.
Cream white sugar, brown sugar, and butter together in the bowl of a stand mixer until light and creamy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract. Alternate adding flour mixture, mashed bananas, and yogurt. Mix on low speed until just moistened; batter may be lumpy, but do not overmix. Fill 24 muffin cups 3/4 full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 17 to 20 minutes. Place on a rack to cool completely, at least 30 minutes.
Use a paring knife to cut a small circle out of the top of each cooled cupcake. Fill with banana filling. Top each cupcake with vanilla frosting.
