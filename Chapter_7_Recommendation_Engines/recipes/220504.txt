Description: 
Another old family recipe, handed down mother to daughter. I assume it is Irish, because it was from that side of the family, and it also makes a LOT! Fortunately, it is excellent reheated (and better the next day, too!) My mother always made this with leftover holiday ham, which makes it even more economical. Can be baked in the oven (very slow!) or cooked on the stovetop (my preferred choice).
