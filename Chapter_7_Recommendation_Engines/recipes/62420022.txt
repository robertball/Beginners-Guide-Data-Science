Ingredients:
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided

Directions:
Spray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray, and place over medium-low heat.
Place about 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese at a time into the skillet.
Cook until the cheese melts into a thin circle, begins to bubble, and browns at the edges, about 1 minute.
Flip the crisp, and brown the other side for about 30 seconds.
Remove the crisp to a plate to cool.
Make 3 more cheese crisps the same way.
