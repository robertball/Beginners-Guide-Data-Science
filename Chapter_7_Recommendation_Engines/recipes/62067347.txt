Ingredients:
3 eggs
4 strips of bacon
2 tbs. chopped red onion
1 1/2 tbs. hot sauce
dash of cayenne pepper
dash of garlic salt
dash of ground black pepper
1/4 c. blue cheese dressing
1/4 c. plain lowfat yogurt
1 tbs. butter

Directions:
In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crisp. Drain; crumble, and set aside.
Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl. Add the onion, hot sauce, cayenne pepper, garlic salt, black pepper, and mix well.
In a clean skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the bacon to the skillet, making sure the crumbled pieces are distributed evenly. Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Cover.
In a small saucepan, combine the blue cheese dressing and the yogurt. Mix well over low heat; do not bring to a boil.
After about 5 minutes, check to see if the omelette is set. Carefully flip the omelette and cook for another couple of minutes. Fold the omelette in half and place on a plate.
Spoon the blue cheese sauce mixture over the omelette and serve.

Description: 
This omelette was created using only what I had on hand in the fridge.  As I've discovered, most of the best breakfast creations are accidentally discovered this way. The flavours mingle nicely, and is perfect for those blue cheese lovers who are in the mood for a truly savoury breakfast.
