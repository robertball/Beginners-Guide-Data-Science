Ingredients:
1 46 oz. can tomato juice
½ can of Campbell’s Consommé Soup
1 T. black pepper
1 T. Celery salt
1 T. Tabasco sauce
1 T. Lemon Juice
3 T. Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Mix all ingredients well.  Chill and mix with desired about of Vodka and ice.  I've used a Pampered Chef mix and store pitcher for home use and a clean/santitized 1/2 gallon milk jug for traveling to the lake, etc.  One batch fits well in either container.

Description: 
My father-in-law first introduced me to this homemade bloody mary mix.  It is very similar to what you'd buy in a store.  Made as is, it is very spicy.  You can customize it to your taste by cutting back on the pepper and tabasco.  I like about 1/2 the pepper and tabasco.  Enjoy this wonderful mix!  It is so easy and much cheaper than buying pre-made mix.
