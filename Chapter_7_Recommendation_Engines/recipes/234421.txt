Ingredients:
8 whole graham crackers, crushed
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2 (1.5 ounce) bars milk chocolate candy bars (such as Hershey'sÂ®)
12 large marshmallows, cut in half crosswise
1 dash red food coloring, or as needed
24 semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir graham cracker crumbs, butter, and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl; mix until evenly moistened and press into an ungreased mini-muffin pan to form shallow cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are bubbling, about 5 minutes.
Break each chocolate bar into 12 equal pieces; place one piece into each graham cracker cup.
Paint red circles and lines to resemble blood-shot eyes on top of each marshmallow using red food coloring. Place painted marshmallows, painted-sides up, into graham cracker cups. Press 1 chocolate chip into the center of each marshmallow.
Bake in the preheated oven until marshmallows are slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Cool in pan for 15 minutes before removing.
