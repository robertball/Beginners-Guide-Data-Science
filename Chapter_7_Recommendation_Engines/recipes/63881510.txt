Ingredients:
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
4 carrots, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 pinch black pepper
3 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth for vegan soup)
4 (15 ounce) cans black beans
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed or diced tomatoes
Tortilla chips or french bread (optional)
Shredded cheddar cheese (optional)
Sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion, celery, carrots and garlic for 10 minutes. Season with chili powder, cumin, and black pepper; cook for 1 minute. Stir in vegetable broth, 2 cans of beans (undrained), and corn (undrained). Bring to a boil.
Meanwhile, drain two cans of beans, but save liquid in case soup is too thick later.  In a food processor or blender, process remaining 2 cans beans (drained) and tomatoes (undrained) until smooth. Stir into boiling soup mixture, reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 25 minutes.  If soup is too thick, add liquid that was drained off of beans earlier.  Add salt, pepper, and chili powder to taste.
Serve with tortilla chips or bread, sour cream, and cheese.
