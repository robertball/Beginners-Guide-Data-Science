Description: 
For the longest time, my mum would make this amazing broccoli casserole. It is more like a crustless quiche, but has converted many broccoli haters into broccoli lovers! 
I have not ever tweaked this recipe - not even to add minced garlic, sauteed onion, pimento, etc; it's too simple and delicious on its own to need tweaking. This can be made ahead and refrigerated before cooking. It freezes well and can be thawed prior to cooking.
