Ingredients:
1 pound ground sausage
2 cups chopped celery
2 large onions, chopped
2 small packages of pre-seasoned cornbread stuffing - about 5 cups
5 cups seasoned bread crumbs (Italian style is perfect!)
1 quart chicken broth
1 teaspoon rosemary, dried or fresh

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place sausage, celery and onions in a large, deep stock pot. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain.
Add to pot: cornbread, bread crumbs, chicken broth, and rosemary.  Mix well and transfer to a 9x12 inch baking dish. (It will be very full so take your time!)
Bake, covered, for 45 minutes or until well set. Remove cover and bake another 10 minutes to dry the top a bit.

Description: 
You must try this. The recipe is very easy with minimal ingredients. The flavors go together beautifully; it's like a rainbow of flavor in your mouth! Ground sausage is cooked with celery and onions, then baked with cornbread stuffing, bread crumbs and chicken broth. I even made this as a meal for my boys and they gobbled it right down. My pickiest eater said he loved it! There will likely be leftovers because this stuffing is very very filling. I hope you get as much joy out of this recipe as I have!Modified from: Cornbread Stuffing With Sausage
