Description: 
Creamy, spicy beef and tomatoes over pasta. I invented this meal one day when there was nothing in the house to eat, and it became an instant family favorite. It goes well with any kind of pasta, but it is best with fettuccine. Not the healthiest dish ever, but maaaan it's good! (Despite the title, it's not really supposed to taste like Skyline Chili. It's just a similar type of dish).
