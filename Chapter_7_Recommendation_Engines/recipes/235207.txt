Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
3/4 cup water
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix beef, water, ranch dressing mix, and onion soup mix together in a bowl; shape into 8 patties.
Cook the burgers until they are very firm, hot, and grey in the center, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
