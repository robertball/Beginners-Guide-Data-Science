Crock-Pot Real Pumpkin Butter Recipe

Ingredients:
7 quarts of Pumpkin Puree
(See step 1) Note: The yield is usually about 2
or 3 cups of puree per 6 inch diameter pie
pumpkin! That cooks down to about half that
volume in making pumpkin butter. So for 6
quarts of pumpkin butter, you'd need 5 or 6
small pie pumpkins!  Similarly for 6 pints,
you'd need 3 pie pumpkins.
2 TB Ground Cinnamon
1 tsp Ground Cloves
1/2 tsp Allspice
**I add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp Ground Ginger (your choice)**
6 cups sugar
[Sugar is added in two stages: first 4 cups,
then 2 cups added later.]
Too thick?
If the pumpkin butter cooks down too much or is too thick for your liking, just add a little bit of apple juice and blend it in.
Not thick enough?
Just let it cook some more, with the lid off so the steam can escape!

Directions:
Step 1 - Make unsweetened pumpkin puree!
That's right, pumpkin butter starts with cooked pumpkin!  You can use store bought pumpkin puree, but the pumpkin butter won't taste nearly as good.  So if you haven't made some pumpkin puree yet start here with how to make pumpkin puree.  Otherwise continue to step 2.
Step 2 - Fill the crock pot
Fill the crock pot to within 2 inches full with pumpkin puree, mine takes about 5 quarts.
Step 3 -Add the spices
Add:
2 TB of ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground cloves
1/2 tsp of allspice
**1/4 to 1/2 tsp ginger (optional)**
4 cups sugar
Step 4 - Cook the Pumpkin butter
Set the crock pot on low or medium heat.
Cover it loosely or use a large pot splatter-guard. It will spatter as it boils slowly, so I also cover nearby surfaces with towels.  You don't want to seal it tightly because you want the steam to escape so it can reduce in volume and thicken.
Leave it to cook for 6 - 8 hours.   How long depends on the size and power of your crockpot, and how thick you like it, If you want to stir it occasionally, that's fine but not necessary.  I let mine go overnight.
It will reduce in volume by about half overnight. As it cooks down (the next morning), add the remaining pumpkin puree (about 2 or 3 quarts) and 2 more cups of sugar. Then let it cook a couple of hours more to mix the flavors.
Puree with a drink blender (hand-held stick blender).
Add to sterilized canning jars with sterilized lids (follow canning jar directions).
Cool labled and dated jars to near room temperature for a couple hours, then put in the fridge or you can freeze them too if you wish.
