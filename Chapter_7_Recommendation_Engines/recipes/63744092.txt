Ingredients:
1 tsp. cornstarch
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 tbsp. each, cornstarch and soy sauce
1 pound of chicken breast, cut into bite size pieces
4 tbsp. peanut oil, divided
1 stalk celery, thinly sliced
1 large carrot, thinly sliced
1/4 pound of fresh green beans, or about 2 cans
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tbsp. water
1/2 cup roasted cashews

Directions:
Mix one tablespoon cornstarch with chicken broth and set aside.
Combine 1 tbsp. cornstarch with 1 tbsp. soy sauce and mix with the chicken. Coat chicken well. Set aside.
Place all cut up veggies in a bowl. Set aside.
Heat wok over high heat. When hot, add about 2 tbsp. peanut oil. When the oil is hot, add the chicken, working in batches, if necessary. Stir fry chicken until opaque. Remove chicken to a bowl and set aside.
Add the other 2 tbsp. oil to the wok. When hot, add the veggies and stir fry about 1-2 minutes. Add water and cover wok. Cook about 3 minutes, or until the veggies are crisp tender.
Return the chicken to the pan. Stir in the chicken broth and cornstarch mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until thick and bubbly. Add the cashews and serve with rice.

Description: 
This is my Mom's recipe from a circa 1970's cookbook. It is a childhood favorite. I usually add just a little bit of ginger. Feel free to add some sesame oil, pea pods, etc. to taste.
