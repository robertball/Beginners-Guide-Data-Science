Place the roast in a slow cooker.  Place chile peppers, salt, garlic & cumin in a small blender and puree. Pour the chipotle sauce and 1/2 cup water over the cut up roast.
Cover, and cook 7 hours on Low.

Description: 
This is an amazing shredded pork recipe similar to what you would eat in a rice bowl (or in an enchilada) at a Mexican restaurant. It is easy to prepare and simmers in a slow cooker all day, ready to enjoy when you arrive home. I serve it over rice (laced with lime juice and fresh cilantro), Cheddar cheese, salsa, guacamole, and a dollop of sour cream. Amazing!Modified from: Mexican Style Shredded Pork
