Ingredients:
Oreo® Crust:
40 creme-filled chocolate sandwich cookie thins (such as Oreo® Thins)
4 tablespoons salted butter, melted
French Silk Pie Filling:
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/2 cups caster (superfine) sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon instant coffee granules
4 eggs, chilled
Whipped Cream:
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons chocolate shavings, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Grind chocolate sandwich cookies into fine crumbs in a food processor. Transfer to a bowl and mix in melted butter until combined. Press into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate. Chill crust while you make the pie filling.
Melt chocolate in a small heatproof bowl in the microwave. Start with 1 minute, stir, and then return for 15 to 30 second increments until melted. Let fully cool to room temperature, at least 20 minutes.
Whip butter and sugar together in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until smooth, about 3 minutes. Stir in vanilla extract and instant coffee. Add the cooled chocolate and mix until combined.
Add eggs one at a time, whisking on medium speed for 5 minutes and scraping down the bowl after each addition. The pie filling should be fluffy and silky like chocolate mousse.
Transfer filling into the pie crust, cover, and chill for at least 6 hours, or overnight.
Beat heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla on medium speed with a handheld mixer until soft peaks form.
Top the French silk pie with the whipped cream and garnish with chocolate shavings.

Description: 
Famous for being both feather-light and indulgently rich at the same time, French silk pie entered the American dessert canon upon winning the Pillsbury bake-off in 1951. It's one of the only dessert recipes that calls for eggs straight from the fridge; you'll whip them with melted chocolate for quite a while before chilling the pie--but rejoice, there's no baking whatsoever!
