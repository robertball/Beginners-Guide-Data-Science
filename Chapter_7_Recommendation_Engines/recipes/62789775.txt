Add your favorite chopped vegetables - I used cucumber, green onion, carrots, celery, bell pepper, and broccoli.
Top with the Bay seasoning.
Before serving, mix the French dressing, Miracle Whip, and Parmesan cheese.

If salad is too dry, add additional Miracle Whip.
You may also add additional Bay seasoning to taste.
