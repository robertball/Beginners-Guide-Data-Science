Description: 
I was trying to do a simple, wild mushroom-studded sweet corn casserole to reinforce our holiday side dish repertoire, and before I knew it, I was eating the best, most flavorful cornbread dressing I'd ever tasted. Not only that, but we completely eliminated the step of having to make cornbread first!
