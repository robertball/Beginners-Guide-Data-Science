Ingredients:
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/3 cups bread crumbs
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups milk
12 ounces chicken tenderloins
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
In a large plastic bag, combine the flour, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, poultry seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Shake to mix.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat until a drop of water evaporates immediately. Dip one piece of chicken at a time into the milk, and then place in the bag with the coating. Shake until fully coated. Place in the frying pan, and continue with remaining chicken.
Cook until the edges are browned, then flip and cook until browned on the other side. If some chicken is done sooner, keep on a paper towel lined plate in a warm oven, so that the chicken is all still warm at serving time.
