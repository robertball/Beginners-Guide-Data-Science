Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed
1-1/4 pounds delicata or other winter squash, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch rings
1/2 pound carrots, split lengthwise and cut into 2-inch pieces
1 pound fingerling potatoes, split lengthwise
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
salt and black pepper to taste
1/2 cup margarine, divided
1 stalk celery, leaves removed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C).
Place all the vegetables in a roasting pan and toss with the olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Spread into a single layer and place a V-rack on top. Season the chicken generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Place 1 tablespoon of the butter in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining butter between the skin and flesh of the chicken over the breast meat. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.
Bake uncovered 30 minutes. Turn the heat down to 375Â°F and bake 30 minutes longer , or  to a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove the chicken  from oven, and return the vegetables to the oven for 10 to 15 minutes more. Cover the chicken with aluminum foil, and allow to rest about 15 minutes before serving.
