Ingredients:
1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, chopped
1 (15 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1 (7.5 ounce) jar quartered artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (6 ounce) package shredded Parmesan cheese, divided
4 large portobello mushroom caps, stems and gills removed
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken, Alfredo sauce, spinach, artichoke hearts, red pepper flakes, and 4 ounces of Parmesan cheese in a large bowl. Stir to combine.
Lightly rub the outside of each portobello with olive oil using your hands; season with salt and pepper.
Divide the chicken filling among the mushroom caps and top with remaining Parmesan cheese. Place mushroom caps on the grill pan of the Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven.
Press "Auto Cook". Select Poultry with Vegetables setting and press "Start". Turn the dial to select 2 pounds and press "Start" again. Cook until chicken is no longer pink and mushrooms are tender, about 23 minutes.
