Ingredients:
4 slices Italian bread, 1/2 inch thick
1/2 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1 large tomato, sliced
1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend

Directions:
Preheat your oven's broiler.
Arrange the slices of bread in a single layer on a baking sheet. Mix together the olive oil and garlic powder in a cup or small bowl. Brush onto the slices of bread. Cover each piece of bread with tomato slices, then sprinkle with as much cheese as you like. Drizzle just a bit of the olive oil over the cheese.
Broil for 3 to 5 minutes, until cheese is melted and bread is toasted. Make sure you keep an eye on it - it doesn't take long!
