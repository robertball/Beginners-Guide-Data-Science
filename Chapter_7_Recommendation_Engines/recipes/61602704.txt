Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 slices Jarlsberg cheese
4 slices cooked ham
1/4 cup whole wheat bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Coat a 7x11 inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
Pound chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness.
Sprinkle each piece of chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.  Place 1 cheese slice and 1 ham slice on top of each breast. Roll up each breast, and secure with a toothpick.  Place in baking dish, and sprinkle chicken evenly with bread crumbs.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink. Remove from oven, and place 1/2 cheese slice on top of each breast.  Return to oven for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese has melted. Remove toothpicks, and serve immediately.
