Ingredients:
1 lb yellow squash, sliced
1 lb zucchini, sliced
1/2 medium onion, diced
1 cup cheddar cheese, shredded
1/2 cup butter or margarine, divided
1/2 cup Bisquick powder
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt
2 eggs
10-15 saltine crackers, crushed
1/4 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Boil vegetables together until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain.  In a large bowl, combine the vegetables with remaining ingredients except for the crackers and breadcrumbs.  Mix with a large spoon by hand until butter has melted and Bisquick is no longer visible.  Crush saltine crackers and gradually mix in the bowl until mixture is no longer moist.  You may not need all 15 crackers.  Pour into 1 1/2 quart casserole dish and lightly top with breadcrumbs.
Bake for 30 minutes and enjoy!
