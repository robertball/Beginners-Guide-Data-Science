Remove plastic wrap and cover egg with slice of cheese

Description: 
I make this on mornings when my boyfriend has minutes to make it out the door. It's a great alternative to the typical egg sandwiches you can get at fast food restaurants, and much healthier too! The possibilities with this simple sandwich are endless!
