Description: 
WE LIKE corn bread with our chili, and this makes just enough for two people. I received the recipe from a quilting friend at church and have shared it with many others.    Another way that my husband and I like eating corn bread is straight out of the oven, buttered and topped with syrup. -Edna Bjork, Norwalk, Iowa
