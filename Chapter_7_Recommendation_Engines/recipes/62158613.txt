Boil pasta according to package directions, drain and rinse with cold water.
In a medium bowl mix the 2 packages of seasoning mix (that came with the pasta salad), the sour cream, the mayonnaise, parmesan cheese and the seafood seasoning.
Place drained and rinsed pasta salad into a large bowl, and add to it the carrots, tomatoes, green onion, and shrimp.

Description: 
I adapted this recipe from a friend of mine who gave me the recipe.  It is a boxed pasta salad mix, combined with other ingredients to make a great pasta salad for that summer barbecue.  Shrimp, parmesan cheese, and tomatoes are just a few of the ingredients. This recipe can easily be halved.
