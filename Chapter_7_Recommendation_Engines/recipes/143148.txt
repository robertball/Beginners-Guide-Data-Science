Ingredients:
1 cup red lentils
1 3/4 cups water
2 (14.4 ounce) cans chopped canned tomatoes
2 onions, chopped
1 cube vegetable bouillon
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Rinse lentils under cold running water and drain. Place the water and lentils in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until lentils just begin to soften,  about 20 minutes. Stir the tomatoes and onions into  the lentils; bring to a gentle simmer. Crumble the bouillon cube into the lentil mixture and stir until it's dissolved. Simmer for about 5 minutes more, stirring frequently. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
This delicious bolognese is extremely quick and easy to make. Serve over pasta, rice, couscous, or any other carbohydrate food you fancy. This sauce gets better the longer it simmers. If you do allow it to simmer for a longer time, check regularly and add water as needed. This sauce also lends itself beautifully to adding vegetables such as zucchini, eggplant, carrots, and mushrooms.
