Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
-Yakisoba-
1 serving spaghetti (adjust according to how hungry you are)
Chopped vegetables to taste (I recommend onions, cabbage, carrots, and asparagus, but feel free to substitute your favorites)
2 strips bacon, chopped into bite-sized bits
-Sauce-
1 T barbecue sauce or ketchup
1 T Worcestershire sauce
1 T soy sauce
1/2 T honey or corn syrup
1/2 tsp brandy (can be omitted, if you like the taste without)

Directions:
Whisk together sauce ingredients and set aside.
Boil spaghetti until fully cooked (al dente doesn't work well with this). Drain and set aside.
Saute bacon and vegetables together, until both are fully cooked.
Add spaghetti to fried mixture and toss.
Pour sauce over everything and toss to burn off alcohol.
Enjoy! Can be topped with a raw egg yolk and shredded seaweed if desired.

Description: 
Late night snacks are my specialty! Unfortunately, that means that the stores are all closed when I get hungry. So after several sleepless nights of searching for a yakisoba recipe I could throw together on the spur of the moment, I finally gave up and made up my own. If you have bulldog sauce, feel free to use that, but if you don't, mine is pretty close!
