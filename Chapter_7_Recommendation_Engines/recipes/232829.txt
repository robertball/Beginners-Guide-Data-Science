Ingredients:
1 cup rice flour
salt to taste
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
cooking spray

Directions:
Mix rice flour and salt together in a bowl; form a well in the center of the mixture. Stir in egg, vegetable oil, and enough water to make a smooth batter.
Spray a non-stick frying pan with cooking spray and place over medium heat; pour about 1/4 cup batter into the hot pan. Tilt pan until batter covers the whole bottom surface making a thin pancake; cook for 1 minute. Flip and cook about 1 more minute. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
I got this recipe from my sister. And the first time I made it I was amazed. I served it with beef curry we couldn't get enough. It was simply super. Take care not too put the heat high and burn the pancakes.
