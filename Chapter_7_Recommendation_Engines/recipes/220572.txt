Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4  bone-in chicken thighs
1  onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
2 cups orange juice (no pulp)
¼ cup brandy-based orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier(<sup>&reg;</sup>)) (optional)
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook chicken thighs in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Remove chicken thighs and set aside.
Cook and stir onion in the same skillet until softened, about 5 minutes.
Stir in garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir in tomatoes, orange juice, orange liqueur, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes until thoroughly combined.
Return chicken thighs to the skillet, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken is tender and no longer pink inside, 25 to 30 minutes.
