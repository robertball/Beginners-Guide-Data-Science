Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 zucchini, sliced
2 yellow squash, sliced
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
3 tablespoons minced garlic
1/4 cup chopped green onions (optional)
2 teaspoons seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup shredded habanero-flavored cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook zucchini and squash until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp and garlic; cook until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 2 minutes per side. Add green onions and seafood seasoning and stir to combine. Remove from heat.
Scoop half of zucchini-squash mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish using a slotted spoon. Add shrimp and skillet drippings. Sprinkle 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 cup habanero pepper cheese on top. Add the remaining zucchini and squash mixture and top with remaining cheeses.
Bake in the preheated oven until gooey and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
