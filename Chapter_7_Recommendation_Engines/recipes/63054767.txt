Ingredients:
1 cup cold water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
3/4 cup Betty Crocker Potato Buds (probably any brand will work)
fresh chives
freshly ground black pepper
cayenne to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
In a bowl wisk together water, salt & egg until combined. Add the instant mashed potatoes and throughly mix. Add the remaining spices & mix until combined.
Add butter & oil into a nonstick pan heated to a medium/high heat. Divide mixture into quarters. With wet hands, form into rough patties and add to pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook until a well developed crust forms. Approximately 10 minutes. Flip over and flatten out some more to maximize the crispy exterior and minimize the mash potato center. Cook for approximately 7-8 minutes more. Top with sour cream & more fresh chives.

Description: 
One advantage this version has over the freshly mashed ones are that the others contain milk and butter, which makes it much harder to hold together when fried.
