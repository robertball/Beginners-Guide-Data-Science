Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup water
2 eggs
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped toasted almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray the inside of a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
Mix flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Add pumpkin puree, vegetable oil, water, and eggs; beat until well incorporated and smooth. Gently stir in chocolate chips and almonds. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean, 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling.
