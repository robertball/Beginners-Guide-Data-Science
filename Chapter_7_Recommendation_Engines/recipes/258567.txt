Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can HORMEL® Mary Kitchen® Corned Beef Hash
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
Salt to taste (optional)
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
4 eggs, beaten
10 (6 inch) soft flour tortillas
1/4 cup pico de gallo salsa, or to taste
1/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend, or more to taste
1/4 cup sour cream, or to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
1 lime, cut into wedges (optional)

Directions:
Mix corned beef hash, black beans, garlic powder, chili powder, salt, and pepper in a saucepan.  Cook on medium-high heat for about 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until bubbly and meat starts to brown. Transfer to a warm dish.
Heat oil in skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Pour in eggs. Cook and stir, lifting up edges of eggs to let uncooked egg reach skillet surface. Remove from heat when eggs are still slightly glossy or to desired doneness, about 4 minutes.
Distribute the corned beef hash mixture onto the flour tortillas. Top with scrambled eggs, salsa, cheese, sour cream, and cilantro.
Garnish with lime wedges, if desired.
