https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 cups fresh peaches, any variety peeled and sliced
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 T Bisquick, any variety (Heart Smart, GF, etc.)
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
2/3 cup Bisquick (any)
2 T brown sugar (light or dark)
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 T milk (Whole, nonfat, your choice)

Directions:
1.  Prepare a 1 quart baking dish (such as Pyrex) by lightly spraying it with non-stick spray. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2.  Peel and slice peaches, cutting the slices as evenly sized as you can to ensure they bake at the same rate.
3.  Toss the raw peaches with 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1T Bisquick, 1/2 t cinnamon. Pour into the prepared baking dish and level off.
4.  For the topping:  Mix 2/3 cup Bisquick, 2 T lightly packed brown sugar. Cut in 1/2 cup unsalted butter and 2 T milk. It should not be pourable; you want to be able to drop by spoonfuls on top.
5.  Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 30 mins.  Let stand 5-10 mins. before serving.
Cook's note: I have made this using a combination of yellow and white peaches, peaches and blueberries, nectarines, etc. All good, ANY Bisquick works and ANY milk works. You can also use frozen and defrosted fruit. Just check the sweetness level and adjust accordingly. Prep time is based upon peeling peaches with a serrated peeler. If you use the dunk in boiling water/ice bath method, add a few minutes.
