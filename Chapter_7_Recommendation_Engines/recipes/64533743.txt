Ingredients:
4 oz or 2/3 cup brewed black coffee (I used Starbucks mocha flavored but any medium roast works)
2/3 cup almond milk
1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
2 packets stevia or sweetener of choice
1/8 tsp peppermint extract (found in the store next to vanilla extract)

Directions:
Brew coffee, I used leftover coffee that I stored overnight in the fridge & warmed in the microwave
In a small pot, combine milk, cocoa, stevia and peppermint extract
Bring to medium heat and allow to heat until cocoa powder dissolves and liquid becomes bubbly
Transfer mixture to a blender or food processor
Blend 2-3 minutes until mixture becomes frothy and foamy
Pour coffee into a coffee mug and add hot milk mixture over it
Add additional toppings
