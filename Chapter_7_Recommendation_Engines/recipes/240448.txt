Ingredients:
non-stick cooking spray
1 cup white sugar
1 banana, mashed
1/2 cup fat-free plain yogurt
2 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup chickpea (garbanzo bean) flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup water
1 cup cooked and mashed sweet potatoes
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate morsels (optional)
1/4 cup chia seeds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a loaf pan with cooking spray.
Beat sugar, banana, and yogurt together in a large bowl until smooth. Beat 1 egg into the banana mixture until smooth before adding the second egg and beating again until smooth.
Mix all-purpose flour, chickpea flour, baking soda, ground cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl; add to the banana mixture with the water and beat until smooth and batter-like. Stir mashed sweet potatoes into the batter until smooth. Fold chocolate and chia seeds through the batter; pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
I wanted a healthier version of my favorite banana bread, so I came up with this. I added the chocolate to appeal to my kids, and boy did they love it! The garbanzo flour packs a bit of extra protein. Slice and enjoy warm!
