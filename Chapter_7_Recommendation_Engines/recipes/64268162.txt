Description: 
I came up with this recipe when I wanted a ginger cookie and didn't have any molasses. This has a delicate flavor, not as strong as your typical ginger cookie or gingerbread, but the vanilla chips give it a great creamy richness that complements the spice.  It makes an excellent Christmas cookie, and 1 cup of walnuts can be added for another layer of flavor.
