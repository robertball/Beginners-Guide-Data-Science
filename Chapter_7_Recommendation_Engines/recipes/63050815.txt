Ingredients:
1 6 ounce box of Jello (any flavor - I usually grab Cherry because it is red)  This is the bigger of the 2 sizes of Jell-O
3 cups cranberries (usually a bag)
2 cups sugar
2 cups water
2 cups crushed pineapple
2 cups pears, diced
1 to 2 cups pecans

Directions:
Clean stems and rotten berries out of the lot and then boil them in the sugar and water.  When the berries are tender, i.e. they are splitting open and are soft when pinched between your fingers, pour over the jell-o in a pan.
Stir until the jell-o is dissolved and evenly mixed.  Let cool in the fridge until jello is set.
Add pineapple, pears, and pecans, stir and serve!  Best served cool and stores well in Tupperware.
