Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 egg
1/2 cup margarine
1 (29 ounce) can pumpkin puree
3 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2/3 cup evaporated milk
1/4 cup margarine
1 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.
Reserve 1 cup of cake mix from the package.  In a bowl, combine remaining cake mix, 1 egg and melted margarine.  Press mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9x13 inch pan to form a crust.
Mix together the pumpkin, 3 eggs, sugar, cinnamon and evaporated milk until blended.  Pour over the crust.  Combine the brown sugar and reserved 1 cup cake mix, then cut in the margarine until mixture is crumbly.  Sprinkle over the filling.
Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes. Keep refrigerated.

Description: 
I've never been good at making pies but love to have pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving.  This cake is just as good and twice as easy to make.
