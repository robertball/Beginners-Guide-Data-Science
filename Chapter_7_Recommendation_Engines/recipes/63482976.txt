Ingredients:
bolognese sauce:
sausage or seasoned ground pork
green beans
salt
tomato sauce

Directions:
Bolognese sauce (with sausage or seasoned ground pork) -- this can easily be made in a big batch, cooked for several hours, and then frozen in smaller portions -- and then serving it over cooked green beans.
fresh stemmed halved green beans in boiling well salted water for 5 min. until just tender and drain.  The beans should still have a bit of firmness, but not squeak.  Since you are topping with the bolognese sauce there is no need to add butter or seasoning.
