Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup finely chopped apple cubes (peel the apples first)
1 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 cup brown rice flour
1 cup cornstarch *
1 cup pitted dates
1 cup pecans, roughly chopped
1/2 cup plant-based milk (I used almond milk)
1/2 cup raisins
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp salt
juice from 1 small lemon, optional

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius/395 degrees Fahrenheit. In a food processor, add the applesauce, dates, milk and lemon juice, and blend until you have a smooth mixture.
2. Mix the flour, starch, baking powder, cinnamon and salt together in a large bowl before stirring in the mixture from the previous step. Finally gently fold in the chopped pecans, raisins and chopped apple. Pour the batter in a loaf pan lined with parchment and place in the oven.
3. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean and the top is slightly golden. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool completely before slicing.
Serve slathered in applesauce and almond butter.
