Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 (6 ounce) container crumbled feta cheese
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 24-cup mini muffin tin with cooking spray.
Mix together turkey, drained spinach, feta cheese, paprika, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well combined. Roll into 24 meatballs and place in the prepared muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
These spinach, feta, and turkey meatballs are quick and easy to make, easy to freeze, and taste great when reheated. My son and I call these Combine Nuggets. Did you know that a combine is a giant tractor that harvests crops from the field? Well, I most certainly didn't until my 3-year-old told me! Therefore, thanks to the hardworking combines we can put the green things in our nuggets.
