Ingredients:
1 pkg fresh mushrooms
2 Tbsp butter

Dot with butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Wrap (bring 2 long sides together above food and fold down in a series of locked folds to allow for heat circulation and expansion).  Fold short ends of foil up and over again.  Crimp closed to seal foil packet.
