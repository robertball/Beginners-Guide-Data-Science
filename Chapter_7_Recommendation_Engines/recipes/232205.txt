1 cup water
3/4 cup whole wheat couscous
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups halved grape tomatoes

1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1/2 cup chopped fresh mint
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; stir in couscous and salt. Remove from heat, cover saucepan, and let stand until water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Transfer couscous to a bowl and fluff with a fork.
Mix tomatoes, cucumber, onion, parsley, mint, lemon juice, olive oil, and black pepper into couscous. Serve immediately or refrigerate for 1 hour for flavors to blend.
