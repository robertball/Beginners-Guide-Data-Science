Ingredients:
12 ounces sea scallops, rinsed and sliced in half horizontally
3/4 cup spiced coconut vinegar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 tablespoon coarsely chopped garlic (optional)
2 medium Roma tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1 Thai chile pepper, seeded and minced
1 1/2 teaspoons calamansi juice
1/4 cup bias-sliced green parts of green onions
1 pinch lemon zest
fleur de sel to taste

Directions:
Mix scallops with spiced coconut vinegar in a large bowl. Cover and chill 15 minutes or to desired firmness. Drain immediately, reserving vinegar, and arrange on small plates or in quartered coconut shells.
Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until golden brown and lightly crispy, 3 to 5 minutes.
Mix tomatoes, red onion, ginger, Thai chile, and calamansi with reserved vinegar. Top scallops with tomato mixture and sprinkle with green onions and fried garlic. Finish with a sprinkle of lemon zest and fleur de sel.

Description: 
An acidic marinade is all that is needed to cook this spicy and sour scallop ceviche. You can also serve the scallops on toasted sesame crackers. As with all ceviches, the acidic marinade cooks the seafood without heat-and it happens pretty quickly. So it's good to make this at the last minute and set it out just before people dig in.
