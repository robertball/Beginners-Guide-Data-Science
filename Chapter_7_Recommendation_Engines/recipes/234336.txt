Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) jar apricot preserves
1 (10 fluid ounce) bottle <sup>&reg;</sup>ussian-style salad dressing (such as Wishbone(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
8  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Whisk apricot preserves, Russian-style salad dressing, and dry onion soup mix together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken breasts, coat with the marinade, squeeze to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 1 hour to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Dump chicken and marinade into a 12x9-inch baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven, basting regularly, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 45 minutes to 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
