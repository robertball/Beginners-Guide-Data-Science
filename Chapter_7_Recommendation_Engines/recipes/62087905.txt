Description: 
Perfect when you want a great tasting meal after a hard days work, and all in one pan. I have come home from work time and time again after having taken chicken out of the freezer and sticking it in the oven to make plain old baked chicken. Then I remembered a recipe my mom used to make that not only filled the house with a smell like she spent her day prepairing dinner but tasted great too. The italian sausage flavors the chicken and vegetables so well you will find yourself going back for more and more.
