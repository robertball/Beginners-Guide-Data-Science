Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound ground chicken
½ cup panko bread crumbs
1 small egg, beaten
1 tablespoon Buffalo wing sauce
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (6 ounce) container block feta cheese, cut into 20 cubes and extra cheese reserved
2 tablespoons Buffalo wing sauce
2 tablespoons ranch dressing
2 tablespoons shredded carrot
2 tablespoons finely minced celery

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with cooking spray.
Combine chicken, bread crumbs, egg, Buffalo sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper in a medium bowl.
Spray hands with cooking spray to prevent sticking. Form a small portion of chicken mixture into a 1 1/2-inch ball around a cube of feta cheese and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken mixture and feta cubes.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 18 to 20 minutes, turning over halfway through.
Transfer cooked meatballs to a serving platter. Drizzle meatballs with Buffalo sauce and ranch dressing; sprinkle carrot, celery, and reserved feta cheese on top.
