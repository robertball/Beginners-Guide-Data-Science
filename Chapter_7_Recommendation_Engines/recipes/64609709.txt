Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk
3/4 Tbsp  chia seeds
2 Tbsp peanut butter (creamy or crunchy)
1 Tbsp  maple syrup (brown sugar, or stevia to taste)
1/2 cup  rolled oats
TOPPINGS (Optional)
Sliced banana, strawberries or raspberries
Flaxseed meal or additional chia seed
Granola

Directions:
To a mason jar or small bowl add milk, chia seeds, peanut butter, and maple syrup (or other sweetener) and stir with a spoon to combine. The peanut butter doesn't need to be completely mixed with the milk (doing so leaves swirls of peanut butter to enjoy the next day).
Add oats and stir a few more times, then press down with a spoon to ensure all oats have been moistened and are immersed in milk.
Cover securely with a lid or plastic wrap and set in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 6 hours).
The next day, open and enjoy as is, or garnish with desired toppings.
Overnight oats will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, though best within the first 12-24 hours.

Description: 
This version is as simple as it gets: 5 ingredients, 5 minutes prep time, no fancy methods, and simple ingredients. Milk, maple syrup and peanut butter make a creamy, flavorful base to soak the oats. Chia seeds add nutrition, a little crunch, and help them thicken.
