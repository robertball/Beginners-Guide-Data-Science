Ingredients:
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1/2 (5.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding (such as Jell-OÂ®), divided
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 banana, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Beat heavy whipping cream in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer until it begins to thicken. Add chocolate pudding and vanilla extract; continue beating until thick enough to hold shape and begins to gather on the beaters. Fold banana into the mousse.

Description: 
A quick, easy chocolate mousse that will please everyone. Great for potlucks and layered deserts! I recommend chilling for about half an hour to firm and give a nice chill, but this can be eaten right after making. Feel free to adjust the amount of chocolate you use. This is a great recipe if you need a chocolate layer for deserts.
