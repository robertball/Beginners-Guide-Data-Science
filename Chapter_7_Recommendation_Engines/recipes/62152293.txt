Ingredients:
1 oz Kahula or any coffee flavoured liquor
1/2 oz Brown creme de cacao
1/2 oz Amaretto
3 oz Cream
3 oz Milk
1 to 2 oz whipped cream

Directions:
Pour all ingredients into a blender and whip on high for 1 to 2 minutes. Add ice if you wish to make more of a slushie.
Can add whipped cream on top of drink if you wish, instead of whipped in the blender.
Adjust amounts to your taste. Enjoy!

Description: 
Sinfully smooth drink. Best if sipped slowly, as the milk and cream can fill you up fast.
