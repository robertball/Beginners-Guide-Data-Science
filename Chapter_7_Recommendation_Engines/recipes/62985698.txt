Ingredients:
1 egg, beaten
2 teaspoons vinegar
2 Tablespoon cold water
3 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups shortening

Directions:
Beat together the egg, vinegar and water and chill briefly.
Measure the flour and salt into your food processor bowl and pulse.
Add chunks of shortening all at once & pulse a few times to make a pea sized meal
Do not overwork the dough.
Pour chilled liquid ingredients into dry ingredients.
Pulse until the dough comes together and starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl. Do not overwork the dough.
Divide the dough in half. Put each half in a quart or gallon sized ziplock bag and roll out with a rolling pin to fill out the bag.
Seal the bag and store in the refrigerator or freezer until ready for use.
Pull the crust out of the refrigerator (do not try to roll frozen dough. It will break) just make sure it is chilled.
Cut the bag open to remove the crust and roll on a lightly floured surface to fit a nine inch pie pan.

Description: 
This is a simple and perfectly flaky pie crust that I acquired from a cook booklet many years ago.. The lady who submitted this won a $2000.00 prize at her midwest state fair for this amazing crust. You can do this with a fork or a pastry cutter, but I simplified it for the food processor.
