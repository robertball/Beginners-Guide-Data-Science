1 (4 ounce) package blue cheese crumbles
1 cup sliced celery
1 medium red bell pepper, sliced
1 medium yellow bell pepper, sliced
6 tablespoons cider vinegar
1/4 cup chopped onion
4 teaspoons brown sugar
4 teaspoons spicy brown mustard

1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
In a large salad bowl, combine the first seven ingredients; cover and refrigerate. In a blender or food processor, combine the vinegar, onion, brown sugar, mustard, salt and pepper; cover and process until smooth. With blender running, add oil in a steady stream; blend until thickened. Drizzle over salad; toss gently. Serve immediately.

Description: 
It's a cinch to mix this zesty salad together for a potluck. 'It'll feed a crowd and then some,' attests Karin Graw from Hudson, Wisconsin. 'For a lighter version, I use less oil and a sugar substitute for the dressing and toss in turkey bacon. Either way, it tastes great.'
