1 package of dry onion soup mix

(butter to grease baking dish)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease baking dish. Pour in 1 cup rice, 1 cup of milk, cream of mushroom soup, and onion mix. (for those of you who dont like onions, I sift the onion mix to discard the onion flakes). Mix incredients in dish until well blended. Place chicken over mixture, set aside. In seperate pan, make stove top stuffing, according to box directions. Lay stuffing over chicken breasts. Bake for 45 min to hour.
