Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), thinly sliced
2 tablespoons honey
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (10 ounce) package flour tortillas
cooking spray
6 ounces Brie cheese, cut into 1/4-inch slices
2 ripe d'Anjou pears, sliced 1/4-inch thick

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion until soft and translucent, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in honey, thyme, salt, and pepper; continue to cook until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Add pears and cook until just softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and grease with nonstick cooking spray. Place 1 tortilla in the skillet and top with 1/4 of the Brie. Add 1/4 of the onion-pear mixture and cover with a second tortilla. Weigh down quesadilla with a smaller skillet or plate and cook until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate.
Repeat with remaining tortillas, Brie cheese, and onion-pear mixture. Slice quesadillas into wedges, or wrap in foil to take along for a picnic.
