Description: 
'My husband, Randy, and I love barbecue ribs, but with our conflicting schedules, we rarely have time to fire up the grill,' says Kandy Bingham, Green River, Wyoming. 'So we let the slow cooker do the work for us. By the time we get home from work, the ribs are tender, juicy and ready to devour.'
