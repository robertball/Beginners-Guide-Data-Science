Ingredients:
One or two heads of cabbage, shredded 1/4" or 1/2"
salt
pepper
garlic
2 or more cloves of garlic, crushed- optional
1/4 c. water- optional

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.
Quarter cabbage and core.  Slice each quarter to 1/2" or 1/4" wedges.  Spread it out 1/2 of the cabbage on your large roasting pan. (I use a full size steam table tray)  Lightly season with salt, pepper and garlic to taste (this is because we are seasoning it in two batches). Sprinkle olive oil over cabbage, no need to mix. Then add remaining cabbage, and repeat adding seasoning and oil. No need to watch out for that flying cabbage, or Pick up spilled cabbage and return it to pan.
Roast cabbage in middle rack of oven.  Stir after 20-minutes, and if necessary add 1/4 cup of water.  Continue roasting until done  but watch that it doesn't burn. We like it when it just wilted because it's crunchier and better when reheated in micowave.
