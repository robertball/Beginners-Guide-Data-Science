Ingredients:
1 lb. lean hamburger
1/2 onion minced
bit of minced celery
salt, pepper, celery salt
1 package won ton wrappers (round or square, doesn't matter)

Directions:
Take a little bit of hamburger (maybe a teaspoon?) and put it in the center of the wonton.  Dip your finger in a bit of lukewarm water and run it along the outside edges of the wonton wrapper to moisten.  Fold over and press to seal.  Fry in hot oil until brown.  Serve with soy sauce at the table for dipping.
