Chicken Fajita Egg Rolls Recipe

Ingredients:
Canola oil, for frying
2 eggs
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 red onion, minced
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 pounds chicken breast, thinly sliced
16 ounces pepper jack cheese, shredded
Egg roll skins (at least 16, most packs come in 20)
Cayenne pepper, to taste (optional)
Jalapeno peppers, to taste (optional)
Mushrooms, finely chopped (optional)

Directions:
1.  Preheat oil to 350 degrees Farenheit. Mix egg and milk together for the egg wash.
2.  In a medium saut√© pan over medium heat add olive oil, onion, peppers, along with optional peppers and mushrooms.  Sweat vegetables until slightly softened.  Add chicken and cook until chicken is no longer pink.  Add cheese and mix thoroughly, until cheese begins to melt.  Remove from heat, strain in a fine mesh sieve or through cheesecloth to remove excess moisture, and let cool.
3.  Place equal amounts of filling mixture in center of egg roll skins.  Fold in side corners and roll, sealing edges with egg wash.  Submerge egg rolls in oil and fry, making sure the rolls do not touch the sides or the bottom of the pan.  Fry in batches, to avoid over-crowding, until golden brown (if using a turkey fryer they will start to float to the top).  Remove egg rolls to paper towels (I recommend standing them on end to drain out any oil that made it inside).

Description: 
Tex-Mex chicken fajita ingredients put into an egg roll.  If you have access to a turkey fryer, I recommend using it to cook these in order to cut down on number of batches and speed up the cooking process.
