Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill weed
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 pound small red potatoes, washed and quartered
3 medium ears corn, husked and cut into 1-inch rounds
1/2 pound baby carrots
1 large red onion, cut into wedges
1/2 pound fresh sugar snap peas

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. In a large bowl, combine the oil, dill, salt, and pepper.
Add the remaining ingredients except the sugar snap peas; toss to coat well, then pour into a 9" x 13" baking dish.
Roast, uncovered, for 20 minutes; gently stir in the sugar snap peas, then roast for 25 to 30 more minutes, or until the vegetables are lightly browned and almost tender, turning once. Serve immediately.
