Description: 
In Barbados okras are plentiful!  My family eats them almost weekly and this is our favorite way of cooking them!  One of the greatest things about this dish is that the okras are not slimy or mushy, and the lime gives it a great kick!  I often serve this dish with a curry... but it is a great side dish for most meals!!!
