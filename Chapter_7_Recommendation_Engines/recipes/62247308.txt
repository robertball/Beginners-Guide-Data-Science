Ingredients:
3 medium tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1 small onion, chopped
2 avocados, chopped
2 garlic cloves, diced

Juice from 1 lime
8 corn tortillas
2 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 cup cooked white rice
1 (15 oz) can of black beans, drained and rinsed
2 Tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped
Tabasco green pepper sauce (optional)

Directions:
In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the tomatoes, onion, avocado, garlic and cilantro. Toss with lime juice.
Heat oil over medium heat in a sautee pan.  Place tortillas, two at a time, in the pan.  Don't overlap the tortillas in the pan.  Allow them to cook for a minute, and then flip them.  Allow them to cook for another minute so they get crunchy.  Repeat with remaining tortillas.
Spoon 2 Tbsp of both the cooked rice amd black beans onto each tortilla.  Spread the tomato mixture on top and garnish with remaining cilantro and green pepper sauce.
