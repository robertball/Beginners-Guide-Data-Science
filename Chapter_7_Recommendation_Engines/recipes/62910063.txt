Ingredients:
2 cans chicken
1-2 quarts water
4-6 T Better Than Bouillon Organic Chicken (BTB)
5 carrots
3 stalks celery
1 med onion
pepper to taste
16 oz. wide egg noodles

Directions:
Depending on serving size needed, and richness of broth preferred, put desired amt. of water and BTB together in a nice sized soup pot.  Thinly slice the onion, and slice the carrots and celery about 1/4 in. thick.  If you have plenty of time, and like the feeling of filling the house with homey smells for a while, throw in the veggies and simmer them until al dente tender.  If you're in a hurry, saute them quickly until mostly tender in a bit of butter, then throw them in the pot.  Add the canned chicken, and check the water level - if it seems like you need more water (imagine your noodles soaking up some), then add more - otherwise bring the pot to a boil and throw in your noodles.  Cook until the noodles are tender (about 8-10 min. - see noodle package directions) and then, add pepper til it tastes good and you're done.  Nice, hot, steaming and EASY chicken noodle soup!  Yay!
