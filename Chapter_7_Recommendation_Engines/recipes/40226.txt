Ingredients:
1 cup water, divided
4 stalks McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Lemon Grass
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (about 1 lime)
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Szechwan Seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 cups hot cooked rice

Directions:
Microwave 1/2 cup water in a glass bowl at HIGH 1 minute. Cut lemon grass into 1-inch pieces; add to water, cover and let stand 5 minutes.
Process lemon grass mixture, lime juice, sugar, Szechwan seasoning and salt in a food processor or blender 30 seconds or until blended.
Place chicken in a shallow dish or self-closing plastic bag; add lemon grass mixture.  Cover and let stand 15 minutes.
Remove chicken from marinade, reserving marinade.  Cook chicken in hot oil in a large skillet over medium heat 7-9 minutes on each side or until done.  (Be careful not to over-brown chicken).  Remove from skillet; set aside.
Add reserved marinade to skillet and cook, stirring constantly, 3 minutes.  Mix remaining 1/2 cup water and cornstarch; stir into marinade and cook, stirring constantly, 2 minutes or until slightly thickened.  Pour glaze through a fine wire-mesh strainer into a bowl, discarding solids.  Serve chicken over rice; pour glaze over chicken.
