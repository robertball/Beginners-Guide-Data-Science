Ingredients:
1 tablespoon sesame oil, or as needed
2 (5 ounce) cans salmon, drained and flaked
2 eggs
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup green bell pepper, diced
1/4 cup green onions, diced
2 teaspoons finely minced fresh ginger
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder

Directions:
Heat sesame oil in skillet over medium heat until it bubbles around the tip of a spoon when dipped in.
Mix salmon, eggs, panko, bell pepper, green onions, ginger, soy sauce, sesame seeds, and five-spice powder together in a bowl. Form mixture into patties and set, evenly spaced, into the hot oil in the skillet.
Brown patties, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and brown on the other side, 4 to 5 minutes more. Remove patties from pan and drain on a paper-towel lined plate to drain excess oil.

Description: 
This is such an easy recipe that I can throw together super fast at the end of a long, hard day. It packs a punch of flavor with very little effort. My kids love this and request it often. Sometimes, I even make a few extra to go in their lunch boxes the next day.
