Butter the bottom of a glass baking dish that is large enough to hold the salmon comfortably. Place fish in the baking dish, skin side down if there is skin on your fish.
Combine the mustard, honey and vinegar in a small bowl; whisk to combine.
Pour the honey mustard mixture over the salmon  and bake in the oven for 15 minutes or until the fish flakes easily.
