Ingredients:
5 slices turkey bacon, chopped
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
1/2 purple sweet pepper, chopped
1/2 white sweet pepper, chopped
1/2 red and yellow striped bell pepper (such as EnjoyaÂ®), chopped
2 pounds ground turkey
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1 (16 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup quinoa
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Place turkey bacon in a large pot and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels.
Heat oil in the same pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and sweet peppers; cook until they just start to turn brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Add ground turkey and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in cooked bacon, crushed tomatoes, pinto beans, black beans, tomato paste, chicken broth, quinoa, chili powder, cumin, and cayenne.
Reduce heat to low and let simmer, adding water if it becomes too dry, 1 to 4 hours.
