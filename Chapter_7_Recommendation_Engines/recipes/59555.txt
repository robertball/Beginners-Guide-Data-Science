Description: 
Alternating slices of sweet and white potatoes baked in cream, butter,  and a touch of cinnamon are a wonderful taste surprise.  This dish was served by friends after my aunt's funeral.  I've made it for several special occasions and it never fails to be a hit.  It is rich, but oh so delicious.
