Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds veal cutlets
1 egg
2 tablespoons milk
1 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
vegetable oil for frying, or as needed - divided
2 red bell peppers, sliced
1 onion, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 cup water
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Pound veal cutlets a few times with a meat mallet to tenderize, if desired. Beat egg with milk in a shallow bowl. Stir bread crumbs, parsley, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a separate bowl until well combined.
Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or enough to cover the bottom of a skillet, over medium heat. Dip each cutlet in egg mixture and then in crumb mixture to coat. Fry the cutlets in the hot oil until browned, about 3 minutes on each side. Drain cutlets on paper towels.
Heat 2 more tablespoons vegetable oil in the same skillet; cook and stir red bell peppers and onion in the hot oil until soft, about 8 minutes. Pour stewed tomatoes into vegetables and stir in water and sugar, dissolving sugar into the sauce. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
Reduce heat to low. Place veal cutlets into the sauce, cover, and simmer until veal is very tender, about 30 more minutes.

Description: 
This recipe has been in the family for generations. The meat is so tender and with the red pepper sauce, is so flavorful you'll want to make it at least once a week! I love serving this with a spring mix salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. Instead of scallopini, you can use veal cutlets and sometimes beef cutlets. The beef cutlets would take another 10 minutes longer cooking with the sauce.
