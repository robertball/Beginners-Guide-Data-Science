Ingredients:
1/2 pound sliced bacon
1/4 cup butter
1/8 cup balsamic vinegar
2 pounds Brussels sprouts, cored and shredded
1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt
pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until crisp. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons grease, crumble and set aside.
In the same skillet, melt butter in with reserved bacon grease over medium heat. Add balsamic vinegar, and cook, stirring until browned. Add Brussels sprouts to the pan, and season with seasoning salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat until sprouts are wilted and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in crumbled bacon just before serving.

Description: 
Not too often do you hear 'fantastic' and 'Brussels sprouts' in the same sentence but this recipe is deserving of that. When I mentioned I was bringing Brussels sprouts to a holiday get together, my mom told me not to bother.  After eating this dish, my family now requests I bring it to every get together!Modified from: Shredded Brussels Sprouts
