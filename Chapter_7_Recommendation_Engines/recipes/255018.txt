Ingredients:
5 cups chicken broth
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup chopped white onion
2 cups Arborio (short grain) rice
1/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk
1 (15 ounce) can Bruce's® Yams Cut Sweet Potatoes in Syrup, drained, syrup reserved
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons minced parsley
1/2 teaspoon sea salt, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
2 tablespoons butter (optional)
1 lime, zested

Directions:
Bring chicken stock to a simmer in a saucepan and keep warm.
Place oil in a separate (large) saucepan. Add onion and saute for 2 minutes until fragrant.
Pour in rice and stir so that all grains of rice are coated. Add broth (1 cup at a time) and stir until liquid has been absorbed. After all broth has been absorbed, stir in coconut milk.
Drain the Bruce's(R) Yams Cut Sweet Potatoes, reserving 1/4 cup syrup. Add syrup to rice and cook until rice starts to become light and creamy.
Stir in sweet potatoes (chunks will break down), cider vinegar, parsley, salt, and pepper. When incorporated, remove from heat and stir in butter (optional).
Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with freshly grated lime zest.
