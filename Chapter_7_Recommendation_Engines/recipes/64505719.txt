Ingredients:
1/2 cup of flaxseed (ground or whole)
1 litre or 4.5 cups water

Directions:
Put the flaxseed in the blender and then add the water. Blend on high for about 1 minute. If using whole seeds, allow to rest in the blender for 2 minutes then blend again on high for another minute.
Allow to rest for 5 minutes and then blend again for 30 seconds.
Pour the milk through a strainer or use a nut bag/cheesecloth to filter the milk into a pitcher or glass container.
Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days in an airtight container.
Use the flaxseed pulp in another recipe but don't throw it down the drain, it has a gelling effect that will clog pipes. Use a Tbsp of dried pulp in your gluten free baking to aid in binding and boost your fiber.

Description: 
DIY flax seed milk can not only save money, but also keep you from using the store-bought kind with chemicals and additives. Reducing the amount of water used can also produce a thicker outcome giving you a creamier texture to use in place of cream in recipes. Flaxseed has a gelling effect, so give it a good shake before using.
