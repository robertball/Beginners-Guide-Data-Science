Ingredients:
6 cups rolled oats
3 cups packed brown sugar
3 cups butter
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking soda

Directions:
Put ingredients together in a bowl.  For each child's bowl, use 1 cup oatmeal, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter or margarine, 1/2 cup of flour, and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda.
Then mash, knead, and squeeze with hands until there aren't any lumps of butter. Form into small balls not as big as a walnut. Put on ungreased cookie sheet. Butter the bottom of a small glass and dip in granulated sugar. Flatten each ball of dough, dipping glass in sugar each time.
Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes.  Let cool on cookie rack.
