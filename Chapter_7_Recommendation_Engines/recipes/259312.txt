Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package gnocchi
1/4 cup butter, divided, or more as needed
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 head cabbage, shredded
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pinch red pepper flakes
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter and olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion; saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in cabbage, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until cabbage is translucent but still crunchy, 5 to 7 minutes.
Toss cooked gnocchi into the cabbage until combined. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.

Description: 
This is a Polish comfort food with an Italian flare. Haluski (cabbage and noodles) is a popular budget-friendly Polish dish. I had some cabbage in the fridge and some gnocchi in my pantry so I decided to stir up some fun. I loved the way it turned out. Sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, it is even more savory and delish.
