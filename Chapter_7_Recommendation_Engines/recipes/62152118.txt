Ingredients:
3 chicken breasts or a whole ckicken
salt & pepper to taste
1 tsp sage
1 cup chopped celery
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp garlic powder
1 Tbsp parsley
Whisk together:
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 t. salt
2 1/2 t baking powder
* Stir in: 1 1/4 cup cream

Directions:
Boil chicken in 4+ cups water with sage, salt & pepper.  When chicken is done pull from broth and let cool to shred.  Return broth to boil.
Add onion powder, garlic powder, celery.
While this is simmering, mix the dumplings, and roll out thin.  Cut into squares using pizza cutter and toss to coat in some extra flour.  Drop into boiling broth.
Let dumplings boil until fluff.  The broth will begin to thicken from the flour.  Keep stirring to prevent sticking to bottom of pan.
When all dumplings have been added and the broth thickened, add chicken back to mixture and allow to heat up.  Stir in parsley.
Serve in bowls and enjoy.  (We enjoy having strawberry shortcake for dessert with this meal!)
