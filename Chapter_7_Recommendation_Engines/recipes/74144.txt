Description: 
Tired of everything being spicy and looking for a quick, nice dinner with a subtle flavor? Try this! Chicken breasts are laid on a bed of broccoli, and blanketed with a mushroom sauce with a hint of horseradish. Great with garlic bread!  Of course - if subtle isn't what you're looking for - you can spice this up all you want!
