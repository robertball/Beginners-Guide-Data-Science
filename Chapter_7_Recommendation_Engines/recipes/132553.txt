Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (10 ounce) package frozen bell pepper strips
black pepper to taste
1 cup sweet white corn
1 (16 ounce) jar medium-hot salsa
1 teaspoon chili powder
2 (15 ounce) cans no-salt-added black beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black-eyed peas, rinsed and drained
1 (10.5 ounce) can chicken stock
1 cube chicken bouillon
3 cups water
1/2 cup uncooked long grain rice

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a deep pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion, garlic, and bell peppers; cook until onions are transparent and peppers are soft, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with black pepper. Stir in the corn, salsa, chili powder, black beans, black-eyed peas, chicken stock, chicken bouillon cube, water, and rice. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer at least 30 minutes until the rice is tender.

Description: 
Salsa gives this black-eyed pea soup lots of flavor without needing a cabinet-full of spices. It's a great, filling soup for a cold day.
