Ingredients:
1lb ground beef
½ pound of ground pork
1 pack of bacon well chopped
3 cups cooked rice; wild rice or brown
1 tsp sugar
3 garlic cloves  well diced  or mashed
1 onion chopped well  red onion ( slice one slice in rings for garnish)
1 tsp salt
½ tsp pepper
1 head of cabbage (I’ve always wanted to try a red cabbage-they’re tastier)
1 tbsp butter or margarine
1 cup hot water
1 cup V-8 juice or Campbell’s tomato juice
1 can of tomato puree
4 plum tomatoes well diced
2 cups of parmesan cheese

Directions:
Instructions:
Combine the beef pork, dice half the package of bacon for the stuffing, rice sugar, onion salt and pepper. The meat and rice mixture is baking in the cabbage leaves. Wilt the cabbage by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes.  Place about ½ cup of the mixture in each cabbage leaf and roll up securely. Wrap each one with 1 or 2 slices of bacon. Place rolls in a baking pan. Dot each with butter.  Combine water and juice, puree, diced tomatoes and pour over rolls. Top with cheese and scatter a few rings on the top for a garnish. Be as generous with the cheese as you like or chose your own favourite cheese. Bake  @ 350F 1 hr.
Have more cheese on hand for when it’s served. No dish is complete without it.
