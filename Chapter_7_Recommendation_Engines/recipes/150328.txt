Ingredients:
1 quart oil for frying
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup canned pumpkin puree
1 cup milk
3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Pour the oil into a deep pot or deep skillet, and heat to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and pumpkin pie spice in a mixing bowl.
Beat the egg, brown sugar, pumpkin puree, and milk together in a large bowl until well blended. Gradually add the flour mixture, stirring until the mixture is smooth.
Using your finger to close the opening, pour 1/2 cup batter into a funnel with a 1/2 inch wide spout. Release your finger, and drizzle the batter into the hot oil using a circular motion to make 4 to 6 inch circle, and then cross over the circle to make a spiral pattern. Cook until golden brown. Turn the cake over to cook the bottom side. Use a slotted spoon to remove from the oil, and drain on paper towels. Cool 5 minutes, and dust generously with confectioners' sugar.

After having this special treat at a Pennsylvania country fair I just had to try and recreate this for my family. I believe I came pretty close, and I hope you enjoy them as much as we do!
