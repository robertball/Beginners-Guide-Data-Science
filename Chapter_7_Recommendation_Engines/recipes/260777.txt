Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 1/2 pounds kielbasa sausage, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle hard apple cider
1/2 onion
1 head green cabbage, coarsely chopped
1 Granny Smith apple, cored and sliced
1/2 cup applesauce
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add kielbasa; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in some apple cider. Scrape the browned bits off of the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon.
Stir onion into the pot; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes more. Add cabbage, cider, Granny Smith apple, applesauce, caraway, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to low; simmer until cabbage softens, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
Use hard cider instead of plain apple cider for my take on this great dish and don't forget the mustard! This goes great with my recipe for Onion Baked Beans. Serve with your favorite hearty, grainy mustard.
