Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1/2 tsp allspice
1/2 tsp pumpkin spice
1 tsp vanilla
4 slices bread
1/4 stick of butter

Directions:
Whisk the eggs, milk, allspice, pumpkin spice, and vanilla.  Dip the slices of bread into the egg mixture and put into a hot frying pan.  "Scramble" the bread as if you were scrambling eggs. Scramble for a couple minutes and then add the butter.  Continue frying until desired crispness.  Serve with syrup or fruit topping.

Description: 
A delicious version of french toast that slightly resembles scrambled eggs. I made this up one night when I accidentally tore some french toast in the pan.  I enjoy it with syrup, but fruit topping and whipped cream would work just as well.
