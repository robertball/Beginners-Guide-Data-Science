1 medium sweet white onion (chopped fine)
1 Tablespoon salt

Let Stand 1 hour at room temperature. (Stirring occasionally) 2. Combine sugar and vinegar in a bowl. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Pour sugar/vinegar mixture over cucumbers in bowl. Mix well. Use a spoon that is small enough to fit into canning jar mouth, fill jars with cucumber mixture. When all jars are filled, pour sugar/vinegar mixture over cucumbers in jars (topping off). Cover and refrigerate. Pickles are ready to eat in 24 hours. Refrigerator shelf life is 3 weeks. (Pickles will not last that long)

Description: 
This is a great refrigerator pickle recipe. In just 24 hours you have great tasting bread and butter style pickle. I grow my own pickles during the summer and love to make these for my friends and family! They never last the full 3 weeks of the refrigerator shelf life!
