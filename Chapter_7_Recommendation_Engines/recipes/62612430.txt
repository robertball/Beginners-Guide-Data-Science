https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2	lbs	hamburger
1	26 oz	Cream of Mushroom (Family size)
1	10 3/4 oz	cream of Celery
1	14.5 oz	french cut green beans
1	lrg package	sliced fresh muchrooms
3	cups	Cheddar Cheese
2	cups	frenchies fried onion
80	oz	tator tots

Directions:
Brown hamburger.
I sometimes saute the mushrooms with the hamburger unless my pan isn't big enough to do both.
Once sauteed...I add the soups and the green beans to this.
I am really anal about the tater tots.  I always line them up in nice neat rows.  I usually do the bottom layer while I am sauteing.  You will not be able to fit this in a cake pan with doing 2 layers of tater tots.  I find the deep tin foil pans work great and you just toss when it's all gone.
.
Layers go like this from bottom to top.
Bottom ~ tator tots
1/2 the cheese layered over.
hamburger mixture
frenchies onions (sometimes I just saute an onion with the mushrooms)
1/2 the rest of the cheese layered over.
Top off this with taters.  (I line these up as well.)
.
I bake this at 350 until the taters are golden brown.  Usually about an hour.
