Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1/2 cup low-fat (1%) milk
1/2 cup butter
4 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter
3 cups quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, milk, butter, and cocoa. Bring to a boil, and cook for 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in peanut butter, oats, coconut, and vanilla. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto wax paper. Let cool until hardened.
Denise's Tiip: Start timing when mixture reaches a full rolling boil; this is the trick to successful cookies! If you boil too long the cookies will be dry and crumbly. If you don't boil long enough, the cookies won't form properly.
