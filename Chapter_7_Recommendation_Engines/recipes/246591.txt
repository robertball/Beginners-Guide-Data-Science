Ingredients:
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened, divided
Cake:
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened, plus additional for greasing
3/4 cup white sugar
3 eggs, at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
Filling:
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup seedless raspberry jam

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans and line with parchment paper.
Beat 3/4 cup butter and white sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until pale and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs one a time, mixing well between each addition. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; beat briefly until well-blended in the batter. Continue beating batter until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes more.
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into the bowl. Gently fold with a spoon just until smooth. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops with a cake spatula.
Bake in the preheated oven until cakes are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Beat confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl to make a smooth buttercream.
Place one cake layer, flat-side up, on a serving platter. Spread buttercream evenly onto the cake with a spatula. Spread raspberry jam in an even layer over the buttercream, right to the edges. Place second layer, flat-side down, over the filling.

Description: 
Probably the most iconic British cake, a good Victoria sponge should be well-risen, moist, and as light as air. Serve dusted with sifted confectioners' sugar.
