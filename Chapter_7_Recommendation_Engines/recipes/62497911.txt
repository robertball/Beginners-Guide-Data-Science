Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package penne pasta or linguine
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
6 slices bacon, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/2 Cup sliced onions
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
Italian seasonings and/or oregano
1 bunch fresh spinach, rinsed and torn into bite-size pieces

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the penne pasta, and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place bacon in the skillet, and cook until browned and crisp. Remove to side.  Add garlic and onions, and cook for about 1 minute.  Stir in the tomatoes, and cook until heated through.  Add warmed milk and stir through.  Place spinach on top, cover and let wilt for a minute.
Drain pasta and transfer to a large serving bowl, and toss with the remaining olive oil, and the bacon and tomato mixture.
