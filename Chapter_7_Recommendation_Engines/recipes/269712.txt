Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 stalks celery, chopped
1 cup chopped carrot
1 small yellow onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
4 cups vegetable broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed San Marzano tomatoes
3 tablespoons tomato paste
2 teaspoons dried basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon raw cane sugar (optional)
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add olive oil, celery, carrot, onion, and garlic. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir in vegetable broth, diced and crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in flour until a smooth, thick paste forms, about 3 minutes.
Release pressure naturally for 2 minutes according to manufacturer's instructions. Release remaining pressure by opening the valve to vent.
Use an immersion blender to carefully puree the hot soup. Select Saute function again; set timer for 3 minutes. Add flour paste, stirring continuously. Add milk, Parmesan cheese, sugar, and red pepper flakes. Season with more salt and pepper if needed. Stir to combine until the timer ends.
