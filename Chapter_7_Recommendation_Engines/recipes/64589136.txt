Ingredients:
1 large eggplant, thinly sliced the length into 10 slices
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 box Dei Fratelli finely chopped tomatoes
---------------------------------------
For the Turkey Meatloaf
1 pound ground turkey
1/4 cup almond meal
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 zucchini, shredded
1 small onion, shredded
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
1/4 cup tomato sauce (from box)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Lay the eggplant on the prepared baking sheets and season both sides with salt and pepper.  Let sit while oven is preheating.  Before they go into the oven drizzle with olive oil.  Let bake for for 10-15 minutes flipping over once.  Set aside.  Reduce oven to 350 degrees.
In a large mixing bowl combine all of the turkey meatloaf ingredients and combine well.
Take a 9x13 baking pan and add about 1/4 cup of sauce to the bottom of the pan.  Lay out 5 slices (overlapping if necessary) to cover the bottom of the pan.
Top the eggplant with the turkey meatloaf mixture and even the layer.  Top with remaining eggplant then cover with remaining sauce.  Bake for 1 hour.
Let rest for 5 minutes then slice and enjoy!
PS Add some freshly grated parmesan cheese before serving!

I can't believe how Dei Fratelli has changed the way I look at tomato sauce!  I used this box of finely chopped tomatoes right from the box.  I did add about 1 clove of garlic that I finely minced in the box and gave it a little stir.  This paleo Italian recipe is perfect and great to share!
