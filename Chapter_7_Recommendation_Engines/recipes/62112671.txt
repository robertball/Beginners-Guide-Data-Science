Image:

Ingredients:
1 pound peanuts, no skin
2 Tbs butter
2 Tbs honey
1 tsp kosher salt
-------------
1-1/2 tsp dried chipotle powder
1/4 tsp dried garlic powder
1/4 tsp chili powder, not powdered chilies
-------------
1/3 cup granulated sugar

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 325 F. Because this recipe involves dry roasting and sugars you will want to use an oven thermometer and a timer.
In a pan large enough to stir the entire pound of peanuts melt the butter, honey and salt until bubbly. Add the nuts and stir until coated.
Transfer the sticky nuts to a 13x9 cake pan and begin to bake at 325. Stir the nuts 2 - 3 times during baking. During the last 10 minutes watch the nuts carefully they will turn to a golden brown color if they get too dark they will be bitter.
In the meantime while the nuts are baking, mix together the chipotle powder, garlic powder, chili powder and sugar. Find a large lidded container that will hold the nuts with plenty of room.
When the nuts are ready add them to the lidded container and dump in the spice mix. Replace the lid securely and shake until everything is well coated. Repeat the shaking every 10 - 15 minutes until cool. Failure to repeat will result in one large and useless rock of spicy nuts.
Store in a one quart airtight container. I use a mason jar.
