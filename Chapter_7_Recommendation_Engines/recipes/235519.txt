Ingredients:
4 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch thick rounds
1/3 cup fresh thyme leaves
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 large garlic cloves, minced
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Combine sweet potatoes, thyme, olive oil, garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes in a bowl until evenly coated. Arrange coated sweet potato slices in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet or 9x13-inch baking dish.
Place baking sheet on the top rack of preheated oven; roast until sweet potatoes are tender and slightly browned, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
Sweet potatoes at their easiest! The potatoes slices need to be in single layer against the pan, not on top of one another. Great for a dinner party! Herbes de Provence with thyme or rosemary sprigs can be used instead of just thyme leaves. Serve warm or at room temperature with sprigs for garnish.
