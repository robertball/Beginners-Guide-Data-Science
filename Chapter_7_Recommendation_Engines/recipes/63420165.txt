Description: 
This side dish, developed by the Light & Tasty Test Kitchen, is twice as nice since it stars both brown and wild rice! Tangy raspberry vinegar complements the nutty flavor of the rice, while dried cranberries provide unexpected bursts of sweetness.Modified from: Brown and Wild Rice Salad
