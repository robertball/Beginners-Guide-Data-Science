Ingredients:
1 frozen banana-chopped
1 Granny Smith apple-cored, peeled & chopped
1 cup Cran-Raspberry Juice (I used Ocean Spray)
1/4 cup milk (I used 2%)
2 tbsp honey
3 tsp white sugar
2-3 cubes of ice

Directions:
put all ingredients in blender and mix until smooth! The apple will add a little grittiness to the mix but not THAT much. Plus, you gotta have fiber!
