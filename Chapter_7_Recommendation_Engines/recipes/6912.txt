Ingredients:
1/2 cup margarine
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, and nuts.
In a large bowl, beat together butter or margarine and 1 cup sugar.  Beat in eggs one at a time.  Stir in rind and 1/2 cup juice.  Pour in flour mixture, and stir until moistened.  Turn into a greased 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until done.  Remove loaf from oven, but not from pan.
Combine 1/2 cup orange juice with 1/4 cup sugar in a small saucepan.  Heat and stir to dissolve sugar.  Spoon glaze over hot loaf.   Let stand in pan for 10 minutes before removing loaf to rack to cool.
