Ingredients:
2 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/4 cup fresh oregano, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (12 ounce) package dry lasagna noodles
1 bunch Swiss chard, torn into several pieces
1 (12 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix diced tomatoes, garlic, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl.
Mix ricotta cheese, parsley, Parmesan cheese, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a separate bowl.
Spoon about 1/3 the tomato mixture into the bottom of a slow cooker. Top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, breaking them as needed to fit the shape of the crock. Layer about half the Swiss chard atop the noodles. Dollop about 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture atop the chard and spread another 1/3 the tomato mixture over the ricotta. Sprinkle about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the tomato mixture. Repeat layering of lasagna noodles, Swiss chard, ricotta mixture, tomato mixture, and mozzarella cheese, respectively.
Cook on Low until the lasagna noodles are tender, 2 to 3 hours.
