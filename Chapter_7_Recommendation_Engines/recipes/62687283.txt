Ingredients:
2 c all-purpose flour
3 tbsp. sugar
1 envelope active dry yeast (1 tbsp.)
1/2 tsp. salt, if desired
2 c. warm water (105F, 40C) or milk

Directions:
In a 4-6 cup plastic pitcher with a strainer in lid or in a large bowl (do not use metal), combine all ingredients.
Beat with wooden or plastic spoon.  Fermentation will dissolve small lumps.
Cover pitcher with lid, turning strainer in lid to pouring lip.  If using a bowl, cover with a cloth.  Set in a warm place free from drafts (85F, 30C).
Let ferment 2-3 days.
Stir mixture several times each day.
To Use:  Remove starter needed for recipe.  Refrigerate remaining starter in pitcher, or in a plastic or glass container with a lid that has an air vent or hole in it.
Label container with contents.  Replenish starter every 7-10 days by stirring in equal amounts of water (or milk) and all-purpose flour.
After replenishing, let stand at room temperature overnight.
Return to refrigerator.
If a clear liquid (liquor) forms on top, stir back into starter.
Makes 3-4 cups.
