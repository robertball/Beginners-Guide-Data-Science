Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon paprika
Â¾ cup panko bread crumbs, or as needed
1 teaspoon garlic powder
4  bone-in chicken thighs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil; coat with cooking spray.
Combine mayonnaise and paprika in a bowl; mix well.
Mix panko and garlic powder together in another bowl.
Spread mayonnaise-paprika mixture on each chicken thigh; press into panko mixture to coat. Place in the prepared baking pan; spritz thighs with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
My wife and I sort of invented this recipe, we think. Chicken should have great flavor and the panko breadcrumbs and olive oil will give it a great crunch! Our kids love it (which is high praise in this house). Hope you enjoy as well!
