Ingredients:
1 cup canned (jar) Roasted Red Bell Peppers, drained and measured packed
2/3 cup Parmesan Cheese (Kraft style, not fresh grated)
2 tablespoons Corn Starch
1 tablespoon chopped fresh Jalapeño Chilies, cored, and seeded
(I like 2 tablespoons Jalapeños, however, it’s has some kick to it!)
1+ teaspoon chopped Garlic (from jar), or 2 minced cloves
½ cup packed chopped fresh Cilantro
2 cups canned Chicken Broth (not fat-free type)
1+ tablespoon each chopped Cilantro and fresh Chives for garnish
12 to 16 oz dried Angel Hair Pasta
5 serving sized boneless Salmon Filets

Directions:
Purée Roasted Red Bell Pepper in food processor, place in cold 12 inch skillet.
Add next 6 ingredients (Parmesan thru Chicken Broth).
Heat mixture in skillet until boiling and thickened, stirring constantly, and remove from heat.
Prepare Angel Hair Pasta according to directions (add 1 tablespoon olive oil in boiling water to keep pasta un-sticky after draining).
Cook, not over-cook, Salmon on barbecue skin-side up first, remove from grill, peel skin off, and finish grilling skin-side down.
Nestle Salmon in center of Pasta on warmed serving plates, pour re-heated sauce around Salmon onto Pasta, and garnish with chopped Cilantro and Chives.
