Ingredients:
1 pkg devils food cake mix ½ C vegetable oil 4 eggs
1 pkg instant chocolate pudding mix 1 C sour cream ½ C warm water
1 ½ C chocolate chips

Directions:
Combine all ingredients, except chocolate chips. Beat 4 minutes.
Fold in chocolate chips. Bake in greased, floured (if you save a BIT of the chocolate cake mix you can use this to flour your pan & it won’t come out floury-looking) 12 C Bundt pan at 350 for 50-60 minutes.
Cool in pan for 10-15 minutes.
Sprinkle with sifted powdered sugar or dribble with chocolate glaze or frost with chocolate frosting (I use Betty Crocker canned frosting, one can is just enough).
