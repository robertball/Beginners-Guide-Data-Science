Ingredients:
About 1/2 cup loosely packed celery leaves, cut or torn into approx 1 inch pieces
1/4 cup kosher salt, or sea salt

Directions:
Line a microwaveable plate with paper towel. Be sure to avoid using recycled towel, as it may catch on fire! Place celery leaves in a single layer and cover with a second paper towel.
Microwave for 30 seconds. Rearrange leaves, if needed, cover and cook for 30 seconds more.
At this point if they are dry and crispy remove from microwave, uncover and allow to cool for several minutes. If needed, continue to microwave the celery in 30 second increments until completely dried.
Alternatively, the celery leaves may be dried in an oven set at the lowest possible temperature, until crisp.
Crush approx 2 tbsp of dried leaves into a 1/4 cup salt and combine well. Adjust celery/salt ratio if needed. If desired, briefly pulse the mixture in a spice grinder.
Store  in an air tight shaker.
Allow to sit for a week or two before using for optimal flavour.
