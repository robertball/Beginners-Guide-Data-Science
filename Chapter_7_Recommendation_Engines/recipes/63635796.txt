Ingredients:
2 C natural peanut butter
1 C agave
1 t baking soda
1/2 t salt
1 t vanilla extract

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together in a medium sized mixing bowl.  Chill 2-4 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Line baking sheets with parchment paper, and drop by rounded tablespoons onto prepared baking sheets about 2" apart.
Press tops of cookies down with a fork dipped in water twice at a 90 degree angle to form a criss-cross pattern on tops and flatten slightly.
Bake 9 minutes or until the edges are golden brown.
Take out of the oven and leave on cookie sheet for 2 minutes to set, then remove parchment to a cooling rack but leave cookies on parchment until completely cool.

Description: 
These cookies are gluten-free, eggless and have no processed sugar.  That's why I called them nada but don't be fooled - they are not tasteless!  I made these for co-workers with special diets but I could eat this whole batch myself!
