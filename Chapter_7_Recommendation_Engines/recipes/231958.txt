Cheese and Pesto Spread  Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1 cup firmly packed basil leaves
1/4 cup toasted pine nuts
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
6 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
6 tablespoons grated Romano cheese
1/3 cup olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (12 ounce) package Brie cheese
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Blend basil leaves, pine nuts, and garlic together in a blender until evenly chopped. Add Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, and olive oil; blend until smooth.
Beat cream cheese and Brie cheese together in a bowl until nearly smooth.
Beat cream in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the whipped cream will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold whipped cream into cheese mixture.
Line a 3 1/2-cup mold with plastic wrap. Spread 1/4 the cheese mixture into the mold; top with 1/3 the basil pesto. Repeat layering 2 more times, ending with cheese mixture. Refrigerate until set, 6 to 24 hours. Turn mold onto a plate and remove plastic wrap.
