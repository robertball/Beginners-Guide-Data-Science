Ingredients:
3 cups cooked low sodium chickpeas, drained with liquid reserved
2 tbsp harissa powder, or more to taste
2 cloves garlic
2 tbsp tahini
2 tbsp lemon juice, divided
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, divided
8 Kalamata olives
2 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
In a small bowl, add the harissa powder and add a teaspoon of the reserved chickpea liquid. Whisk adding more liquid as needed to create a smooth paste. Set aside.
Reserve about 1/2 cup of whole chickpeas for garnish. Add the remaining whole, drained chickpeas to a food processor fitted with a blade.  Add the garlic, tahini, 1 tbsp lemon juice, and 1/2 cup evoo. Blend until smooth. Add the harissa. During this time you may need to add some of the chickpea liquid to keep the consistency creamy. Taste and adjust the lemon juice and evoo if necessary. The flavor should be a smooth nutty flavor with a kick of flavor, not overpowered by any one element.
Add the hummus to a serving dish. Top with reserved, whole chickpeas, olives, and the remaining oil. Dust with a bit of harissa powder and sprinkle chopped, fresh coriander. Best if left to set to allow the flavors to meld, but it can be eaten immediately. Serve at room temperature, but store in the refrigerator.
