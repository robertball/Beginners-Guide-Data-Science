Ingredients:
1/3 pound ground beef
6 slices bacon
1/3 onion, diced
3 Hawaiian bread rolls (such as King'sÂ®), split
1 tablespoon barbeque sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Form ground beef into 3 evenly-sized patties. Place patties in a non-stick skillet and cook over medium heat to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 150 degrees F (65 degrees C).
Place bacon in a separate skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon slices and drain on paper towels, reserving bacon grease in the skillet. Add onion to skillet; cook and stir in bacon grease until translucent and browned, about 10 minutes.
Place 1 ground beef patty, 2 slices bacon, and 1/3 of the onions on each roll; top each with barbeque sauce.

Description: 
I was in a hurry and needed something quick. I wanted sliders, and I love putting onions on everything. I was thinking of what else I could add when I remembered bacon makes everything better! I made these quickly and they came out great.
