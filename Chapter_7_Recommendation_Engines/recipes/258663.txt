1 (6 ounce) package button mushrooms, stemmed
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese

2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Coat tops of mushrooms with olive oil. Place mushrooms top-down in a grill-safe dish.

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook mushrooms until tender and heated through, about 5 minutes.
