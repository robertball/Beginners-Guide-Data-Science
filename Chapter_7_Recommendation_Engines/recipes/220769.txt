Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) loaves frozen bread dough, thawed
2 raisins
2 sliced almonds
1 egg, beaten
6 lettuce leaves

Directions:
Grease a baking sheet.
Cut off 1/4 of the dough from 1 loaf and form into a pear-shaped ball for the bunny head.
Form the remaining 3/4 loaf into a fat oval shape for the body. Place the body onto the prepared baking sheet and attach the head by pinching the 2 pieces together.
Make narrow cuts, about 3/4 in deep, on each side of head for whiskers.
Cut second loaf of dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll 2 pieces into 16-inch ropes. Fold each rope in half, and pinch the ends to the head to form ears.
Cut the third piece of dough in half and shape into 2 ovals about 3 1/2 inches long for back paws. Attach the paws to the bottom sides of the body. Make two 1-inch cuts on the paws for toes.
Cut the remaining dough into 3 pieces. Form 2 pieces into balls and pinch on sides for front paws.
Divide the remaining piece of dough into 3 equal pieces and roll into 1-inch balls. Press the dough balls onto the  the face to form two cheeks and a nose.
Press raisins onto the face to make eyes.
Press almond slices close together onto face to make bunny teeth.
Cover and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled, 30 to 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Brush the loaf lightly with beaten egg.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool.
To serve, line a serving platter with lettuce leaves and place the bunny in the center.

Description: 
I love this bunny bread. I make it every Easter and have it at my Easter dinner.  Sometimes I cut a hole in the tummy and fill with dip, or eat it as bread with dinner. S0 easy to make and my kids love helping me. I have also made this with rosemary bread and wheat bread.
