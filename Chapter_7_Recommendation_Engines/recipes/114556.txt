Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup cornmeal
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons cold butter or margarine
1 tablespoon shortening
1 egg
3/4 cup milk
24 miniature hot dogs
HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE:
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup prepared mustard
1 tablespoon molasses

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first four ingredients. Cut in butter and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Beat egg and milk; stir into dry ingredients until a soft dough forms. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 6-8 times or until smooth. Roll out to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/4-in. biscuit cutter. Fold each dough circle over a hot dog and press edges to seal (dough will be sticky). Place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 450 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Combine sauce ingredients in a small bowl; mix well. Serve with the corn dogs.
