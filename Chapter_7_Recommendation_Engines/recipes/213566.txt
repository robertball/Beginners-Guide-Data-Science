Ingredients:
2 (7.5 ounce) cans red sockeye salmon
1/2 onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 (8 ounce) container smoked salmon cream cheese spread
1 pinch dried parsley flakes, for garnish

Directions:
Drain the salmon, remove bones and pieces of skin, and place the salmon into a bowl. Flake the salmon apart with a fork. Stir in onion, lemon juice, horseradish, and salt until mixture is well combined. Stir in smoked salmon cream cheese spread, a few spoonfuls at a time, until the spread is very well combined. Pack into a serving container, and sprinkle with parsley to serve.

Description: 
This is a simple recipe for salmon dip and spread that I've been making for years, and it always gets requested for social gatherings.  Always enjoyed by my fishing buddies, it gained its nickname of 'cat food.' Serve with crisp crackers like rusks, canapes or melba toast.
