Ingredients:
1/4 cup Butter
1 tablespoon instant espresso powder
9 tablespoons whipping cream
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
12 ounces high-quality milk chocolate bar, chopped
Unsweetened cocoa, sifted
Grated semi-sweet chocolate or chocolate decorator sprinkles

Directions:
Place butter, espresso powder, whipping cream and cinnamon in medium saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat until mixture bubbles around edges (1 to 2 minutes). Remove from heat; stir in chocolate until melted and smooth.
Place mixture in medium bowl. Cover; refrigerate until firm (3 hours or overnight).
Working quickly, shape chocolate mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. Roll balls in cocoa, shaved chocolate or chocolate sprinkles to coat. Place truffles in candy cups or mini muffin pan liners. Cover; store refrigerated.
