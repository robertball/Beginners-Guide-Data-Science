Ingredients:
1/4 cup plain breadcrumbs
4 slices bacon, chopped
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 tsp finely chopped chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
1 lb ground chicken
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
salt & pepper
16 oz pkg frozen corn, thawed
8 oz cabbage, thinly shredded
8 four tortillas (7-in), warmed

Directions:
Preheat the broiler.
In a large bowl, combine the breadcrumbs with 1/3 cup water.
In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat.  Transfer to a plate; pour all but 2 tsp fat into a bowl.
Add the onion to the skillet and cook over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes.  Stir in 3/4 of the garlic, the chiles and 2 TB water, scraping up any browned bits; add to the breadcrumbs and let cool slightly.
Add the chicken, bacon and 1/4 cup cilantro to the breadcrumb mixture; season with salt and pepper.  Form the mixture into 32 meatballs.  Broil the meatballs, turning once, until just cooked through, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the reserved bacon fat over medium-high heat.  Add the corn and cook undisturbed until it begins to brown, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the cabbage and remaining garlic and cook, stirring, until the cabbage just begins to wilt, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup cilantro; season with salt and pepper.  Serve the meatballs in the tortillas with the cabbage slaw.
