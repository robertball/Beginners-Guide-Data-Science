Ingredients:
2 cups all purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup milk
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1 Tablespoon pure vanilla
1/2 cup (1 stick) melted butter
2 whole egg yolks
4 whole egg whites
1/4 cup Belgian Pearl Sugar

Directions:
Preheat waffle iron.
In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt and granulated sugar.  Set aside.
Separate 4 egg whites from egg yolks.  Set egg whites aside.  Save 2 egg yolks.
In another large bowl, mix together milk, heavy whipping cream, vanilla, and  2 egg yolks.  Whisk together.
Melt butter.
Alternate adding flour mixture and butter into the milk/cream mixture.
Put egg whites and put into mixing bowl and beat until the egg whites form stiff peaks.  Fold egg whites into batter.  Do not over mix.
Carefully fold 1/4 cup Belgian Pearl Sugar into batter.  Stir just enough for pearl sugar to be covered in waffle batter.
Scoop approximately 1/3 cup waffle batter into hot waffle iron.  The amount of waffle batter you add will depend on the size of the waffle iron.
