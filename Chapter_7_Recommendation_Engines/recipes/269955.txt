Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 shallot, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups shiitake mushrooms, sliced
6 cups vegetable stock
1 teaspoon ground thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup green lentils, rinsed and drained
2 teaspoons sesame oil
2 green onions, finely chopped, or to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add shallot slices and saute for 1 minute, then add garlic and mushrooms. Saute until mushrooms start to soften, about 3 minutes, stirring frequently so garlic doesn't burn. Add vegetable stock, thyme, and salt and increase heat to high. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
Stir in lentils and sesame oil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender, about 20 minutes.
Divide soup between 4 bowls and garnish with sliced green onions.
