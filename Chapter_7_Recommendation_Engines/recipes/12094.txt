Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
3 tablespoons boiling water
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
4 cups fresh blackberries, rinsed and drained
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
To begin making pastry dough, sift 1 1/2 cups flour, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Cut in 1/2 cup butter or margarine.  Add boiling water to the flour mixture.  Stir until mixture clings in a ball.  Divide dough in half, and roll out two crusts.
Combine sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and 1/8 teaspoon salt.  Mix with the berries.  Place berry filling in an unbaked pie crust. Sprinkle with lemon juice and dot with butter or margarine.
Fit and seal upper crust.
Bake on lower shelf in a 425 degree F (220 degree C) oven for 30 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
When my mom was a little girl, all of the mothers in the neighborhood would take turns making this pie for all of the kids. A whole pie would disappear in about five minutes- from first cut to last bite!
