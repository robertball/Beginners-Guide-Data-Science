Directions:
Pour the vodka, brandy and creme de menthe into a shot glass. Stir, then pour in the rum. Pour it into your mouth and gargle. Light it on fire. A blue flame will appear, but it won't burn your mouth. Sprinkle cinnamon into the flame and enjoy the show. Swallow after the flame has gone out.
