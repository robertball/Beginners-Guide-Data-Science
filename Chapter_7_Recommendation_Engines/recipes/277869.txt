Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes, scrubbed
2 cups white sugar
8 ounces sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened

1 pinch ground allspice, or to taste (optional)

2 (9 inch) pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a pot of water to a boil; add sweet potatoes and boil until soft, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove and discard skin; mash potatoes in a bowl until lumps are removed.
Mix 1 cup mashed sweet potatoes, sugar, condensed milk, butter, eggs, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves together in a bowl. Divide batter evenly between the 2 pie crusts.
Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
Traditional Southern-style sweet potato pie. This is my mother's recipe, but she's Mimi to my kids, so in our house we call this dish Mimi's sweet potato pie. It's delicious right out of the oven, at room temp, or right out of the refrigerator.
