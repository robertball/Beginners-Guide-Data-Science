Ingredients:
1 cup of almond pulp (leftover from making Homemade Almond Milk)
1 Tbsp lemon juice
1/4 olive oil, or more taste
1/4 tsp salt, or more to taste
dash of fresh ground pepper (optional)
----------------
To make "flavoured" cheeses:
add 1 Tbsp of fresh herbs/spices or veggies for each 1/4 cup of "cheese"

Directions:
Make sure you have squeezed out all the water from your almond pulp.
Put the pulp into a mixing bowl large enough to mix in all the ingredients.
Add the lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper to the almond pulp.
Put the mixture back into the cheesecloth or clean coffee filter and close it. Put it into a bowl or mould,cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 hours.
Once the 12 hours have passed, add whatever herbs/spices and/or veggies desired.
Put back in the refrigerator (either with or without the cheesecloth) and cover with plastic wrap.
Should stay good in the fridge for a week or so.

Description: 
I needed a way to use up leftover almond pulp from making milk. I tried a few batches of this recipe altering the lemon, salt and flavours. This was my favourite. Serve with peppers, crackers, olives and marinated veggies.
