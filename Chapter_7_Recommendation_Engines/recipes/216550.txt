Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon butter
5 sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
3/4 cup plain yogurt
1/2 bulb roasted garlic, minced
1 untreated cedar plank, soaked in water for 2 hours
1 tablespoon melted butter
salt and black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped onion
1 pinch paprika
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rub the soaked cedar plank with 1/2 teaspoon of butter.
Use a paring knife to pierce the sweet potatoes in several spots to a depth of 1/2-inch. Cook the sweet potatoes in a microwave on High until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Peel the potatoes, and place into a mixing bowl. Add 2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, the yogurt, and roasted garlic. Mash until smooth. Mound the potatoes onto the cedar plank.
Bake in the preheated oven until a golden brown crust forms on the potatoes, about 30 minutes. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of melted butter, and season with salt and black pepper to taste. Sprinkle with parsley, onion, paprika, and the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese to serve.
