Directions:
In a small bowl, sprinkle sugar over the strawberries.  Cover and refrigerate for several hours.
Bake cake according to package directions, substituting pineapple juice for the water.  Remove from oven and let cool.  Then, using a toothpick, put holes into cake.
Mix the milks together and pour over cooled cake. Refrigerate for several hours letting all the liquid absorb.
