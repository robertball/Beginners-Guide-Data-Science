Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2) pound broiler-fryer chicken, cut up
3 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced
1 cup thinly sliced carrots
1 medium green pepper, sliced
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
1/4 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Grill chicken, uncovered, over medium heat for 3 minutes on each side. Place two pieces of chicken each on four pieces of heavy-duty foil (about 18 in. x 12 in.). Divide potatoes, carrots and green pepper between the four pieces of foil. Top each with 2 tablespoons soup, 1 tablespoon water, salt and pepper. Fold foil around mixture and seal tightly. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 20 minutes; turn and grill 20-25 minutes longer or until vegetables are tender and chicken juices run clear.
