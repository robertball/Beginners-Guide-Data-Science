Ingredients:
12 jumbo-size (3 1/2-inch) foil baking cups
1 pound ground beef
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)
1 cup frozen mixed vegetables
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
3 cups hot prepared mashed potatoes
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 12 (2 1/2-inch) muffin-pan cups with the baking cups.
Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat.
Add the garlic to the skillet and cook and stir for 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the soup, vegetables and Worcestershire sauce. Spoon about 1/4 cup beef mixture into each baking cup. Spread or pipe about 1/4 cup potatoes on top of each.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the minis are hot. Top each with 1 tablespoon cheese.
Bake for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
