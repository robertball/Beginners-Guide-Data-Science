Ingredients:
2 angel food cakes torn into pieces
1 1/4 cup of butter
3 cups of powdered sugar
4 egg yolks
2  8oz containers of whipped topping
2 pkgs of 8 ct fun sized butterfinger candy bars (freeze ahead of time)

Directions:
Put half of the torn pieces of cake into a 9 x 13 pan.
Beat the butter, sugar, and egg yolks together until mixed well.  Add both containers of whipped topping until creamy.  (Make sure it is mixed well, as the whipped topping is not heavy enough to pull the mixture from the bottom.)
Unwrap all candy bars and crush. (Save 1/2 cup to 1 cup of crushed candy to sprinkle on the top of finished cake.) Add remaining candy to creamy mixture and stir well.  Pour half of mixture over angel food cake and spread well.  Add remaining angel food cake on top and pour remaining mixture and spread again.  Sprinkle top with left over candy.  Chill in fridge for at least 2 hrs and ENJOY!
