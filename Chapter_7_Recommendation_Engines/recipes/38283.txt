Ingredients:
¾ cup all-purpose flour
1 ¼ cups ground almonds
¾ cup packed brown sugar, divided
½ cup butter
1 ½ pounds tofu
⅔ cup vegetable oil
½ cup orange juice
½ cup chocolate liqueur
½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch springform pan.
In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, ground almonds and 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar. Knead in the butter to form a dough. Press the dough firmly into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Using a blender, combine the tofu, remaining sugar, oil, orange juice, chocolate liqueur, cocoa, and almond extract. Blend until smooth and creamy. Spread the batter in an even layer over the prepared crust.
Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cake to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate overnight. This cake must be thoroughly cold to set properly, otherwise it will be runny like a pudding.

Description: 
A creamy, rich chocolate cake that can be adapted for vegans by using margarine instead of butter.  Do not use the silken tofu for this recipe, as it is too watery, and the cake will not set.
