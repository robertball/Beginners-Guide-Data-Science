Ingredients:
2  skinless, boneless salmon fillets
Garlic powder, onion powder and Mrs. Dash.
1 package frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed
1/3 cup pesto
1   package fresh  spinach leaves (I like baby spinach).
1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F
~Season the salmon fillets generously with seasonings (both sides).   garlic salt, onion powder and Mrs. Dash.
~slightly roll pastry sheet so it's easier to work with and not so thick ( I rolll about 1/2 inch in each direction).
~place a generous layer of spinach leaves down center of pastry.  Place seasoned salmon on top of spinach (cut to fit down center of pastry).  Spread half of pesto over salmon and top with cheese.  Finish with another generous layer of spinach over top.  slightly moisten  the edges of the puff pastry with water, fold to the center, and seal the seams.  You can brush beaten egg white over the top to help it brown too.
Bake in preheated oven for about 25 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed and golden, and the salmon has cooked all the way through.
