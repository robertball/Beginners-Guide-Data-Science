Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup half-and-half cream
1 cup miniature marshmallows
1 cup cherry baking chips
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 cup roasted Spanish peanuts

Directions:
Line an 8x8 or 9x9 inch square pan with waxed paper.
In a medium saucepan, combine butter, sugar, salt and half and half. Heat until boiling, stirring occasionally. Boil for 5 minutes, stirring enough to keep from scorching. Remove from heat and stir in the marshmallows, and cherry chips. Press the mixture into the prepared pan.
In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt chocolate chips, and peanut butter together stirring frequently until smooth. Spread over the mixture in the pan. Refrigerate for 2 hours before cutting into squares.

Description: 
These ultra sweet bars are always a year-round request, even though I usually only make them at Christmas time.  They are very easy to make, and quick!  If cherry chips aren't available in your area, butterscotch chips can be substituted.
