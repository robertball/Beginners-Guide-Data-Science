Ingredients:
French Toast Casserole

1/2 c. butter
2 c. corn syrup
1 loaf French bread, sliced
5 eggs, beaten
1 1/2 c. milk
1 t. vanilla extract
Garnish: powdered sugar, maple syrup
(We added 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans to our recipe)

Directions:
Melt together brown sugar, butter and corn syrup in a saucepan over low heat; pour into a greased 13" x 9" baking pan. Arrange bread slices over mixture and set aside. Whisk together eggs, milk and vanilla; pour over bread, coating all slices. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Uncover and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or until lightly golden. Sprinkle with powered sugar; serve with warm syrup. Makes 6-8 servings
