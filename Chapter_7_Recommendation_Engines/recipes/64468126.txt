Ingredients:
1/4 tablespoon butter
2 eggs
1 tablespoon water
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat an egg pan over medium heat and melt butter. Don't let the pan get too hot
Crack the eggs into the pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook exactly two minutes until bottom has set. If the egg is sizzling and popping, the pan is TOO hot.
Add the water around the egg and immediately cover. Cook one minute. More or less if you want the yolk set more. You can take the back of your fork and press lightly on the yolk to test it.
Turn off the heat and serve
