Ingredients:
1/2 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 cups ketchup
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together onion soup mix, sugar, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce. Do not use until the last few minutes of cooking, because this sweet sauce will burn if cooked for too long or over too high heat.
