Ingredients:
8  chicken tenders
1 tablespoon BBQ rub (such as McCormick(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
8 slices center-cut bacon, cut in half lengthwise
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon water

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Season chicken tenders with BBQ rub. Wrap each tender with 2 thin strips of bacon, tucking in the ends to secure.
Mix together honey and water in a small bowl. Set aside.
Place chicken tenders on the preheated grill and reduce heat to medium-low. Close lid and grill tenders, turning every 2 to 3 minutes, until bacon is browned and chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73 degrees C), 12 to 14 minutes. For crispier bacon, increase heat during the last 2 minutes of cooking.
Move tenders to indirect heat and brush with honey mixture. Transfer to a plate and serve.

Description: 
The perfect marriage of smoky and sweet flavors is what you'll get when you use the outdoor grill to cook up these chicken tenders! I like to use center-cut bacon since it is leaner and less likely to cause flare-ups. I find cutting the bacon lengthwise, and then using the thin strips to wrap the bacon, is much easier than trying to wrap using a wide strip. Use your favorite BBQ rub on the chicken!
