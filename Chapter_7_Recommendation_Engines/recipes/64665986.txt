Ingredients:
1 cup sugar superfine white
3/4 cup dried red hibiscus flowers
1/4 cup dried white hibiscus flowers

Directions:
Mix the flowers together, slightly breaking them into smaller pieces. Add the sugar and 3/4 cup of dried flowers in a mini food processor. Pulse to grind the flowers until pulverized. Use the pulse method to ensure the sugar doesnâ€™t heat and melt.
In an airtight container, add the remaining 1/4 cup flowers and cover with the sugar mixture.
Store for at least three days before consuming.
