Ingredients:
1 medium seedless watermelon, cut lengthwise and into slices
1 bottle vodka, any brand
1 bottle watermelon pucker
1 2 liter bottle Sprite or equivalent
Ice
Equipment: juicer (blender works well, or fork tines and a bowl)
Shot glass
Hurricane glassware or any kind of drinkable glass for presentation

Directions:
For each serving, take 1 large chunk of watermelon, juice it, keeping as much pulp out of juice as possible.
Fill a hurricane glass 1/3 full of ice, pour watermelon juice over ice.
Follow with a shot of each vodka and pucker (add more or less to taste) and top off with sprite.
Serve with a wedge of watermelon on the rind, like you would a lemon slice.
Enjoy!
