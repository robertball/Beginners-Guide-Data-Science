Ingredients:
2¼ tsp (1 pkg) active dry yeast
1 cup warm water
2 tbsp sugar
3 tbsp milk
2 tbsp plain yogurt
1 egg, beaten
2 tsp salt
4½ cups all-purpose or bread flour
2 tsp minced garlic
¼ cup butter, melted

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water.  Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.  Stir in milk, yogurt, egg, salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough.  Knead for 6 to 8 minutes on a lightly floured surface, or until smooth.  Place dough in a well oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth and set aside to rise for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in volume.
Punch down the dough and knead in the garlic.  Divide the dough into 12 roughly equal balls and place them on a tray.  Cover with a towel then allow to rise in a warm and humid place for 30 minutes or until doubled in size.
During the second rising, set the oven to broil with a pizza stone on the middle rack and let it heat for about 20 minutes.
Roll one ball of dough out into a circle about ¼" thick.  Brush each side with butter then place the disk on the pizza stone and cook for 3 minutes, or until puffy and lightly browned.  Turn over and cook the other side until browned, another 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from grill, and continue the process until all the naan has been prepared.
