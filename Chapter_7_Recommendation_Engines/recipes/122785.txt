1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Combine the egg, sour cream, milk and butter; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.

Description: 
This corn bread goes well with just about anything. I always make it when we have chili. The sour cream makes it nice and moist.
