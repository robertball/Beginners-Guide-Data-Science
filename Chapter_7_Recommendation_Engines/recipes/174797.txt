1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
Tray or cardboard, 15x12 inches, covered
2/3 cup Betty Crocker® Rich & Creamy chocolate frosting
1 (16 ounce) container Betty Crocker® Rich & Creamy vanilla frosting
1 chocolate-covered mint patty
1 large marshmallow, cut in half

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for dark or nonstick pans). Grease bottoms and sides of 1 (8-inch) and 1 (9-inch) round cake pan with shortening or cooking spray. Make cake as directed on box, using water, oil and eggs. Pour into pans.
Bake as directed on box. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pans to cooling racks. Cool completely, about 1 hour.
Use serrated knife to cut 9-inch cake in half and cut hat as shown in diagram. Remaining half of 9-inch cake will form body of pirate. Cut 8-inch cake as directed in diagram. On tray, place cake pieces. Cut ears and nose from small pieces of cake; attach to cake with small amount of frosting. Cover; freeze 1 hour or until firm.
Reserve 2 teaspoons chocolate frosting. Frost hat with remaining chocolate frosting. Mix 2/3 cup of the vanilla frosting with reserved chocolate frosting. With tinted vanilla frosting, frost head, ears and nose of pirate. Add mint patty for eye patch, marshmallow slice and gum ball for eye, and ring-shaped candy for earring.
Frost body with remaining vanilla frosting. Cut fruit snack into shapes for shirt stripes, mouth and strap for eye patch; place on cake. Cut licorice to fit hat. Add gum for teeth and chocolate decors for whiskers. Store loosely covered at room temperature.
