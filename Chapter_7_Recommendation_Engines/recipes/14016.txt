Ingredients:
8 cannelloni noodles
5 cloves garlic, minced
5 shallots, chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup dry sherry
2 cups heavy whipping cream
salt and pepper to taste
1 onion, chopped
1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms
1 zucchini, chopped
1 small eggplant, diced
2 roasted red bell peppers, diced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3/4 cup ricotta cheese
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a large pot of salted water, parboil cannelloni. (Parboiling is partially cooking the noodles in boiling water; they will finish cooking when baked.)
Meanwhile, cook 2 cloves garlic and 2 shallots in 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat for 30 seconds. Pour in sherry, raise heat to high, and reduce liquid by half. Stir in cream, and reduce until there is about 1 1/2 cups liquid. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set cream sauce aside.
In a large skillet, heat one tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Cook onion, 3 shallots, 3 cloves garlic, mushrooms, zucchini, and eggplant in olive oil until all vegetables are tender. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in red peppers, basil, oregano, ricotta, and Parmesan cheese. Season to taste with salt and  pepper.  Set filling aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease one 9x13 inch baking dish.  Stuff vegetable/cheese filling into cannelloni.  Place in prepared baking dish, and cover with cream sauce.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.
