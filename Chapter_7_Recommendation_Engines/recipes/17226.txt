2 cups crushed zwieback toast
3 tablespoons white sugar

In a large mixing bowl, whip cream cheese until fluffy. Add confectioners' sugar and beat until smooth. Fold in whipped topping and marshmallows. Spread mixture evenly onto cooled crust.
Boil water in a medium saucepan. Remove from heat and add gelatin. Mix until dissolved, then stir in partially frozen strawberries. Pour mixture over cream cheese layer. Chill until very firm.
