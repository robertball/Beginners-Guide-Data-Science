5 slices bacon, chopped
1/2 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 lbs fresh green beans
2 T balsamic vinegar
1/2 c water
1/2 c bread crumbs (I use italian seasoned)
3/4 c italian blend cheese

1 t pepper

Directions:
Sautee bacon, onion, and garlic till firm but not crisp.  Add vinegar, salt and pepper, water, and beans; simmer covered till almost tender. Remove lid and simmer till most excess liquid gone.  Add bread crumbs and stir to absorb moisture.  Remove from heat, and add cheese, stirring til melted.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Serve immediately.
