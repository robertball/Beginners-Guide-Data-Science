Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 overripe bananas, divided
1 cup chopped pecans, divided, or as needed
2 cups brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, melted and cooled
2 eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.
Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
Mash 2 bananas with a fork in a small bowl so they still have a bit of texture; mix in 1/2 cup chopped pecans.
Mash remaining 2 bananas in a separate large bowl. Add brown sugar and white sugar and beat with an electric mixer for 3 minutes. Add melted butter, eggs, and vanilla; mix for 1 more minute. Mix the banana-sugar mixture into the flour mixture until combined. Stir in banana-pecan mixture.
Spoon about 1/4 cup of batter into each prepared muffin cup and top with remaining pecans.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 16 to 17 minutes; do not overbake. Cool in the tins for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
