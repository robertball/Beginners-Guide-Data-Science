Split Pea Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
2 to 2 1/2 cups (1 pkg) dried split peas
2 quarts cold water or chicken stock
1 1/2 pounds ham bone
2 onions, minced
1/2 tsp salt (seasoned salt if available)
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp Herbs de Provence
1 tsp minced garlic
1 lemon, juiced
3 stalks celery, chopped
4 carrots, diced
1 medium potato, diced

Directions:
If the split pea package instructions require soaking, follow those instructions then drain and rinse gently. If the package calls for soaking but you don't have the required time then try the following: in 2 quarts of water simmer the peas gently for 2 minutes then allow them to soak for l hour. Drain and rinse gently (and cross your fingers because this does not always work very well).
Next transfer the peas to a large pot and add 2 quarts of cold water or for more flavor use chicken stock. Add to this the ham bone, onion, salt, pepper, Herbs de Provence, garlic, lemon juice and celery. Cover and bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Remove the ham bone; cut off any meat still clinging then dice it and return it to the pot (the bone may be disposed of at this point). Add carrots and potatoes, return to a boil then simmer uncovered for 60 minutes (or until the vegetables are cooked to your liking).
