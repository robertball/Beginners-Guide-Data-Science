Ingredients:
·         1  box (1 pound)  macaroni
·         6  slices  bacon, diced
·         1  tablespoon butter
·         3  tablespoons  all-purpose flour
·         2  cups milk
·         1/2  teaspoon onion powder
·         1/4  teaspoon  salt
·         1/4  teaspoon  pepper
·         1/2  pound  sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
·         1  cup  shredded Colby-Jack cheese (4 ounces)
·         1  cup  shredded mozzarella cheese (4 ounces)
·         8  slices  Kraft Deli Deluxe American cheese (6 ounces)

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 3-quart broiler-safe baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boiling.
Cook macaroni 8 minutes in boiling water, then drain. Meanwhile, in medium-size saucepan, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp, 6 minutes. Transfer to paper towels. Carefully pour off drippings, returning 2 tablespoons to pan. Add butter.
Whisk in flour until smooth. In a thin stream, whisk in milk. Stir in onion powder, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat and simmer 2 minutes. In large bowl, toss together cheddar, Colby-Jack and mozzarella.
Remove milk mixture from heat; whisk in American cheese and 11/4 cups of the cheddar mixture. Toss bacon pieces with remaining shredded cheese.
In pasta pot, combine cooked pasta and cheese sauce. Pour half into prepared dish. Sprinkle with a generous cup of the bacon-cheese mixture. Repeat layering.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Increase oven temperature to broil and broil 3 minutes, until top is lightly browned. Cool slightly before serving.
