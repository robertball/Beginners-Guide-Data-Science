Ingredients:
INGREDIENTS FOR MARINADE:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/1 cup sugar
2 Tbs garlic, finely minced
1 Tbs sesame oil
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 yellow onion, finely chipped
INGREDIENTS FOR STEW:
12 chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into thirds
4 carrots, cut into 1-inch chunks
2 jalapenos, sliced into half-inch pieces
2 yellow onions, sliced into half-inch rings
3 quarts (roughly) water

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients for the marinade and soak the chicken for at least 20 minutes.
Spread the onion rings across the bottom of a large pot.
Place the chicken pieces on top, spooning some of the marinade into the pot with them.
Fill the pot about halfway with water and bring it to a boil.
Lower the heat to medium-low and cook for 1.5 hours.
Add the carrots and jalapeno and cook for an additional half hour, until the carrots are soft.
Remove chicken and vegetables with a slotted spoon.
Serve with a small amount of broth over hot white rice.
