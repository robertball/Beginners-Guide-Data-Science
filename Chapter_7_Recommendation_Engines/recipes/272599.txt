Ingredients:
6 (2 ounce) frozen breaded fish fillets
8 leaves romaine lettuce
2 tomatoes, cut into small wedges
1 avocado, diced
1/2 cucumber, sliced
2 slices jicama, diced, or more to taste
1 tablespoon minced onion
1/4 cup creamy cilantro salad dressing
2 tablespoons crumbled cotija cheese
6 sprigs cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place fish fillets in a single layer on a shallow metal baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven, flipping halfway, until crispy and browned, 22 to 24 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to soak up excess oil. Let cool for 5 minutes.
Tear apart lettuce leaves and divide between 2 salad bowls. Place tomatoes over the lettuce. Arrange avocado, cucumber, jicama, and onion around tomatoes. Cut fish fillets into quarters and arrange over the salads. Drizzle some salad dressing around the vegetables and over the fish.
Sprinkle each salad with 1/2 of the cotija cheese. Garnish with cilantro leaves.

Description: 
We love fish tacos, but have to cut back on carbs, so this salad completely satisfies fish taco craving. If you're not cutting down on carbs, you could tuck some tortilla chips around the edge of the salad, or warm some corn tortillas and serve alongside.
