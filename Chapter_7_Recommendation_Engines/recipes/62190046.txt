Ingredients:
Four 6-ounce, 1-inch-thick salmon fillets, skin on and at room temperature
1/2 cup ranch dressing
3 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/4 crumbled feta cheese
2 tomatoes, chopped
1/4 cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Preheat a grill to high. Cut four 8-by-12-inch sheets of heavy-duty foil. Place each salmon fillet skin side down on a sheet; top each with 2 tablespoons ranch dressing, 1 tablespoon bacon, 1 tablespoon feta and 1 tablespoon green onions; season with pepper. Fold up the sides of the foil, leaving the top exposed. Place on the grill, cover and cook until almost opaque in the thickest part, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve topped with the tomatoes.
