Ingredients:
1 cup chopped pistachios
1/2 cup bread crumbs
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tsp honey
1/2 tsp garlic salt
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp pepper
1 tsp Italian seasoning
5 skinless, boneless chicken chicken thighs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Lightly coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Mix together pistachios and bread crumbs in a shallow bowl.
In a separate bowl, stir together Dijon mustard, olive oil, honey, salt and pepper and Italian seasoning until smooth.
Dip chicken into Dijon mixture to coat, then coat with bread crumbs/pistachio mixture.
Roll and secure chicken thigh with a toothpick and place onto prepared baking sheet.
Place into preheated oven and turn the oven down to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake until the chicken is no longer pink and the pistachio coating is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
Top with a tsp of raspberry jam reduction (1/4 cup raspberry jam, 2 T orange juice, 2 T white vinegar, simmer until reduced by half, add dab of butter to make silky).
Garnish with fresh mint leaves and serve immediately.
