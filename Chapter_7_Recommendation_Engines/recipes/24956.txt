Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups corn syrup
2 cups heavy cream
1 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Butter a 9x13 inch dish.
In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, 1 cup cream and butter.  Bring to a boil, stirring often, then stir in remaining 1 cup cream.  Heat, without stirring, to 242 degrees F (116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm but pliable ball.  Remove from heat, stir in vanilla, and pour into prepared dish.  Refrigerate.
When cool, return candies to room temperature then cut into 1 inch squares and wrap in waxed paper.

Description: 
I got this from a co-worker about 12 years ago.  These are the best melt in your mouth caramels I have ever had, and I always have to make them for Christmas.
