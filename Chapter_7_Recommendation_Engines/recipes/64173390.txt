2. Using a little chicken broth (or olive oil, if preferred), saute onions and garlic until onions are soft.

Description: 
This is a quick and easy acorn squash soup...especially if you 'roast' the acorn squash in a slow cooker.  Not only did my husband love, but my 13 and 16 year old kids came back for seconds!
