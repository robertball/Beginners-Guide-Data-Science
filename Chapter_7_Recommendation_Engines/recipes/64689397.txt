Ingredients:
8 to 10  small red potatoes
1 to 2 Tablespoons Butter
1 or 2 stalks of green onion (chopped)
Garlic salt and Ground Pepper to taste
2 Tbsp. Grated Parmesan Cheese
Sour Cream (optional)

Directions:
Wash and boil  red potatoes, skin on, till fork tender.
Drain potatoes, put in a non stick skillet.
Slightly smash with a potato masher or fork. So that the bottoms of potatoes are not severed.
Sprinkle Garlic salt and Ground pepper on the smashed potatoes.
Sprinkle chopped green onions and grated parmesan over potatoes.
Cut up Butter into pieces and drop around the pan in spaces in between potatoes.
Turn skillet on Med/Hi heat to melt butter. Cover skillet and let potatoes brown on bottom for 5 to 7 min. This will matter as I have a Gas oven.
Serve w/sour cream, if desired
