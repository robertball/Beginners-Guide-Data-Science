Ingredients:
5 Strips Low-Sodium Bacon
2 Leeks
4 Medium Sized Russet Potatoes
3 Cloves of Garlic
3 Cups Fat Free Chicken Broth
2 ½ Cups Skim Milk
1 ½ Cups Sharp Cheddar Cheese
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Chop bacon into little bits and cook over medium high heat in your soup pot, until bacon is crispy.
Remove bacon and reserve 2 TBS of bacon grease in the pot.
Cut Leeks vertically and then into half moons. Soak in water to remove sand and then dry thoroughly.
Heat pot to Medium and add Leeks to the bacon grease.  Cook about 5 minutes until Leeks begin to wilt.
Peel  and cut potatoes into 1 inch cubes.
Add potatoes, chicken broth, milk and peeled garlic cloves to your soup pot. Cook over Medium low heat for about 20 minutes, or until potatoes are fork tender.
Using a blender or immersion blender, puree soup until smooth. Do not over process or you will overdevelop the starch in the potatoes.
Turn off heat and stir in the cheddar cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste….this will depend on how salty your bacon and chicken broth are. I use low-sodium bacon and homemade chicken broth.
Top with crumbled bacon.
