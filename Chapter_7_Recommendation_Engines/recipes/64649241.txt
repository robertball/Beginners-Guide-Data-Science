Ingredients:
1 sleeve graham crackers, crushed (10 sheets)
1 cup powdered sugar
1Â½ cups of 3-5 freshly juiced fruit juice from the fruit directly
3 cups milk chocolate chips

Directions:
1. Line muffin tin with cupcake liners. In a medium sized mixing bowl mix together the crushed graham crackers, powdered sugar, and freshly juiced fruit juice straight from the fruit. (I just softened mine for about 40 seconds in the microwave). Mix together until combined.
2. Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave safe bowl stirring 30 seconds at a time until smooth. Add a heaping teaspoon into the bottom of each cupcake liner and spread along the bottom. Follow it by a heaping tablespoon of the fruit juice mixture. Lastly, add a heaping teaspoon of the melted to the chocolate and spread evenly over the fruit juice layer. Refrigerate for about an hour until set and firm.
