Ingredients:
1 cup yukon potatoes (about 4)
2 cup brussel sprouts (about 2 dozen)
1 cup of rainbow carrots (about 4)
1 cup of cauliflower (about half a head)
1 cup of red beets (4-5 beets)
1/2 cup of shallots (about 4)
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425, ensuring a rack is low in the oven.  I use the second lowest level.
Prepare brussell sprouts by cutting a bit off of the bottoms and peeling the top couple of layers.  Then place the brussels in some salted water and allow to sit while you prep the rest of the veggies.
Peel beets and cut into large cubes.  It is best to use a non-wood cutting board if using red beets, as these can stain wood.  Place in a small baking sheet or dish, separate from other veggies.
Peel shallots and cut in half, if necessary to make bite size pieces
Cut carrots, cauliflower, and potatoes into large chunks.
Mix carrots, potatoes, shallots, cauliflower, and brussel sprouts in a large bowl with olive oil.  Salt and pepper to taste, but be generous.  Oil and S&P the beets as well.
Place veggies on a baking sheet, taking the time to put the largest flat sides down to get the most caramelization.
Place in oven and cook until done, about 45 minutes.  Do not move or flip during cooking.

Description: 
Roasted vegetables are one of my absolute favorite side dishes, especially in the winter.  They take a while to cook, but overall are an extremely easy dish to prepare.  I've found that the key is to place them low in the oven so that you get a good caramelized side.  Don't move or flip them, but keep an eye on them so that you don't go past caramelized to burned.
