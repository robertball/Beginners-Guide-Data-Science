Ingredients:
5 pounds thawed chicken wings (portioned, NOT DINNER WINGS)
10 0z of Kraft brand original BBQ sauce
2 Tablespoons of Ms.ButterWorths syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees Farenheit.
Lay thawed chicken wings evenly in baking pan with sides. DO NOT USE A BAKING SHEET. Mix the BBQ sauce and syrup in medium bowl well. Pour over wings evenly.
Let wings cook for 1 hour. Every 15-20 minutes, remove from oven and turn over. Do this for 1 hour. After wings have cooked for an hour turning every 15-20 minutes, broil on each side for 5 minutes. The wings should be a golden brown color. The sauce will look to have burnt on the wing, its fine!!

Description: 
This BBQ sauce is unexplainable. Its not a rich BBQ but not quite a honey BBQ either. You'll love these!!!
