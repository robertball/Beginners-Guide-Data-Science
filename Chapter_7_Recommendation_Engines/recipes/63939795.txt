Ingredients:
2-tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
4- garlic cloves chopped.
10-ounces peas fresh or frozen is fine you just need to thaw them before adding to the sauce
1-cup onion chopped.
8-ounces baby Bella mushrooms sliced.
1-lb pasta
1/28 ounce can of whole Italian plum tomatoes crushed by hand.
Salt n pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large skillet heat the olive oil and sauté the onion and mushrooms for about 5 minutes and toss in the garlic and sauté for 1 minute more. Now add the tomatoes, salt and pepper to taste and simmer for about 20 min on a medium heat. Add the peas and simmer for 5 minutes if using thawed/frozen or 10 minutes if using fresh. Prepare your pasta 2 minutes short of recommended time. Strain the pasta and add the pasta to the sauce and cook for 2 minutes longer. I serve it with grated Romano cheese and some Italian bread

Description: 
This is a dish my Grandmother would make for me and I always looked forward to it. There are many versions of this recipe out there and I think most families have their own version and to me that is what makes grandma style cooking so cool. So here is my Grandmothers version of pasta and peas!
