Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 (14 ounce) cans artichoke bottoms, drained
1 teaspoon lemon pepper
1 teaspoon garlic salt
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon sour cream
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat; remove from heat and set aside. Place the Parmesan cheese in a shallow bowl, and set aside.
Cut a thin slice from the bottom of each artichoke bottom so it will stand, and gently press your thumb into the center of each to form a depression for the filling. Sprinkle the artichoke bottoms with lemon pepper and garlic salt.
Combine the cream cheese, sour cream, and chives in a bowl, and mix well. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling into each artichoke bottom.
Dip each stuffed artichoke bottom into the melted butter, roll in Parmesan cheese, and place into the prepared baking dish. Bake about 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until the tops of the artichokes are golden brown.
