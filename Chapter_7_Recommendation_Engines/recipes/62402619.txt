Ingredients:
4 medium beets (about 1 pound), stems trimmed to 1"
2 tablespoons apricot all-fruit spread
1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons flaxseed oil
2 tablespoons snipped fresh chives or thinly sliced scallion greens
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 medium navel oranges
4 cups mixed bitter salad greens, such as arugula, watercress, endive, and escarole

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Coat a 9" baking pan with cooking spray.
2. Place the beets in the prepared baking pan and cover tightly with foil. Roast for 1 hour, or until very tender. Uncover and let the beets stand until cool enough to handle.
3. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the all-fruit spread, vinegar, olive oil, flaxseed oil, chives or scallions, salt, and pepper.
4. Slip the skins off the beets and discard the skins. Chop the beets. Cut off the peel and white pith from the oranges. Section the oranges into the bowl with the dressing. Add the beets and toss to coat well. Let stand for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
5. Just before serving, arrange the greens on a serving plate. Top with the beet mixture.
