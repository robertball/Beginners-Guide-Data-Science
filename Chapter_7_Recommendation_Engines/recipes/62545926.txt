Ingredients:
Desired Fresh Fruit
Sugar
Water or Juice
Corn Starch OR Flour & Butter

Directions:
Take desired fruit, heat in a pan with a little water or complimentary juice to amount proportionate to fruit amount. Add sugar to taste and corn starch 1 tablespoon at a time to desired thickening.
No Corn Starch? No Problem!
This option takes a little more patience, and experience with butter/flour combos helps.
Press together small amount of flour and butter until crumbly, start at med or med high heat with very small amount of juice or water, slowly add small amounts of liquid, gradually increase heat  while stirring until mixture becomes smooth.
Add fruit and sugar to taste. Continue to stir every 2-3 mins or less & slowly bring to boil for about a minute. Remove from heat. Use as desired.
If mixture is not thick enough, put back on heat & slowly add small amounts of flour to thicken - careful not to add too fast or flour will clump.
If mixture is too thick, put back on heat and slowly add small amounts juice or water to thin out to desired consistency.
