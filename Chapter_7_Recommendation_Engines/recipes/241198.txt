Ingredients:
2 lobster tails
1/2 cup white wine
1/4 cup cherry tomatoes, or more to taste (optional)
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons garlic powder, divided
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Carefully cut lobster tails down the center using scissors, making a wide enough incision for the meat to "flower" out during cooking. De-vein the meat, if desired.
Combine wine, cherry tomatoes, butter, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, and salt in a large pot; add lobster tails. Bring heat to medium and steam lobster tails for 4 minutes. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon garlic powder and continue steaming until meat is cooked through and tender, about 3 minutes more.

Description: 
Steamed lobster tails. If using cherry tomatoes, it is great over white rice with a little bit of the sauce left in the pot.
