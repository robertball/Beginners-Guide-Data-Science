Ingredients:
1/3 cup cilantro
1/4 cup molasses
1 1/2 tablespoons hot pepper relish
2 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 pound salmon, with skin

Directions:
Combine cilantro, molasses, relish, garlic, olive oil, onion powder, and cayenne pepper in a blender and blend until smooth.
Place salmon in a shallow glass baking dish and coat with the molasses mixture. Cover and refrigerate 15 minutes. Turn salmon over and refrigerate 15 minutes more.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Uncover baking dish and turn salmon skin-side down in the baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until fish flakes easily with a fork and the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 20 minutes.
