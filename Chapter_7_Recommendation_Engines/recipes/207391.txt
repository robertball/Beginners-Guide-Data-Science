Ingredients:
For Peachsicle Frappe:
1 (15.25 ounce) can sliced peaches in juice
1 1/2 cups sugar-free lemonade
1 (6 ounce) container low-fat or non-fat vanilla yogurt

Directions:
Freeze the can of fruit overnight or longer until frozen solid.
Run the frozen can under hot, running water for 3 to 4 minutes until the edges are thawed. (The contents will move when you shake the can.) Open the can and coarsely cut up the fruit in the can with a small knife; scoop into the blender. Add the remaining ingredients, cover blender and puree.
Serve in chilled glasses.
