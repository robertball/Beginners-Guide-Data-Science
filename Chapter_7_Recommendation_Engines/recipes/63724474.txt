Description: 
My Grandfather, William MacKay Fraser brought this recipe to Canada from Embo, Scotland in the early 19th century. It has since been used in many of our family's weddings. I am currently preparing it for my daughter's upcoming wedding to continue the family tradition. Take a little wrapped piece home from the wedding to place under your pillow. You will dream of your true love.
