Ingredients:
1 tablespoon bacon grease (or vegetable oil)
4 strips of bacon, chopped
1/2 cup onion, chopped
1 1/2 pounds fresh, shelled purple hull peas
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Rinse the peas and set aside.
Add the bacon grease to a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and bacon to the pot, and saut√© until the onion becomes transparent.
Add the peas to the pot, then add enough water to cover the peas.
Bring the water to a boil. Cover the peas. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and allow the peas to cook until they are tender, approximately 30 minutes. (Do not overcook, or the peas will become mushy.)
Season with salt and pepper and serve
