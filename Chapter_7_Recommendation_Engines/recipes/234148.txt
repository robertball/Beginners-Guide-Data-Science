Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 egg
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chocolate chips, or to taste (optional)
4 graham crackers, crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk white sugar, brown sugar, butter, and egg together in a large bowl. Stir flour, baking soda, and salt into sugar mixture until batter is just mixed; fold in chocolate chips. Roll dough into 1-inch balls.
Pour graham cracker crumbs into a resealable bag. Place each dough ball, 1 at a time, into the bag and shake until completely coated in graham cracker crumbs. Arrange coated dough balls on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned on the edges and have 'cracks' in the middle, about 10 minutes.
