Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 cup thickly sliced shallots
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 red bell peppers, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 1/2 teaspoons chipotle chile powder, or to taste
2 teaspoons ground cumin
3 cups cubed cooked roast beef
1 pound baby red potatoes, cut in half
2 cups water
1 quart beef broth
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup chopped parsley
2 hard-cooked eggs, sliced 1/4 inch thick

Directions:
Heat the canola oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in shallots, garlic, and red pepper; cook until the shallot has softened and turned translucent, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle in the chipotle powder and cumin; cook 30 seconds until fragrant.
Add the roast beef and red potatoes, pour in the water and beef broth. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in the oregano, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Stir in chopped parsley before serving. Garnish each bowl with a few slices of hard-cooked egg.

Description: 
This is my take on the ubiquitous Latino stew, ajiaco. This version uses leftover roast beef, sweet red peppers, and creamy baby potatoes simmered together in a spicy broth.
