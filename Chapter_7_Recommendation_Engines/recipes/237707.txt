2 cups chopped pecans
1 cup coconut oil
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix cake flour, pecans, coconut oil, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until mixture comes together and forms a soft dough. Roll dough into 1-inch balls and arrange 2 inches apart on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms of the cookies are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
