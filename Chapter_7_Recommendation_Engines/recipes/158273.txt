Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup butter, melted
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter, cream, and milk; stir until a spongy dough has formed. Turn the dough out onto a lightly-floured surface. Pat the dough into a rectangle about 3/4 inch thick and 7 inches wide. Cut into 6 triangles. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 13 minutes.

Description: 
Scones are a kind of sweet biscuit. They are very common in the United Kingdom. Here is a pretty good recipe that I made after a lot of trial and error. These are quite easy. You can add a bit more sugar if you want. These taste awesome with grape or blackberry jelly!
