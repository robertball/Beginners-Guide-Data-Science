Ingredients:
2 Hatch chile peppers, halved and seeded
cooking spray
6 cooked shrimps, tails removed
1 (9 inch) whole-wheat tortilla
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place Hatch chile peppers, cut sides down, onto the prepared baking sheet.
Cook peppers under the preheated broiler until the skin has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Place blackened peppers into a bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 15 minutes. Discard skins and chop peppers.
Coat a large skillet with cooking spray over medium heat. Place shrimp onto tortilla; cover with the chiles, garlic, and mozzarella cheese. Add salt.
Fold tortilla in half and transfer to the skillet. Cook until lightly toasted with spots of brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
I created this one night out of hunger, a craving for Hatch green chile, and having only a few items in the fridge. The unexpected combination of flavors tastes wonderful!
