Ingredients:
2 pounds confectioners' sugar
1/4 pound margarine, softened
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
12 ounces peanut butter
1 pound flaked coconut
4 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons shortening

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine sugar, margarine, cream cheese and vanilla extract.  Divide the batter in half and place each half of the batter in a bowl on its own. Stir peanut butter into one of the bowls and coconut into the second.
Using your hands, mold the dough into egg-shapes and arrange the forms on cookie sheets. Place the eggs in the freezer until frozen.
Once the eggs have frozen, melt the chocolate and shortening in the top of a double-boiler. Dip the eggs into the chocolate until coated. Place the eggs on wax paper lined cookie sheets and return to the freezer to harden. After the chocolate has hardened the eggs can be kept in the refrigerator.
