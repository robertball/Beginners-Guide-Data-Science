Ingredients:
2 eggs
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk, divided
1/4 cup beef drippings, divided

Directions:
Break eggs into a blender; blend for 2 to 3 minutes.
Sift flour and salt together in a bowl; add flour mixture and 1/4 cup milk to blender. Blend until smooth, 1 minute. Scrape batter from sides of blender and pour in remaining 3/4 cup milk. Blend until smooth, 2 to 3 more minutes.
Refrigerate batter 1 to 2 hours before cooking.
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Pour 2 teaspoons of drippings into each of 6 muffin cups. Place muffin pan into oven and heat until drippings are very hot.
Pour batter into each of the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until puddings puff up and are slightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
A quick and easy way to make Yorkshire pudding with little mess. Raises really high! If you don't have any meat drippings, I've used vegetable oil in the past. Just put it the oven until hot.
