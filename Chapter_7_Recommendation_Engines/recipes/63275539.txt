Ingredients:
sweet apples (like Fuji), peeled and thinly sliced, divided
1 3/4 cups moist-style yellow cake mix
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. plus a dash cinnamon, divided
1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg
1/8 tsp. ground ginger
1/2 cup no-sugar-added applesauce
1/2 cup club soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Bring a skillet sprayed with nonstick spray to medium-high heat on the stove. Add about 3/4 of the apple slices to the skillet. (Set the rest aside.) Stirring often, cook until apples have softened, 6 - 8 minutes. Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine cake mix, baking powder, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Mix well. Add applesauce and club soda, and stir until smooth. Stir cooked apple slices into the batter.
Spray a round cake pan with nonstick spray, and pour batter into the pan. Smooth surface with the back of a spoon or spatula, making sure all of the apple slices in the batter are covered. Lay uncooked apple slices on top and sprinkle with remaining dash of cinnamon.
Bake in the oven until toothpick inserted in center comes out mostly clean, 30 - 35 minutes.
Allow to cool. Then cut into 8 slices and EAT!
