Ingredients:
4 bone-in loin pork chops, 1-inch thick
2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt
1/2 teaspoon coarse black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves

Directions:
Combine the brown sugar, salt, pepper, allspice and thyme leaves in a small bowl. Rub both sides of pork chops with herb mixture. Let stand 15 to 30 minutes. Discard any remaining herb mixture.
Prepare a medium-hot fire in grill. Pat pork chops dry while being careful not to remove the rub. Grill chops, over direct heat, turning once, to medium doneness or until the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F., about 3 to 4 minutes per side.
