Ingredients:
1 1/3 pounds ground turkey breast
3/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
1/2 green poblano pepper, diced
1 tablespoon seasoned salt (such as Santa Maria-style)
1 tablespoon granulated onion
4 hamburger buns, split
2 avocados, mashed

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix together ground turkey, shredded cheese, poblano pepper, seasoned salt, and granulated onion in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Divide mixture into 4 portions. Roll each portion into a ball and press into a burger shape.
Place burgers on the preheated grill and cook, flipping once halfway through, until no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve on hamburger buns topped with mashed avocado.
