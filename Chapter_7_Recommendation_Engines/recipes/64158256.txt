Ingredients
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon chili powder, divided
1/2 sliced small red onion
3 thinly sliced radishes
1 pound tilapia fillets
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 peeled firm ripe mango, cut into 1/4-inch-thick matchsticks
1 sliced peeled firm ripe avocado
4 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves, divided
Canola oil (for brushing grill)
8 (6-inch) blue or yellow corn tortillas
Salsa verde (optional)

Directions:
1. Combine the red wine vinegar, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon chili powder in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Remove the pan from heat, and stir in the red onion and radishes. Let stand, uncovered, 10 minutes or until cooled.
2. Rinse fish; pat dry. Gently toss with 1/4 cup lime juice, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, and the garlic in shallow glass dish. Marinate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
3. Gently toss mango and avocado in small bowl with remaining 1/4 teaspoon chili powder and 2 tablespoons each cilantro and remaining lime juice.
4. Preheat a lightly oiled grill rack or grill pan. Remove fish from marinade, and grill, turning once, 2â€“3 minutes per side or until cooked through and golden brown. Transfer to a plate; cover and keep warm. Grill tortillas lightly until pale golden and slightly crisp. Transfer to 4 serving plates, folding tortillas to form U-shape.
5. Fill tortillas with fish, pickled vegetables, avocado mixture, remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro, and salsa verde, if desired; serve.
