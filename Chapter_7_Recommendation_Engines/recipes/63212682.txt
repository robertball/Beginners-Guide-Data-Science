Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp nutmeg
2 tbsp cinnamon
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup butter
4 tbsp honey
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup chopped apple of your choice
1/2 cup candied pecans
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup caramel sauce
1 1/2 tbsp apple sauce

Directions:
Apple Instructions:
Chop up 1 medium apple into small squares to fill 1 cup. Add 1/8 tsp cinnamon to them, and then stir up until all apples are more or less covered with cinnamon. Pressing down the apples with a fruit muddle wouldn't hurt either.
Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
In a medium bowl, combine flour, soda, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Then set aside. In a large bowl, combine sugar, butter, honey, maple syrup, caramel sauce, vanilla, apple sauce, and eggs. Mix with electric wire whisk at low speed until fluffy. Then add apples and pecans and mix a little more. After that mix both bowls together at medium speed until fully blended together. Pour onto sprayed baking sheet and bake from 18-21 minutes
