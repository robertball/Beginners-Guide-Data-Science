Ingredients:
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
4 cups cubed seedless watermelon
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Pour water into a small, microwave-safe bowl.  Sprinkle gelatin over the water and allow to soften for 2 minutes.  Microwave on High for 40 seconds, then stir.  Let stand again for 2 more minutes, and stir until smooth.
Place one cup of the cubed watermelon into the bowl of a blender along with the lime juice and honey.  Pour in the melted gelatin, and process until smooth.  Add the watermelon a cup at a time, processing until smooth after each addition.
Pour the mixture into an 8x8 inch square dish.  Place into the freezer and freeze until almost firm.  Transfer into a chilled bowl, then beat with an electric mixer until the mixture is fluffy, and bright pink.  Scoop into serving dishes, then return to the freezer and freeze until firm.  Remove from the freezer 15-20 minutes before serving.
