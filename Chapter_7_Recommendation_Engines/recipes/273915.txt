Ingredients:
1 cup butter, melted
1 cup white sugar
1 cup light brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 cup ground pecans
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 (13 ounce) jar chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats or aluminum foil, shiny side down.
Beat melted butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together using an electric mixer in a large bowl. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract. Stir oats, pecans, and baking powder into the batter.
Drop batter onto the prepared sheets, 1 teaspoon at a time, spaced 3 inches apart; batter will spread out very thinly while baking.
Bake in the preheated oven, watching very carefully, until edges just start to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Keep cookies on the baking sheets; they will finish baking as they cool and harden. Cool completely before removing from the baking sheets, at least 10 minutes.
Choose 2 cookies that are the same size. Spread chocolate-hazelnut spread very thinly on 1 cookie and sandwich the other on top. Continue until all the cookies are paired and filled.

Description: 
This is a delicious sandwich cookie. My mom's recipe originally called for a layer of semisweet chocolate in between 2 lace cookies, but I decided to try Nutella® instead and love the result! Store in an airtight container so cookies stay crispy.
