Ingredients:
8 eggs
3/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup milk
1 cup cream
2 (16 ounce) containers ricotta cheese
1 cup finely chopped red and green candied cherries
2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts
2 whole candied cherries
confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat the eggs, sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla together in a mixing bowl until light colored and fluffy, about 10 minutes. Pour in the milk and cream; continue beating to make a smooth mixture. Stir in the ricotta cheese and cherries until evenly blended. Pour into the pie shells.
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and bake until set, about 50 minutes more. Cool on racks. When pies are completely cool, dust with confectioners' sugar, and decorate by placing 1 whole cherry in the center of each pie.

This is an Italian take on cheesecake, only so much richer. It was always served by my grandma at Christmas, and it's the perfect dessert to end a holiday meal!
