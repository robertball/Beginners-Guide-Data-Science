Description: 
Spinach, egg noodles and a creamy hot dog mixture is topped with peas and crumbled bacon. What a casserole! This is a recipe I received in German class 24 years ago. It looks unusual, but it is very delicious. I don't know where the teacher found the recipe. Drop biscuits go well with this casserole.
