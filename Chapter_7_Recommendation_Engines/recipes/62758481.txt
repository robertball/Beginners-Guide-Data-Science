Description: 
Stir-fries are the perfect vehicle for quick-cooking, sweet-tasting shrimp. But a proper stir-fry is easier said than done. We have found that itâ€™s all too easy to overcook the shrimp or bury its flavor under competing ingredients. We wanted a simply flavored stir fry in which the shrimp could shine.
