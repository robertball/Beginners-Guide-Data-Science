Ingredients:
Dip
6 oz. fat-free plain Greek yogurt (like Fage Total 0%)
1 tbsp. granulated white sugar
1/8 tsp. cinnamon
1/8 tsp. vanilla extract
Kebabs
1 cup 1-inch pineapple chunks (about 1/4th of a pineapple)
1 cup 1-inch mango chunks (about 1 mango)
1 cup 1-inch peach or nectarine chunks (about 2 peaches or nectarines)
1 cup 1-inch banana chunks (about 1 large banana)
1/4 tsp. cinnamon

Directions:
If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 20 minutes to prevent burning. (You'll need 4 skewers.)
Combine all ingredients for dip in a bowl. Mix until thoroughly blended and smooth. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
Skewer the fruit chunks alternately onto 4 skewers, packing the pieces together tightly. Sprinkle with cinnamon.
Bring a grill (or grill pan) sprayed with nonstick spray to medium heat. Add skewers, cover, and cook until fruit chunks are slightly blackened and caramelized, about 3 minutes per side. If using a grill pan, work in batches, removing pan from heat between batches to re-spray. (Don't worry if the lid used for covering isn't a perfect fit!)
Serve dip with grilled fruit and chew!
