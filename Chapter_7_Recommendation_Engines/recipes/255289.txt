2 cups water
1 cup bulgur
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups shredded carrots
1 large onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
5 cups reduced-sodium tomato juice
2 (16 ounce) cans kidney beans
2 (16 ounce) cans black beans
1 (28 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (8 ounce) can low-sodium tomato sauce
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons taco seasoning

Directions:
Pour water and bulgur into a saucepan. Bring to a boil; cover and simmer until tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain off excess water.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add carrots, onions, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper; cook and stir until softened and starting to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir cooked bulgur, tomato juice, kidney beans, black beans, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, chili powder, taco seasoning, cumin, cayenne, and pepper into the pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, 20 to 30 minutes.
