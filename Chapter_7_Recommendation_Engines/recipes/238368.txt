1 cup water
1 cup distilled white vinegar, divided
1/2 onion, diced
1 head cabbage, cored and shredded

1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine water, 1/2 of the vinegar, and onion in a pot over high heat; add cabbage, sea salt, celery seed, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper. Pour the remaining vinegar over cabbage mixture. Cover pot and bring water to a boil; cook mixture for about 3 minutes.
Stir cabbage mixture and return lid to pot; cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is tender and wilted, 10 to 15 minutes more.

Description: 
This is a comfort food that reminds me of visiting my grandparents. They always had kielbasa and sauerkraut among the holiday feasts. Kielbasa tastes best when it is sliced thickly and placed on the bottom of the pot before you begin cooking.
