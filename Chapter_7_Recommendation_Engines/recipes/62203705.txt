1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1-1/2 cups (3 sticks) butter (at room temperature)
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1-1/2 cups packed light-brown sugar
3 large eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
3 cups semisweet chocolate chips
3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
2 cups sweetened flake coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in bowl.

Gradually beat in sugars; beat to combine, 2 minutes.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each.
