Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup quinoa
1 (15 ounce) can reduced-sodium black beans, drained and rinsed
2 ears corn, kernels cut from cob
4 cups fresh salsa
2 avocados, cut into cubes

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a simmer until the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Mix black beans and corn kernels in a large bowl; add cooked quinoa and stir. Spoon quinoa mixture into 4 bowls; top each with salsa and avocado.

Description: 
This is so easy and fast to make, and tastes amazing! Even my carnivorous boyfriend loves it. Serve cold as a mid-day salad, as a side dish, or serve warm as the main course. The thing I love most about this meal is its versatility. This is how I usually make it, but I just came up with it one day when wanting a quinoa, black bean, and corn recipe. Feel free to change to suit your preferences! I make it cheater-style with salsa, but it can easily be made with fresh or cooked veggies of your choice. It can be a cool summer salad, or a hearty warm winter dinner by the fire. This is the first of my recipes that I have shared.
