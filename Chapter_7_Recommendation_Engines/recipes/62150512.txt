For brownie base, in a large mixing bowl, beat sugar, eggs and vanilla. Add butter; mix well. Combine dry ingredients; add to batter and mix well. Pour into a foil-lined 8-in. square-baking pan. Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes or until brownies test done with a toothpick inserted halfway to the center of the pan. Cool pan on wire rack.
For frosting, melt chocolate chips, water, and butter in a microwave or double boiler; stir until smooth. Cool to room temperature. Fold in whipped cream. Spread over brownies. Chill before cutting. Wet knife between cuts for a cleaner look. Store in the refrigerator.
