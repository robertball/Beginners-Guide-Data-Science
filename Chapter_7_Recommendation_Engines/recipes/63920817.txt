Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
1 16 oz package cavatappi or corkscrew-shape pasta
3 TBSP unsalted butter
1/3 cup finely chopped onion (1 small)
3 TBSP all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
2 1/2 cups milk
8 oz Gouda cheese, shredded* (2 cups)
4 oz sharp cheddar cheese, shredded* (1 cup)
4 oz Swiss cheese, shredded* (1 cup)
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tsp unsalted butter
2/3 cup panko (Japanese-style bread crumbs)
Snipped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Preheat broiler. Coat a 2 1/2- to 3-quart broiler-safe au gratin or baking dish with cooking spray; set aside.** Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boiling. Add pasta and cook according to package directions. Drain and return to the warm pot.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan melt the 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir for 3 minutes. Stir in flour, kosher salt, and pepper. Add milk all at once. Cook, whisking constantly, until thickened and bubbly. Cook and whisk for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat.
Add Gouda cheese, cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese, whisking until cheeses are melted and sauce is smooth. Add the cheese sauce to cooked pasta; stir to coat. Transfer mixture to prepared dish.
In a small microwave-safe bowl melt the 1 teaspoon butter. Stir in panko and the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle panko mixture over pasta mixture. Broil 5 to 6 inches from the heat about 2 minutes or until top is browned. If desired, garnish with parsley.
