Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 very ripe bananas, diced
1 cup maple sugar
1 pinch ground cinnamon (optional)

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat, and let the butter heat until fragrant and very lightly brown. Add the bananas and stir constantly until the banana pieces sizzle and begin to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Turn down the heat to medium-low, sprinkle with maple sugar, and stir gently until the sugar melts. Sprinkle with cinnamon and serve.
