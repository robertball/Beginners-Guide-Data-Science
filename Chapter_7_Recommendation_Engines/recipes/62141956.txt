Ingredients:
4 pork chops
1 small apple
1 medium onion
1 cup chicken stock
1 can Cream of Mushroom Soup
Milk

Directions:
Rinse your pork chops so you don't get bone particles in your dish.
Brown pork chops in a non-stick pan over medium heat. If you don't have a non-stick pan you can use pam or the equivalent to keep your chops from sticking.
Core and thinly slice the apple. No need to peel it.
Clean and quarter the onion
Add the apple and onion to the pork chops.
Pour the chicken stock into the pan with the chops, onion, and apple.
Mix your can of mushroom soup with 1/2 can (use your mushroom soup can for measuring) of milk and pour over the chops.
Continue to cook over medium heat until apples start to soften and the stock mixture starts to thicken.
