Ingredients:
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½ cup Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's <sup>&reg;</sup>edHot(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), divided
1  orange bell pepper, cut into strips
¼  white onion, sliced
2 tablespoons honey, or to taste
2  avocados, sliced, divided
6 ounces Greek yogurt
½ cup salsa verde (green salsa)
1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
10 (8 inch) flour tortillas
4 ounces Manchego cheese, or to taste, grated

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken in a baking dish and coat with 1/4 cup wing sauce. Cover with bell pepper and onion. Drizzle honey over the chicken, bell pepper, and onion. Cover with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
Combine 1 1/2 avocados, Greek yogurt, and salsa verde in a blender. Pulse until sauce is mostly smooth but retains some texture.
Transfer chicken to a cutting board. Drain drippings, reserving bell pepper and onion. Shred chicken using tongs or a fork. Mix in remaining 1/4 cup wing sauce.
Lightly coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil. Place a small amount of shredded chicken on each tortilla. Add some of the bell pepper and onion. Roll up each tortilla and place seam-side down in the baking dish.
Spoon some sauce over each enchilada; spread out so that each is lightly coated. Reserve some of the sauce for serving. Sprinkle most of the grated Manchego cheese over the top.
Bake until cheese is thoroughly melted, about 10 minutes. Spoon a bit more sauce over each serving; add a bit more grated cheese. Add some of the remaining avocado slices to each plate.

Description: 
Buffalo chicken enchiladas with the green, white, and red of the Mexican flag, all in one dish!
 Quick and easy, with a surprising array of flavors. This is not a traditional Mexican dish, just a dish inspired by those flavors. It's mildly spicy. Add extra salsa verde when serving for a truly spicy flavor.
