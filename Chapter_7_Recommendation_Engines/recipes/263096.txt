Ingredients:
Beer Batter:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
8 ounces Mexican beer
1 egg
Chipotle-Lime Sauce:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, seeded and minced
1 tablespoon adobo sauce from chipotle peppers
1/2 lime, juiced
oil for frying
1 pound cod fillets, cut into 2-inch chunks
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1 (10 ounce) package 6-inch flour tortillas
1 head lettuce, shredded
1 (8 ounce) package crumbled queso fresco
1 tomato, diced
1/2 red onion, diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 fresh lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Stir in beer and egg.
Mix mayonnaise, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, and lime juice together in a bowl.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Coat cod pieces in 1/3 cup flour until completely covered. Shake off excess flour; dip into beer batter. Cook cod in oil a few pieces at a time until batter turns a golden brown color, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from oil and place on paper towels to drain oil excess. Sprinkle with salt.
Place fried cod pieces on tortillas. Top with lettuce, queso fresco, tomato, red onion, cilantro, and chipotle-lime sauce. Serve with lime wedges.

Description: 
These cod fish tacos are perfect for warm evenings or sunny afternoon family gatherings. If age appropriate, serve with the same cerveza you used in your batter and both the tacos and beer will go down easily.
