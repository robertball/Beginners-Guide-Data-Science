1 and 3/4 cup salt

1/4 cup cinnamon
1/4 cup poultry seasoning
1/4 cup rosemary

8 Bay leaves
Lemongrass about two cups cut from my herb garden

3 peeled oranges( I just used the peel)
3 celery stalks including the leaves

This is enough brine for a 20 pound turkey. You can half it if the Turkey is smaller.
