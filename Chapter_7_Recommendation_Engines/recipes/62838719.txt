Description: 
If your family or you hate the slime of regular oatmeal then this is for you. It's more cake like. This is the most requested recipe at the sports camp my kids went to. I modified the recipe to cut the fat and sugar and it is my kids favorite breakfast. Make a pan on Monday and eat a quick, healthy breakfast the rest of the week.
