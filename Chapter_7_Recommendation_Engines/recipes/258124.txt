Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/2 cups almond flour
1/3 cup granular no-calorie sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Filling:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 (14 ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk
3/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 teaspoons lemon zest, divided
Topping:
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix almond flour, sucralose sweetener, butter, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Press over the bottom and up the sides of a deep-dish pie plate to form a crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is firm, about 7 minutes. Let cool completely.
Beat cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in sweetened condensed milk. Add lemon juice and 1 teaspoon lemon zest; beat until thoroughly blended. Pour filling into the cooled crust.
Refrigerate until filling is set, about 4 hours.
Spread whipped topping over lemon filling. Garnish with remaining 1 teaspoon lemon zest.
