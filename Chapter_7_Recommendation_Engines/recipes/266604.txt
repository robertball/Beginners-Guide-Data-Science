Ingredients:
1/2 celeriac, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch sticks
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Harissa Ketchup:
1/4 cup tomato paste
2 tablespoons tomato sauce
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons harissa
2 teaspoons brown rice syrup
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1 pinch fine sea salt
1 teaspoon water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (99 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and place in the oven to preheat.
Place celeriac in a bowl; drizzle olive oil over and season with salt and black pepper. Toss fries to coat evenly.
Remove baking sheet from the hot oven. Transfer fries to the baking sheet in a single layer with some space between them.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
While fries bake, combine tomato paste, tomato sauce, apple cider vinegar, harissa, brown rice syrup, coriander, garlic powder, onion powder, and sea salt in a small bowl. Stir to combine until smooth. Add water, 1/4 teaspoon at a time until desired consistency. Set ketchup aside.
Remove fries from oven and increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Flip fries and return baking sheet to the hot oven. Bake until crispy, about 15 minutes more.
Serve celery root fries with harissa ketchup.

Description: 
Oven-roasted celeriac sticks are a lovely accompaniment to your main dish or even alone, just for a snack. The light celery flavor goes well with a spicy homemade ketchup. I tried two different methods to achieve the crispiest fries, and this was the one that I preferred. I served it with homemade harissa ketchup.
