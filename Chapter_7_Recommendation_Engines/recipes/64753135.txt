Ingredients:
2 cups brown rice (not instant)
2 tablespoons red quinoa (not instant)
2 mini seedless cucumbers (middles scooped out); finely diced
zest of 1 lemon
1 teaspoon canola oil
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the rice and quinoa and cook until al dente, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to cool slightly.
2. Add the cucumber, lemon zest, canola oil, salt and pepper to the rice. Stir to combine. Serve immediately.
Helpful Tip: To remove the fleshy middles of the cucumbers, slice them in half lengthwise, then slice the halves into very thin strips, also lengthwise. Cut away the middle parts of the cucumber strips from the outer parts. Don't discard the middle parts! You can use them to infuse water for drinking. Just place them into a pitcher filled with filtered water, then place the water in the refrigerator for at least an hour. When you need a refreshing thirst quencher, this cucumber water will be chilled and naturally flavored!  When the water runs out, just keep refilling the pitcher while leaving the cucumbers in it. This can be done over and over for a few days.
