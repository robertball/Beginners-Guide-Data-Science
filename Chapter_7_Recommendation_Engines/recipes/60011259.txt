Ingredients:
For the panna cottas:
2 teaspoons plain gelatin
1/4 cup cold water
3 cups cream
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, sifted
1 (1 1/2-inch-long) vanilla bean, split lengthwise
For the berry sauce:
1 (10 ounce) bag frozen mixed berries, thawed
2 tablespoons superfine sugar
2 tablespoons brandy

Directions:
In a small bowl, soften gelatin in cold water; set aside. Place cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla bean in a saucepan. Stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a simmer. Simmer gently for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and discard the vanilla bean.
Add gelatin and water to the hot cream mixture. Stir until gelatin dissolves. Pour into 6 lightly oiled 1/2-cup dariole molds (or other small cylindrical molds) and refrigerate overnight or at least 8 hours.
To make the berry sauce, combine berries and sugar in a bowl. Crush berries slightly with the back of a spoon, and mix in the brandy. Let stand for an hour until it has a syrupy consistency.
Unmold panna cottas and serve with berry sauce.
