Description: 
I'm gonna show you my take on this amazing Italian custard pudding. Above and beyond that rich and decadent butterscotch flavor, the texture here is unbelievable. To say it's smooth and luxurious doesn't come close to doing it justice. Serve as-is, with whipped cream, or topped with caramel sauce and flaky sea salt.
