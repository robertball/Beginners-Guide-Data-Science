Ingredients:
12 Figs, ripe
6 ounces (175g) Gorgonzola Piccante
Salt and pepper (freshly milled black pepper of course)
2 Tablespoons of Greek Honey
2 Tablespoons of Red wine vinegar

Directions:
Preheat the grill (note this is ENGLISH english - Americans call this a broiler I believe) to its highest setting.
Oil a baking tray around 10 x 14 inches (25 x 35 cms).
Cut the cheese into 1/4 inch (5mm) dice.
Wipe the figs and halve them through the stalk.
Place, cut side uppermost, on the baking tray. Season with salt and pepper and slide under the heat for 5 or 6 minutes, until they're soft and bubbling slightly.
Remove the tray from the grill and divide the cheese equally among the figs, pressing down gently to squish it into the figs.
Slide the tray back under the grill and cook for a further 2 minutes or so, until the cheese is bubbling and faintly golden.
While doing the grilling, mix up the sauce of honey and red wine vinegar.
Transfer straight from the heat onto plates, pour the sauce over, and serve.

Simply delicious....a real WOW from everyone when I first served them. It may sound like an unlikely combination, but it is simply brilliant. A first course that is fast, unusual and absolutely no trouble at all to prepare.
