Description: 
Pens Joyce Haworth from Des Plaines, Illinois, 'When the stores in my area stopped carrying our favorite turkey sausage, I was desperate! I went to the library for some books on sausage-making...and was surprised to learn how easy it is! We use this sweet spicy sausage on pizza, in spaghetti sauce, casseroles and breakfast patties.'
