Ingredients:
2 cups cubed or shredded cooked chicken
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
3 tablespoons Frank's® RedHot® Sauce
1/2 (17.3 ounce) package Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry Sheets, thawed

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Stir the chicken, cheese and hot sauce in a medium bowl.
Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface.  Roll the pastry sheet into a 10x14-inch rectangle.
With the short side facing you, spoon the chicken mixture down the center of the pastry.  Fold 2 opposite sides of the pastry to the center over the filling and press to seal.  Place the pastry, seam-side down, onto a baking sheet.  Tuck the ends under to seal.
Bake for 30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.  Cut the pastry in quarters to serve.
