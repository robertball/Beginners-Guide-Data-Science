Ingredients:
3/4 c soy sauce
1/8 tsp ginger
4 boneless chicken breasts
1 1/2 tsp hoisin sauce
Salt and pepper
Water

Directions:
In a medium skillet on medium-high heat, pour 1/2 cup soy sauce in to coat the bottom of the pan. Add in ginger and stir. Heat for about 1 minute.
Lightly salt and pepper chicken. Add chicken into the pan. Cook until all pink disapears, and juices run clear, flipping chicken occasionally. While cooking chicken, add about 1/4 cup water everytime soy sauce evaporates, making it so that there is always a sauce surrounding chicken.
Take chicken out of the pan, and on a small cutting board, shred the chicken.
Pour 1/4 cup soy sauce and the 1 1/2 teaspoons hoisin sauce into the pan, and cook until fully incorporated on low, about 2 minutes. Add a little water if needed.
Put shredded chicken back into pan and let absorb the sauce, this will only take a minute.
Enjoy!
