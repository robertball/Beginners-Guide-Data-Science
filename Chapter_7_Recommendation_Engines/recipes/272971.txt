2 1/2 cups cubed fully cooked ham
1/2 cup chopped onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
salt and pepper to taste

Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add ham and onion; saute for about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper; cook for 2 minutes.
Whisk together chicken broth, half-and-half, and flour in a bowl until smooth; pour into the pot. Stir in farfalle pasta, cover, and cook for 15 minutes.
