Ingredients:
2 cups ketchup
2 cups brown sugar
1 cup water
1 cup lemon juice
2 tsp onion powder
1 stick butter (no margarine)
3 tbs Worcestershire sauce
2 tbs Texas Pete
1/2-1 tsp Red pepper

Directions:
Put stick of butter in large pot with heat set on simmer.
You want it to melt real slow to allow you time to mix the other ingredients without burning the butter.
Put ketchup and brown sugar in large mixing bowl and stir until smooth.
Add and stir each of the remaining ingredients separately.
Put on medium heat until the sauce begins to bubble, usually about 15 minutes or so.
Then on simmer (or whatever your lowest setting is) for an additional 20 minutes.
