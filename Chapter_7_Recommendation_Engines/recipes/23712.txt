Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
1 medium head cabbage, quartered
2 tablespoons olive oil
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add farfalle pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In a large skillet over medium heat, saute cabbage in olive oil.  If skillet gets dry add a bit more oil.   Saute about 10 minutes then add cooked farfalle pasta. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes more.  Sprinkle on pepper to taste.

Submitter: 
Exousia
Description: 
Not sure about the name but the dish is delicious.  A simple dish of cabbage and noodles, but don't try to substitute butter, it's not as good.  Try it with 1/2 pound of pastrami or corned beef cooked in.
