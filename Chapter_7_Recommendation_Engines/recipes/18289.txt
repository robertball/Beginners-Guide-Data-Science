1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup quick-cooking grits

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart casserole dish.
Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan with garlic and salt. Stir in grits, reduce heat to low, and cook until thick, about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from heat and stir in cheese and butter until melted. In a small bowl, whisk together egg and milk, then stir into grits. Pour grits mixture into greased casserole dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until firm.

Description: 
I love grits, which is strange since I was raised in Wisconsin. My husband on the other hand hates them and he was raised in the south. He however loves these garlicky, cheesy grits. This is a great dish to serve with barbequed ribs or chicken
