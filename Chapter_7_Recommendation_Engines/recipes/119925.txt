Ingredients:
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
2 eggs
1/2 cup honey
1/3 cup vegetable oil
GLAZE:
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons milk

Directions:
In a saucepan over low heat, cook and stir brown sugar and milk for 5 minutes or until sugar is dissolved.  Remove from the heat.  In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients.  In another bowl, combine the eggs, honey, oil and brown sugar mixture; mix well.  Stir into dry ingredients until moistened.  Pour into a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean (cover with foil of top browns too quickly).  Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.  Combine glaze ingredients until smooth; drizzle over bread.

Description: 
'The texture of this moist bread is almost like a cake, so I usually serve slices of it for dessert,' comments Gaye O'Dell of Binghamton, New York. 'Plus, the loaf looks so festive with the pretty glaze drizzled on top.'
