Ingredients:
8 oz can beef broth
3 pounds boneless pork ribs
1 (18 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce
1 sliced onion
Rolls

Directions:
Pour can of beef broth into slow cooker, and add boneless pork ribs and sliced onion. Cook on High heat for 4 hours, or until meat shreds easily. Remove meat, and shred with two forks. It will seem that it's not working right away, but it will.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer the shredded pork to a Dutch oven or iron skillet, and stir in barbeque sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until heated through.
Serve with rolls.
