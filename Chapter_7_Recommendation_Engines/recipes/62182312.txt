Ingredients:
6 Ziploc type freezer bags
12 eggs
*shredded cheese (I like coby jack)
*cubed ham
*crumbled bacon
*diced onion
*diced green onions
*cubed tomato or chunky salsa
*hash browns

Directions:
Bring water to a rolling boil in a large pot.  Have everyone write their name on a quart-size Ziploc freezer bag with permanent marker.  Crack 2 eggs into each bag (not more than 2) shake to combine them.  Put out a variety of ingredients such as: cheeses, ham, onion, green pepper, tomato, hash browns, salsa, etc.  Each guest adds prepared ingredients of choice to their bag and shake. Make sure to get the air out of the bag and zip it up.
Place the bags into rolling, boiling water for exactly 13 minutes. You can usually cook 6-8 omelets in a large pot. For more, make another pot of boiling water.  Open the bags and the omelet will roll out easily. Be prepared for everyone to be amazed.
Nice to serve with fresh fruit and coffee cake; everyone gets involved in the process and a great conversation piece.
