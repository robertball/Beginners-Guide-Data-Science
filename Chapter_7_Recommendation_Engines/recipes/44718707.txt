Ingredients:
1 cup pancake/waffle mix..(I used "complete")
1/2 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 cup apple - peeled, cored and sliced (I used 1 large Cortland)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup pecans, chopped
3 tablespoons maple syrup (I used sugar-free)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  While oven is preheating, put the 2 T butter in 9 inch pie plate and place in the oven.  Mix together pancake mix, milk and egg until blended.  Set aside.
Mix cinnamon and syrup with the sliced apple.  Place 1/2 of the apple slices on top of butter in bottom of pie plate.  Sprinkle pecans over apples.  Pour 1/2 of the pancake batter on top of the pecans.  Next layer the rest of the apple and then pour the rest of the batter over apples.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes or until top springs back when touched. Loosen edges and invert onto serving platter. Cut into wedges before serving.
