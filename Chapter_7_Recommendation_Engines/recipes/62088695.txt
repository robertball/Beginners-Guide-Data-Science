Ingredients:
1 cup cold salmon (leftover from salmon filet basted with avocado oil and liberally sprinkled with dried dill with sesame(Spice Hunter brand) at 375 degrees for 16-18 minutes. Allow to cool).
1/4 cup mayonnaise
juice of 1/2 lemon
1 T prepared horseradish
1 T mustard
6 drops Tabasco sauce
salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1 T fresh dill

Directions:
Place all ingredients in a food processor and puree until smooth.  Adjust seasonings to your taste. Serve as a spread or dip with crostini or vegetables. Serve cold or at room temperature.  Can be made ahead. Always tastes better the next day. I am sure you can use canned salmon just as well, but fresh salmon tastes better.  If you do not have avocado oil, use an avocado in the spread instead. The fun of making spreads is that almost anything goes. Tasting along the way is the secret to a spread or dip that you and your family and friends will love.
