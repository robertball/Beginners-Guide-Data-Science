Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) pork roast
1/3 cup Chardonnay wine
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon rosemary
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pierce pork roast multiple times with a fork and place into a roasting bag. Pour wine over the roast. Sprinkle ginger, garlic, rosemary, and black pepper over the roast, respectively. Seal roasting bag.
Cook until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
