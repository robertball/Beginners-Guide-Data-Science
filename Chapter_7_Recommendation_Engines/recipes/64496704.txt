Ingredients:
12 large jalapenos halved and deseeded
1- 12 oz hickory smoked bacon cut into two pieces per slice.
1- 8 oz package of light cream cheese
3-4 cloves of minced garlic
1 Tb minced chives
1 Tb minced fresh basil, tarragon, and parsley (or any combination of your favorite herbs)
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp sea salt
1/3 cup brown sugar
24 toothpicks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Using vinyl or latex gloves, halve each jalapeno and using a paring knife, remove pith and seeds, but keep the stem intact.
Combine cream cheese, herbs, garlic, and seasonings well and set aside.
Cut bacon into halves per slice and have toothpicks ready.
Stuff roughly a tsp or more of the cream cheese filling into each half and smooth it evenly within it.
Wrap each jalapeno in a half a slice of bacon and using a toothpick, affix it so that the ends are below each half and will not pull away once it cooks.  These can be frozen at this point for future use, or continue the following steps.
Dredge each top portion of the jalapeno in the brown sugar and place skin side down on a sheet pan.
Bake for 15 minutes or until bacon is lightly browned, but not crisp. The bacon will continue to crisp/harden as it cools.  Serve immediately.
