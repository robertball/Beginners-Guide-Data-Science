Ingredients:
•1 package (16 ounces) angel food cake mix
•5 teaspoons confectioners' sugar
•1 cup (8 ounces) strawberry yogurt
•1 package (1 ounce) instant sugar-free vanilla pudding mix
•3 drops red food coloring, optional

Directions:
•Line a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan with waxed paper. Prepare cake according to package directions.
• Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake at 350° for 15-20 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool for 5 minutes.
• Turn cake onto a kitchen towel dusted with confectioners' sugar. Gently peel off waxed paper. Roll up jelly-roll style in the towel, starting with a short side. Cool on a wire rack.
• In a large bowl, whisk the yogurt, pudding mix and food coloring if desired. Fold in whipped topping.
• Unroll cake; spread filling evenly over cake to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up. Cover and freeze. Remove from freezer 30 minutes before slicing. Yield: 10 servings.

Description: 
There's always room for dessert-especially when it's this eye-catching frozen fare. We like strawberry yogurt in the filling, but different flavors work well, too, suggests Joan Colbert. The make-ahead dessert is often requested at her Sigourney, Iowa home.
