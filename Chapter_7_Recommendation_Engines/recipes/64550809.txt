Ingredients:
2 cups raw slivered almonds
1/2 cup shredded unsweetened coconut
1/2 cup raw sunflower seeds
1 1/4 cups raw pumpkin (or peptia) seeds
3 tbsp coconut oil
1/4 cup honey
1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven 325 degrees F and prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking liner
To a food processor, add slivered almonds & pulse until a granola like mixture appears this should only take a few seconds, do not over process
In a large mixing bowl, add all nuts including pulsed almonds & shredded coconut
In a small saucepan, heat coconut oil, vanilla & honey on low heat for 5 minutes
Pour the mixture over nuts & combine well then spread the mixture evenly onto the baking sheet
Bake 20-25 minutes until slightly golden brown stirring half way through baking
Remove from oven & cool 10-15 minutes, the granola will harden more as it cools
Store in a container & enjoy for a few weeks
