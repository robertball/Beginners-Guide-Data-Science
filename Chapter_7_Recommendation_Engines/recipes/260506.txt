Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup thinly sliced white or brown mushroom
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup thinly sliced celery
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme or sage
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 (32 ounce) carton College Inn® Turkey or Chicken Broth, divided
2 tablespoons dry white wine
Cracked black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook mushrooms, onion, celery and thyme until onion is very soft and golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Stir in flour and cook, stirring constantly, about 4 to 5 minutes or just until light golden brown.
Gradually whisk in 2 cups broth and wine.  Cook, stirring frequently with a whisk, about 3 minutes or until thickened and smooth.  Let cool.  Refrigerate gravy base and remaining 2 cups broth up to 2 days before serving.
Transfer roasted turkey to a platter to rest. Skim fat from pan drippings.  Add pan drippings to refrigerated gravy base in a medium saucepan; heat over medium heat, stirring frequently with a whisk.  Add reserved broth 1/4 cup at a time until desired consistency is reached.  Simmer until heated through and season to taste with pepper.
