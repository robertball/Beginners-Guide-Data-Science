Ingredients:
For the avocado-lime guacamole:
· 3 ripe avocados, peeled, pitted, and cubed
· 1/2 cup sour cream
· 3 tablespoons chopped basil
· 3 tablespoons finely chopped shallots
· 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan
· 2 tablespoons lemon juice
· 2 tablespoons lime juice
· 2 tablespoons minced garlic
· 1 serrano chile, seeded and minced
· 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
· 1 teaspoon salt
For the burger:
· 1 1/2 pounds raw boneless skinless salmon fillet, minced by hand*
· 1/2 cup mayonnaise
· 1/4 cup minced shallots
· 3 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro
· 3 tablespoons finely chopped chives
· 3 tablespoons finely chopped dill
· 3 tablespoons minced scallions
· 3 tablespoons minced lemongrass (from 1 stalk)
· 3 tablespoons minced peeled ginger
· 3 tablespoons thinly sliced mint leaves
· 2 tablespoons fish sauce
· 2 tablespoons hot chile sauce, such as Sriracha
· 1 tablespoon minced garlic
· 1 teaspoon salt
· 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
· 1 1/2 cups panko**
· 1/2 cup raw sesame seeds
· 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more as needed
· 6 onion hamburger buns, split***

Directions:
For the avocado-lime guacamole:
Using a potato masher or a large fork, coarsely mash all of the ingredients in a large bowl. Serve immediately. Guacamole is best served immediately after it's made, but if necessary, this one can be made up to 8 hours ahead. To keep it as fresh as possible, place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the guacamole to prevent it from discoloring, then refrigerate it. Just before serving, stir the guacamole to blend.)
For the burger:
Stir the first 15 ingredients in a large bowl just until blended (do not overwork the fish). Stir in 1 cup of the panko. Form the salmon mixture into six 4½-inch-diameter patties that are ½-inch thick. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.
Then, stir the sesame seeds with the remaining panko in a shallow bowl. Generously coat the patties with the sesame mixture. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil on a large nonstick griddle over medium-high heat.
Working in batches, grill the patties until golden brown on the outside and just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side, adding more oil to the griddle as needed.
Generously spread the avocado-lime guacamole over the bun bottoms. Place the salmon patties on the bun bottoms. Top with desired toppings and the bun tops, and serve.

*Note: Do not mince the salmon in a food processor, as it tends to make the fish stringy and mushy. Instead, use a large sharp knife.
