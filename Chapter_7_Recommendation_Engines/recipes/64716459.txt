Ingredients:
1 egg
2 tbsp milk
1 baked potato - preferably left over from the night before.
¼ cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 pinch salt
1 pinch pepper
1 pinch onion powder
1 pinch Italian seasoning

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 400°F.
Cut the potato into cubes and place in the bottom of the ramekin.
Season the potato with a pinch of salt, pepper, onion powder, and Italian seasoning.
Top the potato with shredded cheddar cheese.
Add a pinch of salt, pepper, onion powder, and Italian seasoning.
In a small bowl, mix the egg with a splash of milk until blended!
Bake for 20 minutes, then broil for about 3 minutes to get the cheese crispy. (Watch closely while broiling so you don't burn it.)
Let stand for about 3-5 minutes before serving.
