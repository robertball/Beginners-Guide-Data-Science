Description: 
A new twist on ordinary fried mozzarella sticks.  A combination of bread and mozzarella makes for a satisfying meal or appetizer. Be sure your mozzarella slice is large enough to cover the bread! Serve with hot tomato sauce or as a hot sandwich covered with tomato sauce.  You'll never eat a regular mozzarella stick again.
