Ingredients:
1 cup white rice
2 cups water
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 sweet yellow onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon chili powder, or more to taste
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
8 large flour tortillas, warmed
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot butter until onion is translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Melt 1 more tablespoon butter with onions and garlic; stir chili powder, paprika, cumin, black pepper, cayenne pepper, cloves, and nutmeg into mixture. Cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes.
Stir black beans and tomato sauce into contents of skillet; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook until flavors blend, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir cilantro into the sauce, and let cilantro wilt, about 5 more minutes.
Fill each tortilla with 1/2 cup cooked rice and 1/3 cup bean mixture.
