Ingredients:
1 lb. ground sausage, mild or medium
1/2 c. water
1/4 c. flour
2 c. milk
freshly ground pepper
biscuits

Directions:
Brown the sausage.  When completely browned, add water to incorporate drippings.  Meanwhile make biscuits as desired.  A couple of minutes before the biscuits come out of the oven and when most of the water has cooked out, stir in flour and cook for about a minute.  Add milk gradually and thicken.  Ladle gravy over biscuits and season with freshly ground pepper.
