Chicken Bombs Recipe

Ingredients:
8 chicken tender fingers
1 pk of Philadelphia Cream Cheese
1 Jalapeno Pepper
1 pkg of bacon
4 oz of pepper jelly
green onions
salt and pepper to taste
Toothpicks to secure bacon

Directions:
Very finely chop the green onions and the pepper.  Mix with the cream cheese and salt and pepper.  Set to the side.
With the flat side of your tenderizer flatten the chicken fingers so that it resembles a rectangle.
Add about 2-4 tbsp of the cream cheese mixture to the middle of the chicken and fold around it like a pouch.  Wrap a slice of bacon around the chicken pouch and secure with a toothpick.  Chicken Bomb should be no bigger than your fist.
Add a small amount of pepper jelly to the top of the bomb to add flavor.
Chicken Bomb should be cooked at 400 degrees for approx 35 Mins.  I use a standard baking sheet with a wire rack so that the chicken juices will drip down away from the bomb.  Be advised that recipe can be very hot if you leave the pepper membranes intact before chopping.

Description: 
This is a great recipe to have with friends and family, or for a buffet line.  I love to invite a few friends over and serve this with a few other appetizers.  A friend brought me a version of this recipe and through a little tweeking we were able to come up with this great dish.
