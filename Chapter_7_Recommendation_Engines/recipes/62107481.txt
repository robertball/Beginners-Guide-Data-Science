Cheesy Tuna Dip Recipe

Ingredients:
2 regular sized tins of all white or albacore tuna in water, drained and pressed.
1 slice (1/4") red onion, finely chopped
2 tbsp garlic, finely chopped
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
about 1/2 cup low/no-fat mayo(I use Duke's)
Black pepper to taste (about 2 tsp)
Dried basil to taste (about 1/2 Tbsp)
Dried thyme to taste (about 1 tsp)
2 slices of green bell pepper, finely chopped (optional)

Directions:
Starting with the mayo, then tuna, cheese, veggies, and spices, layer twice in a medium sized bowl and mix thoroughly.
Chilling for an hour or two (or even overnight) is best, but it is quite edible right away!
I serve with wheat thins, crostini, or french bread, depending on the occasion.
