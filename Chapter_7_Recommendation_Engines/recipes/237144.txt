Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 bananas, mashed
3/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon rum-flavored extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
3/4 cup shredded unsweetened coconut, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Stir bananas, sugar, butter, egg, rum-flavored extract, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Fold flour mixture into banana mixture 1 cup at a time. Add pineapple chunks and 1/2 cup coconut; fold gently into batter. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups and top each with about 1 teaspoon shredded coconut.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan before removing to a wire rack.
