Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped
6 large cremini mushrooms, chopped
2 large cloves garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup herbed goat cheese (chevre)
4 teaspoons whipped cream cheese
4 flour tortillas
1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, mushrooms, garlic, salt, and black pepper with olive oil and balsamic vinegar until onion is translucent and mushrooms are lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
Mix goat cheese and cream cheese together in a small bowl.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Warm a tortilla on the hot skillet for 1 minute; flip and repeat on other side.
Spread 1/4 goat cheese mixture onto warmed tortilla; spoon 1/4 mushroom mixture on one half of tortilla. Sprinkle 1/4 mozzarella cheese over mushroom mixture.
Cook quesadilla until mozzarella cheese begins to melt, about 5 minutes; fold tortilla over melted cheese and press to seal. Repeat with remaining tortillas and fillings.
