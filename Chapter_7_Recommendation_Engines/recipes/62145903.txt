Ingredients:
2.5 lbs ground beef
1 cup onion chopped
1 pkg dried onion soup mix
1 can 10 oz Rotel Chopped tomatoes & green chili
1 pkg angel hair pre shredded cabbage(found in the produce section with bagged lettuce) or shred 1 small cabbage.  A cole slaw mix bag with carrots also works.
2 cups shredded mozzerala cheese
Topping:
2 cups bisquick, pioneer or baking mix
1 TBSP Seasoned garlic powder
1 cup milk
2 eggs

Directions:
Brown the ground beef, dried onion soup mix and onion in a large skillet
Drain the grease from beef mixture
Add the can of Rotel Chopped tomatoes and cabbage.
Cook until the cabbage is wilted and the beef mix cooks down turning often to coat the cabbage.
Pour beef mix into a 13X9 baking pan and press down using a spatuala.
Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the beef mixture.
Blend together the baking mix, garlic, milk and eggs until smooth.  Pour over the Batter in stripes over beef mix in pan and blend with a spoon so the dish is covered with the batter.
Bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes or golden brown.  This dish cuts great and serves 8-10 people.
Any flavor of cheese can be used but I prefer the mozzerala for the melting quality.
