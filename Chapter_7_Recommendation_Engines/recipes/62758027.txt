Ingredients:
2	tablespoons  white vinegar
1	teaspoon  salt
12	large  eggs
6	English muffins , split
12	slices  Canadian bacon  (see note)
1	recipe   Foolproof Hollandaise  (see related recipe)

Directions:
1. POACH EGGS Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat broiler. Fill large skillet nearly to rim with water. Add vinegar and salt and bring to boil over high heat. Following photos at left, crack 3 eggs each into 4 teacups and carefully pour eggs into skillet. Cover pan, remove from heat, and poach eggs until whites are set but yolks are still slightly runny, 5 to 7 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer eggs to paper towel-lined plate.
2. TOAST MUFFINS While eggs are poaching, arrange English muffins, split side-up, on baking sheet and broil until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Place 1 slice bacon on each English muffin and broil until beginning to brown, about 1 minute.
3. SAUCE AND SERVE Arrange 1 poached egg on top of each English muffin. Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons hollandaise over each egg. Serve, passing remaining hollandaise at table.

Description: 
The test kitchenâ€™s favorite Canadian bacon is Applegate Farms. If you like, you can toast the English muffins and warm the bacon 20 minutes in advance. Reheat them in a 200-degree oven just before serving.
