Ingredients:
Serves 4
1 cup yellow split peas, soaked in cold water for 1 hour
1 large tomato (about 8 ounces), cut into 8 wedges
1/4 cup canola oil
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 medium red onion, finely chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)
5 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon coriander seeds, finely ground
3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon cayenne (I used 1/4, thought it was plenty, although I may be a wuss.)
1/4 cup minced cilantro leaves (I abhor cilantro, and always replace it with flat-leaf parsley.)
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Drain dal and place in a large saucepan. Add tomato and 3C of water and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook until peas are tender, 45m-1h. Pick out tomato skins and whisk dal to emulsify. Keep warm over very low heat.
Heat the oil in a med skillet over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke, add cumin seeds, covering pan. After the seeds stop sputtering, add the onion and saute over medium heat. 3 minutes later, add garlic and saute until most of the onion has turned dark brown, about 5 minutes. Add the coriander, turmeric and cayenne, stir and pour mixture over the dal. Add the cilantro, butter and salt to the dal and simmer for another 5 minutes. Serve hot.
