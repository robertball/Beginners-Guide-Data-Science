Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
2/3 cup whipped cream cheese, divided
5 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 1/4 teaspoons granulated sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (16.5 ounce) package NESTLE® TOLL HOUSE® Refrigerated Chocolate Chip Cookie Bar Dough
1 2/3 cups peeled, chopped banana, divided
1/3 cup sweetened dried cranberries, divided
5 teaspoons chopped dry-roasted peanuts, divided
1/3 cup NESTLE® TOLL HOUSE® Premier White Morsels
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray three baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray.
Spread 2 tablespoons cream cheese to edge of tortilla. Combine sugar and cinnamon in small bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of mixture over cream cheese. Cut bar of cookie dough into five sections. One at a time, cut each section into 16 pieces. Arrange dough pieces 1 inch apart over top of tortilla, leaving a 1-inch border around edge. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup banana, 1 tablespoon cranberries and 1 teaspoon peanuts. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Arrange two tortillas diagonally on a baking sheet.
Bake for 17 to 19 minutes or until edges begin to brown. Cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.
Place morsels and peanut butter in small, heavy-duty plastic bag. Microwave on Medium-High (70%) power for 30 seconds; knead. Microwave at additional 10- to 15-second intervals, kneading until smooth. Cut tiny corner from bag; squeeze to drizzle over pizzas. Cool completely. Cut pizzas into wedges using pizza cutter or sharp knife.
