24 potato rounds, thawed and mashed slightly
1 large tomato, diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
2 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese
1/2 cup picante sauce
1/2 tablespoon chili powder
1 pinch cayenne pepper
12 (8 inch) flour tortillas
For the Mojito Vinaigrette: 1/2 cup vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup lime juice (about 6 limes)
2 tablespoons honey
20 large fresh mint leaves, chopped

Directions:
For the Black Bean Cigars: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/54235/black-bean-cigars/?internalSource=hub%20recipe&referringContentType=search%20results&clickId=cardslot%201
Whip up the Mojito Vinaigrette while the cigars are baking by combining all of the ingredients in a jar with a tight fitting lid. Shake well and refrigerate until ready to use.
Make up your salad with whatever you like in your salads. For the side of fruit I used chopped mango but again, use whatever fruit you like.
