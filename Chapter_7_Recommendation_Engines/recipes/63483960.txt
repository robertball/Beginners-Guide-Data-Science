Ingredients:
2 pounds butternut squash, halved, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 1/2 cups diced onion (saute in butter)
2 carrots, peeled and diced
3 (13 3/4-ounce) cans chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper, nutmeg
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup light cream or heavy cream
Sour cream, for garnish

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine squash, onion, carrots, broth and salt. Simmer, uncovered, until squash is very tender, about 40 minutes. Puree soup in a blender or food processor with the butter. Whisk cream into soup. Serve in wide, shallow bowls with a dollop of sour cream, if desired.
This freezes, without the cream, beautifully, and once thawed and reheated, that's when you add the cream.
