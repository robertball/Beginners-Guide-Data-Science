Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) tilapia fillets
1 teaspoon Diamond CrystalÂ® Kosher Salt

Directions:
Lightly salt one side of each tilapia filets with Diamond Crystal(R) Kosher Salt. Rub Cajun seasoning on both sides of the filets.
Heat oil over medium-high heat in a skillet.
When the oil is hot, carefully place filets in the skillet. Fry each side until richly browned and fish flakes easily, 3 to 4 minutes.
