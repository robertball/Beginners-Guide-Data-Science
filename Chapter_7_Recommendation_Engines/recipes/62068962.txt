Ingredients:
2 plaintains peeled and chopped
1/4 cup of bread crumbs
1/4 cup of corn meal
1 clove of garlic
1 TB of oregano
1 1/2 TB of paprika
1/4 cup of shitaki mushrooms
1/4 cup of black olives
1/2 cup of spinach
3 TB butter

Directions:
Take all these ingedrients and put them in a food processor and and process until they are a molding texture. If it's soupy (for any reason) add more cread crumbs or cornmeal. TB as a time. IT shouldn't be. once it's a nice texture (like that of patty hamburger meat) stop processing and mold into patties and fry up in the frying pan. Add salt pepper as you like and dress your burger as you like or pita.
