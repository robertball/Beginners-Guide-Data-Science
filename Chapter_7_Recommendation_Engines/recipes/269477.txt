Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 package taco seasoning mix
1/4 cup water
1 (28 ounce) can mild enchilada sauce
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained (optional)
8 tortillas, cut into 2-inch strips
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add taco seasoning and water; cook and stir until meat is coated, about 5 minutes more. Add enchilada sauce, refried beans, and corn; stir to combine.
Place a layer of tortilla strips in the bottom of a baking dish. Top with a layer of meat mixture, more tortilla strips, and Mexican cheese; repeat layers as necessary. End with a layer of Mexican cheese.
Bake in the oven until cheese is melted and golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
