Description: 
This recipe is lightly fried prawns in a hot and spicy sauce. Garnish with lemon wedges, sesame seeds, and cilantro. You can add more hot sauce if you want it spicier. If you can't find these ingredients at your local grocery store, I can assure you that you can find them at a Chinese or Indian grocery store!
