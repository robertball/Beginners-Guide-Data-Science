Ingredients:
2 zucchini, sliced
2 green bell peppers, cut in 1-inch pieces
2 carrots, thinly sliced
16 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
1 onion, diced
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 clove garlic, pressed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
9 whole grain lasagna noodles
2 (28 ounce) jars pasta sauce
1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a ziploc bag, shake together oil, basil, garlic and salt and pepper to taste along with all vegetables.  Arrange on a baking sheet.  Bake in preheated oven until vegetables are lightly browned and tender, 10 to 25 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Mix mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese in a bowl or bag.
In a 9x13 baking dish, spread about 1/3 cup pasta sauce in the bottom. Layer 3 lasagna noodles over sauce. Spread about of 1/2 of the roasted vegetables over noodles and top with about 1/3 of the sauce. Sprinkle 1/3 of the mozzarella-Parmesan cheese mixture over the sauce. Layer noodles, vegetables, sauce and cheese one more time.  Top with remaining noodles, sauce and cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow lasagna to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
