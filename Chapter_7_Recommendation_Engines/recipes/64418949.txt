Ingredients:
1/2 cup ranch dressing
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided
1-1/4 cups shredded cooked chicken
1-1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 cup canned black beans, rinsed & mashed
1 cup frozen corn
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped sweet pepper
1 tsp. ground cumin
8 flour tortillas (8 inch), warmed
1 egg, beaten
2 Tbsp. oil

Directions:
Heat oven to 400Â°F.
Mix dressing and 1/4 cup cilantro. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Mix remaining cilantro, chicken, cheese, beans, onion, corn, peppers and cumin; mix lightly.
Spoon chicken mixture down centers of tortillas. Fold in opposite sides of each tortilla, then roll up, starting at bottom edge. Brush top edge with egg; press into egg roll to seal. Place, seam-sides down, on baking sheet; brush with oil.
Bake 20 min. or until golden brown. Cut each diagonally into thirds. Serve with dressing mixture.

Description: 
This recipe leaves lots of options for you, depending on what your personal tastes are or what you have on hand such as adding spinach or switching the chicken for browned ground beef or even chorizo. I will sometimes leave them uncut and serve with Mexican rice for a full meal.
