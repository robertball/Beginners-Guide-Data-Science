Ingredients:
2 pounds ground turkey
1 3/4 cups skim milk, or more as needed
4 eggs, beaten
2 fresh jalapeno peppers, diced
2 fresh serrano peppers, diced
1 large carrot, shredded
1/2 large yellow onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup snipped fresh chives
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried sage
5 slices whole grain bread, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix together ground turkey, milk, eggs, jalapeno peppers, serrano peppers, carrot, onion, chives, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, salt, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, mustard powder, black pepper, and sage in a large bowl.
Place 5 slices bread in the bowl of a food processor; pulse for a few seconds at a time until bread is ground into crumbs. Add bread crumbs to turkey mixture. Rake a fork across the surface of the mixture. When the surface barely retains the fork impression, the consistency is correct. Add more bread crumbs if mixture is too moist; add more milk if mixture is too dry.
Form turkey mixture into a loaf shape and place in a large cast-iron skillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This moist and versatile meatloaf is packed with flavor. I make it with hot peppers to add a spicy layer that complements but doesn't overpower. For mild taste preferences, substitute green bell pepper for the hot peppers.
