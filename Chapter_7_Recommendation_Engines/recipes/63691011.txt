Ingredients:
1 Package 'Whonu' Oreo Cookies, crushed
1 (8 0z) Package Low Fat Cream Cheese, Softened
1 (12 oz) Container Fat Free Whipped Cream
1 Large Box of Fat Free Vanilla Pudding
3 1/2 cups 1% Milk
1 Cup Powdered Sugar
1 Tbsp Vanilla Extract
1/2 Cup Mixed Nuts, chopped or crushed. (optional)
Gummi Worms/Decorations to Preference

Directions:
* In a large bowl mix pudding, whipped cream, softened cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and milk with a whisk. Blend until smooth.
* Either with a muddler, potato smasher, or food processor crush Whonu oreos until fine. If desired and necessary crush nuts within the cookies (adds some protein and a salty flavor that compliments the sweet cookies).
* In serving dish of choice, layer pudding and cookie mixes so that cookies make up the top and bottom layer. Cool in refrigerator for 2 hours, and serve cool.

Description: 
I made this for a family Christmas dinner and everybody loved it, and they were shocked to hear (except for the powdered sugar) there was relatively little sugar or fat in it, and that it is packed with vitamins and nutrients! Unless the nuts are added to give a salty complimentary flavor, it tastes just your regular dirt cake. It still has some sugar and calories but it's far healthier than any dirt cake recipe I've come across before.
