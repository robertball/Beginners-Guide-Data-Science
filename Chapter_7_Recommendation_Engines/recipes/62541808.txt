Ingredients:
Crust
1/3 cup butter, room temperature
1/4 cup sugar
2 large egg yolks
1 cup all purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
1 large egg white
Walnut Filling
2 cups walnut halves or coarsely chopped walnuts
2/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 tsp salt
2 tsp orange zest
2 tsp lemon zest
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F.
Make the crust. In a medium bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light. Beat in egg yolks, followed by the all purpose flour and salt. Continue to mix at medium-low speed. Dough should start to come together but still be slightly crumbly.
Turn dough out into a 9-inch tart pan and press into an even layer and up the sides.
Bake for 12 minutes, until crust starts to turn a light golden brown at the edges.
Lightly beat egg white. Brush a layer egg white onto crust with a pastry brush. Return to oven and bake for 3-4 additional minutes.
Cool crust for about 30 minutes before filling.
Spread walnuts in an even layer on the bottom of the prepared tart crust.
In a medium sauce pan, combine brown sugar, butter, maple syrup, salt, lemon zest and orange zest. Cook over medium heat until mixture just comes to a boil. Cook for 2 minutes, then remove from heat and stir vanilla extract.
Pour syrup evenly over walnuts.
Bake for 10-12 minutes, until filling is slightly bubbly.
Cool completely before serving.
