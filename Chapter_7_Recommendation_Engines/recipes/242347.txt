Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 large egg
2 tablespoons grated onion
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, onion, black pepper, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl; form into small balls. Arrange balls on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip meatballs and continue baking until cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
