Ingredients:
2 Tbsp butter or margarine
2-3 small shallots, finely chopped
6 Tbsp lemon juice
3 Tbsp Dijon mustard
1 container (3/4 oz) Fresh Dill (no substitute)
4 Salmon Stakes, about 6-8 oz each

Directions:
1.  Heat butter in small saucepan and saute shallot until tender, but not browned.
2.  Add lemon juice, mustard, dill, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, stirring.
3.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place salmon steaks in a buttered shallow baking dish or in individual au gratin dishes.
4.  Pour sauce over the steaks and bake for 25 minutes or until fish is opaque and flakes easily.
I would not make this dish unless I had fresh dill.

Description: 
I found the original recipe about 15 years ago, and have modified it over time.  After playing with the recipe, I belive I have finally perfected it.  I featured this recipe on a local cooking show, Mass Appeal.  This is a must try recipe, especially for Salmon lovers. NOTE:  I would NOT make this recipe unless I had fresh dill.
