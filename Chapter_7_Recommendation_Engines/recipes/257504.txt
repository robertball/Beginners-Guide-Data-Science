Ingredients:
Â¼ cup butter
4  white onions, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 cups dry white wine (such as Chardonnay)
8 quarts heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons saffron
1 pinch kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a very large pot over medium heat. Add onions and garlic; cook and stir until softened and browned, about 20 minutes. Pour in white wine; simmer until reduced by half, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir heavy cream into the saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Stir in saffron. Season sauce lightly with salt and pepper.
Refrigerate sauce until cool and thick, about 1 hour. Spoon into ice cube trays and freeze until solid.

Description: 
This is a base sauce for other recipes and can be modified to fit almost any white sauce recipe. It is a sauce you can freeze and use at a later time. It thickens into a paste as it cools; use only a tablespoon or two per meal that you are making. I use this sauce as a base for my shrimp diablo.
