Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute chicken strips and onion until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes. Drain off as much liquid as possible.
Stir in the chicken broth, and simmer for 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and let simmer for a few minutes before stirring in the sugar, soy sauce, mirin, and salt. Simmer for 3 more minutes. Sprinkle in half of the green onions, stirring gently. Pour beaten eggs over the chicken mixture, and simmer until the eggs are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Serve over Japanese sticky rice.
