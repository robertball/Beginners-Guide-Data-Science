1 pound ground beef

1/2 cup cold water
3 medium tomatoes, thinly sliced
1 medium green pepper, chopped
2 large onions, chopped
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 cup sour cream
2/3 cup mayonnaise

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain.
Meanwhile in a large bowl, combine the biscuit mix and water until a soft dough forms. Spread into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Layer with the beef, tomatoes and green pepper.
In a large bowl, combine the onions, 1/2 cup cheese, sour cream and mayonnaise; spread over top. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until edges are browned. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake 5 minutes longer or until the cheese is melted.

Description: 
When tomatoes and green pepper are plentiful in my garden, I slice the tomatoes and chop the peppers, then freeze them on baking sheets. When they're frozen, I put them in heavy-duty bags and store for later use in this casserole.--Karen Owen, Rising Sun, Indiana
