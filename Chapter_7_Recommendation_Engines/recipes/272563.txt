Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup kasha (toasted buckwheat groats)
2 carrots, grated
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, or to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring water and kasha to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, without stirring, until kasha groats are soft and fully open, about 15 minutes. Let cool.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Stir carrots, parsley, olive oil, basil, thyme, oregano, paprika, mustard, and cayenne pepper into the kasha. Form mixture into patties and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned on the outside, about 30 minutes.
