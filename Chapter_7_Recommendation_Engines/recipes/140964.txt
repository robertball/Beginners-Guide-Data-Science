Ingredients:
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1/2 sweet onion, finely chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
3 tablespoons red Thai curry paste
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
12 ounces monkfish, cut into cubes
1 tablespoon fish sauce
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Heat peanut oil in a large sauce pan over medium heat. Stir in chopped onion, and cook until softened and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add red bell pepper and continue to cook for 3 to 5 more minutes, until softened. Stir in the curry paste and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the coconut milk and slowly bring to a simmer.
Once coconut milk begins to simmer, stir in cubed monkfish, and simmer 7 to 10 minutes, or until the fish is firm and the center is no longer opaque. Stir in fish sauce, lime juice, and cilantro before serving.
