Ingredients:
water (for sautéing the veggies)
1 10oz bag frozen sweet potatoes (chopped)
1/2 10oz bag frozen red bell peppers (chopped)
1 large onion (chopped)
4 garlic cloves (minced or chopped)
1 package of extra firm tofu
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
2 large handfuls of greens (I used a packaged power greens mix but any would work)
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp cinnamon
chipotle powder (to taste)
pink Himalayan salt (to taste)

Directions:
Water sauté sweet potatoes in a large skillet until they start to get soft.
Add onion and garlic and cook until the onions start to become translucent.
Add the red bell peppers and cook until most of the water is gone.
Drain your tofu and crumble in a bowl using a fork, add to pan.
Then add the nutritional yeast, cumin, cinnamon, chipotle powder, and pink Himalayan salt.  Lower the heat and stir until all spices are mixed evenly.
Lastly add your greens and stir until they wilt and mix with your scramble.
