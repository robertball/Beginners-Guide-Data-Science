Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups lard
10 tablespoons ice water
2 pounds top round steak, cut into 1/4 inch cubes
5 red potatoes, peeled and chopped
3 turnips, peeled and cubed
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon salt

Directions:
Place the flour, 2 teaspoons of salt, and the lard in a bowl. Quickly rub the lard into the flour with your fingertips until it resembles small peas.  Pour in the ice water, and form into a ball.  Add more water if it feels too dry.  Divide the dough into 6 balls, and wrap in plastic.  Chill one hour.
In a bowl, combine the meat, turnips, potatoes, onions, remaining 1 tablespoon salt, and pepper.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
Roll out one of the balls on a floured surface to about 1/4 inch thick.  Using a cake pan, trace a 9 inch circle in the dough; cut out the circle.  Place about 1 1/2 cups of the meat mixture into the middle of the circle.  Fold the edges of the circle up to meet along the top of the meat filling, and crimp the dough along the top to seal.  Repeat until all dough is used up.  With a spatula, transfer the pasties  to an ungreased sheet.
Bake the pasties for 45 minutes, or until golden.  Serve hot or at room temperature.

Description: 
Coal miners in the Midwest would take these for their lunch. They keep warm rather long wrapped in a towel. Some housewives would stuff one end with a savory filling, and the other with a sweet one. That way you could have your dessert with your dinner! For a true coal miner meal experience, be sure to roughly chop the potatoes.
