Ingredients:
1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp minced gingerroot
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 large carrots, thinly sliced
1 sweet green pepper, thinly sliced
2 cups thinly sliced mushrooms
¼ tsp pepper
2 cups bean sprouts, rinsed
2 green onions, thinly sliced
Sauce:
½ cup chicken stock
2 Tbsp soy sauce
1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar
2 tsp cornstarch
2 tsp sesame oil

Directions:
Cut chicken across the grain into thin strips. In wok or large deep skillet, heat half of the oil over high heat; stir-fry chicken, in 2 batches, until no longer pink inside, about 4 minutes. Set aside on plate.
Add remaining oil to wok; stir-fry ginger and garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add carrots, green pepper, mushrooms and pepper; stir-fry for 1 minute. Add ¼ cup water; cover and steam until vegetables are tender-crisp, about 4 minutes.
Sauce: Meanwhile in bowl, whisk together chicken stock, soy sauce, vinegar, cornstarch, sesame oil and hot pepper sauce; pour into center of wok and boil stirring, until thickened, about 2 minutes.
Return chicken to pan; stir-fry until sauce is thickened and glossy. Spread bean sprouts all over platter; top with chicken mixture. Sprinkle with green onions.
