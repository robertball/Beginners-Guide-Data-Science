Ingredients:
Styrofoam ball
Double sided tape
Tooth picks
Mini cupcakes of your choice
Decorator icing
Green tissue paper
Green fondant leaves(optional..tissue paper works also)
Pot or bowl
Ribbon

Directions:
Line the bowl with tissue paper allowing some come out the sides.
Wrap the styrofoam ball with green tisse paper.
Tape the ball to the bottom of the pot.
Once your un-iced cupcake of choice has cooled start placing tooth picks at the bottom of the ball close to the bowl.
Place cupcake on tooth pick (you may want to use two tooth picks or double sided tape so the cupcake does not slide off).
Place cupcakes on tooth picks on the bottom row first and continue working your way around the ball until you reach the top.
Once all the cupcakes are on the ball ice them starting at the bottom working your way up(Use a large star tip for best results).
Cut tissue paper into leaf shapes or use green fondant leaves and place them into any holes to fill in the spaces between the cupcakes.
Tie ribbon around top pot or bowl if desired.
