Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/3 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
8 ounces candy canes or hard peppermint candies, finely crushed
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped into chip-size bits*

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicon baking mat or lightly butter sheet.
Combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk to combine.
Combine butter and sugars in a medium bowl, cream together until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides of bowl, add egg and vanilla; beat to combine.
With mixer on low, spoon in dry ingredients; mix to combine. Add crushed candy and chocolate bits; mix until evenly incorporated.
Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place 3 inch apart on baking sheet and flatten slightly. Bake 10 to 12 minutes.
Remove sheet from oven and immediately use a metal spatula to neaten any edges where a piece of candy may have melted out. Let cookies cool for about 5 minutes on sheet. Transfer to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.
