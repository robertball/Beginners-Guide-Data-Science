Description: 
A non-alcoholic, holiday version of the Moscow mule. It uses a cranberry shrub instead of lime and a splash of club soda instead of vodka. It's a perfect combination for an aperitivo or snack. If possible, serve with savory macarons as a garnish; thread each macaron onto a skewer, put two in each glass, and serve immediately.
