Ingredients:
4 		salmon fillets, about 6 oz (180 g) each
1 tsp 		vegetable or olive oil
2 tsp 		finely grated lemon peel
1/2 cup 	finely chopped fresh dill
4 thin 	green onions, thinly sliced
as needed     fresh lemon wedges and sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425F. Line a baking sheet with foil. Place fillets, skin-side down, on foil. Coat with oil and lightly sprinkle with salt. Stir peel with dill and onions. Make a slit along length of salmon, forming a pocket 3/4 inch deep. Leave about 1 inch uncut at each end. Stuff about three-quarters of dill mixture into pockets, letting a little spill out. Place a piece of foil loosely over top. Bake in center of 425F oven for 15 minutes. Insert knife tip into center of salmon. If tip feels warm, it's done. Remove salmon to plates, leaving skin on foil. Sprinkle with remaining dill mixture. Serve with lemon wedges and lots of sour cream.
