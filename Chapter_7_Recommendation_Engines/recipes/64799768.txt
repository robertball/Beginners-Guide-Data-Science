Ingredients:
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1/4 cup minced yellow onion
1/4 cup minced carrot
1/4 cup minced celery
2 tbsp black sesame seeds
1/4 cup chopped raw peanuts
1 bay leaf
Salt, to taste
1 (300 grams) box attieke (cassava couscous)
1 cup water
2 tbsp cilantro, chopped

Directions:
In an large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Saut√© the onion, carrot, and celery until fragrant. Add the black sesame seeds, peanuts, bay leaf, and salt stirring often. When the vegetables are tender and the  seeds and peanuts have toasted, add the attieke, stirring constantly. Pour the water over the entire pan distributing evenly over the whole pan. Cover and reduce the heat to medium allowing the couscous to steam for about 5 minutes or until the couscous is moist and heated all the way through.
Remove the cover and, using a spatula, fold the couscous. Do not stir, as this will mash the couscous, just use a folding maneuver to mix the ingredients from the bottom upwards and let the couscous breathe to help the water evaporate.
Top with chopped cilantro.
Notes:Boxed attieke can be found in African grocery stores or online.
Fresh or frozen attieke can also be used in this recipe, but cooking time should be reduced by 10 minutes.

Description: 
Originally from the Ivory Coast, fermented cassava couscous, or attieke, is a tangy alternative to wheat couscous. It has a slightly sour taste that goes well with your favorite savory and spicy dishes. My version is mildly spiced so it goes well with any of your favorite dishes. It is a gluten free way to enjoy couscous.
