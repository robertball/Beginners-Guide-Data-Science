Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
Wet Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups milk
1 ripe banana, mashed
1/3 cup smooth peanut butter
1 egg
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat a griddle to medium heat.
Whisk flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Combine milk, banana, peanut butter, egg, canola oil, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl; pour into the flour mixture and whisk together until thoroughly mixed.
Ladle batter in 1/4 cup portions onto hot griddle. Cook until tiny air bubbles form on top, 2 to 5 minutes; flip and continue cooking until the bottoms are browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Keep finished pancakes warm.

Description: 
I have a common pancake recipe that I modify from time to time. This one tastes fantastic with warm maple or strawberry syrup. I freeze leftover pancakes and reheat in the toaster, spreading them with strawberry or raspberry jam. Yum!
