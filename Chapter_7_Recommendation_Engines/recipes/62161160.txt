Ingredients:
1 or 2 9" pie crusts (pillsbury)
1 box Jones' golden brown breakfast sausage links (partially thawed & sliced)
3 eggs
2 10oz pkgs frozen chopped spinach, thawed & pressed well to drain
1/2 lb mozzerella
2/3 cup ricotta cheese (I use part skim)
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1/2 tsp garlic powder
pinch of nutmeg

Directions:
Pre heat oven to 375F
In a medium bowl, combine sliced sausage, eggs, thawed & drained spinach, mozzerella, ricotta, salt & pepper, garlic powder, and nutmeg. Mix well.
Scoop out spinach mixture into a prepared 9" pie crust. Place a top crust (if desired) on pie and seal edges w/ fork or pinch w/ fingers. Make three 2" slits in top of crust w/ knife. You may need to cover the pie crust edges w/ aluminum foil to prevent over browning.
Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 min. Allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.

This spinach pie is my mother-in- law's recipe and it's so good! I'm not a spinach person, but I love this! Mild, not overpowering, and tastey!
