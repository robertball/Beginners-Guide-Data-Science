Ingredients:
2 cups ketchup
1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
6 to 8 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 3 to 4 lemons)
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
2 tablespoons molasses
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1-1/2 teaspoons liquid smoke
2 teaspoons dry mustard
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
1. Combine the ketchup, brown sugar, lemon juice and zest, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, mustard, onion powder, and pepper in a nonreactive saucepan and whisk to mix. Let the sauce gradually come to a simmer over medium heat and simmer until thick and flavorful, 8 to 10 minutes.
2. If not serving the sauce immediately, let cool to room temperature. Transfer to clean glass jars and refrigerate until serving; the sauce will keep for several weeks. Bring to room temperature before using.
