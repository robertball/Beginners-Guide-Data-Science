Ingredients:
8 ounces whole grain spaghetti
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 cups cremini mushrooms, quartered
1 large yellow squash, halved and sliced
1/4 red onion, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup oil, garlic, Dijon mustard, and pepper in a small bowl. Set sauce aside.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, squash, and onion. Cook for 3 minutes; stir in balsamic sauce mixture. Continue cooking until vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes more, adding parsley during the last minute of cooking. Drain cooked pasta, add to the pan, and toss to coat with sauce. Serve hot.
