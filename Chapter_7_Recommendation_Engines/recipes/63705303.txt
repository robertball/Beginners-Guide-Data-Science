Ingredients:
1 cup parmesan cheese, grated
2 tsp. garlic powder
2 (11 oz.) tubes refrigerated breadsticks
24 thin sliced bacon strips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In a shallow dish, mix together the parmesan cheese and garlic powder. Set aside.
Separate breadsticks and wind a strip of bacon around each, tucking bacon ends under; place on prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. While the breadsticks are still warm, roll in the cheese mixture.
Great as an appetizer or to serve with a salad.
