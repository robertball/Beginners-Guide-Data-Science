Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 (6 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 1/2 tablespoons jerk seasoning, divided
2 cups penne pasta
1 cup water
3/4 cup whipping cream, or more as needed
1 teaspoon garlic base (such as Better Than Bouillon® Roasted Garlic Base)
1 1/2 cups finely shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. When hot, add butter, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and onion. Cook until softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, slice each chicken breast horizontally creating two thin fillets. Cut each fillet into diagonal strips and sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons jerk seasoning. Add to Instant Pot(R) and cook for 5 minutes. Cancel Saute function. Mix in penne, water, whipping cream, and garlic base.
Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir in remaining jerk seasoning and Parmesan cheese until well combined. Add more cream if you like, up to 1/4 cup.
