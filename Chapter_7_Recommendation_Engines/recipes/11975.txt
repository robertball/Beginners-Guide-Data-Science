Ingredients:
1 pound linguini pasta
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 small zucchini, thinly sliced
1 yellow squash, thinly sliced
2 carrots, sliced thin
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1/2 onion, sliced
1 tablespoon salt-free herb and spice blend
4 cloves crushed garlic
1/4 cup white wine
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
In a large pot with boiling salted water cook linguini pasta until al dente. Drain well.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet heat olive oil and add thinly sliced zucchini, squash, carrots, red bell pepper, onions, salt-free spice blend, and minced garlic. Cook on medium-high for five minutes, stirring frequently. Add white wine and lemon juice and continue cooking until vegetables are crisp-tender and liquid has reduced, about 5 to 10 minutes.
Toss cooked and drained pasta with sauteed vegetables and serve.
