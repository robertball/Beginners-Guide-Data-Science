Ingredients:
3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
6 uncooked lasagna noodles
1 cup chicken broth
1 (8 ounce) package low fat cream cheese, softened
1 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
26 ounces Kroger Marinara
2 portabello mushrooms

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain, rinse with cold water, and set aside.
Meanwhile, place the chicken in a saucepan with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes, or until no longer pink and juices run clear. Remove from saucepan,  and shred.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix the chicken with the chicken broth, cream cheese, and 1 cup mozzarella cheese.
Spread 1/3 of pasta sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with the chicken mixture, mushrooms and top with 3 lasagna noodles; repeat. Top with remaining sauce, and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese.
Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven.
