Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package wide egg noodles
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup apricot nectar
1 cup milk
1/2 cup golden raisins (optional)
1 1/2 cups cornflake crumbs
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9 inch baking pan.
Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in egg noodles, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In a medium bowl, thoroughly mix egg noodles with 1/4 cup butter, cream cheese, eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, and vanilla. Stir in apricot nectar and milk. Mix in raisins. Transfer to the prepared baking pan.
In a separate medium bowl, mix cornflake crumbs, 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar, remaining vanilla, and cinnamon. Spread over the egg noodle mixture.
Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned.

Description: 
This is an old family recipe that I recently entered in the 2001 Ventura County Fair and won 'Honorable Mention' for in the Pudding Division. There was no category for Kugel, but the judges loved it and still wanted to honor me with a ribbon! Hope you enjoy it as well.
