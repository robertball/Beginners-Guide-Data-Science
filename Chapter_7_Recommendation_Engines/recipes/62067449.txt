Ingredients:
3 Pork Chops
1 cup Pepsi
2/3 cup ketchup
1/3 cup Catalina dressing
1 tbsp. A-1 steak sauce (HP sauce for my Canadian friends)
3-4 tbls. brown sugar
1 tsp. garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
mix Pepsi, ketchup, Catalina, steak
sauce and brown sugar in mixing bowl. Sprinkle chops on both sides with garlic powder and salt and pepper. Place in baking dish and pour mixture over chops. Allow to marinate in fridge for 1/2 hour to and hour. Bake in oven for 1 hour at 350 degrees or until internal temp of chops reaches 160 degrees. For another twist, instead of marinating, use a slow cooker instead and pour mixture over chops and cook on low heat for 6 to 8 hours. They will fall off the bone!!!
