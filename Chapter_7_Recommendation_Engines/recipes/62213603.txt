Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs ground beef
1 egg slightly beaten
1/2 cup of bread crumbs (plain or seasoned)
1 8oz can of pizza sauce
1/4 tsp. salt
3/4 tsp. Italian Seasoning
1/2 tsp. Ground Oregano
1/4 tsp. Pepper
2 cups of Mozzarella Cheese (divided)

Directions:
Combine the ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, 1/4 cup of the pizza sauce, salt, Italian Seasoning, oregano,and pepper in a large mixing bowl.  Mix well.  Shape meat into a 10x12 (approx) rectangle on a piece of wax paper.  Sprinkle 1 1/2 cups of cheese over meat. Roll meat and cheese up and seal edges (similar to how you make pumpkin roll).  Bake like a regular meat loaf.  Using a loaf pan bake at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes to one hour depending on your oven.  Pour rest of the remaining sauce onto the meat loaf 10 mintues before it is done and top with remaining cheese 5 mintues before done.  Let rest a few mintues before serving.

A dear friend gave this recipe to me 25 years ago at my wedding shower. It is something I've made many times over the years and is a wonderful take on an the regular stand-by meatloaf
