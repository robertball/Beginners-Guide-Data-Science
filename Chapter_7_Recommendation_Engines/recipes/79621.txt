Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs, separated
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups chopped walnuts
1 (12 fluid ounce) can ready-to-spread vanilla frosting
1 cup candy-coated chocolate peanuts

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together butter and sugar until creamy and smooth. Stir in the egg yolks and vanilla. In a separate bowl, mix together flour and salt; then slowly blend with creamy mixture. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll out dough into 1 inch balls. Dip balls into slightly beaten egg whites, then roll in chopped walnuts. Place balls 1 inch apart onto baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes. Remove from oven, and press thumb gently into the center of each cookie. Return to oven, and bake 5 minutes more. Remove cookies to wire racks to cool. Fill top of each cookie with frosting, and top with a chocolate-coated peanut.
