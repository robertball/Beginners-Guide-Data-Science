Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1 cup sliced carrots
1 cup frozen green peas
1/2 cup sliced celery
2 small potatoes, peeled & cubed
1/3 cup butter
1/2 cup sliced yellow onion
1 lg garlic clove, minced
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 tsp garlic salt
2 cups + 6 cups chicken broth
1 cup milk
1 egg
2 (9 inch)  unbaked deep pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
In a saucepan, combine chicken, carrots, peas, potatoes and celery. Add 4 cups chicken broth (or enough to cover meat and vegetables) and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain and set aside.
Put bottom pie crust in oven for 6 minutes.
In the saucepan over medium heat, cook onions and garlic in butter until soft and translucent. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and garlic salt.  Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
Beat egg slightly then brush bottom and top crust with egg.
Place the chicken mixture in bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away any excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
