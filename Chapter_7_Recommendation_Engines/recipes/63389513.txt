Ingredients:
1/3 lb ground beef
salt and pepper to taste
24 wonton wrappers ( or substitute & cut cooked  lasagna noodles, pot stickers, zucchini peeled into strips)
1 3/4 cups grated Parmesan cheese (7 oz)
1 3/4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (7 oz)
3/4 cup ricotta cheese (3 oz)
1 cup pasta sauce
(optional) basil for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spray muffin tin with cooking spray.
Brown beef, and season with salt and pepper. Drain.
Cut wonton wrappers into circle shapes (about 2 1/4- inches) using a biscuit cutter or using the top of a drinking glass. You can cut several at a time. Note: For a more rustic look, no cutting necessary!
Reserve 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese and 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese for the top of your cupcakes.
Start layering your lasagna cupcakes. Begin with a wonton wrapper and press it into the bottom of each muffin tin. Sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese, ricotta cheese, and mozzarella cheese in each. Top with a little meat and pasta sauce.
Repeat layers again (i.e. wonton, Parmesan, ricotta, mozzarella, and pasta sauce). Top with reserved Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses.
Bake for 18-20 minutes or until edges are brown. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes. To remove, use a knife to loosen the edges then pop each lasagna out.
Garnish with basil and ENJOY!!!.

Description: 
Usually lasagna looks like a big mess, but we all love the taste! My boys' favorite, easy to freeze and reheat for a quick meal, or for company it looks elegant. Wonton wrappers are used in this lasagna. Keep in mind you can make different versions, i.e. vegetarian, seafood & alfredo, low carb w/ zucchini strips, or gluten free noodles. Enjoy!
