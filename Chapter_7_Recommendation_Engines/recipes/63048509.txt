Ingredients:
1 pound bacon, cut into ½ inch dice
2 cups onion, cut into ½ inch dice
2 cups potatoes, peeled, cut into ½ inch dice
2 cups turnips, peeled, cut into ½ inch dice
4-6 sprigs thyme or 1 bay leaf
1 cup greens, torn (any kind, I used kale)
1 cup cream
salt and pepper

Directions:
In a large sauce pan over medium heat, add bacon. Cover and cook slowly until fat renders, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat.
Return pan to medium heat, add onion and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes. Do not brown.
Add potatoes and turnips to cook, stirring for 2 minutes. Add thyme, enough water to cover, bring to a boil, and reduce. Cook at brisk simmer for 15-20 minutes until tender.
Meanwhile, cook torn greens in butter or some of the bacon fat over high heat until wilted. Reduce and cook over medium-low heat for 1-2 minutes. Add greens to soup and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Add cream, salt, and pepper. Remove bay leaf or thyme and serve.
