Ingredients:
1 ½ cups buttermilk
1 ½ tablespoons butter, melted
2 tablespoons white sugar
¾ teaspoon salt
3 cups all-purpose flour
⅓ cup whole wheat flour
1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
Place all ingredients into a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the Basic White Bread setting, then press Start. If the ingredients do not form a ball after a few minutes, add a splash more buttermilk, or a handful of flour if it is too loose.

Description: 
A very soft bread. I love how it smells right when it comes out of the bread machine.
