Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup powdered milk
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons soy flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups water
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, powdered milk, sugar, soy flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl to make the batter.
Combine 2 cups batter, water, and 2 tablespoons oil in a bowl. Add more or less water to reach your desired batter thickness. Mix well.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
This is a pancake mix that you can prepare ahead and store in an airtight container for months. When you're ready for hot pancakes, just add oil and water to cook, like store-bought pancake mixes, but healthier. Double or triple the recipe so you have extra on hand.
