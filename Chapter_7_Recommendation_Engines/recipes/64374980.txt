Ingredients:
1/2 cup gluten free flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
pinch salt
1 very ripe banana
3 Tbsp brown sugar
1 Tbsp applesauce
1 small flax egg
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
4 Tbsp whole walnuts for topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and lightly butter two small ramekins with non-dairy butter. Prepare flax egg and set aside.
In a large bowl, mash the banana, leaving some texture.
Add brown sugar, baking soda, salt and whisk for one minute.
Stir in flax egg, vanilla, applesauce and stir.
Add flour and stir with a spoon or spatula until just combined.
Divide batter evenly into the two ramekins - about 1/2 to 3/4 full - and generously top with walnuts.
Bake for 25-30 minutes or until tops are golden brown and a toothpick or knife comes out clean. Let cool for a few minutes, remove from ramekins and serve warm. Additional butter isnâ€™t necessary - these are very moist and quite perfect as is.
