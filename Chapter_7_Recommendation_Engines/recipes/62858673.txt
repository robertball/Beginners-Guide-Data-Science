Ingredients:
Crepes
4 eggs
1/4 tsp. salt
2 cups all purpose flour
2 1/4 cups milk
1/4 cup melted butter
Filling
1 10-oz. Pkg. frozen spinach, cooked & drained
1/4 cup butter
3 Tbsp. flour
1 cup milk
1/2 tsp.salt
1/8 tsp. pepper
1/8 tsp. nutmeg
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1 4-oz. can mushroom pieces
1 tsp. grated onion
Parmesan Cheese

Directions:
Crepes:
Blend all ingredients for 1 minute and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight (covered).  I use a crepe maker but you can make the crepes in a non-stick skillet.  Pour about 1/4 cup in skillet & spread evenly over bottom of pan.  Cook until bubbles form on top and crepes begin to dry out.  No need to cook on top side.  Place filling on that side.
Filling:
Melt butter in large skillet over low heat.  Blend in flour & cook, stirring constantly, about 6-8 minutes until thick.  Add well drained spinach & remaining ingredients.  Place about a heaping tablespoon in each crepe, fold over & place in 9x13 inch dish. Brush with melted butter & sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Bake @ 350 until crepes are light brown on top.
