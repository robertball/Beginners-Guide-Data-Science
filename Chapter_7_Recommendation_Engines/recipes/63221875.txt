Ingredients:
1 refrigerated pizza dough (Pillsbury classic crust or thin crust)
2 teaspoons olive oil or olive oil spray
1/2 - 2/3 cup prepared pizza sauce
2 - 3 Tbsp sliced green olives w/pimentos
¼ cup chopped red onions, optional
1/2 cup sliced grape tomatoes
1½ cups chopped cooked/smoked ham
8 ounce can of pineapple tidbits, drained well
1½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese + ¼ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
Or
1 ¼ cups shredded mozzarella cheese + ½ cup shredded provolone cheese + ¼ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese for extra cheesiness.

Directions:
Preheat an oven with a rack in the middle position to 425°F, (400°F for dark/nonstick pans).
Spray a cookie sheet with olive oil, unroll and press the dough on the pan without stretching it.
Lightly spray the top of the dough with olive oil and pre-bake the dough for 8 minutes.
Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the prebaked crust. Top the pizza evenly with olives, ham, optional onions, tomatoes and pineapple. Sprinkle the cheeses evenly over the top.
Bake at 425°F (400°F for dark/nonstick pans) for 6 - 8 minutes or until cheese melts and the crust is lightly browned.

Description: 
The title may sound weird but the combo of ham, green olives and pineapple tastes great on a pizza. Adjust the amount of olives or pineapple to suit your taste.
