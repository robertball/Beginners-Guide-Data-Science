Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 bottle of buffalo chicken sauce
1/2 package of ranch dip mix
2 tbs butter

Directions:
Place frozen chicken breasts in the bottom of the slow-cooker, cover with 3/4 bottle of buffalo sauce and the ranch dip mix.  Cook on low for 7-8 hours.  Right before serving shred the chicken with a fork and add the butter.  Load shredded chicken on hogie or any bread you like.  Use the left over sauce to taste, I also like to top with blue cheese or ranch dressing.
