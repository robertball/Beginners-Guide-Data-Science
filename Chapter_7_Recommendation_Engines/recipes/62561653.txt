Ingredients:
1/2 loaf wheat with double fiber bread. Or just wheat bread.
1/2 loaf of italian bread or whatever you have left over.
1 tablespoon Oregano
1 Tablespoon Parsley
1 Teaspoon Garlic Powder
1 8oz. jar of Parmeasan Reduced Fat Cheese
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Heat oven to 250 degrees-
Cut bread into 1/4  inch cubes and place on a cookie sheet (or any long flat baking pan)
Bake in oven for about 30 minutes or until all bread crumbs have dried out. (Turn them a few times)
Cool the bread crumbs once they are done. This is important or the extra mosisture may make moldy crumbs.
Using either your blender or processor grind the bread crumbs into fine crumbs (like the size you've seen in the store bought crumbs.)
Put the ground up bread crumbs into a large bowl and add the other ingredients, mix it up well. Now you can either use them in a recipe or put them in an airtight storage container for future use.
