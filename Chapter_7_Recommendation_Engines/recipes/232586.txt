Ingredients:
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 pinch poultry seasoning (such as McCormick(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper
1 ½ cups water
2 cups yellow rice mix
1 teaspoon soy sauce
2 (15 ounce) cans pineapple chunks, undrained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season chicken breasts with poultry seasoning, salt, and black pepper.
Combine water, yellow rice mix, and soy sauce in a baking dish. Arrange chicken over rice and pour pineapples and juice over chicken.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and rice is tender, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
