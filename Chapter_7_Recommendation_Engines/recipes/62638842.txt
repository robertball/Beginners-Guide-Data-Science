Ingredients:
3 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper (I used garlic pepper blend)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/4 lbs broccoli, separated into small florets, and stems, sliced (about 5 cups florets and 3/4 cup stems in total)

Directions:
Stir water, salt, and pepper together in small bowl, til salt dissolves.
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high then add the broccoli stems in an even layer.
Don't stir for about two minutes until they get light browned.
Add the florets and toss to combine and don't stir for another two minutes, until they just begin to brown.
Add water spice mixture and cover pan with lid, cooking for two minutes.
Uncover and cook until desired doneness.

Description: 
Tasty way to prepare broccoli!

*I eyeballed my broccoli measurements and it worked fine. I did add a little water to mine. Very interesting and flavorful way to cook broccoli. I never liked the smell of cooking broccoli, but this was fine! I didn't measure anything and I used cajun seasoning and minced garlic in the water. Delicious!!
