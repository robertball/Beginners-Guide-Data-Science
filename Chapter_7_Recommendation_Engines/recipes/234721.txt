Ingredients:
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup canned pumpkin
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup dried cranberries
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8x4x2-inch loaf pans and flour pans using 2 teaspoons flour.
Stir 2 1/4 cups flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk pumpkin, oil, and eggs together in a separate bowl. Pour pumpkin mixture into flour mixture and stir until just combined; fold cranberries and chocolate chips into batter. Pour batter into prepared loaf pans.
Bake loaves in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
I got this recipe from my mother-in-law, and it's my favorite holiday snack now! The cranberries in it are delicious! The bread may get a little hard around the edges but it takes a long time to get the center done.
