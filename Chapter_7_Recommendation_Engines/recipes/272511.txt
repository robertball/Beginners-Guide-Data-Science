Ingredients:
8 (4 ounce) veal cutlets
8 slices prosciutto
8 leaves fresh sage
1/4 cup butter
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup dry white wine

Directions:
Pound veal cutlets on a flat surface with a meat mallet until very thin. Lay 1 slice of prosciutto and 1 sage leaf on top of each veal cutlet and secure with toothpicks.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Increase heat to high and add the cutlets. Quickly brown on both sides, lightly seasoning with salt, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Grind black pepper on top and pour in a few tablespoons of white wine. Cook off wine quickly and transfer cutlets to a warm serving dish. Pour juice from the skillet over the cutlets and serve immediately.
