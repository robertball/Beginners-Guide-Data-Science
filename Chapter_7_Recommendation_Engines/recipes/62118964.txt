Corn & Crab Chowder Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 15 oz can Mexican blend corn (Corn w/Red & Green peppers)
1 15 oz can sweet corn
2 10.5 oz cans creamed corn
2 10.5 oz cans cream of potato soup
1 10.5 oz can cream of celery soup
1 bay leaf
1 tsp. thyme
1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning
½ cup sherry or white wine
Milk – add 1 soup can for each can of soup added – I used Vitamin D/whole milk
1 – 1lb can of pasteurized crab meat

Directions:
Combine all ingredients, adding one can of milk for each can of soup added.
Use medium heat & stir frequently, as creamed corn tends to sink to the bottom of the pan & can burn.  For large parties, I warm this up on the stovetop & place in a crock pot on Low heat.
Serve with crusty rolls or bread.
The type of crab meat you use is really what makes this soup.  Don't get the canned stuff in the tuna section - it's tasteless - instead, buy the pasteurized crab meat which is usually in your grocer's seafood department.  For this chowder I buy the claw meat, it's typically half the price of lump & I think it holds together better in the soup.
