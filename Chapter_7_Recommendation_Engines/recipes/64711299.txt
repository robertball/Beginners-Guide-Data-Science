Ingredients:
1  24 oz. jar of spicy dill pickle spears
1/4 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
1 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 cup panko-style bread crumbs
Oil for spritzing

Directions:
Drain and pat dry pickles of excess moisture.
In 3 separate bowls, 1 with flour and paprika mixture, 1 with beaten egg and milk mixture and 1 with bread crumbs. First dip in flour mixture, then with egg  mixture and then with bread crumbs. Do this with each pickle spear until they are thoroughly coated. Lightly spritz each with oil. You may have to do separate batches to avoid over crowding the air fryer.
Place pickles in a single layer, set temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and set time for 14 minutes (cook time may vary on brand of air fryers). Turn pickles 1/2 way through the cooking time.
Serve with ranch dressing or your favorite dipping sauce.
