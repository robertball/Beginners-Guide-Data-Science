Ingredients:
2 lb. pork tenderloin
rub ingredients:
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
basting ingredients:
sweet & sour sauce
3 tablespoon honey
4 teaspoon yellow mustard

Directions:
24 hours before baking remove all visible fat from thawed tenderloin. Rinse with cold water. Put in a baking dish/pan that is slightly bigger than the loin.
Mix all the rub ingredients together until mixed well. Rub the mixture into the loin on all visible areas, rubbing it well into the loin. Cover the dish/pan with foil and set in refrigerator for 24 hours.
Approximately 10-15 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 300F, remove foil and brush a light to medium coating of sweet & sour sauce (I use Kikkoman brand, just my preference) all over the loin and wait 10 minutes. 4.Mix honey and mustard together and after 10 minutes are up baste a heavy coating over the sweet & sour coating, covering all the tenderloin.
Place approximately 1/2 inch of water in bottom of dish/pan ( do not run water over loin) and recover with foil. Bake at 300F for 1 1/2 hours

Description: 
I could not get my husband to eat pork loin or roasts. I tried dozens of recipes but he would just say it was ok but would never want me to make it again. After numerous tries I came up with this, and he likes it, if the rub stays on it for 24 hours.  Believe me he knows when it doesn't! Now it is a regular on the menu without complaint. I hope others like it.
