Ingredients:
2 cups flour
4 tsp. baking powder
3/4 tsp. salt
1/3 cup sugar
4 Tbsp. frozen butter, diced
2 Tbsp. shortening
3/4 cup Half n Half or heavy cream
1 egg
zest of 1 orange
handful craisins
zest of 1 orange
juice of 1 orange
powdered sugar, enough to make thick icing

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees
In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Mix well.
Cut in butter and shortening. Best if the butter stays in cubes and isn't incorporated into the flour much.
In a separate bowl, combine cream with beaten egg then add to dry ingredients. Stir in zest and fruit.
Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Make into a flattened round and cut into 8 wedges (like a pizza).
Bake for 15 minutes or until golden.
Icing: whisk zest, orange juice and powered sugar until thick.
Drizzle with icing.
Frozen variation: place unbaked scones on cookie sheet and place in freezer. Once frozen, they can be stored in an airtight container until ready to bake. Bake at 350 for about 22-24 minutes.
Petite scone variation: divide the dough ball in half. Cut each flattened round into 8 wedges, resulting in 18 wedges. Reduce baking time. If frozen, bake at 350 for 15 minutes.
Lemon blueberry variation: substitute lemon juice and zest for the orange juice and zest. Substitute dried blueberries (found in same section as craisins) for craisins.
