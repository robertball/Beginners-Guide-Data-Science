Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup ground almonds
1/2 cup cold butter
6 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, softened
1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
2 packages (3.4 ounces each) instant pistachio pudding mix
5 eggs, lightly beaten
Chocolate syrup
Whipped cream and chopped pistachios, optional

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the flour and almonds; cut in butter until
crumbly. Press onto the bottom and 1-1/4 in. up the sides of a
greased 10-in. springform pan. Bake at 400° for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat cream cheese, milk and pudding mixes
until smooth. Add eggs; beat on low speed just until combined. Pour
over crust.
Place pan on a baking sheet. Reduce heat to 350°. Bake for 55-60
minutes or until the center is almost set. Cool on a wire rack for
10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen; cool
1 hour longer. Refrigerate overnight.
Slice cheesecake; drizzle slices with chocolate syrup. Garnish with
whipped cream and pistachios if desired.
