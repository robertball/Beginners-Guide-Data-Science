Ingredients:
2 cups butter, softened
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, Whip the butter on high speed, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl.  Whip until double in volume. This takes a very long time, approximately 10 minutes.
While still whipping, drizzle in the heavy cream.  Continue whipping until the mixture is stiff,  approximately 2 to 4 minutes.
Add 1/2 of the confectioners sugar and whip until smooth.  At this point, you can taste the frosting and determine if you would like to add more sugar to sweeten to taste.
Thickly frosts top and sides of two 9 inch cakes.

Description: 
The success of this frosting is in the technique, not the ingredients. It's so creamy and not too sweet.
