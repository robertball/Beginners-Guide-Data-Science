Ingredients:
2 c. light cream (whipping cream)
2 c. sugar
1 c. light corn syrup
1/2 tsp. salt
1/3 c. butter

Directions:
Heat the 2 c. light cream until lukewarm, then take out 1 c. and set aside.
To cream in pot, add sugar, corn syrup and salt.
While stirring for 10 minutes, slowly add the other cup of cream and 1/3 c. butter. Do not let it stop boiling!
Boil to 236. If you don't have a candy thermometer, take a little bit of candy and put it in some cold water. If you can form a soft ball, then it's boiled properly.
Let stand 10 min.
Pour into buttered 9x13 pan.
