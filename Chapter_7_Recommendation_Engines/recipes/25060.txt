Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup water
1 (8 ounce) package chopped pitted dates
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup orange juice
3/4 cup milk
2 eggs
1 tablespoon orange zest
1 cup chopped pecans
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1/3 cup butter, softened
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon orange zest
2 1/2 tablespoons orange juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine sugar, 1/2 cup butter, water and dates. Cook, stirring frequently until dates have softened and the mixture is well blended. Remove from heat.  Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the date mixture, then mix in the 1/4 cup orange juice, milk, eggs and 1 tablespoon orange zest. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. To make the frosting, combine the confectioners' sugar, 1/3 cup butter, cream cheese and orange zest. Beat until smooth. Gradually mix in the remaining orange juice a tablespoon at a time until the icing is spreadable. Spread over the bars when cool. Cut into squares.
