Ingredients:
2+ lb moose rump roast
Marinade:
1 cup teriyaki sauce
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp steak seasoning
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp Italian Seasoning
2 tbs lemon juice
2 tbs worcestershire sauce
Main ingredients:
5 red potatos, quartered
1 cup sliced carrots
ounces beef stock
1 medium sweet onion, chopped
4 slices bacon, cut in in half half
4 cloves garlic, sliced lengthwise
1 can chopped tomatoes and garlic with juice
1 small package fresh mushrooms, whole
4 med bay leaves
3 tbs olive oil

Directions:
Combine roast and  marinade ingredients in ziplock bag, seal, mix well, and refrigerate overnight.
Pour marinade into crock pot.  Make 8 large slits completely through the roast and insert the bacon slices.  Stuff the garlic slices in after the bacon.  Brown roast on all sides in olive oil and place in crock pot.  Surround with remaining ingredients and cook on low for 10 hours.  You will notice as the roast cooks, the juice will nearly cover the roast, which is desired.
After 10 hours, remove roast and allow to rest for 10 minutes.  Remove and juice and place in serving bowl.  Thicken one cup of juice for thicker gravy if desired.  I like to semi-shred the roast, and cover with the thin juice, and use the thicker gravy on the potatoes.

I know what you're thinking... wild game roast = Dry Dry Dry!  Not this one.  Use your crock pot on low, 10 hours.
