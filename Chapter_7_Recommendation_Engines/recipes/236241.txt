Ingredients:
1 cup low-sodium soy sauce
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
1/4 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons barbeque sauce
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha) (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water
1 quart peanut oil for frying, or as needed
4 pounds chicken wings
2 tablespoons lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Stir soy sauce, brown sugar, ketchup, barbeque sauce, garlic, vinegar, chile-garlic sauce, pepper, sesame oil, and ginger together in a saucepan; bring to a boil.
Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl; stir into the sauce. Remove from heat and set aside to cool and thicken.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).
Season chicken wings with lemon-pepper seasoning.
Fry chicken wings in batches of 6 to 8 at a time in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per batch. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the meatiest part of the wing, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Put cooked wings into a large mixing bowl. Ladle sauce over the wings and toss to coat.
