Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups coleslaw mix
1/2 cup bean sprouts
8 thick slices (3/4 inch thick) sourdough bread
3 tablespoons margarine, softened
3 tablespoons honey mustard
6 ounces sliced Havarti cheese

Directions:
In a medium bowl, toss together the coleslaw mix and bean sprouts.
Spread one side of each bread slice with margarine. Spread opposite side of 4 slices with honey mustard. Layer the honey mustard side of the 4 bread slices with the coleslaw mixture and cheese. Top with remaining 4 bread slices, margarine side out.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the sandwiches about 2 minutes on each side, until the cheese has melted and the bread is golden brown.
