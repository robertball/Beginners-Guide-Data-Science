Description: 
Sure, we know that mashed potatoes feel like the center of the meal at the Thanksgiving table. And you can't go wrong with simple roasted potatoes either. However, if you want to wow your guests with your presentation, try these little roasted potato cakes, which are formed like a flower with thin slices of potatoes, then roasted in a pool of herbed butter. We have a feeling everyone will say yes to these.
