Ingredients:
2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
12 ounces soy chorizo, crumbled
12 (6 inch) corn tortillas

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Cook, covered, until potatoes are easily pierced with a knife, about 30 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water.
Transfer boiled potatoes to a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Mash with a potato masher, adding reserved cooking water to reach desired consistency.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet. Cook soy chorizo for 5 minutes. Add mashed potatoes and mix well.
Heat tortillas on a hot griddle over medium heat to soften them. Fill them with equal amounts of potato-chorizo mixture. Fold them in half and brush the outside of the tortillas with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Place tacos on the hot griddle and cook, turning once, until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is a vegan version of popular Mexican tacos made are traditionally made with potatoes and pork chorizo that are deep fried, but I prefer this healthier version where you just heat the tortillas on the griddle with a very small amount of oil until they are crispy.
