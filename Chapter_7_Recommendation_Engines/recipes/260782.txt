Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon instant coffee granules
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cocoa powder
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut (optional)
2 cups milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, instant coffee, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy.
Combine flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, salt, baking powder, cream of tartar, and chili powder in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into the butter mixture slowly until blended. Fold in coconut and chocolate chips.
Drop batter by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool slightly on the baking sheet before transferring to a rack to cool completely, about 15 minutes.
