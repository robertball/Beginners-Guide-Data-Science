Chocolate Covered Strawberries Recipe

Ingredients:
One large or two small containers of strawberries
3 5 oz. jumbo Hershey's milk chocolate bars

Directions:
Wash and dry strawberries, leaving stems attached. Make sure berries are 100% dry before using. ANY water remaining on berries can cause chocolate to sieze, becoming a tough, rubbery mass. Break chocolate bars into pieces, melt broken chocolate in a microwave on high, beginning with 30 seconds, stir. Repeat. As chocolate begins to melt, reduce microwave cook time intervals to 15 seconds, still stirring between each interval. Use care not to burn the chocolate, it will taste horrible and sieze. The chocolate is melted to the right texture when it resembles chocolate pudding. Once melted, dip about 3/4 of the dried berry into the chocolate, twist and lift. Place dipped berry on a foil lined cookie sheet. Once all the berries are dipped, keep in refrigerator until needed. Let refrigerate at least one hour before eating. Enjoy!
