Ingredients:
2-4 cups precooked diced chicken breast (add as little or as much as you prefer)
2 medium onions chopped
16 oz canned salsa
4 oz canned tomato sauce
16 oz heavy cream
16 oz frozen corn
1 packet Old El Paso 25% Less Sodium Taco Seasoning
1/4 cup oil
4 chicken bullion cubes
4 cups water
4 oz cheddar cheese (optional)
4 oz sour cream (optional)
1 oz green onions (optional)

Directions:
Add all the ingredients to a pot and heat over medium heat on the stove top until simmering. Serve immediately with cheddar cheese, green onions, or sour cream garnish. I've also made it in a crock pot and Instant Pot pressure cooker depending on whether I wanted it ready slowly or a little faster and they both work great. If you're not overly concerned with carbs, feel free to add tortilla strips as a crunchy topping!

Description: 
This is a very low carb, super simple, creamy chicken soup I make for the family that takes 10-15 minutes to prep and is delicious. If you use the Tyson precooked diced chicken it cuts the cooking time down to basically just getting it hot so it's also very fast! This is perfect for a cold day when you want a hearty filling soup.
