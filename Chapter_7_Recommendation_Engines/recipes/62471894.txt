Ingredients:
Phyllo Wrapped Egg Rolls
2 tablespoons olive oil oil
2 small ribs celery, finely chopped
1 cup mushrooms, chopped
1/2 head  cabbage, shredded
¾ cup bean sprouts
1/4 cup water chestnuts, drained and chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 inch fresh ginger root, peeled and grated
2 tablespoons tamari (aged soy sauce)
2 teaspoons corn starch
12-16 13x17-inch sheets phyllo pastry dough
1 tablespoon butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400ºF with rack in the center.
Heat olive oil in a large,  skillet over medium heat.  Add the celery and mushrooms, stir-fry for 1 minute, then add the cabbage, bean sprouts, water chestnuts, garlic and ginger, and cook 2-3 minutes more.
Combine the tamari and corn starch till smooth.  Stir into vegetables. Cook and stir until slightly thickened.
Stack 2 phyllo dough sheets at a time on clean working area.  Fold them both in half to measure 81/2 x 13. Place about 1/3 cup  of the mixture on the dough, two inches from the bottom and each side. Tuck bottom up and fold both sides in, then roll and wrap upwards until you reach the edge of the dough sheet. Place seam side down on a baking sheet. Brush tops with melted butter.  (Phyllo dough dries out very quickly so as you are assembling the egg rolls, keep the remaining sheets covered with a damp kitchen towel.)
Bake for 15 minutes, until light golden. Serve with sweet and sour sauce, or dipping sauce of your choice.
