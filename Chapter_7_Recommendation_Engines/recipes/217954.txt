Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1 loaf French bread, cut into 1-inch slices
8 eggs
2 cups prepared eggnog

Directions:
Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Heat the brown sugar, butter, and corn syrup in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until the mixture begins to boil; remove the mixture from heat, and pour into the prepared baking dish. Place the bread slices atop the brown sugar mixture.
Whisk the eggs and eggnog together in a large bowl; pour over the bread slices. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Remove the baking dish from the refrigerator.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Increase heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), remove the aluminum foil, and continue baking until the the top begins to brown, 5 to 7 minutes more.

Description: 
Delicious and so easy, it'll become a Christmas morning tradition! Needs no syrup.  Whipped cream and sliced fruit like strawberries and bananas are great on top! Instead of eggnog, you can use whole milk and add a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and a tablespoon of vanilla.
