Ingredients:
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup finely ground graham cracker crumbs
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons shortening

Directions:
Combine peanut butter, graham cracker crumbs, and confectioners' sugar in a bowl or a food processor until smooth.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Roll  teaspoonfuls of peanut butter mixture into balls.  Refrigerate until ready to dip in melted chocolate.
Melt chocolate chips and shortening together in the top of a double boiler until very liquid.  Using a fork or a skewer, dip each ball into chocolate leaving just the very top of the ball exposed. Set on a greased cookie sheet, setting each ball on the peanut butter end.  Refrigerate until the chocolate is firm.
