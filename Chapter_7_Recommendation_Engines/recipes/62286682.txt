Ingredients:
3 - 4 cups bread flour
1 packet instant yeast
2 tsp. sugar
1 tsp. salt (non iodized is best)
1 large egg
2 tablespoons butter (or oil)
1 cup warm water
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For wheat variety:
Make the following changes and additions and continue with the ingredients and recipe as directed:
1 cup wheat flour
2 cups bread flour
2 teaspoons dark brown sugar
1 tbsp. vital wheat gluten

Directions:
Place all ingredients in the bread machine as yours directs.  Set to the dough cycle.
Do not flour your table but lightly grease instead.  Place dough on table and divide in to 8 equal portions. Let rest, covered 5 minutes. Roll into balls as smoothly as possible. Let rest another 5 minutes.  Flatten dough into 4 inch circles (approximately) about 3/4 inch thick.
Place dough on lightly greased baking pan - use parchment or a silpat if you have it.  Press kaiser stamp into dough but NOT all the way thru or you will have the dough looking more like a spider than a roll when it rises and bakes.
Turn the stamped dough upside down so that while it rises the stamp wont become distorted.
Let rise about 30 to 45 minutes or until doubled in size.
Turn rolls right side up and brush with milk for a golden brown top.  Brush with a beaten egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds if you like.
Heat oven to 450* and bake about 17 minutes or until nice and golden in color.  Don't be afraid to let them get a deep golden brown.  They will soften as they cool.   Be sure to cool completely before cutting.
