Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups dry-curd cottage cheese
2 egg yolks
3/4 teaspoon salt (optional)
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3/4 cup cold water

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the cottage cheese, egg yolks, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, and baking powder. Pour in the vegetable oil and cold water, and mix or knead into a smooth dough.
Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface, and cut into 3 inch circles using a glass, can, or cookie cutter. Place a spoonful of the cottage cheese filling onto each circle. Fold in half, and pinch the edges together to seal.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Carefully drop the perogies into the water, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until they float. Remove from water with a slotted spoon, and place on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet to drain excess water.

Description: 
Very easy recipe to make, and a wonderful twist to an ordinary perogy.  These cheese filled perogies taste great just boiled or fried with a little butter.  Eat them with sour cream and you will have a wonderful dinner. You can easily double or triple the recipe and place extras in the freezer.
