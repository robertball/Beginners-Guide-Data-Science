Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup finely diced onion
1 (10 ounce) package fresh spinach, chopped
6 large eggs
1/4 cup milk, or as needed
1/4 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup shredded Asiago cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup imitation crab meat, finely chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 24 miniature muffin cups with cooking spray.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onion until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir spinach into onion and cook, stirring often, until spinach is wilted and onions are translucent, about 3 more minutes. Drain juice.
Beat eggs with milk in a large bowl until thoroughly combined; stir in Cheddar, Asiago, and Parmesan cheeses and season with salt and black pepper.
Divide spinach mixture into the prepared muffin cups (about 1 teaspoon per cup) and top spinach with imitation crab meat. Slowly and carefully pour egg-cheese mixture over the imitation crab, filling the mini muffin cups just to the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the egg is set, 12 to 15 minutes.
