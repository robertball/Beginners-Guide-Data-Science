Ingredients:
1 14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk
1 12 oz. can evaporated milk
3 large eggs
3 Tbsp. orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier
1 tsp. finely grated orange rind
1/2 c. cajeta (found in Mexican markets) OR caramel ice cream topping
1 box butter recipe yellow cake mix**
3/4 c. water
1/2 c. tequila
1/2 c. butter, melted
3 large eggs
1 tsp. very finely grated lime rind
1 c. sweetened flaked coconut (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Generously spray a 12-cup Bundt pan with cooking spray. Pour caramel into the bottom of pan. Set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together the milks, eggs, orange liqueur and orange peel. Set aside.
Prepare cake batter by beating the cake mix, water, tequila, butter, eggs and lime zest on low speed for 30 seconds, then on medium speed 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl occasionally. Pour cake batter into pan over caramel.
Stir the milk mixture and very gradually pour over the cake batter. This mixture will sink and the batter will rise as it bakes.
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Unmold onto a serving plate. Let cool completely. Store letover cake in refrigerator.
