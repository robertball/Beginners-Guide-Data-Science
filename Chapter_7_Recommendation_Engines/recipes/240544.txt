Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey breast
2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 (20 ounce) jar picante sauce
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup crushed tortilla chips, or to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer turkey to a 5-quart pot.
Mix broth, picante sauce, cilantro, lime juice, and olive oil into turkey; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer until flavors blend, about 40 minutes. Transfer soup to serving bowls and top with tortilla chips.

An easy and delicious spicy soup made with ground turkey breast. Control the spice level by the picante sauce you use (we like medium). Also works well with ground pork.
