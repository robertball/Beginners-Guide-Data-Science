Ingredients:
Salad
1 small red cabbage (about 1/2 pound), quartered
1 small green cabbage (about 1/2 pound), quartered
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Salt
1 large Asian pear--peeled, cored and cut into matchsticks (about 1 cup)
1/4 cup mixed herbs, such as Thai basil, mint and cilantro
1/4 cup pomegranate seeds (from about 1/4 pomegranate)
Vinaigrette
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lime zest
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
1 serrano chile--roasted, seeded and finely chopped (about 1Â½ teaspoons)
Salt

Directions:
1. Make the salad: Brush the red and green cabbage with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt. In a large cast-iron skillet, cook the cabbage over high heat until brown on all sides and slightly soft, about 5 minutes. Let the cabbage cool to room temperature, then core and thinly slice.
2. While the cabbage cools, make the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk the olive oil with the lime zest, lime juice, rice wine vinegar and serrano chile. Season to taste with salt and set aside.
3. In a large bowl, combine the pear with the red and green cabbage, herbs and pomegranate seeds. Toss with the vinaigrette and season to taste with salt. Divide among 4 plates and serve immediately.
