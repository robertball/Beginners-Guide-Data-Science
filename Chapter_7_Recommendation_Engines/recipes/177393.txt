Harvest Patties Recipe

Ingredients:
3 yellow potatoes, peeled and grated
1 large carrot, peeled and grated
1 parsnip, peeled and grated
1 1/2 cups grated butternut squash
1 egg
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Toss together the potatoes, carrot, parsnip, and squash in a large bowl until evenly mixed. Tilting the bowl away from you, collect all the vegetables in your hands and squeeze them to separate the juice. Move the vegetables into a separate bowl and mix in the cinnamon.
After 5 minutes or so, slowly pour out the juice from the first bowl - the bottom of the bowl should be coated with starch. Combine the starch with egg and flour, using a fork to stir it together. Then take the starch mixture in your hands and massage it through the shredded vegetables. Separate the mix into little balls, about 1 inch thick, and flatten onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake the patties in the oven until lightly browned around the edges, about 20 minutes; flip and bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
This is a new spin on a traditional Jewish food. They're very sweet and fun to make, making it a great recipe for kids who want to help out in the kitchen. They also make great finger food for parties. Be sure to remove any jewelry before getting started though - you'll be putting your hands into a very sticky mess, and it can get everywhere! Serve hot with apricot preserves, applesauce, maple syrup, or parmesan cheese. If you have a food processor, that will probably work as well, though I prefer the extra-fine result that comes from using a cheese grater. They can also be frozen and reheated.
