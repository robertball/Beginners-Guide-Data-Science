Ingredients:
2 pounds fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2 1/2 inch pieces
1 1/2 cups balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch asparagus just until tender, about 1 minute. Plunge into a bowl of cold water to cool. Drain asparagus and place in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in vinaigrette and seal bag. Refrigerate at least 3 hours, turning bag occasionally.
Just before serving, drain asparagus, reserving vinaigrette. Arrange on a serving platter and sprinkle with lemon zest, parsley, salt, and pepper. Serve reserved vinaigrette in a small dish on the side.
