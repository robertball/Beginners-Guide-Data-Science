Ingredients:
1/2 cup KRAFT Tuscan House Italian Dressing and Marinade, divided
2 (4 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breast halves
1 red pepper, cut into strips
1 small zucchini, cut lengthwise in half, then sliced crosswise
4 slices Italian bread
1/2 cup KRAFT Shredded Low-Moisture Part-Skim Mozzarella Cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Reserve 1 tablespoon dressing; pour remaining over chicken and vegetables in shallow dish. Stir vegetables and turn chicken to evenly coat both sides of each piece. Refrigerate 30 min. to marinate.
Heat panini grill. Meanwhile, drain chicken and vegetables; discard marinade. Cook chicken and vegetables in skillet on medium heat 10 min. or until chicken is done (165 degrees F) and vegetables are crisp-tender, turning chicken after 5 min. and stirring vegetables occasionally.
Fill bread slices with chicken, vegetables, cheese and basil to make 2 sandwiches; brush outsides with reserved dressing. Grill 5 min. or until golden brown.
