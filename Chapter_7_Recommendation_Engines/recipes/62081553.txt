In a small mixing bowl beat cream softened cream cheese, orange juice concentrate, sugar, orange zest (stay with the orange stuff, not the white portion), and cinnamon on medium speed until fluffy.

Garnish with mint leaf or as desired.
Spread on cracker and try to eat just one.

Description: 
This is a festive spread that goes great with Bistro Crackers, Wheat Thins, or Triscuits.  It was given to me by a friend who has made it for years.  It's especially nice during the holidays, but tasty enough that you would never want to have it only once each year.  It's a cream cheese based spread with orange zest, pecans, and dried cranberries providing an excellent supporting role.  Dessert, hors d'oeuvre, or something else?  I'm not sure, but I hope you like it.
