Description: 
While experimenting on the stove one day, I discovered this unique and timeless taste.  What's different about it is that it is totally invisible to the unsuspecting palette.  Try it, might be fun for your family.  Grape tomatoes, rather than cherry tomatoes, are preferred if you can find them.
