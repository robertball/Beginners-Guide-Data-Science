Ingredients:
1 stick butter (½ cup)
½ cup vegetable shortening
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
½ cup white sugar
1½ tsp vanilla extract
2 eggs
1½ cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
2 cups rolled oats
½ cup finely ground walnuts
12 oz. pckg. semi-sweet chocolate chips
Kosher salt

Directions:
Heat oven to 350º
Combine flour, salt and baking soda in bowl and set aside.
Cream butter, shortening, sugars and vanilla together.
Add eggs, beating until fluffy.
Mix in flour mixture until well blended.
Fold in walnuts and oatmeal.
Fold in chocolate chips.  The mixture will be quite stiff.
Drop in tablespoon-size drops on cookie sheet (I like to use release wrap or parchment paper for ease of removal).
Bake for 10 minutes or until lightly brown and still soft on top.  Remove from oven.
While on cookie sheet, sprinkle very lightly with kosher salt.  There should be just a few flecks on each cookie.
After two minutes rest time, transfer with spatula to cooling rack.
