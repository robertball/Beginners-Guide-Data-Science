Ingredients:
4 russet potatoes
1 1/2 cups white vinegar
2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
salt to taste

Directions:
Slice potatoes very thinly using a sharp knife. Place in a bowl and add 4 cups of water; soak for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to release the starch.
Drain potatoes and return to the bowl. Add 3 cups water and vinegar. Soak for 2 hours.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drain potatoes and pat dry.
Fry potatoes in the hot oil, working in batches, for 1 minute. Transfer to a paper towel-lined tray to drain excess oil. Fry for 1 more minute and drain again. Season with salt while still hot.
