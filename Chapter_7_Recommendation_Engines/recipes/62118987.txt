Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 cups flour
1/2 cup dark cocoa
1/2 cup sugar
14 ounces semi-sweet baking chocolate
1/2 teaspoon imitation almond extract
1/2 cup finely chopped and drained maraschino cherries
2 Tablespoons milk
2 Tablespoons unsalted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Finely chop 6 ounces of baking chocolate and set aside.
Combine 1 cup cold butter with the flour, sugar, and cocoa until mixture resembles small crumbs
Stir in chopped chocolate, extract, and cherries until well combined.
Roll dough into 1 inch round balls and roll in granulated sugar.
Place dough balls 1 inch apart on cookie sheet and flatten with bottom of a cup to 1 1/2 inch circles.
Bake about 10 minutes.
Remove from oven and let cool on cookie sheet for about 2 minutes.
Carefully remove cookies to cool completely on waxed paper for at least an hour.
After cookies have cooled completely, melt the remaining 8 ounces baking chocolate on very low heat in a small pot, stirring occasionally. Add in 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon milk and stir until smooth. Melted chocolate should run off the spoon with ease, if not, add another tablespoon of milk and another tablespoon of butter.
Dip each cookie at least halfway into the chocolate.
Lay the dipped cookies back on the waxed paper and let cool and harden for several hours.
Store covered, in the refrigerator, or freeze for later use.
