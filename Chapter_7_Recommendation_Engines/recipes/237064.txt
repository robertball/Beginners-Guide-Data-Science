Description: 
Usually making something like fresh cheese at home is done because it's higher quality, and much cheaper. This recipe for fromage blanc, or farmer's cheese, flies in the face of that conventional culinary wisdom. So why bother? Because, for any self-respecting foodie, making a batch of homemade cheese is definitely on the culinary 'bucket list.' Before you cash in your apron for good, you should experience the magic of watching a pot of milk turned into cheese. And if all this sounds kind of cheesy, so be it.
