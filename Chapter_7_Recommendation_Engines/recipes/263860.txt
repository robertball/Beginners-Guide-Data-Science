Ingredients:
6 carrots
Jordanian Za'atar Spice Mix:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon sumac powder
1/2 teaspoon Himalayan pink salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut carrot pieces lengthwise into strips.
Combine olive oil, sesame seeds, oregano, thyme, sumac, pink salt, and pepper in a bowl. Add carrots and toss to coat; spread carrots onto a baking sheet in a single layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender and lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Broil carrots until thoroughly browned, 3 to 5 minutes more.
