Ingredients:
1 large La Tortilla Factory Smart & Delicious Low Carb/High FIber tortilla
1 slice extra-lean turkey bacon
2 cups fresh spinach leaves
1/3 cup diced mushrooms
1/4 cup diced plum tomatoes (preferably Roma)
1/4 cup diced green bell pepper
2 T diced onion
1 wedge The Laughing Cow Light Original Swiss cheese
2 T shredded fat-free cheddar cheese

Directions:
Cut bacon into small, bite-sized pieces. Set aside.
Spray a small pan with nonstick spray and bring to medium-high heat. Add bacon pieces, mushrooms, peppers, and onion to the pan. Stirring occasionally, cook until bacon begins to crisp, 4 to 5 minutes.
Add spinach leaves and cook and stir until the leaves have wilted. Add shredded cheese and stir until just melted. Remove pan from heat and set aside.
Warm tortilla in the microwave for about 10 seconds. Lay tortilla flat and spread cheese wedge on top of it. Evenly layer spinach mixture over the cheese-topped tortilla. Place diced tomatoes on top of spinach mixture.
Fold tortilla, then enjoy!
