Ingredients:
2 cups almond milk
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1 cup almonds
5 tablespoons pistachio paste
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon almond extract
2 teaspoons almond extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 drop green food coloring (optional)

Directions:
Combine almond milk, coconut milk, sugar, corn syrup, and coconut oil in a medium-sized saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring continuously with a whisk, about 5 minutes.
Add almonds to a high-speed blender. Pour in milk mixture and blend until smooth.
Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl to remove remaining chunks of nuts. Add pistachio paste, 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons extract, salt, and food coloring; mix until thoroughly combined. Pour 1/2 of the mixture into an airtight container and store in the refrigerator. Pour remaining mixture into ice cube trays, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze until solid, about 4 hours.
Remove ice cube trays from freezer and transfer frozen ice cream to the blender. Add refrigerated mixture and blend until smooth. Pour ice cream into an airtight container and freeze until solid, about 1 hour, or eat immediately as soft-serve ice cream.
