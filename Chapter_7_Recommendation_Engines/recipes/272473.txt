Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
1 pound chicken breast, cubed
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed
1  zucchini, cut in quarters and sliced
4  red potatoes, diced
Â½  onion, sliced
extra-virgin olive oil
garlic-pepper seasoning
dried Italian seasoning to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a sheet pan with olive oil.
Place chicken, asparagus, zucchini, potatoes, and onion on the sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with garlic-pepper seasoning and Italian seasoning.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Blot juices off the sheet pan and flip chicken and vegetables over. Bake until vegetables are soft and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 more minutes.
