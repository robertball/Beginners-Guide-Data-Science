Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound kale, ribs removed, coarsely chopped (see Tip)
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 teaspoons sherry vinegar or red-wine vinegar
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add kale and cook, tossing with two large spoons, until bright green, about 1 minute. Add water, reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the kale is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Push kale to one side, add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil to the empty side and cook garlic and crushed red pepper in it until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Stir in vinegar to taste and salt.
