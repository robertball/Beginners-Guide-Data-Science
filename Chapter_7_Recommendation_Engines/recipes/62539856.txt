Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cup white (or yellow) cornmeal
1 cup turbinado sugar (may substitute any other sweetener)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon of dry egg replacer (I use Ener-G)
6 ounces soft tofu
1 1/2 cup soy milk
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 to 1 1/2 cup fresh whole cranberries
9 x 13" cake pan

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine all dry ingredients.
In a separate bowl, thoroughly mash tofu and add in the egg, soymilk, and olive oil.  Whisk until all are combined.
Pour wet ingredients into the dry and stir to create a thick batter.
Fold in cranberries.  Pour into a 9" x 13" baking pan that has been well oiled.
Optional:  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of turbinado sugar over the top.
Bake at 375 degrees for 35-40 min.

Description: 
I adapted this to be a healthier version of cornbread. It's perfect for the holidays. The tart cranberries compliment the sweetness of the cornbread and the tofu helps make this moist and nutritious.
