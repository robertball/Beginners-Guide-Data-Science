Ingredients:
4 oz pancetta, chopped (or center cut bacon)
1 tbsp butter
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 cup celery, minced
1/2 cup carrots, minced
7 cloves garlic, crushed
1 lb 80% lean ground beef
1/4 cup white wine
2 - 28 oz cans crushed tomatoes
3 bay leaves
salt and fresh pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp dried oregano
1/2 cup half & half

Directions:
In a dutch oven or deep heavy sauté pan, sauté pancetta until fat melts.
Add butter, onions, garlic, celery and carrots and cook on medium-low heat until soft, about 5 minutes.
Increase flame to medium-high, add meat, season with salt and pepper and sauté until browned.
Add wine, cook until it reduces down, about 3-4 minutes.
Add tomatoes and bay leaves. Simmer covered on low, at least 1-1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Add half & half, oregano and parsley, cook 2 minutes longer.
Serve over pasta of your choice, top with parmesan if desired.

Description: 
I found the original recipe on SkinnyTaste.com and tweaked it to this, which my wife and I enjoy over and over.   This sauce freeze's well for later re-heating, but in our house, it never makes it to the freezer.
