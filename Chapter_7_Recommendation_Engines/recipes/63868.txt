Ingredients:
Crust:
1 egg white
3/4 cup ground gingersnaps
1 tablespoon butter
Filling:
1 (16 ounce) can BUSH'S® Pinto Beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
2 tablespoons molasses
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar, firmly packed
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
Topping:
3/4 cup low fat granola

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut an 8 x 12 inch piece of wax paper and moisten one side with water. Press wax paper, wet side down, into an 8 x 8 inch glass baking dish. Let longer sides of paper extend up sides of the baking dish to help with removal. Lightly spray the wax paper and sides of the pan with non-stick spray.
For crust, stir together egg white, gingersnap crumbs and butter until combined.  Press into pan, using back of a greased spoon. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until firm. Remove pan from oven and cool.
For filling, puree BUSH'S(R) BEST Pinto Beans with buttermilk in a food processor until smooth. Transfer to mixing bowl and add eggs, pumpkin puree, molasses and vanilla. Beat with hand mixer on high for one minute. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, salt and clove. Sift mixture into filling and beat for one minute on high. Pour filling onto the prepared crust and sprinkle granola on top.
Bake 40-45 minutes, or until inserted knife comes out clean. Cool completely, and lift from pan using the ends of the wax paper. Cut into 12 bars and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
