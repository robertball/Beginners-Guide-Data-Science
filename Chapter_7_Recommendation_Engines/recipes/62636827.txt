Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, beaten
1 1/2 cups milk
1/4 cup butter or margarine

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda and salt; mix well.
Add the milk, vegetable oil, egg, sugar and vanilla and mix well. Let the batter sit for 30 minutes.  Preheat a waffle iron. Do not use non-stick spray on the waffle iron; the oil in the batter will allow the waffle to release easily.
Follow the directions on your waffle iron to cook the waffles.
Serve immediately with butter and syrup.
