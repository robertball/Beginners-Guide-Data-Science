Ingredients:
1/4 cup tamari (gluten-free soy sauce)
1/4 cup sesame oil
2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
2 green onions, thinly sliced, divided
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
4 (6 ounce) tuna steaks
2 tablespoons sesame seeds, or to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Whisk tamari, sesame oil, mirin, honey, vinegar, ginger, green onions, and garlic together in a bowl until marinade is evenly mixed. Place tuna steaks in the marinade and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Spread sesame seeds onto a plate. Remove tuna from marinade and discard marinade. Press tuna into sesame seeds until evenly coated.
Heat olive oil in a cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot; cook tuna in the hot oil until cooked to desired doneness, 30 seconds to 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
This is a combination of two fabulous marinades. My kids absolutely love it and ask for me to make it all the time!  And, just by using a gluten-free soy sauce, the entire recipe is gluten free! Serve with wasabi paste and rice.
