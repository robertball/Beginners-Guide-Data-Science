4 tablespoons margarine
1 onion, chopped
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
4 cups water

2 pounds cod fillets, cubed
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter or margarine in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until tender. Add the potatoes and water and simmer for 20 more minutes, or until potatoes are tender.
Add the creamed corn and milk, stirring until smooth. Finally, add the fish, stir well and allow to heat through, about 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
Quick and very simple chowder. Eat as your main course or as a side dish. I will sometimes add shredded carrot with the potatoes, just for eye appeal. It does not change the flavor.
