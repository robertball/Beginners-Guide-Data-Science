Ingredients:
4 boneless pork chops
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic (optional)

Directions:
Combine the pork chops, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, vegetable oil, and garlic in a large resealable plastic bag. Squeeze as much excess air from bag as possible. Marinate in refrigerator 4 to 24 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Remove the pork chops from the marinade directly to the grill. Discard the marinade.
Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a variation of the 'Tangy Chicken' recipe here on Allrecipes.com. It's fast and easy. It makes the chops very juicy and tender. You may be put off by the lemon, but you really don't taste it that strong, it's overpowered by the Worcestershire Sauce. It seems the acid in the lemon helps make the more meat tender and helps the flavor soak in. The garlic is just a hint also, not too strong at all! Garlic powder could also be used.
