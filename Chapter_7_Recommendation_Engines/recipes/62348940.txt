Ingredients:
27 oz. Whole Green Chilis, Hatch if you got 'em
2.5 lb. Tillamook Monterey Jack Cheese
1 or 2 14.5 oz. Mexican style stewed tomatoes, whole or large cut
6 eggs
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Grease 13 x 9 & preheat oven to 350*.  Drain chilis & tomatoes.  Squeeze/pinch all the juice you can out of each individual veggie.  Blot the veggies with paper towels...Make sure they are as dry as you can get them without pulverizing them!!  Slice cheese into 1/4 inch slices.  Beat eggs in small bowl & add sour cream, mix well.  Layer ingredients in this order..cheese, green chili, 1/2 of egg/sour cream mixture, tomatoes, cheese, green chili, other 1/2 of egg/sour cream mixture, tomatoes and finish with another layer of cheese on top.  Bake for 30-45 min or until bubbly & slightly brown.  Serve hot & it's really good the next day too.  Dry veggies are the key or you will have runny spots.  I think you can tell the difference between Tillamook & cheap brands, so use Tillamook.  Use tomatoes according to personal taste, I've used 2 cans but I think I prefer 1 can.
