Description: 
A quick, simple, and nutritious salad! Balela is a Middle Eastern salad with chickpeas, black 
beans, parsley, and spices. There are variations that use mint, cumin, and other flavorings, but 
this one is pretty basic. Feel free to experiment! The salad is very healthy with plenty of protein
 and fiber from the beans. Serve with good rough peasant bread and red wine.
