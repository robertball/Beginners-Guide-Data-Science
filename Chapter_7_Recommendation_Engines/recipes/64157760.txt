Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, diced
10 oz all purpose flour (2 cups)
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
5 oz cheddar cheese, grated
3 scallions, chopped
5 tbsp butter, cubed
2/3 cup heavy cream (plus or minus a tablespoon)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Cook the bacon in a skillet until crisp, then drain on a paper towel and let cool completely.
Whisk to combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Stir in the cheddar, scallions, and bacon.
Work the butter cubes in with your fingertips, until you get pea sized pieces of butter coated in the flour mixture. Make a well in the center and pour in the heavy cream.
Stir to distribute (and do not overstir or the scones will get tough). The scones will be a little crumbly but should press together well.Turn the dough out onto a piece of parchment paper, and use your fingers to press it into a big rectangle. Then cut into triangles.
Bake for 20 to 23 minutes, until the edges are crisp but the interior is still moist (the best way to tell is to taste). Enjoy, preferably while they're still warm
