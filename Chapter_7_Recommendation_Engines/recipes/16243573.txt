Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter, softened
1 tsp salt, or to taste
1 tsp ground black pepper, or to taste
8 ears fresh corn

Directions:
Cut 8 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil into 12x8-inch rectangles.  Spread softened butter evenly over each sheet of foil, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides.  On each sheet of foil, sprinkle 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over butter.  Place 1 ear of corn in center of each fiol sheet.  Wrap foil around corn, twisting ends to seal.
Cook, covered with grill lid, over medium-hot coals (350F to 400F) 15 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally, until desired degree of tenderness.
