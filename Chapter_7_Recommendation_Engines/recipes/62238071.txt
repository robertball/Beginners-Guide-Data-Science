Ingredients:
9 lasagna noodles
1 lb ground chuck or lean ground beef
16 oz part-skim ricotta cheese
4 c mozzarella cheese, shredded, divided
2 eggs, beaten
1 Tbl garlic powder
2 tsp onion powder
2 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried parsley
1 tsp ground cayenne pepper
10 oz frozen chopped spinach, thawed
1 jar Prego Italian Sausage pasta sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Cook noodles according to package instructions (it helps to add a little olive oil to the water to prevent the noodles from sticking, reducing the likelyhood that the noodles will tear).
Brown and drain the ground chuck and put on a plate with a paper towel under the beef to absorb excess oil.  Put aside.
In a large bowl, combine ricotta cheese, 3 c mozzarella cheese, the eggs and all the spices.  Mix well.  Set aside.
Spray a lasagna dish, lightly, with nonstick cooking spray.  Place 3 noodles, side by side, in the bottom of the dish.  Top with 1/2 the ricotta mixture, 1/2 the ground beef, 1/2 the spinach and 1/3 the pasta sauce.  Repeat, creating another layer of noodles, cheese mixture, beef, spinach and pasta sauce.  Top with remaining 3 noodles and then remaining 1/3 of pasta sauce.
Cover tightly with foil and bake in preheated oven for 1 hour.  Remove from oven and sprinkle with remaining 1 c of mozzarella cheese.  Replace foil and let the lasagna sit for 1 hour.
