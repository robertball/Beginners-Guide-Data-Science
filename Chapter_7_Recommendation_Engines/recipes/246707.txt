Ingredients:
4 lobster tails
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup red guajillo chile sauce (such as HerdezÂ®)
1 tomato, diced, divided
3 green onions, chopped
1/4 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
8 (6 inch) flour tortillas
1 small avocado, sliced
1/2 cup shredded lettuce

Directions:
Preheat a lightly oiled grill pan over medium-high heat.
Cut lobster tails in half lengthwise along the spine. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Grill until slightly charred and shells are bright in color, about 5 minutes. Remove lobster meat from the shells and chop coarsely.
Combine chile sauce, 1/2 the tomato, and green onions in a large bowl. Mix in chopped lobster meat.
Divide Colby-Monterey Jack cheese evenly among tortillas. Top each tortilla with some of the lobster mixture. Fold tacos over and grill until cheese melts and tortillas are lightly charred, about 1 minute per side. Garnish with remaining tomato, avocado, and shredded lettuce.

Description: 
Disappointed by restaurant lobster tacos, I created this recipe for great at-home lobster tacos my family enjoys. I used my grill pan for cooking inside.
