Ingredients:
1 ½ cups lentils
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon chile powder
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
½ teaspoon ground cloves
½ teaspoon ground allspice
2  bay leaves
2 tablespoons olive oil
5  tomatoes, pureed
2 tablespoons ginger paste
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons white sugar
salt to taste
1 cup heavy whipping cream
6 tablespoons butter
1  lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Soak lentils in a saucepan of water for 1 hour. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes. Drain.
Heat cinnamon, chile powder, coriander, cumin, turmeric, nutmeg, paprika, black pepper, cayenne, cloves, allspice, and bay leaves in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Stir olive oil into the skillet. Add tomatoes, ginger paste, and garlic; simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Stir in sugar and salt. Cook until mixture thickens into a pulpy sauce, about 5 minutes. Add lentils and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir cream and butter into sauce. Cook until sauce thickens and lentils are very soft, about 30 minutes. Squeeze some lime juice over each serving.

Description: 
This is my adaptation of Dal Makhani. This is a slightly sweet and savory version compared to the tomato-based versions out there - it reminds me more of what you would get in a restaurant. I use sugar, cinnamon, and more butter than other offerings in my version. I always make my version of Coconut Chicken Curry when I make this recipe. This dish pairs well with a rice side; I prefer basmati rice, particularly as a pilaf. It also pairs well with naan bread.
