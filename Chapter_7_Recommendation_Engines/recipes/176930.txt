Ingredients:
1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese
1 Fuji apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
3/4 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
1/4 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
8 thin slices French bread

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat source.
Toss together the goat cheese, apple, thyme, oregano, and pepper in a bowl; set aside. Arrange the bread slices on a baking sheet; toast the bread under the broiler until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
Sprinkle the goat cheese mixture evenly over the bread slices. Return bread to oven to broil until cheese is softened, about 1 minute more.
