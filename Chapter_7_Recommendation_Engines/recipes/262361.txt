6 tablespoons nutritional yeast

1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Slice tofu into 1/4-inch slabs.
Place nutritional yeast on a plate. Mix in garlic powder, salt, and pepper.

Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over low to medium heat. Add tofu slices; cook until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
Firm tofu breaded with nutritional yeast then pan-fried until golden brown. Creates a crispy breading. Great with hash browns and toast for a weekend breakfast, lunch, whatever! My daughter likes to dip this in ketchup. Excellent in a sandwich. For a low-fat version you can also bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) on a nonstick baking sheet for 15 to 20 minutes.
