Description: 
I've made the original to this recipe before and it is great. I made these changes to use up some items I had in the pantry and refrigerator. With the changes I made to this recipe it is no longer vegan but still a nice healthier pudding that whips up in no time.Modified from: Chocolate-Banana Tofu Pudding
