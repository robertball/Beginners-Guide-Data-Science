Ingredients:
2 strips bacon, finely chopped
2 medium onions, finely chopped
2 stalks celery, finely chopped
1 large carrot, finely chopped
6 garlic cloves, minced
2 pounds ground beef chuck
Coarse salt and ground pepper
2 cups milk
Pinch of ground nutmeg
1 cup dry white wine
2 cans (28 ounces each) crushed tomatoes in puree

Directions:
1.	In a Dutch oven, cook bacon, onions, celery, carrot, and garlic over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes.
2.	Add beef; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring and breaking up meat with a spoon, until browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
3.	Raise heat to high. Add milk and nutmeg; cook, stirring frequently, until milk has evaporated, 6 to 8 minutes. Add wine; cook, stirring frequently, until wine has evaporated, 6 to 8 minutes.
4.	Stir tomatoes into beef mixture; simmer gently over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally and adding water as needed to prevent sauce from becoming too dry (1 1/2 to 2 cups total), until sauce is thick and beef is very tender, about 2 hours. Season with salt and pepper.
