Ingredients:
1 lb rice flour
2 cups of warm water
Pinch of salt
Banana leaves or parchment paper

Directions:
Add the flour and salt to a medium bowl; make a well and add the warm water. Knead the
mixture into an evenly textured dough.
2.	We use a special mold to create a stringer-noodle, but you also can use a potato
ricer for this. Line the bottom of a steamer tray with banana leaves or parchment paper. Squeeze the dough through the mold or ricer into the steamer tray, allowing the noodles to form a layered spiral 4-5 inches in diameter.   Continue making the hoppers and filling the tray(s) until the dough has been used up.
Steam the rice hoppers for 10 minutes in a steamer.  Remove the hoppers and arrange them
on one side of a serving dish next to Azalinaâ€™s Mint Curry. To eat in the traditional style, eat with your hands and use the hoppers to scoop up the curry.
