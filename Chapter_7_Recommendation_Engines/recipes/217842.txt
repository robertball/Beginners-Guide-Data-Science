Description: 
I lived in southern California for many years. Around Cinco de Mayo, there would be fiestas in our neighborhood. Vendors sold grilled corn on the cob prepared with butter, mayonnaise, cotija cheese, chile powder and a lime wedge.  They were so delicious!  After moving, we'd crave this corn, so I altered the recipe using canned corn and  mixed in the same ingredients for a similar treat that doesn't require an outdoor grill.
