Ingredients:
1/3 cup prepared teriyaki sauce
1/2 cup candied pineapple, roughly chopped
1/3 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/3 cup chopped yellow bell pepper
3 tablespoons chopped green bell pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 pounds ground pork

Directions:
In a medium bowl thoroughly combine teriyaki sauce, pineapple, bell peppers, salt and pepper. Add pork and gently bring all the ingredients together with your hands; do not over-work the meat. With dampened hands, form pork mixture into 4 patties of even thickness, or make 6 smaller patties, if desired. Transfer patties to a lined baking sheet, cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Light the grill or preheat the broiler. Cook patties, turning each carefully with a spatula once, for about 6 minutes per side, or until just cooked through.
