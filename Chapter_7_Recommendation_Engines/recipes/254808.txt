Ingredients:
2 pounds beef short ribs, cut flanken-style
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons steak seasoning
1/3 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 tablespoons maple syrup
2 tablespoons cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Season short ribs with sugar and steak seasoning; rub over both sides.
Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, maple syrup, 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, sesame oil, ginger, and red pepper flakes together in a small bowl to make marinade.
Pour marinade into a large resealable plastic bag. Add short ribs. Seal and let marinate in the refrigerator, 1 to 4 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove short ribs from marinade; discard marinade. Grill short ribs until well-browned, about 3 minutes per side.
