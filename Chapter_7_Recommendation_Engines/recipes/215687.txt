Ingredients:
2 large zucchini, halved and quartered
1 1/4 pounds lean ground turkey
1/2 small green bell pepper, finely chopped
1/4 onion, finely chopped
1 egg
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons steak seasoning (such as Montreal Steak SeasoningÂ®)
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 cup salsa
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Scoop flesh out of zucchini using a spoon, creating boats.
Mix turkey, green bell pepper, onion, egg, bread crumbs, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, garlic, steak seasoning, cumin, and thyme together in a large bowl. Fill zucchini boats with turkey mixture. Cover with salsa and Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until turkey is no longer pink in the center and zucchini is very tender, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
My picky teens who hate zucchini love this hearty main dish. And I love it because it gives me one more way to use up the overabundance of zucchini from my garden.
