Ingredients:
1 or more potatoes. depends on the size you are making. Eggs. I use pre-beat eggs, but the fresh eggs in shell would be best. garlic, olive oil, pan france. Tomato, ripe!
Salt and pepper to taste.

Directions:
Heat a frying pan and at some olive oil and crushed garlic(I love garlic). You could use butter as well. Slice potatoes thin to you'r liking. Once the oil is hot add the potatoes and remove garlic before it burns. Just before the potatoes are done add the beaten eggs. You can whisk some milk or anything you want to the eggs to add fluff or flavor, etc.
Pour the eggs into pan and cook on a md flame. heat slowly or it will burn. When the top is just about firm, invert to a plate and slide the unckooked side back into pan. When it is cooked(some like a little raw in the center, but not me)remove to a plate and slice.
While this is heating warm the bread in oven. I add butter or olive oil as well as garlic to the bread.
Serve the tortilla in small slices on a slice of french bread but first, if you want, squeze some tomato onto the bread. I add an avacado slice to myn.
This is great served with a few shrimp that have ben cooked in a bit of butter or olve oil and garlic.
