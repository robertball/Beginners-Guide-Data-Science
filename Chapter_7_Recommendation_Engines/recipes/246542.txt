Ingredients:
15 spears fresh asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces, or more to taste
1 tablespoon butter, softened, or as needed
3 slices bread, divided
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
4 ounces processed cheese food (such as VelveetaÂ®), cubed

Directions:
Bring 1/2 inch water to a boil in a saucepan. Add asparagus, cover, and steam until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Spread a thin layer of butter onto each bread slice. Cut bread into cubes.
Stir cream of mushroom soup, processed cheese food, and 2/3 of buttered bread cubes together in a bowl; stir in asparagus. Transfer asparagus mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with remaining bread cubes.
Bake in the preheated oven until bread is golden brown, about 20 minutes.
