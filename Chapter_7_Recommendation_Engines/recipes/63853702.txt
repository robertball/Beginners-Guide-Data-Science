Ingredients:
Ingredients:
3 pounds bone-in chicken parts, cut into small pieces (excess fat removed)
10 ounces potatoes, cut into big chunks
2 carrots, cut into big chunks
1/2 large onion, cut into big chunks
4 - 5 plump garlic cloves
2 - 3 thinly sliced ginger pieces
2 scallions, cut into 2-inch lengths
Sauce:
2 tablespoons Korean red chili pepper flakes (gochugaru)
1 tablespoon sugar
4 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons rice wine
1 tablespoon honey or corn syrup
2 tablespoons Korean red chili pepper paste (gochujang)
pinch pepper
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon sesame seeds

Directions:
To make this dish on the stove, add 1-1/2 cups water to a large pot along with the chicken and the sauce (except the sesame oil and sesame seeds). Stir well. Bring it to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the vegetables (except the scallions). Cover, and cook for an additional 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Continue to cook, uncovered this time, until the chicken is tender and the sauce is slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in the scallions, sesame oil and sesame seeds right before turning off the heat.
