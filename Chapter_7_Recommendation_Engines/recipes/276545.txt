Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups peeled and cubed potatoes
1 pound ground beef
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 onion, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 (10 ounce) package frozen corn
3 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 cup shredded Emmentaler cheese
3 tablespoons taco sauce
2 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces
1/2 cup milk
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 25 minutes.
While potatoes are cooking, cook ground beef in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add taco seasoning and stir until meat is coated; set aside.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper and cook until slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in frozen corn, water, and tomato paste. Bring to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Transfer corn mixture to a shallow baking dish and spread to cover the bottom. Top with seasoned meat.
Drain potatoes. Add Emmentaler cheese, taco sauce, and butter and mash with potatoes. Add milk, salt, and pepper, mash until smooth, and spread on top of seasoned meat.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes begin to brown, about 30 minutes.
