Ingredients:
1 tbl. salt
5 or 6 cloves of garlic
Freshly  ground pepper to taste
1/4 tsp. of dried thyme
2 or 3 tbl. of good olive oil
2 good sized sprigs of rosemary
Lemon juice from one freshly squeezed lemon
1 chicken, cut into separate pieces (wings, thighs, legs, etc.)

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper, thyme and mix in the olive oil and lemon juice.
Separate the rosemary leaves from their stems.
Peel the garlic cloves.
Place the rosemary leaves and the garlic cloves in a food processor and chop until the ingredients are blended fairly well.
After you've done that, take the garlic and rosemary mixture, and stir into the olive oil and lemon mixture.
In a small roasting pan, add about a half cup of good white wine. Note: you can save yourself some cleanup time by coating the pan with nonstick cooking spray.
Bed the chicken pieces within the pan.
Spoon the olive oil, lemon and rosemary mixture over the chicken pieces that you've placed in a small roasting pan.
Bake covered at 325 degrees for about 50 minutes. Toward the last 20 minutes of roasting, remove the pan cover to brown the chicken.
