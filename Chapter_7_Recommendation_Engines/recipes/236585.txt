Description: 
Skinless, boneless chicken breasts are split and stuffed with mushrooms, ricotta, and feta cheeses and marinated artichokes and sprinkled with Italian seasonings and Parmesan! To add Italian flair, serve the chicken over pasta with your favorite sauce. Make sure the mushrooms are sliced thin, and don't rinse the artichoke hearts, just drain them. You can substitute goat cheese for the feta cheese.
