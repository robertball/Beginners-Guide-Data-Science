Ingredients:
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon sugar-free syrup
1 teaspoon EV coconut oil

Directions:
In a bowl, mash the cream cheese with beaten eggs, about 1 teaspoon at a time at first, until the mixture is smooth and free of lumps. Beat in the cinnamon and sugar-free syrup.
Melt the oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. When the oil has stopped foaming, reduce heat to medium-low, and pour in several tablespoons of the batter. Swirl to coat the bottom of the skillet. Allow to cook until set, about 4 minutes on the first side; flip the crepe with a spatula and cook the other side until the crepe shows small browned spots, 1 to 2 more minutes.

An alternative to crepes made with flour, these easy, thin pancakes contain eggs but no sugar or wheat flour. Cream cheese is the magic that holds them together. Serve with your favorite filling or just top them with sugar-free syrup.Modified from: Low Carb Pancake Crepes
