Ingredients:
3/4 cup shortening
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 cups milk
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups sifted all-purpose flour
4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup flaked coconut
1/3 cup corn syrup
2 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9 inch round layer cake pans.
Separate eggs reserve 2 of the egg whites for the frosting. Cream shortening, add 1 1/2 cups of the sugar, beaten egg yolks, and 1 egg white; continue beating until well combined.
Sift flour with baking powder and salt, mix with coconut and add alternately with milk and the almond extract to the shortening mixture. Pour batter into the prepared pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Let cakes cool then remove from pans. Ice with Angel icing and sprinkle with shredded coconut on top and sides of cake after icing.
To Make Angel Icing: Place the 2 egg whites, 3/4 cup white sugar, corn syrup, water, cream of tartar and salt in a double boiler over hard boiling water.  Start beating right away with a beater until the mixture stands in stiff peaks.  Remove from heat and add vanilla or your choice of flavoring and keep beating until it is thick enough to spread easily. Spread over cooled cake.
