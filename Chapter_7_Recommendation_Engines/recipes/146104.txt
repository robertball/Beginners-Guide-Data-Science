Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2 inch slices
1/2 cup favorite barbecue sauce
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon chili powder
4 cups zucchini, sliced 1/4-inch thick
1/2 cup red onion, sliced 1/4-inch thick, rings separated
1 (16 ounce) can BUSH'S速 Dark Red Kidney Beans, drained and rinsed
Salt and pepper, to taste
16 12x16 pieces of foil, folded in 1/2
8 12x16 pieces of parchment paper, folded in 1/2

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F or heat grill to medium high.
Season chicken with salt and pepper. Toss with 1/2 cup barbecue sauce.
Combine garlic, olive oil and chili powder. Toss with sliced zucchini, onions and kidney beans.
Open a double layer of foil; place a piece of parchment paper on top. Fold paper in half and open again.
Scoop 1/8 of bean mixture on each package, then place chicken on top. Drizzle remaining juice from bean mixture on top of each piece of chicken.
Fold the paper and foil in half (it should close like a book). Crimp edges starting at the edge of foil, twisting completely to seal. The packages must be tightly sealed so they will capture the steam created when cooking.
Place packages on a baking sheet; do not overlap or let them touch. Bake until chicken is completely cooked, approximately 15 minutes. To grill, place in a single layer over medium heat; cover and let cook until packets puff up and the chicken is completely cooked, approximately 15 minutes.
