Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups finely chopped fresh pineapple
1/2 red bell pepper, cut into small dice
3 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
3 green onions, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 1/4 pounds sea scallops
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Combine pineapple, bell pepper, cilantro, green onions, and lime juice in medium bowl; set aside.
In another bowl, coat scallops with oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Heat a heavy non-stick skillet over high heat until very hot.  Add scallops to the hot skillet; cook, turning once, until scallops are well seared on both sides and cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to a plate; set aside.
Pour salsa into the hot skillet; cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Serve scallops with warm salsa alongside.
