Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
Filling:
1 (12 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups shredded sweetened coconut
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix 1 1/2 cups flour, butter, brown sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a bowl using a pastry blender until crumbly. Pat crust mixture into a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle chocolate chips over crust and return to the hot oven until chips are softened, about 1 minute. Remove from oven and gently spread softened chocolate over the crust. Leave oven on.
Beat eggs in a bowl until light and frothy; add shredded coconut, 2 tablespoons flour, vanilla extract, baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Spread egg mixture over the chocolate-covered crust.
Bake in the hot oven until light golden and center is set, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow to cool completely, at least 1 hour. Cut into 1x3-inch bars.
