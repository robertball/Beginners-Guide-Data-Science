Aunt Mazo's Dessert Recipe

Ingredients:
4 (14 ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk
4 pints heavy whipping cream
1 (4 ounce) jar maraschino cherries
1 cup chopped almonds

Directions:
Remove labels from the cans of milk and put them unopened into a large pot of gently boiling water. Boil for about 3 hours. Make sure the water doesn't boil away or the cans will explode (or so I'm told).
After 3 hours, take the cans out and cool in fridge.
When chilled, open the cans and put the results into a bowl.
Beat the whipping cream, and fold into the "caramel sauce" (cooked, cooled condensed milk). Mix in the nuts and cherries.

Submitter: 
Gratefoole
Description: 
The richest dessert I've ever tasted! A sort of a caramel pudding. It's so rich you'll probably only want a small serving . . . You can substitute Cool Whip for the real whipped cream if you want to save some calories, fat, and/or money in this recipe. (The way it stands, it costs over $15.00 to make!)
