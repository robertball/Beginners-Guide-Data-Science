Ingredients:
3 eggs
100 grams (3.5 ounces) of cream cheese
a pinch of salt
½ teaspoon baking powder (can be excluded)

Directions:
oopsies
6–8 depending on size.
Separate the eggs, with the egg whites in one bowl and the egg yolks in another.
Whip the egg whites together with the salt until very stiff. You should be able to turn the bowl over without the egg whites moving.
Mix the egg yolks and the cream cheese well. If you choose, add the psyllium seed husk and baking powder (this makes the Oopsie more bread-like).
Gently fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mix – try to keep the air in the egg whites.
Put 6 large or 8 smaller oopsies on a baking tray.
Bake in the middle of the oven at 150° C (300° F) for about 25 minutes – until they turn golden.
