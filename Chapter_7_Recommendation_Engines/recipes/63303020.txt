Description: 
Brunch is always a fun dish to serve on a Sunday afternoon for friends and family. I could do this every day, but for most people the weekends are the best time to get together. I love that these  are fast and take very little overseeing! If you're like me then you will enjoy not just eating, but making this frittata too!
