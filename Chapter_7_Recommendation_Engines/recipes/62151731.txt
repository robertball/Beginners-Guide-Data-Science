Description: 
My friend Sandra used to have a cafe in Phoenix, AZ. This was the most popular salad on the menu. She served it with spring salad mix topped with goat cheese and dried cranberries. I use romaine with mandarin oranges. Be creative and don't skip the surprise ingredient called for in the recipe.
