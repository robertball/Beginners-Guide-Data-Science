Description: 
My 6-year-old, who is incredibly picky, describes this as 'alicious.' Two nights ago, we were at the tail-end of our food and I decided to throw some things together and experiment. I didn't expect the kids to like this, but to my surprise, we had it two nights in a row. They LOVE it.
