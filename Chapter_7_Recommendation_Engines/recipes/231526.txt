Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) boneless fully cooked ham
1/4 cup honey, warmed
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup prepared horseradish
1/4 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut ham into 1/4-inch thick slices and tie slices back together in shape of original ham, using kitchen string. Place ham on a rack set in a roasting pan.
Stir honey and cloves together in a bowl and drizzle honey mixture over ham.
Bake ham in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes, basting often with pan drippings.
Mix brown sugar, horseradish, and lemon juice together in a bowl. Baste ham with horseradish glaze, allowing glaze to drip between slices.
Continue baking until glaze has set, ham has browned, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the sliced ham reads at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), 25 to 30 more minutes.
