Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
1 shallot, sliced
2 tbsp.  fresh lemon juice
2 tsp. dijon mustard
2 tsp. red wine vinegar
salt and pepper
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
12 large eggs
12 oz. baby spinach
2 large heads frisee, chopped(about 5 cups)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Grease a 12-cup muffin pan; set aside. Arrange bacon on an 18" by 12" jelly-roll pan and roast for 5 minutes. Add shallot to pan; roast 5 more minutes or until the bacon is crisp.
Meanwhile, in a 1-quart saucepan, heat 2 cups of water to a boil. Drain the bacon on paper towels. Let cool slightly, then crumble.
In a blender, puree the shallot, lemon juice, dijon, vinegar, 1 tbsp. water, and 1/4 tsp. each salt and pepper. With the blender running, drizzle in oil.
In the muffin pan, add 2 tbsp. boiling water to each muffin cavity. Crack one egg into each, then add enough boiling water to cover the eggs. Bake for 7 minutes or until the whites are set and the yolks begin to thicken.
While the eggs bake, toss the spinach, frisee, bacon, and dressing in a bowl until fully mixed. Divide among 12 plates.
Run a thin bladed knife around the edges of the eggs. With a slotted spoon, lift out each egg; quickly drain, still in the spoon, on a paper towel, then place on the salad. Serve hot.
