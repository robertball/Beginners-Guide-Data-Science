Ingredients:
For the Cake:
2/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup shortening
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup milk
1-2 cups Heavy whipping cream
3 Tablespoons sugar
1 1/2 quarts fresh or frozen strawberries, sliced
2 bags strawberry gel

Directions:
In a bowl, cream together sugar and shortening. Add egg and vanilla; beat well. Combine dry ingredients and add alternately with milk to the creamed mixture. Spread in a greased 9 inch square baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. Cool on wire rack.
Cut into nine servings horizontally and fill with whipped cream and strawberries. Replace top of cake; garnish with more berries and a dollop of whipped cream, (Instead of making 9 servings I cut the cake across horizontally, take the top layer off and add the strawberry/glaze mixture, put top of cake back on and top with remaining strawberry/glaze  mixture and top with whipped cream). Mae the strawberry mixture by adding desired glaze to strawberries.
To Make Homemade Whipped Cream:
Place metal mixing bowl and metal whisk in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes. Put sugar and whipping cream in bowl, whisk until stiff peaks form.
