Ingredients:
4 celery ribs, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
2 tablespoons butter
6 cups cubed day-old bread
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a small skillet, saute celery and onion in butter until tender. In a bowl, combine the bread cubes, celery mixture, salt and pepper; set aside.
Cut a lengthwise slit down the center of each tenderloin to within 1/2 in. of bottom. Open tenderloins so they lie flat; cover with plastic wrap. Flatten to 1/2-in. thickness. In a large skillet, brown pork in oil on both sides over medium-high heat.
Spoon stuffing onto one tenderloin. Top with the second tenderloin; tie with kitchen string. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until a meat thermometer inserted into the meat reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
For an impressive entree that goes together with ease, you must try my Moms tenderloin. Sauteed veggies keep the bread stuffing moist, and the pork is so flavorful. --Lois Frazee, Gardnerville, Nevada
