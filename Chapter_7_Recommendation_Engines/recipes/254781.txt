Ingredients:
3 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
1 bay leaf
1/2 cup soy milk (such as Silk速)
2 tablespoons vegan mayonnaise (such as Vegenaise速)
2 tablespoons vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance速)
1 tablespoon vegan grated Parmesan-style topping (such as Go Veggie速
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potato chunks and bay leaf into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
Combine soy milk, vegan mayonnaise, vegan margarine, Parmesan-style topping, salt, and pepper in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second intervals until margarine is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.
Pour soy milk mixture over potatoes in the bowl; mash until smooth with a potato masher.

Description: 
As I recently became vegan, I remembered the creaminess of dairy mashed potatoes. I was not satisfied with other vegan mashed potato recipes, so I created my own. These are as good, if not better, than the mashed potatoes I used to make. No one would ever believe they are vegan.
