Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) pork tenderloin, cut into 1 inch cubes
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1 green onion, chopped
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 dash soy sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (12 ounce) package square wonton wrappers
1 egg white, beaten
2 quarts peanut oil for frying

Directions:
Combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, lime juice, crushed red pepper, sesame oil, and soy sauce in a food processor. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Pulse until pork is minced to the consistency of ground beef.
Separate the wonton wrappers and lay them out on a clean surface. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the pork mixture into the center of each wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water, fold over the filling to form a triangle, and press together to seal. Brush each wonton with egg white.
Pour the peanut oil into a large pot and preheat to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Gently drop wontons into the hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove to paper towels to drain.
