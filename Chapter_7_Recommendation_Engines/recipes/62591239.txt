Ingredients:
1 lb of stir fry meat
1 container of mushrooms. ( I like mushrooms so I usually get 2 thingys)
2 cans of beef consume
1 regular container of sour cream
1 bag of No Yolks Broad noodles

Directions:
Brown beef with a table spoon of butter.  Add mushrooms when beef is browned and cook mushrooms until they a slightly soft.  Sprinkle beef and mushrooms with a teaspoon of flour and cook for about 3 minutes.  Add consume bring to a boil and then simmer for a couple hours.  I usually use just a can of consume and use red wine.  After the meat and mushrooms have simmered for a couple hours add the sour cream.  I put the noodle in the same time as sour cream and viola!
