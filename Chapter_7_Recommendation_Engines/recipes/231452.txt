Ingredients:
1 cup dried black-eyed peas
4 cups water, or as needed to cover
1 tablespoon soy margarine
1 turnip, peeled and chopped
1 bunch collard greens, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tomatoes, chopped
1 tablespoon balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing
1 tablespoon olive oil (optional)

Directions:
Place black-eyed peas into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse.
In a large pot, cover black-eyed peas with fresh water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until peas are tender, 40 to 60 minutes. Drain.
Heat soy margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Add turnip and collard greens; cook for 2 minutes.
Stir black-eyed peas, garlic, and tomatoes into collard mixture; cook and stir until collards are tender, about 5 minutes.
Season with balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil.
