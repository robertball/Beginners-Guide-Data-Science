Ingredients:
1 cup GOYA® Pico de Gallo Salsa
1 (15.5 ounce) can GOYA® Low Sodium Black Beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro
4 (10 inch) GOYA® Flour Tortillas Burritos
1 teaspoon GOYA® Extra Virgin Olive Oil
GOYA® Salsita (optional)

Directions:
Using small-hole strainer, drain liquid from Pico de Gallo Salsa; discard liquid. Transfer remaining tomato mixture to medium bowl. Mix in black beans, cheese and cilantro until combined.
Divide black bean mixture evenly over half of each tortilla (about 1/2 cup each). Fold tortillas in half.
Heat large griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Brush with oil. Place filled tortillas on griddle. Cook, carefully flipping once, until tortillas are golden brown and crisp and cheese filling melts, about 5 minutes.
Cut quesadillas into wedges. Serve with your favorite GOYA® Salsita variety, if desired.
