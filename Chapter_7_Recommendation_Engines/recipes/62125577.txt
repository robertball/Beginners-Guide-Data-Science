1 medium/large onion, finely diced
1 can low sodium chicken broth
Water to cover
1 can Corned Beef, broken up
Salt & Pepper to taste

Description: 
This is my family's version of Corned Beef Hash because it is not hash as much as it is a stew or soup.  It's great on cold nights, when time's short, or even camping.  Serves up great with hot biscuits.
