Ingredients:
Dough:
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup warm water (100 to 110 degrees F)
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
6 3/4 cups bread flour, divided
Praline-Cream Cheese Filling:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 large egg
1 cup finely chopped pecans, toasted, divided
Creamy Vanilla Glaze:
3 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons butter, melted
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 tablespoons whole milk, or more as needed
purple, green, and gold/yellow sparkling sugars

Directions:
Combine sour cream, 1/3 cup sugar, butter, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring, until butter melts, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; let mixture cool to 100 to 110 degrees F, about 15 minutes.
Stir together water, yeast, and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in a 1-cup glass measuring cup; let stand for 5 minutes.
Combine sour cream mixture, yeast mixture, eggs, and 2 cups of the flour in the bowl of a heavy-duty electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat at medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low; gradually add 4 more cups of flour, beating until dough comes together.
Turn dough out onto a surface dusted with 1/4 cup of the flour. Knead, gradually adding remaining 1/2 cup flour, 2 tablespoons at a time, until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Dough should be tacky but release easily from surface.
Place dough in a well greased bowl; turn to grease top. Cover; let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Beat cream cheese, sugars, cinnamon, and vanilla with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Beat in egg.
Gently punch dough down; divide in half. Roll 1 portion out into a 22x12-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Keep the other portion covered. Spread 1/2 of the filling over rectangle, leaving a 1-inch border. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup pecans. Carefully roll up, starting from a long edge.
Place roll, seam-side down, on a large parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bring ends of roll together to form a ring. Moisten ends with water; pinch together to seal. Repeat with remaining dough, filling, and pecans. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Uncover dough rings.
Bake in the preheated oven until cakes are a deep golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool cakes completely on wire racks, about 1 1/2 hours.
Stir confectioners' sugar, melted butter, and vanilla extract together to make the glaze. Stir in 3 tablespoons milk. Add additional milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, until pourable but still opaque. Pour evenly over cakes. Sprinkle with sparkling sugars, alternating colors to form bands.
