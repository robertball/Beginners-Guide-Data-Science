Ingredients:
cooking spray
8 tablespoons pumpkin puree
1/3 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 2/3 tablespoons water
1 egg
7/8 cup almond flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 7x3-inch loaf pans.
Mix together pumpkin puree, sweetener, vegetable oil, water, and egg in a large bowl.
Whisk together almond flour, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger in a separate bowl. Stir into pumpkin mixture until just blended. Pour into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of each loaf comes out clean, about 50 minutes.
