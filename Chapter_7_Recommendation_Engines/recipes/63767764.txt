Ingredients:
2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/4 teaspoon sugar
3/4 cup hot water
1 3/4 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons italian herbs (basil, oregano, thyme & rosemary)

Directions:
Preheat oven at 500°F.
Dissolve yeast and sugar in water; allow to rest for 8 minutes.
In the meantime, combine flour, salt and Italian seasoning.
Pour yeast over flour mixture and mix well with a heavy spoon.
Turn dough on to a floured surface and knead for 2 minutes, dusting more flour on surface if needed.
Using a rolling pin, roll dough into a 12" circle of even thickness (about 1/4") flipping over to roll each side (don't press too hard when rolling or dough may stick to surface).
Cut off any excess edges to make a neat circle.
Palm down, slide your hands under dough and lifting carefully place on to a greased pan or hot pizza stone.
Bake at 500°F for 4 minutes.
Remove from oven and top with your favorite toppings (don't go too crazy with the toppings if you want crust to remain crispy).
Return to oven for 6-8 minutes
