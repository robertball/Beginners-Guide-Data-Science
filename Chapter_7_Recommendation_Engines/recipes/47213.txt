Ingredients:
8 cups spelt flour
1/2 cup sesame seeds
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon blackstrap molasses
2 teaspoons baking soda
4 1/4 cups milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, mix together the spelt flour, sesame seeds, salt, molasses, baking soda and milk until well blended. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.
Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. Placing a tin of the same size over the top of the loaf while baking gives it a lovely crust.
