Ingredients:
1/2 cup pineapple juice
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon dry mustard
1 (4.5 pound) butt-end smoked ham
1 (15.25 ounce) can pineapple rings, drained
1 (4 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, drained
1/4 cup whole cloves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Whisk pineapple juice, brown sugar, and dry mustard in a bowl until brown sugar has dissolved.
Place ham in a baking dish with cut side down and arrange pineapple rings and maraschino cherries onto the ham; secure with toothpicks if needed. Push cloves into ham and baste ham and fruit with pineapple juice glaze.
Bake in the preheated oven until glaze has baked onto ham, 1 1/2 to 2 hours; baste with glaze every 30 minutes.
Turn on oven's broiler.
Broil ham until the glaze forms a crust and the pineapple slices are browned, about 5 minutes.
