Ingredients:
2 tsp olive oil, or vegetable oil
4 slice(s) uncooked turkey bacon, diced
1/2 cup(s) (chopped) uncooked onion(s), diced
2 cup(s) uncooked asparagus, fresh, or frozen and thawed, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 spray(s) cooking spray
6 slice(s) reduced-calorie whole wheat bread
4 large egg(s)
5 large egg white(s)
3/4 cup(s) fat-free skim milk
2 tsp Dijon mustard
1/2 tsp table salt
1/4 tsp black pepper, freshly ground
2 Tbsp grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 cup(s) low-fat shredded Cheddar cheese, about 4 oz

Directions:
Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add onion and asparagus; saut√© until vegetable are soft, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove vegetables from pan and set aside.
Preheat broiler.
Off heat, coat same skillet with cooking spray. Arrange bread slices tightly in bottom of skillet.
In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, egg whites, milk, mustard, salt and pepper; pour over bread and allow milk mixture to soak in entirely (like when you make French toast). Sprinkle bread with 1 tablespoon of Parmesan cheese.
Place skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Cook, shaking pan frequently to promote even cooking, until almost cooked through to the top, about 4 or 5 minutes.
Place skillet under broiler to set eggs, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from broiler; top with bacon-vegetable mixture, cheddar cheese and remaining tablespoon of Parmesan cheese. Place skillet under broiler again until cheese melts, about 1 to 2 minutes. Slice into 6 pieces and serve. Yields 1 piece per serving.
