Ingredients:
5 thick slices bacon, diced
1 cup beef stew meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
1 pound lamb stew meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
1 pound pork stew meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 onions, chopped
1 bulb garlic, peeled and minced
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
3 tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1 cup red wine vinegar
1 (14.5 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes
5 cups beef stock
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
1/2 tablespoon salt
3 cups water
2 red bell peppers, chopped
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 parsnip, chopped
3 stalks celery, chopped
4 carrots, chopped
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 medium head cabbage, chopped
1 cup green peas

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium high heat, fry the bacon for 5 to 10 minutes, or until well browned. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon from the skillet and set aside. In small batches, saute the meat in the bacon fat until browned. Use a slotted spoon and set the stew meats aside as well.
Melt the butter in the bacon fat in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute for 5 minutes. Stir in the flour, caraway seeds, paprika and crushed red pepper flakes. Stir for two minutes until all the flour is dissolved. Whisk in the vinegar and tomato. The mixture should be very thick.
Next, pour in the beef stock, beer, salt, water, red bell peppers, reserved bacon and reserved meat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 45 minutes. Stir in the potatoes, parsnip, celery and carrots and continue to simmer, covered, for 30 more minutes, or until all vegetables are tender.
Stir in the breadcrumbs until stew has thickened. Add the cabbage and peas and simmer for 5 more minutes. (Note: For best results, allow soup to cool slightly, then refrigerate overnight and reheat before serving.)

Description: 
I made this up one day. It takes a lot of work, but makes a lot of stew, and the leftovers just taste better and better each time you try it.
