Ingredients:
3 whole chicken breasts
1 c. water
1 c. dry sherry
1½ t. salt (optional)
½ t. curry powder
1 med. onion chopped
½ c. diced celery
1 lb. fresh mushrooms
1/4 c. butter or margarine
1 box Uncle Ben's mixed wild rice
1 c. sour cream*
1 can cream of mushroom soup**
*Light sour cream works just fine.
**Lower sodium soup may be used if preferred.

Directions:
Put chicken in kettle, add water, sherry, salt, curry powder, onion, celery. Cover tightly and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour. Remove from heat and strain broth. Refrigerate chicken and broth at once. When chicken is cool, remove from skin and bones and cut into bite sized pieces.
Slice and saute mushrooms in butter until golden brown. Use broth (skimmed for fat)to cook rice (2 c. as directed on Uncle Ben's box). When rice is done, combine all ingredients and heat uncovered in 300° oven for 20 minutes. If prepared after refrigerating, heat in 350° oven for 20 min. or until bubbly. Pimento may be added for color.
Nice served with broccoli and spinach/fruit salad and crusty rolls.

Description: 
This is great for unexpected company because it freezes well. Pauline was a co-worker (now deceased)who was a fantastic cook. She gave me this recipe at least 25 years ago, and the dish has always been a hit throughout the years.
