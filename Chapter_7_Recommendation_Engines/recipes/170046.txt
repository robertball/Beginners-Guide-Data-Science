Ingredients:
8 slices bread
3 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup low-fat milk
1 cup butter, melted
2 cups white sugar
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks, undrained
3 tablespoons powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Cut the bread into 1 inch pieces and place on a baking sheet.  Toast for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned.  Remove from oven and reserve.
Beat the eggs, milk, butter, and sugar in a large bowl until well combined.  Stir in the undrained pineapple and the toasted bread cubes and toss until coated.  Pour mixture into the prepared pan.
Bake until puffed and golden, about 45 minutes.  Serve warm with a sprinkle of powdered sugar for garnish.
