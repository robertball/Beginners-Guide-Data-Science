Description: 
This recipe originated with my husband's family, but we've made it our own by blending the fruit instead of keeping it chunky and adding strawberries. It's such a huge hit with family and company every Christmas.  Makes enough punch for two separate occassions for us: one party and lounging around Christmas eve.
