2 1/2 cups almonds, finely ground
1 small lemon, zested and juiced

Place the confectioners' sugar, egg yolks, and eggs in the bowl of an electric mixer, and mix on Medium-Low until well combined. Stir in the the ground almonds, lemon zest, and enough lemon juice to make a thick, smooth batter.
Place the batter into a cookie press with a 1/4 inch star-shaped tip, and press out a 6 inch lines of batter. Cut the batter into 2-inch sticks,or form into rings or letters, and place them on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are crisp and light brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool.
Place 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar in a fine mesh sieve, and lightly dust the cookies before serving.

Description: 
This is a small, crisp delight.  This is one of the recipes that Grandma Krupitza brought from Austria about 100 years ago.  We generally serve these at the holiday season.
