Ingredients:
2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
Dash cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp paprika
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
5 tbsp unsalted butter
1 cup buttermilk or 1 cup milk and 1 tbsp lemon juice, mixed
1/2 cup snipped chives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, baking soda, cayenne, paprika, and cheese.  Blend thoroughly.  Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal.
In a small bowl, combine buttermilk and chives.  Add to dry ingredients and stir to make soft dough.
Turn out dough onto floured surface and knead until it just comes together.
Drop dough by the serving spoon full onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until light golden brown.  Remove to a wire rack to cool slightly, then serve still warm.
