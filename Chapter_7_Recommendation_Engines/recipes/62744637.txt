Ingredients:
1-1/4 cup white sugar
1-1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
pinch of salt, about 1/8 teaspoon or less
1 ounce unsweetened chocolate, about two squares, melted
4 tablespoons butter, melted
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup milk (whole or skimmed)
1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
1-1/2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup strong brewed coffee, chilled; original blend or vanilla flavor

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
Grease an 8" square pan, metal or glass.
Melt chocolate and set aside.
Melt butter and set aside.
In a large bowl, mix 3/4 cup white sugar with the flour, salt, and baking powder.
Add the melted butter and melted chocolate, vanilla, and milk.
Stir gently but thoroughly to incorporate all the ingredients.
Pour the batter into the greased pan.
Pour the 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar evenly over the top of the batter (you can mix the two, if you like).
Dust the cocoa powder on top of the sugars.
Pour the cold coffee evenly all over the top of the cake and allow to soak in; do not stir.
Bake for 30 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
