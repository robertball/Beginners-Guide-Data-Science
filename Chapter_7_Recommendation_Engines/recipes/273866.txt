Ingredients:
aluminum foil
3 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 onion, sliced
2 fresh beets, peeled and cubed
2 peeled carrots, cut in half crosswise, then quartered lengthwise
1 bell pepper, sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, or as needed
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Lay out several pieces of aluminum foil.
Combine potatoes, onion, beets, carrots, bell pepper, and garlic in a large bowl. Season generously with salt and pepper. Drizzle generously with olive oil. Add balsamic vinegar; mix well.
Place vegetables on the aluminum foil. Wrap well, using at least 2 pieces of foil so the liquid does not leak out.
Place on the preheated grill. Cook for 15 minutes. Flip and cook for another 15 minutes. Continue cooking until the vegetables are fork-tender, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
My dad would make the most wonderful grilled vegetables that he pulled straight from his garden. Every summer I crave these, so I figured out how he made them, and I added a few personal touches. You can use some or all of these vegetables, and you can add some of your own, but the thing that brings it all together and makes it special are the beets.
