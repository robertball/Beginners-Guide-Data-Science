Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
1 pastry for a 9-inch deep-dish pie crust
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain well and let cool.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry.
Mash sweet potatoes with a potato masher or fork. Measure 1 3/4 cup of the mash into a large bowl. Add milk, sugar, eggs, butter, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Beat with a rotary beater until mixture has the consistency of cake batter. Pour into the pastry-lined plate.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool until center is set, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is simply the best-tasting sweet potato pie our family has ever eaten. We don't like the pies that have an orange or lemon bite to them. This pie tastes sweet, nutty, and earthy. Serve slightly warm or cold, topped with whipped topping, alongside a warm beverage like hot tea, coffee, hot chocolate, or apple cider. So awesome!
