Ingredients:
1 cup millet, rinsed
2 cups water
1 onion, thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 pinch sea salt
2 cups chopped fresh spinach
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2 tablespoons chopped toasted almonds

Directions:
Bring millet to a boil in a pot of lightly salted water. Boil 1 to 2 minutes, and reduce heat to low. Simmer, without stirring, until millet is dry and fluffy, about 20 minutes.
Heat another pot over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in coriander, ginger, cumin, turmeric, and salt. Add spinach and a splash of water; steam until wilted, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and coconut milk. Adjust seasonings to taste. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors meld, 10 to 15 minutes.
Serve curry over the millet and garnish with toasted almonds.

Description: 
This curry is so simple, and yet so tasty and nutritious. It is vegan and oil free, but so satisfying from the fat content of the coconut milk.
