Ingredients:
2 tablespoons lard
2 large onions, finely sliced
2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 tablespoons Hungarian paprika
1 cup water, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt lard in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in hot lard until soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes.
Stir beef and paprika into onions. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Add 1 cup water and simmer, adding more water if moisture gets too low, until meat falls apart and onion sauce is thick, about 1 hour more. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
