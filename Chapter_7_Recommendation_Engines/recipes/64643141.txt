Ingredients:
3 russet potatoes, rinsed and scrubbed clean4 strips bacon, cut into 1" pieces1 onion, chopped1/4 c. water2 cloves garlic2 green onions, sliced1/2 tsp. smoked paprikaKosher saltFreshly ground black pepper4 eggs1 c. shredded Cheddar

Directions:
Chop potatoes into small cubes, about 3/4"-thick.Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and fry until crispy. Turn off heat and transfer bacon to a paper towellined plate. Keep most of bacon fat in skillet, removing any black pieces from the bacon.Turn the heat back to medium and add onion to the skillet. Saute, stirring occasionally, until onions begin to soften. Add potatoes and toss until evenly coated in bacon fat. Pour in water and cover skillet with a large lid. (This helps speed up the cooking and prevent burning.) Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes, checking the potatoes occasionally. If they start to brown too quickly, remove the lid and add more water.When the potatoes are tender, remove lid and stir in garlic, green onions, and paprika. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Using a wooden spoon, make four holes in the potatoes to reveal bottom of skillet. Crack an egg into each hole and season each egg with salt and pepper. Sprinkle cheese and cooked bacon bits over the entire skillet. Replace lid and cook until eggs are cooked to your liking, about 5 minutes for a just runny egg. Serve warm.
