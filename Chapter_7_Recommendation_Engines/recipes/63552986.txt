Ingredients:
2 c. Medjool dates, pitted
1 c. raw almonds
2 1/4 c. raw cacao powder
1 c. shredded unsweetened coconut, plus extra for garnish
1/2 c. cocoa nibs
1/2 c. raw agave
2 t. vanilla extract
1 t. salt

Directions:
1. In a 350 degree oven, toast coconut on a cookie sheet for 7 minutes, stirring with a spatula every minute so that it doesn't burn.
2. In a food processor, blend the dates and almonds. Add cacao powder and blend until incorporated.
3. Move cacao mixture into a bowl and fold in remaining ingredients.
4. Roll truffle dough into Tablespoon-sized balls, coat in extra toasted coconut and place on a parchment-lined cookie sheet.
5. Place truffles in the fridge or freezer to harden (about an hour) before packing.
