Ingredients:
2 eggs
2 tsp. sugar
1 cup milk
1 tbsp. vanilla
1 cup flour
1/4 tsp. salt
Cooking oil for deep-frying
Icing:
2 cups icing sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
1-3 tbsp. water

Directions:
Beat eggs and sugar (I use the small glass bowl that came with my electric mixer).
Stir in milk and vanilla.
Mix flour and salt; add to batter and beat until smooth.
READ the next instructions thru before starting the frying part!
Heat 1" of oil to 365 degrees in an electric skillet (or a deep-fryer if you have one).
Place rosette iron in hot oil & heat well. Shake off excess oil.
Quickly dip iron in batter, 3/4 up on sides of iron (do not let better run over the top of iron or rosette will be stuck onto the iron!). Don't hold iron in batter too long or iron cools and batter falls off.
Immediately place back into hot oil; loosen rosette with fork and remove iron.
Fry 1-2 minutes per side or until golden.
Remove to a wire rack covered with paper towel.
Repeat with remaining batter; stirring batter occasionally and removing lumps.
For icing, mix sugar, vanilla and enough water to make a dipping consistency.
Dip edges of rosettes into icing; dry on wire racks.
Any broken ones are fair game for the cook to claim!
Makes about 4 dozen.

Description: 
These crunchy, delicate, deep-fried goodies are a little labor intensive, but a traditional treat that everyone will appreciate. My great grandma was the rosette maker in our family and I've inherited her rosette iron! Dipping the edges in icing is optional.
