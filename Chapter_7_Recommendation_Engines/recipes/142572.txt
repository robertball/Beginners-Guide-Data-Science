Ingredients:
Sweet Onion Slaw:
4 cups packaged coleslaw mix with carrots
1 large sweet onion, thinly sliced
1/2 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
1/2 yellow bell pepper, cut into thin strips
1/2 cup Ranch salad dressing
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon lime juice
Pork Tenderloin:
1/2 cup hickory-flavored barbecue sauce
2 chipotle chiles packed in adobo sauce, minced*
2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins
2 tablespoons garlic-flavored oil

Directions:
For Slaw, combine coleslaw mix, onion and bell peppers in large bowl. Combine dressing, cilantro and lime juice in a small bowl; toss dressing mixture with coleslaw mixture just until all ingredients are well coated. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to serve.
For pork, prepare grill with medium-hot fire. Combine barbecue sauce with chipotle chiles. Brush tenderloin with garlic-flavored oil. Grill 8 minutes per side, or until meat thermometer inserted in thickest part reads 150 degrees F. Brush tenderloin generously with barbecue sauce mixture and grill a couple more minutes, about one minute per side. Let tenderloin stand 5 minutes before slicing.
To serve, place slaw in center of platter. Surround with sliced tenderloin. Remaining sauce can be served at the table.
