Ingredients:
1/2 cup 	(125 mL) corn starch
1/2 cup 	(125 mL) icing sugar
1 cup 	        (250 mL) All Purpose Flour
3/4 cup 	(175 mL) butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Mix corn starch, icing sugar and flour in a large bowl.
Blend in butter thoroughly with large spoon. Work with hands until soft, smooth dough forms. If necessary, refrigerate 1 hour or until easy to handle.
Shape into 1 inch (2.5 cm) balls. Place about 1 1/2" (4 cm) apart on prepared baking sheets; flatten with lightly floured fork. Or, roll dough to 1/4" (0.5 cm) thickness; cut into shapes with cookie cutters.
Decorate with candied cherries, coloured sprinkles or nuts, if desired.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until edges are lightly browned. Time will vary with size of cookies.
Remove from sheets and cool completely on wire rack.
