1 package of cole slaw mix (8.5 ounces)
1 can pineapple tidbits, drained (15 ounces)  You can also use the crushed pineapple if you prefer

1/2 cup finely chopped onions
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon dried cilantro (optional)

Directions:
In a larger bowl, mix the coleslaw, pineapple, golden raisins & onions together.
In a smaller bowl, whisk together the remainder of the ingredients to make the dressing.  Mix until nice and creamy.
Pour the dressing over the slaw mix, toss to coat.  This taste best cold, so place in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving. (or overnight)
