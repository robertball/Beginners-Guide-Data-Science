https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup Splenda
1/2 cup Sugar Twin brown sugar substitute
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 cup peanut butter
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour

Directions:
Heat oven to 350ยบ.  Cream butter, sugar substitutes, and brown sugar.  Add eggs and beat well; during beating, add vanilla.  Add peanut butter.  Scrape down sides of bowl and beat another minute.  While beating on slow speed, add baking soda.  Then add whole wheat flour gradually while beating.
Pinch dough out of bowl and casually roll into ball about the size of a walnut.  Place on ungreased cookie sheet, and press a fork into the dough to make a criss-cross shape, slightly flattening the cookie.  Repeat until tray is filled, leaving about 2 inches of space between the cookies.
Bake at 350ยบ for about 10 minutes, being careful not to overbake.  Remove from oven and let set about 1 minute, then remove cookies to cooling racks.
The cookies will be more crisp and crumbly than regular peanut butter cookies.  They obviously aren't as incredible as sugar-laden cookies, but if you haven't eaten a "real" cookie in a while, they're darn good!  Hope you enjoy!
Diabetics or people with other dietary and health concerns should check with a physician to be certain these cookies can be part of their dietary plan.
