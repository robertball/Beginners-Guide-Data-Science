Ingredients:
1 pound thin asparagus spears, tough ends snapped
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons light butter, melted
1/4 cup fat-free sour cream
1 small lemon, juiced

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and place a sheet of aluminum foil on the grate.
While grill is heating, bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Drop asparagus spears into boiling water and stir gently; cook until the asparagus are bright green but still crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.
Drain the asparagus and cool quickly under a stream of cold water.
Place asparagus into a bowl and toss with olive oil, salt, and black pepper.
Place asparagus onto the foil-lined grill grate and cook until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Turn spears over several times with tongs.
Transfer grilled asparagus to a serving platter.
Stir cilantro, light butter, fat-free sour cream, and lemon juice together in a bowl; drizzle over asparagus to serve.
