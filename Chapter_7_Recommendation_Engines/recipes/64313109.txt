Ingredients:
1 pounds Swiss chard, fresh
2 teaspoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
1/2 medium lemon finely grated zest (use all) plus juiced (to taste)
1 clove(s) garlic large, minced
1/4 teaspoon rosemary, dried crumbled
2 chop(s) pork, boneless center loin chop (6 to 8 ounces each)
salt to taste
peppercorns, black
freshly ground, to taste
1 spray(s) cooking spray to coat skillet

Directions:
Trim tough ends off Swiss chard stems, tear leaves from stems, roughly chop leaves, and thinly slice stems.
In a medium bowl, combine 2 teaspoons of the oil, half of the garlic, the lemon zest, and rosemary. Add the pork chops and turn to coat. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
Spray a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Add pork chops and cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until just cooked through (do not overcook). Transfer pork chops to a plate, and cover loosely with foil to keep warm.
Wipe out the skillet, add remaining 2 teaspoons oil, and heat over medium heat. Add remaining garlic and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add Swiss chard stems and cook, stirring, 1 to 2 minutes. Add leaves and 1 tablespoon of water; stir to coat. Cover and cook until leaves are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve pork chops with their juices and chard on the side.
