Ingredients:
8 boneless, skinless chicken tenders
1 1/2 C. coconut milk, divided
1 egg, beaten
1 tsp. sesame oil
1 C. flaked, sweetened coconut
1/2 C. bread crumbs, plain
3 T. flour
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. garlic powder
1/3 C. oil for frying
Dip:
1/4 C. apple or apricot preserves or orange marmalade
1 T. honey mustard
1/4 tsp. hot sauce

Directions:
Combine chicken tenders and 1 C. coconut milk, marinade in refrigerator overnight.
The next day, remove chicken tenders and discard marinade.  Lay chicken strips down and beat thin with a meat mallet or rolling pin.  In a shallow bowl, combine egg, remainder of coconut milk and sesame oil.  In another shallow bowl, combine coconut,  bread crumbs, flour, salt and garlic powder; blend evenly.  Dip each chicken strip in liquid mixture, and then in dry coconut mixture to coat.  Place chicken in a clean dish and transfer to the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, combine dip ingredients and mix well.  Set in refrigerator.
Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Fry chicken strips on each side for about 4 minutes, or until golden brown and center is cooked.  Remove and transfer to paper towel-lined plate to drain.  Serve immediately with dip.
