Ingredients:
2 cups flour
3 large eggs, room temperature
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons water, or as needed

Directions:
Beat flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt together in a bowl. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to flour mixture until a smooth and very thick dough forms.
Turn dough out onto a work surface and knead for 10 minutes. Let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Divide dough into 8 balls and use a pasta machine to roll and cut dough into desired pasta shape.

Description: 
Consistently great and easy pasta dough. This makes really great homemade linguine or ravioli for a manual pasta machine. If its too sticky, just roll a bit in flour. This recipe makes enough pasta for 24 small raviolis or 4 servings of linguine. Whatever pasta you make should take no more than 4 to 6 minutes to boil.
