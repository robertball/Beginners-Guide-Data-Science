Chopped spinach leaves are steamed and then sauteed with olive oil, garlic, spices, and preserved lemons. The resulting cooked salad is garnished with olives and eaten as a dip with Moroccan bread.
The salad can be made spicier by adding minced roasted chili pepper or a small spoonful of harissa.
The preparation is the same as for Moroccan Mallow Salad (Khoubiza or Bakoula).
Serves 3 to 4 as a side.

PREPARATION
Wash the spinach leaves very well several times in a large bowl of water. Drain thoroughly. Finely chop the spinach, place the leaves in a steamer, and steam over simmering water for 15 to 20 minutes, until the leaves darken and are tender.
Squeeze out any excess liquid from the steamed leaves, and transfer the spinach to a skillet. Add the remaining ingredients (except for the olives), stir to mix, and saute over medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes, until the parsley is wilted and the flavors have blended.
