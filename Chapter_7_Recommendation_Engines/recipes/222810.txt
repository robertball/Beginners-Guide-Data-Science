Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package tri-color rotini pasta
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1 green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces

4 ounces Cheddar cheese, cut into 1-inch cubes
4 ounces precooked chicken sausage, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian dressing (such as Ken's Steak House Lite Northern Italian DressingÂ®)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and rinse under cold water.
Mix pasta, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, cherry tomatoes, green bell pepper, green olives, ripe olives, Cheddar cheese, and sausage together in a bowl. Add dressing and toss to coat. Marinate in refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.

Description: 
I needed a quick and easy side dish to take to our friend's house for their son's birthday. This dish needed to be something that would be able to be outside and be pretty, so this is what I came up with. The variety of ingredients all tied together with the salad dressing was perfect, so much so that I took home an empty bowl!
