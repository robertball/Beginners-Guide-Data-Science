Description: 
This tried-and-true recipe is from my grandmother's collection, and it remains my favorite today. This cake tastes wonderful--the apple filling keeps it moist, and the crispy crunch of its nut mixture makes it seem forever fresh. Apple Cream Coffee Cake is always on my menu for brunch, and good for snacking at any time of day!
