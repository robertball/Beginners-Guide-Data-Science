Description: 
Gizzards are inexpensive and very flavorful but can be tough. By cooking them low and slow they become really tender and the south west spices are always a hit in my house. We eat these over rice or in a tortilla like a burrito. If my picky 12 year old likes them and actually requests them on a regular basis then I know it's a winner.
