Ingredients:
8 to 10 baby gold potatoes, unpeeled (or other small potatoes such as baby reds or fingerlings)
2 bone-in pork chops, 1/2" to 3/4" thick
1 15-oz can tomato sauce
2/3 cup heavy cream, or milk to cut calories
1 tablespoon hot water
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon Tabasco Sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
Wash and pierce potatoes and place in a 4 quart glass or ceramic baking dish.
Microwave on high for 4 to 6 minutes, checking after 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, pour the tomato sauce into a large measuring cup or bowl, and then swish 1 tablespoon hot water in the can to get the remaining sauce.
In the same measuring cup, whisk cream, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and Tabasco together with the tomato sauce.
When potatoes are about half-cooked, remove dish from microwave.
Place the chops on top of the potatoes.
Pour the sauce over the chops.
Turn oven down to 425 degrees and place dish, uncovered, in the oven.
Bake for 40 to 60 minutes until chops are no longer pink in the center.
Place chops and potatoes on a platter and serve the sauce in a bowl.

Potatoes and tomato sauce might not be the first combination that comes to everyone's mind, but it did to mine and now this creamy combination is one of my husband's favorites.  Plus, it is a one-pot meal!
