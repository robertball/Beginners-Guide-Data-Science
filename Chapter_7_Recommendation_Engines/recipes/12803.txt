Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 1/2 cups uncooked white rice
1/4 cup butter
1 onion, chopped

1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
In a Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic. Cook until tender about 4 minutes. Add the celery and pepper. Cook for 3 minutes. Do not brown add the flour and stir well. Cook for 3 minutes.
Stir in the milk and bring just to a boil. Season with salt, pepper and hot sauce. Stir in the chili sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning.
Place rice into the bottom of the prepared pan. Arrange the fish fillets over the rice in a single layer. Place the sliced tomatoes over the fish and pour the sauce over the top.
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 20 minutes or until fish is just cooked and flakes easily with a fork.
