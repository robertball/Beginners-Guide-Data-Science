Ingredients:
1-1/2 pounds thick-sliced bacon strips, finely chopped
8 shallots, finely chopped
1 large sweet onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup whiskey (I used Jameson Black Label)
1/2 cup real maple syrup
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
Assorted crackers

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp, allow to cool then crumble into small pieces. Drain on paper towels. Discard all but 2 tablespoons drippings. Add shallots and onion to the drippings; cook over medium heat until caramelized, stirring occasionally.
Stir in garlic; cook 30 seconds. Add seasonings. Remove from heat; stir in whiskey and maple syrup. Increase heat to high; bring to a boil and cook 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add vinegar and brown sugar; cook another 3 minutes, continuing to stir constantly.
Add crumbled bacon; reduce heat to low, and cook 12 minutes, stirring every few minutes. Allow jam to cool slightly. Pulse half of the jam in a food processor until smooth; stir puree into remaining jam. Serve with assorted crackers.

Description: 
Friends of ours have a Bacon Fest every year where people bring dishes to share made with bacon (what's not to love about that).  This was my entry for this past year, the winner hands down.  The nice thing about this are it's many applications for consumption.  I have used it just as a dip, as a spread on burgers, as a spread on English muffins with an egg for breakfast and even mixed it with Neufchatel cheese in a crock pot for an appetizer.
