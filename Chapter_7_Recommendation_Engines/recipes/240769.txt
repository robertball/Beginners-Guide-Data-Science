Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries
1 large orange, peeled
2 cups boiling water
1 cup white sugar
1 (6 ounce) package cherry-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-O®)
1 (14 ounce) can crushed pineapple with juice

Directions:
Process cranberries and orange in a food processor until finely ground.
Stir boiling water, sugar, and gelatin together in a bowl until gelatin and sugar dissolve. Add cranberry mixture and pineapple with juice; stir. Pour into a 8-inch square serving dish, cover the dish with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until set, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This was my mothers recipe, and named by my son because it is so addictive. By replacing the Jell-O® with sugar-free Jello-O®, using no-sugar-added pineapple, and your choice of sugar substitute, this turns into a reduced-carb recipe. If you don't have a grinder, use a blender and water to grind the cranberries, then drain.
