Ingredients:
2 pkg. (4-serving size each) Jell-O Brand Strawberry Flavor Gelatin
1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon
4 cups water
4 medium apples, such as Granny Smith, McIntosh, or Golden Delicious
1/2 cup thawed Cool Whip Whipped Topping
Fresh mint for garnish, if desired

Directions:
Combine dry gelatin mix and cinnamon in 3-to 4-qt. saucepan.  Add water.  Bring to a boil on medium-high heat, stirring frequently until gelatin is completely dissolved.
Peel and core apples.  Add to gelatin mixture in saucepan; partially cover saucepan with lid.  Return to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 10 to 15 min. or just until apples are fork tender and gently turn apples every 5 min.  Remove apples from liquid.
Serve apples warm.  Or, cool and store in tightly covered container in refrigerator at least 1 hour or overnight.  Serve each apple topped 2 tablespoons of the whipped topping.  Garnish with fresh mint, if desired.
