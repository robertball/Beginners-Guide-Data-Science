Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
4 tsp sugar
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
2 1/2 tbsp melted butter
1 cup milk
2 eggs

Directions:
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder and salt together.
Make hole in middle of dry ingredients.
Pour cold milk in and stir hot butter into milk.
Add eggs and beat into milk and butter.
Stir in the flour until completely combined.
Pour onto hot frying pan until bubble start to form, then flip.
If it burns before it starts to bubble then your burner is too hot.
If you have a teflon pan you don't need to use any oil or butter in the pan, the pancakes will not stick.

Description: 
The key to these pancakes is to pour the hot melted butter into the cold milk and stir so that it gets chunky. When they are cooked, the butter melts and creates little butter pockets in each pancake. If you don't like thick fluffy pancakes you can add more milk and thin the batter out.
