Ingredients:
For this dish you will need
Meat ( in my case beef) for 4 tortillas I used  Â½ pound
1 small onion
1 egg
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 clove of garlic
4 tortillas

Directions:
Mix meat with finely chopped onion and finely chopped garlic and add 1 egg. Stir very well, ad salt and pepper; you may add the herbs as well.
Put a thin layer on one part of tortilla and cover with the second and press it a little.
Preheat the frying pan at medium heat, add cooking oil and fry on one side until golden brown, and then turn Cheburek on the other side.
Check that if your meat is cooked (with fork, toothpick), if not cover the frying pan with a lid and turn down the heat to minimum. (Cook for additional 5 min.)
Enjoy!

Originally it was cooked for purposes of preserving the meat of a lamb and this was a good food for travelling at a great distances (The meat could be stored longer).
