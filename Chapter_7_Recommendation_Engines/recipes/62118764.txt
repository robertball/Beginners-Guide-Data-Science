Ingredients:
1 pound hot or mild Italian sausage with casing removed.
1/2 pound ground beef
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped bell pepper
1/4 cup sliced mushrooms
8 ounces tomato sauce
6 ounces tomato paste
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup grated Parmesan Cheese
1/4 teaspoon oregano
1/4 teaspoon rosemary
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
6 slices Mozzarella Cheese
1 large loaf Italian bread
Dill pickle slices

Directions:
Brown the Italian sausage and ground beef together in a large skillet. Add chopped onion, bell pepper and mushrooms. Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, oregano, rosemary, garlic salt, black pepper and Parmesan cheese. Simmer on low heat for 8-10 minutes and make sure not to boil. Cut the Italian bread lengthwise and scoop out some of the center, which can be used later for another recipe. Line the bottom of the bread with 3 slices Mozzarella cheese. Fill the scooped out bread center with the Stromboli mixture and top with the remaining 3 slices Mozzarella cheese. Place the remaining cut Italian bread on top. Wrap sandwich in foil and bake 5-7 minutes in oven at 400 degrees. Remove and let cool for handling, then unwrap from foil. Slice the Italian loaf of bread, filled with the Stromboli mixture, according to the size of sandwich you desire. Serve with side dill pickle slices, the American part of this wonderful Italian-American sandwich.

While visiting the West End section of Birmingham, Alabama, as a child growing up, my grandmother had many Italian-American neighbors and this was one of their favorite shared recipes from the Old Country. A fabulous sandwich!!
