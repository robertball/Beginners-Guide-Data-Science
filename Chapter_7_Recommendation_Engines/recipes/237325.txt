Ingredients:
1 ½ cups white wine
½ cup olive oil
½ cup orange juice
½  yellow onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced
2 tablespoons herbes de Provence
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded to an even thickness
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste

Directions:
Whisk white wine, 1/2 cup olive oil, orange juice, yellow onion, garlic, and herbes de Provence together in a large glass bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours.
Remove chicken from the marinade, shake to remove excess liquid. Season chicken with salt and pepper and let it rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. Discard remaining marinade.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry chicken in hot oil until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
