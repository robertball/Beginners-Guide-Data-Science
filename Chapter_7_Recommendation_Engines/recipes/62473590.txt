Ingredients:
1 deep dish frozen pie crust, thawed
4 slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled – reserve fat
1/2 cup of diced white onion
1 minced garlic clove
4 large eggs
1 cup of half and half
1/2 cup of sour cream
1/2 cup of Swiss or Gruyere cheese, shredded
1/4 tsp. of salt
1/4 tsp. of black pepper
1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper or smoked paprika
1/4 cup of chopped parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425°F.
Cook and crumble the bacon reserving two tablespoons of the rendered fat, discard the rest. Cook the diced onion and garlic in the bacon fat until soft. Set aside to cool.
Prick the bottom and sides of the thawed crust. Bake for 8 minutes while you make the egg custard mixture.
Mix the half and half with the sour cream. Beat the eggs. Incorporate the eggs into the sour cream mixture. Add the shredded cheese, salt, pepper and paprika to the mixture.
Add cooked bacon, onion and chopped parsley to the sour cream and egg mixture.
Remove crust from oven and lower the temperature to 325°F.
Add quiche mixture to crust and return to oven. Bake for 45 – 50 minutes or until custard is set. Depending on your oven you may wish to line the rim of the crust with aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning.
Remove from oven and cool ten minutes before slicing into wedges. Serve with a side salad if desired. Enjoy!

Description: 
I discovered Quiche Lorraine while studying French in high school. After trying many recipes over the years and being dissatisfied with each one I have put my own spin on this classic recipe that results in a crisp crust and tender custard. Bon Appetit!
