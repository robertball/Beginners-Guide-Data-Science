Ingredients:
4 (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
5 teaspoons grated lemon rind
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon water
2 garlic cloves, minced
Cooking spray
4 lemon wedges
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Prepare grill.
Place each chicken breast half between 2 sheets of heavy-duty plastic wrap, and pound to 1/4-inch thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin.
Combine lemon rind and next 6 ingredients (through minced garlic); rub evenly over both sides of chicken. Place chicken on a grill rack coated with cooking spray, and grill 3 minutes on each side or until chicken is done. Remove from heat. Squeeze 1 lemon wedge evenly over each chicken breast half. Sprinkle parsley evenly over chicken.

Description: 
Chicken breasts are pounded thin with a meat mallet or rolling pin to create paillards; the increased surface allows you to use even more of the flavorful rub. From Cooking Light, July 2004.
