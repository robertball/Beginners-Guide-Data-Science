Ingredients:
Tempeh:
1/3 cup water
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon honey
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
1 (8 ounce) package three-grain tempeh, cut into bite-size pieces
Couscous:
2 cups vegetable broth
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
2 1/2 tablespoons curry powder
2 teaspoons salt
1 (10 ounce) box plain couscous
1 onion, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons dried mint

Directions:
Mix 1/3 cup water, soy sauce, honey, 1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder, garlic, lemon juice, and liquid smoke together in a bowl until marinade is smooth; add tempeh and turn to coat evenly. Marinate tempeh, turning frequently, for 20 minutes.
Combine vegetable broth, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 1/2 tablespoons curry powder, and salt in a saucepan with a tight-fitting lid; bring to a boil. Add couscous, cover saucepan, and remove from heat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; add tempeh and marinade. Cook tempeh until browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn and brown the other side, about 5 minutes more. Remove tempeh from skillet.
Pour remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil into the same skillet; cook and stir onion until fragrant and brown, about 4 minutes. Add chickpeas and water; cook and stir using a wooden spoon to break up brown bits of food on the skillet, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
Fold couscous into the onion mixture; add tempeh. Sprinkle mint over couscous; cook and stir until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
This is my favorite way to use tempeh. The honey in the marinade allows the tempeh to caramelize beautifully. You can also add diced red pepper for a little extra color. Serve with pita bread and lentil soup to round out the meal. Serve with additional mint as a garnish.
