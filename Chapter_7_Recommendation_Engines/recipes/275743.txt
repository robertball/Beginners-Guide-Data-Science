Ingredients:
3 cups heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons vanilla bean paste
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Pour heavy cream into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip at medium-high speed until it begins to thicken. Add vanilla bean paste once it starts to thicken. Mix in lemon juice. Pour in sugar and continue mixing until stiff peaks form.

Submitter: 
fleur
Description: 
Thick, heavenly, and quick homemade whipped cream. The lemon adds a hint of light citrus, the vanilla warms and enriches the typically too-sugary treat. By adding these 2 ingredients, I cut the sugar in half!
 Great for French toast, fruit dip, and desserts, or as a base for more elaborate recipes that use cream.
