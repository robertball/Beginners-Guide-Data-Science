Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) tube polenta, cut into 1/2 inch slices
4 plum (Roma) tomatoes, seeded, diced
1 cup diced seedless cucumber
1 (10 ounce) can sliced ripe olives, drained
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven broiler. Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Line the prepared pan with the polenta slices; set aside. Combine diced tomatoes, cucumber, and olives in a large bowl. Add balsamic vinegar, olive oil, oregano, basil, and salt and pepper to taste; mix. Spoon this topping over the polenta slices, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
Broil in preheated oven until the polenta is hot, and the cheese is lightly browned, about 3 minutes.
