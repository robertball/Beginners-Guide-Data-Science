Ingredients:
Dishwasher Salmon:
1 Tbsp. olive oil
4 (6 oz.) salmon fillets
4 Tbsp. lime juice
salt and pepper
aluminum foil
Piquant Dill Sauce:
1 Tbsp. butter
1 shallot, minced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 cups fresh dill, stems removed
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. pepper
1 leek, white part only (washed and finely chopped)
1 jalapeno chili, seeds and membranes removed, finely diced
1 cup chicken stock
2 Tbsp. lemon juice
3 Tbsp. sour cream

Directions:
Cut two 12-inch square sheets of aluminum foil. Grease shiny side with oil. Place 2 fillets side by side on each square and fold up the outer edges (double wrap).
Drizzle 1 Tbsp. lime juice over each fillet. Salt and pepper.
Fold and pinch the aluminum foil extra tightly to create a water-tight seal around each pair of fillets. Make sure it's airtight by pressing gently with hand.
Place foil packets on top rack of dishwasher, run for "pots and pans" cycle. When cycle is complete, take out salmon, discard foil, place one fillet on each plate, and spoon dill sauce on top.
Sauce directions:
Melt butter in pan. Saute leek, shallot, jalapeno, and garlic for 5 minutes (until translucent, not brown).
Reduce heat and add stock. Simmer, uncovered for 15 minutes (adjust heat--liquid should reduce to half).
Transfer to a blender and add dill, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Puree until smooth. Stir in sour cream at last minute.
Serve hot or chilled.
