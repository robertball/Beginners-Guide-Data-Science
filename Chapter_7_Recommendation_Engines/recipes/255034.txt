Ingredients:
6 pounds tomatoes, diced
4 cups white sugar
1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
1/4 cup freshly grated ginger
4 teaspoons ground cumin
4 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Combine tomatoes, sugar, lime juice, ginger, cumin, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and cayenne pepper in a large, heavy-bottomed pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until tomatoes are broken down into a thick sauce, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.
Pour into sterilized jars; tightly screw on lids. Turn jars upside down to stand on their lids; cool completely. Refrigerate.

Description: 
This tomato chutney recipe is easy to make and tastes great just on crackers. As this chutney disappears instantly with my family and friends, I always like to make a large amount (but there is still never enough to satisfy the demand).
