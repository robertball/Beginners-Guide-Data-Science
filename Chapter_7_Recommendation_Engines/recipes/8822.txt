Description: 
It is easy to prepare and everyone I have made it for really likes it! Serve with bread and your favorite vegetables, if desired. (Note: You can also use 2 pounds of chicken breast meat instead of a whole chicken; I like to cook my chicken ahead of time and freeze it, so that it is even quicker to make when I'm ready).
