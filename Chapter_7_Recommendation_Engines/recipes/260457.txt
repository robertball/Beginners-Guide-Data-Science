Description: 
For years, any time my mum makes her baked beans people ask for the recipe. There are rarely any leftovers, and the first thing people will ask at get-togethers is 'Who made the baked beans?' These baked beans are so simple to make, and so delicious you'll wish you would have doubled the recipe! 
I tried tweaking the recipe once...the family consensus was 'Don't EVER mess with the recipe again.'
