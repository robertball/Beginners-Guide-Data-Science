Ingredients:
1/3 cup fresh or frozen cranberries, chopped
2 tablespoons orange marmalade
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
2 pork chops
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Generously grease a 9x9 inch glass baking dish.
In a bowl, mix cranberries, marmalade, and cloves.  Make a pocket in each pork chop by cutting into pork toward the bone; fill pockets with cranberry mixture.
Place the pork chops in prepared baking pan.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Spoon 1 tablespoon honey over each chop.  Bake uncovered about 45 minutes or until pork is no longer pink in the center.

Description: 
Sweet orange marmalade enhances the flavor of the tart cranberries in this wonderful dish.  For a more intense flavor, use 1/4 cup dried cranberries or cherries instead of fresh or frozen cranberries and do not chop.
