Ingredients:
12 slices Wonder® Classic White Bread
1 (9.75 ounce) can white chunk chicken breast, drained
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3 drops hot pepper sauce
1/2 cup finely chopped green bell pepper
1/3 cup shredded carrot
1/4 cup finely chopped red onion
2 tablespoons light mayonnaise
Salt and pepper, to taste
1/4 cup sliced toasted almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Wonder Bread Croustades: Cut crusts from Wonder Bread and flatten with a rolling pin until quite flat, about 1/8-inch thick. Cut circles from the bread with a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. (You can cut 2 circles from each slice of bread.)
Lightly brush mini-muffin pan with melted butter. Gently press each round of bread into a mini-muffin cup, forming it into a bowl shape. Repeat, making as many Croustades as specified in the recipe.
Bake about 9 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
Cool slightly, then remove the Croustades from the pan and allow them to cool completely on a wire rack.
Chinese Chicken Salad: Place remaining ingredients, except almonds, in a mixing bowl and blend together.
Fill Croustades and top with toasted almonds.
When serving, plan on 2 filled Croustades per serving.

Submitter: 
Wonder® bread
Description: 
Baked until hot and crispy, these bread cups are the perfect 'bowl' for your favorite filling. Make appetizer Croustades in mini-muffin pans or main dish Croustades in regular muffin pans. Either way, they'll not only taste good, they'll help your family feel good, too. Because now, just two slices of Wonder Classic White Bread have as much calcium as eight ounces of milk.
