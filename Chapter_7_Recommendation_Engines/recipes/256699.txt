Ingredients:
1 pound brown sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup brewed coffee
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (12 ounce) bag chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Beat brown sugar, oil, and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir flour, coffee, salt, baking soda, and vanilla extract into creamed sugar mixture until batter is just mixed; fold in chocolate chips and walnuts. Spread batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to crisp and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
