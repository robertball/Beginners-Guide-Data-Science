Ingredients:
1 pound dried red kidney beans, rinsed
2 quarts water
1 Moroccan-style preserved lemon, or to taste
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
1 small red chile pepper, halved lengthwise
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon anise seed

Directions:
Place kidney beans into a large container and cover with about 1 quart water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain.
Combine beans, 1 quart water, preserved lemon, sugar, black pepper, red chile pepper, bay leaf, garlic powder, and anise seed in a stockpot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover stockpot, and simmer for 1 hour.
Remove lemon, bay leaf, and red chile pepper from bean mixture. Mash about 10% of the beans against the sides of the stockpot using the back of a spoon. Cover stockpot and simmer for 45 minutes more.
Remove cover from stockpot and simmer beans until beans are thickened and water is evaporated, about 15 minutes more.

Description: 
This recipe is incredibly simple to make, and it's fat-free, yet these are the most delicious beans I've had. The secret ingredient is the salt-preserved lemon, a flavor like no other. Serve hot in small bowls as a side dish or snack. Good with eggs, tortillas, or other Mexican food. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator.
