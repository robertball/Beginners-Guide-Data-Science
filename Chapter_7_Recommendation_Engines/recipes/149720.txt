Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegan margarine
1 cup brown sugar, not packed
1/4 cup soy milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup shortening
5 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Stir the margarine and brown sugar together in a pan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, and cook for 1 minute until dark brown. Remove from heat, and whisk in the soy milk and vanilla extract until smooth.
Beat the shortening together with 2 cups confectioners' sugar in a mixing bowl until well blended. Continue beating, and gradually add the brown sugar mixture, alternating with the remaining confectioners' sugar.

Description: 
This is a rich, caramely buttercream frosting, which pairs perfectly with a simple chocolate cake, or frost an apple cake for a sweet Autumn treat. This icing can also be made with standard ingredients such as milk and butter. It makes enough to frost one two-inch layer cake, or 24 cupcakes.
