Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked brown rice
water
1/2 pound collard greens, chopped
2 cloves garlic, peeled
1 (10 ounce) package frozen okra
1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped, with liquid
1 chayote squash, diced
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon dried dill weed, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
1 (16 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
all-purpose flour, or as needed

Directions:
Bring brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.
Place collard greens and 2 peeled whole garlic cloves in a pot; add enough water to cover. Boil until collards are tender, about 15 minutes. Drain.
Combine okra, tomatoes, chayote squash, and 2 crushed garlic cloves in a separate large pot; bring to a boil and cook until okra has thawed, about 5 minutes. Reduce to a simmer; season with ground ginger, dill weed, ground cumin, and cilantro to taste. Add collard greens; simmer until flavors have blended, at least 40 minutes (1 hour for best flavor).
Mash kidney beans together with tomato paste in a bowl; add to the stew. Stir in cooked rice and mix well. Add a spoonful of flour to thicken, if desired. Adjust seasonings to taste.
