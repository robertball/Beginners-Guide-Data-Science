Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut in half
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon seeded, minced serrano chile
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
1 cup green peas
1 cup corn
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
10 cups chicken broth
4 Yukon Gold potatoes, cut in half
1 cup uncooked white rice

Directions:
Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat.  Stir in the onion, garlic, and serrano chili; cook until the onion has softened, about 1 minute.  Add the chicken, and continue to cook for 5 minutes.
Stir in the cilantro, peas, corn, and red pepper; cook for 1 minute.  Pour in the chicken broth, potatoes, and rice.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the chicken is opaque and the potatoes are tender, about 40 minutes.
