Ingredients:
9 lasagna noodles
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
2 cups milk
1 pound kielbasa
1 (20 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained
8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In a blender or with an electric mixer, blend mushroom soup, cream of chicken soup and milk until smooth.  Cut sausage in half lengthwise and slice thinly.
In a 9x13 inch dish, layer 1 cup soup mixture, 3 noodles, half the sauerkraut, half the sausage and a third of the cheese.  Repeat.  Top with remaining 3 noodles and remaining soup mixture.  Cover with foil.
Bake in preheated oven 25 minutes, then uncover and bake 15 minutes more.  Sprinkle with remaining cheese when still hot.
