Ingredients:
butter-flavored cooking spray
1/3 cup chopped almonds
1/3 cup shredded coconut
1/3 cup dried cranberries
1 cup fat-free, reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 cup uncooked couscous

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium heat and grease with cooking spray. Add almonds; cook, stirring constantly, until slightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add coconut; cook and stir until almonds and coconut are fully toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cranberries; cook until cranberries are heated through, about 1 minute more.
Bring chicken broth to a boil in a pot. Remove from heat and add couscous. Stir, cover, and let sit until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the almonds, coconut, and cranberries; stir to blend.
