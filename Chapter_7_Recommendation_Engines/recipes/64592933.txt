Ingredients:
2 Tbsp olive oil, or more to taste
3 extra large red bell peppers, seeded
1 extra large yellow bell pepper, seeded
1 large red onion, sliced into eighths
2 garlic cloves, peeled
2 very ripe roma tomatoes, diced
1 bunch fresh basil
1/3 cup  dry white wine
1/3 cup black and green Italian olives
1Tbsp fresh oregano
1 fresh (small) cayenne pepper, optional
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut bell peppers into one-inch pieces.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add oil. When warm, add onion and garlic. Sauté until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add bell pepper pieces and mix with onion and garlic.
Continue cooking until onion becomes translucent, about  7 more minutes. Add wine and mix. Add tomatoes and mix.
Reduce heat to allow a simmer. Once the tomatoes have begun to soften, add the fresh herbs and olives. Stir.
Allow to simmer, stir occasionally, until the bell peppers have softened.  Season with chopped  fresh cayenne pepper, salt and pepper as desired.
Serve warm. This is even better the next day!

Description: 
Camilla’s version of a Sicilian contorno (meatless side dish) made with bell peppers, onion, garlic, and fresh herbs. It's usually made in large quantities so there will be leftovers to toss with either pasta or rice the next day. It can be made either in the oven or on the stove-top. This is the stove-top version.
