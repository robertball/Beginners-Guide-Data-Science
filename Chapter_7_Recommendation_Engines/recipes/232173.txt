Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk chocolate chips, or more to taste
12 ice cream cones
1/2 cup miniature marshmallows, or more to taste
12 12x12-inch squares of heavy-duty aluminum foil

Directions:
Place about 1 teaspoon chocolate chips into an ice cream cone, followed by a layer of mini marshmallows. Continue layering chips and marshmallows into the cone until full. Repeat with remaining chips, marshmallows, and cones.
Wrap each cone tightly in aluminum foil.
Heat the foil-wrapped cones in a campfire until chocolate and marshmallows are melted, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
These s'mores are neater and easier to make than traditional s'mores. We love making them while camping or sitting around the fire pit. The quantity can easily be adjusted to suit your needs.
