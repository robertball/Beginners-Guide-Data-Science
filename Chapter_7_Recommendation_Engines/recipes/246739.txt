Ingredients:
2 cups water
2 cups white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
2 drops rose water (optional)
1 pinch saffron (optional)
1/2 cup instant dry milk powder (such as Carnation®)
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon unsalted butter (such as Land O'Lakes®)
2 tablespoons plain yogurt
2 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes.
Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined. Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until dough comes together. Let gulab dough rest for 5 minutes. Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough. When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 1 minute before coming to the surface, the oil is ready.
Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully, until dark golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining gulab.
Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab. Remove from heat and let them soak in the syrup, covered, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
