Ingredients:
1 cup olive oil
2 lbs. onions finely cut (6 cups)
1 cup garlic, finely chopped (3 head)
6 quarts tomato puree
5 6-oz. cans tomato past (Optional depending on thickness of tomato puree)
1/3 cup dried oregano
¼ cup dried basil
4 bay leaves
¼ cup sugar
2 tablespoons salt
1-4 jalapeño peppers, ground (blended with tomato puree)

Directions:
To make tomato puree:  Quarter tomatoes and press lightly in pot to create enough juice that tomatoes won’t burn.
Cook until tomatoes are soft and have made a lot of juice.
Pour into colander set in a large bowl so that the clear tomato liquid drains away.  (This clear liquid can be canned [seasoned or not] for soup starter.)
Put tomato pulp into blender and blend in small batches then run it through the food mill.
Method:
Heat oil until a light haze forms over it.
Add onions and cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently for 7-8 minutes or until soft but not browned.
Add garlic- cook additional 1-2 minutes.
Stir in tomatoes, paste, oregano, basil, bay leaves, peppers, sugar and salt.
Bring to a boil then turn heat very low and simmer, uncovered for 40 minutes.
