Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 cup Fiber One
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. paprika
3/4 tsp. black pepper
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
Pulse Fiber One in a food processor until blended - you want it a little chunky, but fine enough to be able to stick to the chicken with ease.
Place Fiber One granules into a bowl and mix with salt, pepper, and paprika.
Add buttermilk to separate bowl.
Coat pan with cooking spray.
Wearing latex gloves, dip chicken breasts one at a time into the buttermilk until completely submerged, then into the Fiber One crumbs.  Coat well and place into pan.  Repeat for each chicken breast.
Cover pan with aluminum foil and bake for fifteen minutes.  After fifteen minutes, remove foil and bake for ten additional minutes or until chicken reaches internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit and the chicken crust is crispy.  Enjoy!
