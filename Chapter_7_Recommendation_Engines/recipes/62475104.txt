Ingredients:
1 recipe for flaky pie crust or prepared flaky pie crust
3 eggs
200 ml of heavy cream
1 tablespoon of parsley
1 cup of cubed sweet pancetta (or cubed thick-cut bacon)
1 large or 2 small garlic cloves
1 3/4 cup porcini mushrooms
100 grams of swiss cheese
ground Parmesan cheese
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 180C  or 350F.
Start the garlic in a pan with a little bit of olive oil, the mushrooms, and the pancetta.  Let simmer over a low heat for about 10 minutes to let the pancetta cook and the flavors blend.
Grease a 9 inch pie pan and lay in your pie dough.
Meanwhile, mix the eggs, heavy cream, parsley, and chopped swiss cheese together in a bowl (adding one thing at time).
Remove the garlic from the pan of mushrooms and pancetta and add the mixture to the other bowl with the eggs.
Mix lightly and pour into pie crust.  Dust with parmesan cheese (lightly!) and bake for 20 minutes.

Description: 
This quiche makes a fantastic addition to any brunch. We use unsmoked pancetta for a smoother flavor, but I'd imagine you could also use thick cut bacon. We love it! :)
