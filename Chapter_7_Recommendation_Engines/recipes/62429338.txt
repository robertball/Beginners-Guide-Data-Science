Ingredients:
Dozen chicken wings (roasters if you can find them)
Juice from 1 lime
Juice from 1 lemon
Juice from 1 orange
1 teaspoon of salt
2 teaspoons of black pepper
1 tablespoon of fresh thyme
1 tablespoon of chopped garlic (do not use powder)
1 tablespoon of chopped ginger (do not use powder)
1 habanero pepper (remove seeds and inner
membrane)and chop into cubes
1 tablespoon of curry powder
1/2 teaspoon of allspice
1/4 teaspoon of fresh ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
1/2 cup of brown sugar (if you would like it sweeter, but it can surely be omitted. One note about the brown sugar is it may burn over high heat due to over-caramelization. I like to put the brown sugar in the basting sauce I set aside from the original marinade to reduce the amount of time the brown sugar will be over the heat)
1/2 cup of vegetable oil

Directions:
Prepare chicken by clipping off wing tips and separating wings from drummettes. (I sometimes keep them whole intact because they keep better on the grill)
Combine all ingredients together in a bowl and then whisk in vegetable oil.
Reserve a quarter of the marinade to the side for use as a basting sauce while grilling
Place wings in the remaining marinade and let sit in the fridge for at least 4 hours but preferably 12 hours but not more because of the acids
Heat up grill and keep at a medium temperature (300-350 degrees)- have a direct and indirect heat section if at all possible
Be sure to salt and pepper wings according to your taste before grilling
Place on grill and sear on each side for about four minutes on direct heating
Place wings onto indirect side and close grill.
Baste wings twice with the remaining time (once every 8 to 10 minutes)
Take wings off the grill and serve immediately with a mango, cilantro, sour cream, mayonnaise, and buttermilk dipping sauce.
Enjoy the Caribs!

Description: 
Spicy, citrus, earthy, with the right amount of thyme. These wings should be a hit as long as your guests are brave enough to take some Carribean heat.
