Ingredients:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup rolled oats
2 eggs
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup raisins
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1/2 cup pitted sour cherries, drained with liquid reserved

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of brown sugar, butter, 1/2 cup of flour and oats until crumbly. Press into the bottom of a 9 inch square pan. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven.
In the same bowl, mix together the eggs, 1 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, salt, baking powder and vanilla until well blended. Stir in the raisins, coconut and cherries, adding a little bit of the cherry juice to keep it from becoming stiff. Spread over the baked crust in the pan.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and lightly browned. Cool and cut into bars.
