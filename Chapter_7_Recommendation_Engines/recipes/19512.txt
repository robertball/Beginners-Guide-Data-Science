Ingredients:
1 whole large smoked mullet
2 (12 ounce) containers whipped cream cheese, softened
1 (5 ounce) bottle sweet hot sauce

Directions:
Pick the meat off of bones, discard any dark meat (it has a nasty flavor), and make sure you chop the meat up fine afterwards.
In a small mixing bowl combine the meat, cream cheese and hot sauce. Mash the mixture well. Refrigerate overnight.

Description: 
This is my own spread.  Here in Florida there is a wide variety of these served at restaurants, but this beats anyone else's, so it's been said. Enjoy! It is commonly served with crackers.
