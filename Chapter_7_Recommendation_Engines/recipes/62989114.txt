Ingredients:
6 to 8 small to medium sized sweet potatoes
3 egg whites
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 cup orange juice
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground clove
1 teaspoon vanilla
TOPPING:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup flour
3 tablespoons melted butter
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Wash all sweet potatoes and roast them skin on for about an hour.  Depending on the size, check them after 40 mins.  When sweet potatoes are done remove from oven and let cool about 30 min. While potatoes are cooling prepare the topping. In a medium bowl mix brown sugar, cinnamon, flour, and melted butter until a coarse meal forms. If it needs a bit more liquid to get it to stick together you can add another tablespoon of butter or a tablespoon of OJ. Stir in chopped pecans and set aside.
In large bowl beat egg whites until soft peaks form.  Fold the rest of casserole ingredients into the egg whites.  When cool enough to handle slice sweet potatoes top to bottom and scoop the potato into the bowl of egg mixture.  Beat until combined and spoon into a large casserole sprayed with Pam.  Top with the topping and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30 mins.  Serve immediately.
