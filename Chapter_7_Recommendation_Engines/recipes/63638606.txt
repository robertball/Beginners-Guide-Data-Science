Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon baking powder
6 tablespoons butter
1 cup milk or buttermilk
1 1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
2 clove garlic, minced
4 slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 clove garlic, minced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
In a large bowl, wisk together flour, salt, pepper and baking powder. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add minced garlic, bacon and cheese toss to combine. Make a well in the center of flour mixture. Add the milk; stir to combine. (I used my hand as to not over mix) Drop batter by over-sized spoonfuls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Bake in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned. While biscuits are baking mix melt butter and minced garlic in microwave. Brush garlic butter over hot baked biscuits. For a browned top place under broiler for 2 min.
