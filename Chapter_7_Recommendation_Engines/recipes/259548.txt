Ingredients:
1 large round bread loaf
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Swiss cheese
1/2 cup chopped cooked bacon
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup chopped garlic, or to taste
1 (8 ounce) package Raclette cheese, sliced into pieces
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
salt (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut a checkerboard pattern of 1-inch square segments into most of the loaf, leaving the bottom crust intact.
Combine Swiss cheese, bacon, butter, and garlic in a bowl. Spoon the mixture between the loaf segments. Stuff the loaf with slices of Raclette. Drizzle olive oil all over the top; sprinkle with salt. Place loaf on a pizza stone.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 35 minutes.

Description: 
I live in Germany and needed a quick appetizer to serve friends. I adapted the quantities and temperature for the USA. I hope you like this recipe idea. This appetizer is the bomb (could be cholesterol bomb)! It's a little easier to eat with forks, or enjoy by pulling apart with your fingers.
