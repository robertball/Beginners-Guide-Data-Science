2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar
1 cup butter, softened
4 large eggs
2 tablespoons instant espresso coffee or instant coffee granules
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup buttermilk
Coffee Glaze:
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons water

Mocha Buttercream Frosting:

2 teaspoons instant espresso powder or instant coffee granules
3 tablespoons milk
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
For Chocolate Espresso Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and line two 9-inch-round baking pans with wax paper.
Microwave small chocolate pieces in small, uncovered, microwave-safe bowl on High (100%) power for 45 seconds; stir. If pieces retain some of their original shape, microwave at additional 10- to 15-second intervals, stirring just until melted. Cool to room temperature.
Combine flour, baking soda and salt in small bowl. Beat brown sugar, butter, eggs, instant coffee and vanilla extract in large mixer bowl for 3 minutes. Gradually add melted chocolate and continue beating for an additional minute. Beat flour mixture into creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Pour into prepared pans.
Bake for 33 to 38 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Run knife around edges of cakes. Invert onto wire racks; remove wax paper. Cool completely.
Brush Coffee Glaze over cake layers. Spread Mocha Buttercream Frosting between layers and over top and sides of cake.
For Coffee Glaze: Microwave granulated sugar, water and instant coffee in small, uncovered, microwave-safe bowl on High (100%) power for 30 seconds. Stir until sugar and coffee are dissolved.
For Mocha Buttercream Frosting: Microwave small chocolate pieces in small, uncovered, microwave-safe bowl on High (100%) power for 45 seconds; stir. If pieces retain some of their original shape, microwave at additional 10- to 15-second intervals, stirring just until melted. Cool to room temperature.
Dissolve instant coffee in milk in glass measure. Beat butter, vanilla extract and salt in large mixer bowl for 3 minutes. Beat in melted chocolate until blended, scraping occasionally. Gradually beat in powdered sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in coffee mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired spreading consistency.
