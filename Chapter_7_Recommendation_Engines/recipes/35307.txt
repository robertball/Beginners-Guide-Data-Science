1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 cup cider vinegar
2 1/2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoons steak sauce
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon dried savory
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Directions:
In a large saucepan, mix together the cola, tomato sauce, tomato paste, butter, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, molasses, cider and balsamic vinegars, steak sauce, and mustard. Season with chili powder, savory, onion powder, garlic salt, and hot pepper sauce, and stir to blend. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon.

Description: 
A hot-sweet sauce that is good on just about anything. You can use any kind of cola in this recipe, just don't use diet cola.  It makes the sauce bitter.
