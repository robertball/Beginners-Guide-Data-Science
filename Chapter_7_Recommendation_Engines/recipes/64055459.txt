Ingredients:
1 pound pinto beans
3 cups vegetable stock
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 onion, minced
1 ounce garlic, minced
1 teaspoon cumin, ground

Juice of 1 lime
Kosher salt, to taste

Directions:
Soak the beans overnight in cold water. Drain the beans.
Place the beans and vegetable stock in a medium stock pot and cook until beans are tender. Strain the stock from the beans and reserve.
Sweat the onions and garlic in the olive oil, add the spices, and toast.
Add the beans and enough stock to keep the beans from sticking to the pan and simmer.
Mash the beans by hand or use an immersion blender to finish
