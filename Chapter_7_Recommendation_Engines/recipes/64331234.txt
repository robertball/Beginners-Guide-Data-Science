Ingredients:
6 ripe avocados
1 bunch of fresh cilantro, finely minced
2 full limes
1 medium jalapeño, diced
2 cloves of garlic, minced
Salt and Pepper

Directions:
Empty the contents of the avocados into a large bowl, and set the pits aside.  Dispose of the avocado skin.
Mash the avocados in the bowl until it has a pasty consistency.
Use the limes to add shavings of the skin to the bowl (lime zest). At least one lime worth the lime zest, but the more the better.
After shaving zest, cut limes into fourths and squeeze both of the full limes into the bowl.  Mix well.
Add minced garlic, diced jalapeño, and minced cilantro. Mix well.
Add salt and pepper to taste, and mix well (typically more salt than pepper).
Serve with chips, pita, with tacos, or anything you desire!
