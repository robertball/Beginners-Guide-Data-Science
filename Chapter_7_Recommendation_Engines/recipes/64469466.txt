Ingredients:
*put a bowl in the freezer*
PART ONE:
•	1 cup Water
•	1 cup Flour
•	Pinch of Salt
•	70g of Butter or Margarine
•	4 Eggs
PART TWO:
•	1 Cup (or so)Heavy Whipping Cream
•	1 tsp vanilla
•	3 tsp powdered sugar
•	Food Coloring (if desired)
•	Fondant
DIRECTIONS START HERE! Take THAT word count! #RuleBreaker!
1)In a large pan or pot, Boil water
2)Once the water is boiling, put all the flour into the pot in at once, rapidly beating it from the moment the flour hits the pan (wooden spoons work best!). Keep mixing until it forms an almost gross, glue-y, smooth oatmeal-y texture (or until the mass easily separates from the side of the pan). Keep on mixing, but Make sure you lower the temperature of the stovetop so you don’t burn it!
3)Take the pan off the burner and plop it into a slightly larger bowl. Give the mass a few minutes to cool down a little, but don’t let it get cold!
4)In the meantime (In another bowl), mix the 4 eggs. Once they are well stirred, slowly add the eggs to the now lukewarm dough
5)Once you’ve added in the egg mixture and the result is a smooth consistency, place that glorious silky dough into a pastry sleeve with a WIDE tip ( If you don’t have a pastry sleeve I would recommend making a cone out of wax paper and lopping off the very tip. If you don’t know how to make triangles of if you have little arms like our mascot, feel free to use about a spoonful of dough). Go ahead and pipe those babies onto a lightly greased tray, but remember  what you put on the sheet will grow 2  3 times in size, so give them some breathing room! If you want them to be reeeally smooth, you can annihilate those ‘points’ you get from piping with a gentle wet fingertip to pat them down.
Be sure to save enough dough to pipe dino shaped heads

Directions:
6)Time to cook! Pop your tray into the oven (I usually set my oven to 400 Degrees) for about 5-7 minutes. After such time, take a peek WITHOUT opening your oven all the way and check out how big they are. If they look super puffy and adorable, KEEP THEM IN THE OVEN but lower the heat. Let them bake for another 10 minutes or so. After ten minutes, check on them again: If they are juuust starting to get that beautiful golden color, that’s when you want to take them out and let them cool.
7)Awesome Job! Go You! Part I is done, give yourself a pat on the back and congratulate the pet that’s been cheering you on this whole time (unless that’s just me; if that’s the case I highly suggest the next time you go grocery shopping you pick up a forever friend to encourage you for moments like this). Do something kind! Give your roommate a hug, or invite a neighbor over for some treats! (But not yet, you should really probably finish this recipe first).PART II: The Reckoning (… or, as the muggles call it, the cream filling!)
PART TWO:
1)You forgot about it didn’t you…Bring that bowl out of the freezer!
Place the cream, vanilla, and powdered sugar all into that bowl and start whipping it good! You want it to have a thick consistency (so, not drippy and gross), but be careful not to stir for *too* long as this will turn it into paste (ew). A good way to test is to see if it sticks to your whisk. Once your cream is how you like it, NOW is the time to fold in a few drops of food coloring if you’d like.
2)Use a spatula to put the cream into another pastry sleeve. When you’re ready to pipe, GENTLY split the cream puff (I use my hands, but you’re welcome to try a knife) about half of the way through. Now, gently pipe through a good size puff inside. CONTINUE TO THE NOTES!
