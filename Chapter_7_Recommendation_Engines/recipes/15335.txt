Ingredients:
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg white
3 tablespoons water
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream the butter with the brown and white sugars. Stir in the vanilla, egg white, and water. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in the chocolate chips.
Drop dough by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool for 1 minute on baking sheets before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
