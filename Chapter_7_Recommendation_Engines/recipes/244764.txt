Ingredients:
2 slices bread, or more as needed
2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup chicken broth
2 cups diced cooked turkey
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Place bread in a blender and blend until soft crumbs form. Place bread crumbs in a shallow bowl.
Heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat until melted. Stir flour into melted butter until dissolved. Mix milk and broth into butter-flour mixture; cook and stir until mixture is thick, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and cool mixture.
Mix turkey, parsley, rosemary, salt, and pepper into cooled mixture. Form turkey mixture into balls. Place balls on a plate and refrigerate until chilled, at least 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Dip balls in the beaten egg, allowing excess to drip back into bowl. Press balls into bread crumbs until coated. Arrange balls on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and browned, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great recipe to use up leftover turkey or chicken. It does not taste anything like leftovers. Makes about six 2-inch croquette balls. Definitely need to double or triple recipe for large groups as I can eat 2 croquettes easily.
