Ingredients:
5 1/2 pounds apples, peeled, cored and thinly sliced
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup honey
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon allspice

Directions:
peel, core, and thinly slice enough apples to fill crockpot.  I like to use more then 1 variety like granny smith and then something a little softer like fugi.  Add remaining ingredients stir to coat apples.  Cook on high for 1 hour then turn to low and cook for 9-11 hours.

Description: 
the honey and brown sugar really gives the apple butter a little more depth then others i have tried.
