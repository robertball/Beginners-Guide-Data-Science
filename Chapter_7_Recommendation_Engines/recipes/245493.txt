Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 cups chopped fresh rhubarb (1/2-inch pieces)
1 onion, chopped
1 large red bell pepper, chopped
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
1 cup frozen white corn
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add rhubarb, onion, red bell pepper, and salt; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Add ground turkey and garlic and cook until turkey starts to brown, about 5 minutes.
Stir chili powder, cocoa powder, white sugar, cumin, cinnamon, allspice, and cayenne pepper into the pot; cook and stir for 3 minutes. Add blacks beans, diced tomatoes, and corn; mix well to combine. Bring chili to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, covered, until thickened and flavors are combined, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.

Description: 
This chili was a fun experiment that my kids gave 5 stars! Rhubarb is very popular in desserts and should make an appearance in a main dish occasionally. Serve with your favorite chili toppings, or eat on its own.
