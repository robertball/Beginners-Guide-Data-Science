Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package Johnsonville® Original, Brown Sugar & Honey, or Vermont Maple Syrup Breakfast Sausage links
2 cups Simply Potatoes® Shredded Hash Browns
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
10 eggs
1 cup half-and-half cream
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
Salt and pepper to taste
5 small, thin tomato slices
1 tablespoon thinly sliced chives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Cook breakfast sausage according to package directions; set aside.
In a skillet, brown the hash browns in butter until crisp.
Spread hash browns into the bottom of a greased 9-in. deep dish pie plate (about 1-3/4 in. deep)
Sprinkle cheese into center of the pie plate.
Arrange breakfast sausage around the edge of the pie plate at a slight angle; using cheese to help hold up the links.
In a bowl, combine the eggs, cream, onion powder, salt and pepper; pour into pie plate.
Arrange tomato slices on top of quiche; sprinkle with chives.
Cover sausage at edge of quiche with foil to prevent overbrowning.
Bake for 40-45 minutes or until eggs are set.  Let rest 5 minutes before cutting.
