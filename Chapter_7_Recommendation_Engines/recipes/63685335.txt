Ingredients:
Green beans, trimmed (about 2-3 cups)
Onion, thinly sliced (I used white onion and added about 1/4 of the onion to each pint jar)
Fresh dill sprigs (2 per jar)
Black peppercorns (1/2 teaspoon per jar)
Red pepper flakes (1/8 teaspoon per jar)
Whole clove garlic, slightly crushed (1-2 per jar)
For the brine, which makes enough for a couple of pint jars or one quart jar:
3/4 cup white vinegar
3/4 cup water
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Directions:
Blanch the beans by submerging them in boiling water for about 30 seconds then transferring them to an ice-water bath until cooled.
Pack the green beans, onion and dill vertically into clean canning jars (I used pint jars). Add the peppercorns, red pepper flakes and garlic.
In a saucepan, bring the vinegar, water, sugar and salt to a boil. Remove from heat and pour into the jars, leaving just a little headspace. Cover jars and cool to room temperature, then refrigerate. Beans will be ready to eat in 2-3 days and will keep for months in the refrigerator.
