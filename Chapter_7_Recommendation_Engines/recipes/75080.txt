Calamari Steaks Parmigiano Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
4 calamari tubes
3/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup milk
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 cups spaghetti sauce
4 slices provolone cheese

Directions:
Slice the calamari tubes open so they can lay flat. Rinse and pat dry; set aside. Mix the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese together in a pie tin or on a plate. Pour the milk into a separate dish. Dip the calamari steaks in milk, then press into the bread crumb mixture to coat.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Quickly add the steaks and cook until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes per side. They should be golden brown but be careful not to over cook or they will be tough.
Reduce heat to low and add garlic and then spaghetti sauce to the pan. Top each steak with a slice of provolone cheese. Cover with a lid just until the cheese has melted, about 2 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is almost like Chicken Parmigiano, but it uses calamari steaks, and is much quicker and easier to make. It is not baked, and the uniform texture of the steaks allows the breading to adhere nicely. Serve over your favorite pasta with extra sauce, if desired.
