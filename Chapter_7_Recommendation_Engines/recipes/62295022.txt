3.5 oz of key lime juice
1 (8oz) package of cream cheese
3/4 cup of sour cream
3 egg yolks
1 (14oz) can of sweetened condensed milk
1 prepared graham cracker crust (I make my own)

Directions:
Make sure all ingredients are room temp, if not this causes lumps.  Pre heat oven at 350 degrees.  With blender, mix together cream cheese and sour cream until well blended.
Next add your key lime juice, egg yolks, milk and mix for an additional 30 seconds. Pour batter into prepared crust and bake for 8-10 minutes.  DO NOT BROWN!
Place cheesecake/pie in the fridge for 4 hours or overnight. Garnish with zest of key lime or a lime twist in center of pie.
