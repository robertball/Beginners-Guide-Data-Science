Ingredients:
* 4 large green tomatoes
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 cup all purpose flour
* 1/2 cup cornmeal
* 1/2 cup bread crumbs
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1 quart vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Slice tomatoes 1/2 inch thick. Discard the ends.
Whisk eggs and milk together in a medium size bowl. Scoop flour onto a plate. Mix cornmeal, bread crumbs (or saltine crackers crumbled up) and salt and pepper on another plate. Dip tomatoes into flour to coat. Then dip the tomatoes into the milk and egg mixture. Dredge in the breadcrumbs (or saltine crackers) to completely coat.
In a large skillet pour vegetable oil (enough so that there is 1/2 inch of oil in the pan) and heat over a medium heat. Place tomatoes into the frying pan in batches of 4 or 5, do not crowd tomatoes, when tomatoes are browned flip on other side to brown. Drain on paper towels.
