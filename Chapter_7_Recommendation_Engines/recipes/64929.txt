Ingredients:
2 pounds beef cube steak
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (14.5 ounce) can canned diced tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can canned tomato sauce
1 large onion, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
5 small zucchini, cut into 1/2 inch slices

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, place the cube steak, flour, salt, and pepper. Seal, and shake to coat.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown the cube steak. Reduce heat to low, and mix in the tomatoes, tomato sauce, onion, and Italian seasoning. Cover, and simmer at least 1 hour, stirring once.
Place the zucchini in the skillet, and coat with the tomato sauce. Continue to simmer uncovered 10 minutes, or until zucchini is tender.

Description: 
A simple-to-make recipe that's also inexpensive! Makes the house smell wonderful as it cooks, and tastes great on those chilly fall nights. We typically serve this over cooked egg noodles with a tossed green salad, but it would be nice over rice, as well. Enjoy!
