Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1 3/4 cups flour
3/4 cup baking cocoa
2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt

14-oz can Coconut Milk - not lite!
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Combine dry ingredients in mixing bowl.
Add rest (vanilla in after all dry ingredients are moist!).
Beat on medium speed for 2 mins.
Pour into greased and floured 10 inch Bundt pan.
Bake at 350F 45-50 mins (until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out relatively clean...)
Cool 40 mins and serve.
Top with dairy-free whipped topping, coconut milk ice cream, or dairy-free icing!
ENJOY!!

Description: 
Our youngest (now 4) is allergic to dairy, but a massive chocoholic!  I’m always looking for good chocolate anything recipes!  I took my grandma’s really AWESOME chocolate coffee cake recipe & modified it  only took once & it was perfect!!  Even better than the original!  Original recipe calls for 1 cup buttermilk & 1/2 cup vegetable oil  I substituted 1-14oz can of Coconut Milk!
