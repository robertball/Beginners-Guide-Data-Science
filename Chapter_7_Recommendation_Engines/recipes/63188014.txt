Description: 
It's so flexible in it's additions etc! Never gets boring, and it fits any eating lifestyle! / My favorite substitutes are cocoa powder and coconut oil, then adding walnuts with coconut milk to moisten it. Make w/o sweetener & flavor for bread slices or bun depending on the shape of your container.
