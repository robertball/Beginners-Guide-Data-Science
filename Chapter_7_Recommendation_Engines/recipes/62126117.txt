Ingredients:

2C warm water
1/3 cup shortening
2tblsp sugar
2 tsp. salt
2C flour
Garlic Buns :
2 heaping tblsp shortening
1 1/4C water
1 1/2 tblsp garlic powder
1 tsp salt
1/4 cup salted butter

Directions:
Dough :
Combine yeast, water and 1/2 tsp sugar in a large bowl.
Allow yeast to double in size
Add Shortening, sugar and salt.
Add flour and beat vigourously.
Continue to add flour until dough is no longer sticky, but firm and elastic.
Flour a flat surface and knead the dough for 7 minutes.
Let dough rise in a oiled bowl (recommend covering with stretch wrap and a tea towel) for one hour.
Cut off chunks, and form into buns.
Let buns rise in a covered skillet for 30 minutes.
Buns :
Mix tsp shortening, 1 1/4C water, 1 1/2 tbsp garlic, 1 1/2tsp salt, 1/4c butter in a sauce pan over medium high heat.
Bring to a boil.
Pour boiled mixture evenly over buns.
Cook at 280 degrees F for 70 minutes (DO NOT LIFT THE LID)
You may need to weigh the lid down if the steam is escaping too slowly.
When cook time is up, tilt skillet to listen for remaining liquid, do not open lid until all liquid is gone.
Serve cut in half with grated cheddar and onion pieces(soaked in vinegar,oil,salt and pepper), or just as they are.
