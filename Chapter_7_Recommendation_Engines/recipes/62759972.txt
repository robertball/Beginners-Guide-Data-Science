Ingredients:
2 boxes puff pastry (4 sheets)
2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
1 box Herbed Chicken Couscous
8 oz mushrooms, finely chopped

Directions:
Prepare couscous according to instructions on package, set aside.
Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper, and sauté in olive oil.  Allow to cool and chop into very small pieces.
Chop mushrooms finely and sauté in olive oil until mostly done, using the same pan as used to cook the chicken.  Drain.
Combine the couscous, mushrooms, and chicken in a large bowl and mix well.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover bowl and place in refrigerator, allowing it to sit overnight or for at least 4 hours.
Prepare puff pastry according to instructions on package.  When ready, divide each sheet into quarters.  In the center of each puff pastry square place a portion of the chicken mixture, folding over to form the traditional turnover shape.  Use egg wash to seal the edges and a fork to crimp the edges closed.  With a sharp knife cut two small slashes in the top of each turnover.  Brush egg wash on each turnover.
Place the turnovers on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment or tin foil, and bake at 400 degrees until golden brown – approximately 15-20 minutes.  Serve immediately or when cool.

Description: 
I created these a few years back as a possible entry for the state fair, and all my tasters loved them.  Puff pastry stuffed with chicken, couscous, and mushrooms... what could be better than that?  You and your family will eat them all and ask for more.
