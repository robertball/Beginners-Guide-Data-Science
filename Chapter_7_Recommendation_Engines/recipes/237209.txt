Ingredients:
3 green chile peppers
Pico de Gallo:
1 green bell pepper, halved, divided
2 small tomatoes, diced
1 small onion, divided
3 fresh jalapeno peppers, diced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons tomato juice
1 lime, juiced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
Filling:
3 tablespoons extra-light olive oil, divided
2 cooked skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, diced
7 mushrooms, sliced
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 pinch garlic salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1/3 cup red enchilada sauce, or more to taste
Quesadilla:
1/2 cup shredded pepperjack cheese
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
4 (10 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange green chile peppers on a baking sheet.
Roast peppers in the preheated oven, turning 1 or 2 times, until skins are charred and blackened, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer chile peppers to a resealable plastic bag and seal; set aside until steam starts to peel away skins, about 10 minutes. Carefully open bag and peel skins from peppers. Dice peppers.
Dice 1/2 the bell pepper and 2/3 the onion and mix with tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, cilantro, tomato juice, lime juice, garlic, salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt together in a bowl. Cover pico de gallo and refrigerate.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Thinly slice the remaining 1/3 onion and 1/2 bell pepper; cook and stir with chicken and mushrooms in the hot oil until vegetables are just tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Add roasted green chile peppers, chili powder, oregano, 1 pinch garlic salt, and 1 pinch black pepper; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir enough enchilada sauce into vegetable mixture just to coat.
Spread pepperjack cheese and Cheddar cheese onto 1/2 of each tortilla. Spread a layer of vegetable mixture over cheese layer. Fold each tortilla over vegetable-cheese layer. Brush the outsides of tortillas with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.
Cook quesadillas, working in batches, in a sandwich press or in a skillet over medium heat until browned and cheeses are melted, about 2 minutes; cut into 4 wedges. Serve quesadillas with the pico de gallo.
