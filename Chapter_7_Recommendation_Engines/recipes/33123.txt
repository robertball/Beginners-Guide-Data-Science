Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 large green bell pepper, finely chopped
2 medium tomatoes, diced
salt and pepper to taste
ground cumin to taste
1 (15 ounce) can lima beans, drained
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
4 eggs
1 tablespoon butter, cut into pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, and cook 5 minutes, until tender. Stir in garlic, green bell pepper, and tomatoes. Season with salt, pepper, and cumin. Reduce heat, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix beans into the onion mixture. Stirring occasionally, cook 10 minutes. Toss in parsley, and transfer to a medium baking dish. Break eggs over the top, dot with butter, and season with salt and pepper.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the eggs are cooked through.

Description: 
Really tasty, my family and friends like it so much. Very flexible - by skipping the eggs it changes to a vegetarian dish. For those who like hot flavor and spicy food, it's great to add jalapeno pepper or cayenne. Good appetite.
