Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant pistachio pudding mix
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (12 ounce) bag semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped maraschino cherries
1/4 cup chopped pistachios

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together the flour and baking soda; set aside.
Cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in the instant pudding mix until well combined. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Blend in the flour mixture. Fold in the chocolate chips, cherries, and pistachios. Drop by large spoonfuls onto ungreased baking pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is an Italian-inspired twist on an American tradition. My family loves spumoni ice cream, so I decided I'd try to alter my chocolate chip recipe to fancy them. In this creation, cherries and pistachios liven up already delicious chocolate chip cookies.
