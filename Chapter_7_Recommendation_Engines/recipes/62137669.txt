Ingredients:
1 cup whole-wheat pastry flour
2 Tbsp maple syrup
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 egg
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Melt the butter and mix it with the sugar.  Add the egg, stir, and mix in the rest of the ingredients.  Fold in the chocolate chips, and drop about a golfball size portion of the batter onto a cookie sheet sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  Bake for 9-10 minutes at 350 degrees. Yummy :-D
