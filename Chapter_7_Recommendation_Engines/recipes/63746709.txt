Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
3 pounds boneless pork
1 (18 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce
1 tsp dried sage
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp seasoned salt
1 tsp pepper

Directions:
Rub spices on pork. Pour can of beef broth into slow cooker and add pork. Cook on High heat for 4 hours, or low heat for 6-8 hours (until meat shreds easily.) Remove meat, and shred with two forks. It will seem that it's not working right away, but it will.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer the shredded pork to a Dutch oven or iron skillet, and stir in barbeque sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until heated through.
