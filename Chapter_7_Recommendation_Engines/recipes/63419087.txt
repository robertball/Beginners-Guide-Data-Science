Ingredients:
1 stick of butter, melted
1 cup of sugar
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups of flour
1 teaspoon of baking soda
Â¼ teaspoon of salt
2-3 ripe bananas, mashed
1 cup of chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix melted butter, sugar, and eggs together.
Blend in the flour, baking soda and salt.
Fold in mashed bananas and pecans.
Spray two loaf pans with non-stick spray and divide batter evenly between the pans.
Bake for 35-40 minutes. Check a few minutes before time is up. Since the loaves are fairly thin, sometimes 35 minutes are enough.
Cool in the pan 15 minutes, then remove to a cooling rack.
Wrap and refrigerate to slice aid in slicing.

Description: 
This super easy banana bread recipe was shared with me by a former co-worker. It is thinner than average and bakes quickly. The flavor and texture are always good!
