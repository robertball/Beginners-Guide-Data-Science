Combine the first seven ingredients; rub over roast. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight (Preferred, not required).
Place herb rubbed pork in crockpot, surrounded by cranberries and apples. Gently pour water around pork. Cook on High for 4 hours, or low for 6-8 hours. In the last 10 minutes prior to serving, dump the stuffing mix on top of roast, mixing it in the juices. Allow it to cook for a few more minutes, until the stuffing is softened.
