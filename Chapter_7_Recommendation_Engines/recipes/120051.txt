Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) jar meatless spaghetti sauce
1 (4.5 ounce) jar sliced mushrooms, drained
1 cup 1% cottage cheese
1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1 egg white
3 cups cooked long-grain rice
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine spaghetti sauce and mushrooms; set aside.  In another bowl, combine the cottage cheese, mozzarella cheese and egg white; mix well.
In a microwave-safe 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray, layer a third of the sauce, half of the rice and half of the cottage cheese mixture; repeat layers. Top with the remaining sauce. Microwave at 50% power for 10-15 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
