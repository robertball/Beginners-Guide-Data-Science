Ingredients:
1/3 cup red quinoa
2/3 cup water
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1/2 cup diced cucumber
1/4 cup diced red onion
2 tablespoons lime juice
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin seed
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups baby spinach leaves
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced

Directions:
Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, and the water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. Spread into a mixing bowl, and refrigerate until cold.
Once the quinoa has chilled, gently stir in the tomatoes, cucumber, and onion. Season with lime juice, cumin, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Divide the spinach leaves onto salad plates, and top with the quinoa salad. Garnish with the avocado slices to serve.
