Ingredients:
1 bunch rainbow carrots
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 green onions, sliced

Directions:
Using short strokes with a vegetable peeler, shave carrots into thin shavings about 2 inches long.
Whisk olive oil, rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, and cumin together in a bowl; pour over carrots and toss gently with a rubber spatula. Season carrots with salt and pepper; sprinkle with green onions.

Description: 
This carrot salad looks absolutely gorgeous and has a sweet, subtle flavor. It's hard to believe anything this simple can be so delicious. Shaving the carrots is a little messy, I admit, but the dish is well worth it.
