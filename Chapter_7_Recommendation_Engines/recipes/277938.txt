Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 cup white sugar
3 medium ripe bananas, mashed
1/3 cup oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chocolate chips (optional)
1/2 cup yogurt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.
Beat the eggs with an electric mixer until foamy. Add sugar; beat until fluffy. Continue beating while adding mashed bananas, oil, and vanilla extract.  Add flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with yogurt, beating batter briefly after each addition, and until creamy following last flour addition. Stir in chocolate chips. Fill the prepared muffin cups to the top with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 22 to 25 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
