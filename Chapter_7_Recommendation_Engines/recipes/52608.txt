1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes

Directions:
Coat the pork chops with flour, shaking off the excess. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork chops and cook until browned on each side, about 5 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low and add the tomatoes, bell pepper and onion. Season with Worcestershire sauce and salt. Cover and simmer for about 1 hour, until chops are fork tender.
