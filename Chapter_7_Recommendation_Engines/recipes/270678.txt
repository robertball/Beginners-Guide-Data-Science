Ingredients:
5 salmon fillets, rinsed
1/2 cup white vinegar
1 teaspoon ground ginger (optional)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
ground black pepper to taste
kosher salt to taste
cooking spray
1/3 cup honey
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons minced fresh basil

Directions:
Place salmon fillets in a plastic container and add vinegar, ginger, garlic powder, black pepper, and salt. Lightly massage into salmon for about 1 minute. Spray both sides of fish with cooking spray. Refrigerate fish while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
Mix honey, lemon juice, and basil together in a bowl.
Preheat a clean outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Grill salmon fillets on the hot grill. Cook the first side for 3 to 5 minutes, depending on thickness of the fish. Turn fish and lightly baste with honey-lemon mixture. Grill another 3 minutes and turn so honey side is down. Baste top of salmon with honey mixture and grill until just warmed on this side, approximately 1 minute more.
