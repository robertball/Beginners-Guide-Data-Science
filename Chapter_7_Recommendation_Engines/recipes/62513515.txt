Ingredients:
1 c dried tropical fruit bits
1/2 c dried cranberries
1 c orange juice (fortified w calcium + vitamins)
1 c rolled oats
1 c All Bran cereal (not flakes)
1 1/2 c Fiber One flakes w/ honey clusters
1/4 c ground flax seed
1 c flour
1 c brown sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp baking soda
2 tsp baking powder
2 eggs
1/4 c oil
1/4 - 1/2 c finely chopped nuts (pecans)
1/2 c white chocolate chips (not the cheap ones)

Directions:
In a small bowl, soak the dried fruit and cranberries in the orange juice for 5 min or so.
Put all dry ingredients in large bowl and use whisk to mix well; add nuts and chips and stir until distributed throughout.  To the orange juice/fruit mixture, add eggs, vanilla and oil, and beat well with a fork.  Pour into dry ingredients and gently stir just until combined.
Fill muffin tins almost to top; bake at 375 for  12-15 min.

Description: 
I could not find a healthy muffin recipe that used the ingredients I had on hand, so I came up with this one.  Results were great and my kids love them.  They are a bit dense -- chewy and sweet, but not too heavy.
