Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen cheese tortellini
¼ cup butter
¼ cup all-purpose flour
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup chicken broth
1 ½ cups Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
¼ cup dry white wine
4 cloves garlic, minced
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
salt and ground black pepper to taste
½ pound grilled chicken, cubed
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in tortellini and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, about 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in heavy cream and chicken broth and mix well. Simmer for 5 minutes, making sure not to boil. Add Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, white wine, garlic, nutmeg, salt, and pepper; stir constantly until cheese is melted and sauce is smooth.
Drain tortellini and toss with chicken in an ungreased 11x17-inch casserole dish. Pour sauce on top. Cover with mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot.
