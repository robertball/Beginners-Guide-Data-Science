Ingredients:
3 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck
1 pound ground pork
1/2 cup meat drippings, or as desired
1 cup minced onion
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)
1 cup tomato paste
1 cup water
1/2 cup beef stock
3 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons dried Mexican oregano
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground coriander seed
1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons chipotle-flavored hot sauce (such as Tabasco® Chipotle Pepper Sauce)
2 tablespoons cornmeal
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large soup pot over medium heat, cook and stir the ground chuck and ground pork until the meat is browned, about 15 minutes, breaking the meat into crumbles as it cooks. Drain off the excess grease, reserving about 1/2 cup of drippings, and cook and stir the onion and garlic until they begin to brown, about 10 minutes.
Stir in the stout beer, tomato paste, water, beef stock, chili powder, cumin, Mexican oregano, smoked paprika, coriander seed, cocoa powder, chipotle-flavored hot sauce, cornmeal, and flour until thoroughly combined, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 8 hours.
