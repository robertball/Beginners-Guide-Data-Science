Ingredients:
4 center cut boneless pork chops, 3/4 inch thick
3/4 tsp. tsp. salt
fresh ground black pepper
1 tsp. Penzeys Pork Chop Seasoning (optional,  contains salt, hickory smoke, garlic, onion, white pepper, and ginger)
2 T olive oil
2/3 cup balsamic vinegar
2 tsp. sugar

Directions:
Trim fat from pork chops, and pound each chop to 3/4 inch thickness. Season chops on both sides with Vege-sal or salt, pepper, and pork chop seasoning if using.
Heat pan 1 minute, add olive oil, heat one minute more, then add pork chops and cook over medium high heat until well browned on both sides and cooked through, about 5 minutes total. Remove pork chops to plate, lower heat slightly, and add vinegar and sugar and cook until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
Put pork chops back into pan with any liquid which has collected on plate, and cook about 4 minutes, turning several times to glaze pork chops with sauce. Serve hot, with sauce poured over.
