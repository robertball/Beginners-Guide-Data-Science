Ingredients:
2 firm, ripe freestone peaches, halved and p
4 Tbsp, honey barbeque sauce

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grill grate.
Rinse and wipe dry the peaches, cut in half and remove the pit. Score flesh-side of the peach halves diagonally about 1/4" deep, twice in each direction. Drizzle flesh-side of each peach half with barbeque sauce; brush sauce for an even coat.
Place peaches, flesh-side up, on the grill. Cook until barbeque sauce bubbles slightly and peaches are a little softer than when you put them on the grill, about 7-10 minutes.
