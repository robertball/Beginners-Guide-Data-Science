Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 1/8 cups white sugar
1/4 teaspoon anise oil
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar for 20 minutes, yes 20, with an electric mixer. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the egg mixture along with the anise oil and continue to mix for about three minutes. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto well greased cookie sheets so that cookies are 2 inches apart.  Cover the cookie sheets carefully with foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake cookies for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bottoms begin to brown. When cool, store in tins.
