Ingredients:
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 (12 ounce) package chicken apple sausage, sliced in 1/2 inch rounds
1 small Granny Smith apple, cored and sliced
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
8 cups mixed field greens, washed and dried
1 cup baby arugula leaves, washed and dried
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
1/2 cup toasted pecans
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese

Directions:
Place 2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet and heat over medium heat. Stir in the sausage; cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Place the apple slices in a bowl, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Set aside.
To make the dressing, whisk together 1/3 cup olive oil, Dijon mustard, 1/3 cup lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a bowl until creamy.
Place the field greens and arugula leaves in a salad bowl; toss together. Mix in the red onion, pecans, blue cheese, and apple slices. Pour the lemon dressing over the salad mixture, and toss to coat evenly. Add the sausage, and toss again.

Description: 
This hearty and flavorful salad is easy to prepare and great served over warm laffa bread for a complete meal. While my favorite version contains a tasty gourmet chicken and apple sausage, any smoked sausage such as kielbasa will do. Enjoy!
