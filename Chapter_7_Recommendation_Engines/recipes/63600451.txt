Ingredients:
2 cups rolled or steel-cut oats, or 1 ½ cups of oat flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
1/3 cup of honey, agave, or maple syrup
2 eggs
¼ cup almond or other milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries

Directions:
Grind oats in blender or food processor for a minute or two until flour-like. You don't have to make sure all the grains are ground, leaving some adds some nice texture.
Combine oats, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Set aside. Mix honey, eggs, milk, coconut oil, vanilla extract in a separate bowl or food processor. Stir the oat mixture into the egg mixture and mix well. Fold in blueberries.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle. Don't try to make them bigger than your spatula (like I do) or they'll break when you try to flip them! Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
Try a bite before topping with syrup, it's decadently yummy as-is! I make "silver dollar" pancakes to take as snacks to potlucks.

Description: 
I'm trying to eat less flour, but I also insist that my meals be tasty. After trying dozens of other people's recipes, I took ideas from all of them to create this. It's probably the MOST DELICIOUS thing I've ever had! By substituting out the eggs, it's easy to turn this into a vegan meal as well.
