Description: 
This stir-fry comes together with chicken, and fire-roasted vegetables and is a keto-friendly Chinese dish. I love fire-roasting my vegetables, but it's completely optional. Use any assorted vegetables you like, e.g. red bell pepper, onions, tomatoes, green beans, mushrooms, or carrots, but be careful if using carrots as they have more carbs than most other vegetables.
