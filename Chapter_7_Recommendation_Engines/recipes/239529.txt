Ingredients:
1/4 teaspoon butter
1 egg, beaten
1 hot dog bun
1 dash hot sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add egg to melted butter and cook until egg starts to bubble, about 1 minute. Flip the egg and cook until set, 2 to 3 minutes more. Roll egg, place in the hot dog bun, and top with hot sauce.

Description: 
I like a morning breakfast sandwich, but I was out of bread. Luckily I had leftover hot-dog buns from my all-star game party and a legend was born.
