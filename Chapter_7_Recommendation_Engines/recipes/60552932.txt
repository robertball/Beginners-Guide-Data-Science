Description: 
I made my macaroni salad budget friendly by cutting out the expensive bell pepper and pimento called for in the original recipe.  I also left out the sugar in the dressing, it made the salad too sweet for my taste.  Use store brand items for the remaining ingredients to really cut costs.Modified from: Classic Macaroni Salad
