Ingredients:
3/4 cup unpopped popcorn
3 Tbsp. coconut oil (or olive oil)
2-3 Tbsp. honey
salt and cinnamon (to taste)

Directions:
Heat 3 Tbsp. oil over high heat in a large pot with 3 kernels of popcorn.  Place lid on pot.
When 1 kernel has popped, remove lid and pour the remaining popcorn into the pot. Put the lid back on and shake over burned back and forth until there is 1-2 seconds between pops (Do not stop shaking the pot or the popcorn will quickly burn!)
Remove lid and quickly pour into a large bowl.
Drizzle honey over popcorn and make sure it is evenly coated (You only need enough honey to make the salt and cinnamon stick to the popcorn; I find this easiest to do with my hands).
Add salt and cinnamon to taste*.
