Description: 
After the news that a local cafe was closing, I begged the owner for this recipe. The sweetness of the red grapes compliments the curry perfectly and the almonds provide a nice crunch. It's always a hit and I'm always asked for the recipe. 
It's nice served over a large leaf of romaine, on a croissant, or just out of the bowl with a fork!
