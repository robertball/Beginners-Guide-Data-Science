Ingredients:
1 pound flank steak (big flat piece!)
1 can cream of mushroom soup
i packet Lipton powdered onion soup mix
1 bag Pepperidge Farm Stuffing mix (regular type)
3 TBS. butter
Water

Directions:
Begin to make the stuffing as directed on the package (you won't need the whole package, but if you make it it makes a good side dish!). Take the flank steak out and pound with meat mallet just enough to break up any tough spots.  Take a knife and make very very shallow long slices along the grain--just enough to score the meat.  Do this on both sides.  Grease lightly a 9x13" pan. When the stuffing is finished take a small amount and put it down the length of the raw flank steak.  Put enough stuffing to fill the center of the flank steak when the sides are pulled together (width pulled together--should look like a long tube!).  Use potato nails or toothpicks to secure the sides of the meat together to form a tube with the stuffing in the middle.  Put the roll in the greased pan, with the tooth picks facing down.  Spread the cream of mushroom soup (condensed) on the meat and sprinkle the powdered onion soup mix on top.  Pour a can of warm water around the beef into the bottom of the pan and cover the pan with tinfoil.  Bake for about an hour, less if you like your meat rare.  Cut into slices and serve with the "gravy" that is made in the bottom of the pan.  If you have trouble cleaning the pan throw a bit of dishwasher soap into the pan with some hot water and let it sit overnight.  Enjoy!!
