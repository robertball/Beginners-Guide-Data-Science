Description: 
Who would believe that beer would be the perfect solution to eradicating fluorescent green margaritas? Well, it is! Use the limeade can to measure the ingredients, and adjust with extra water if the mixture seems too sweet. Straining the pulp is always a good idea.Modified from: Beer Margaritas
