Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup shortening
1 package (1 1/2 teaspoons) dry active yeast
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 cup warm water
3/4 cup thick sour cream
1 egg and 2 yolks, well beaten
1 cup sugar

Directions:
Sift the flour and salt together into a mixing bowl.  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and add to the flour mix along with sour cream, vanilla, and egg.  Mix well with hands or stand beater.  Cover dough with a damp cloth and chill for 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Cover a board or wax paper with the sugar and roll out half the dough into an oblong 8x16 inch rectangle.  Fold corners toward center with ends overlapping.  Sprinkle dough with sugar roll out again.  Repeat process one more time.
Roll dough into 1/4 inch thickness and slice into 4x1 inch rectangles.  Grasp each rectangle by the ends and twist several times.  Place on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake until lightly browned (15-25 minutes).

Description: 
This recipe is a long-standing family tradition - women in my family have made this every Christmas since before they came to America!  The sweet and sour cookie truly melts in your mouth and is a favorite treat for family, neighbors, and co-workers around the Holidays.

The recipe makes a lot, so there is lots to share!

My grandmother always told me it had to be mixed with your bare hands since the metal would change the flavor, but I haven't noticed a difference with a stand mixer, although a handheld doesn't seem quite up to the task.
