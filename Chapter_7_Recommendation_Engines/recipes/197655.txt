Ingredients:
1 gallon lard for frying (manteca)
5 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
6 bay leaves
2 tablespoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons coarse ground black pepper
2 large onions, quartered
3 whole garlic cloves
1 large orange, halved

Directions:
Heat the lard in a deep roasting pan over medium heat. Stir in the pork, bay leaves, salt, pepper, onions, and garlic. Squeeze the orange into the mixture and drop in the orange halves. Add more lard if needed to cover all of the ingredients.
Cook until the pork is tender enough to pull apart with a fork, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Discard the orange, onion, and garlic; strain the pork cubes from the lard using a slotted spoon.
