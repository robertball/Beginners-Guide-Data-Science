Ingredients:
1 stick of butter
1 c. sugar
1 c. water
1-1/2 c. self-rising flour
1 stick of butter
1/2 c. milk, at room temperature
2 c. fruit (apple, blueberry, blackberries, cherries)
1 tsp. cinnamon

Directions:
Melt a stick of butter in a 10" round pan.  Heat 1 c. sugar and 1 c. water until the sugar dissolves; set aside.  Cut the self-rising flour and a stick of butter together until crumbly.  Add the milk and mix together.  Knead it a few times on a floured surface and roll out to 11x14".  Pour the fruit on top and sprinkle the cinnamon over.  Roll it up like a jelly-roll and slice into 1-1/2" slices; making about 10 pieces or so.  Set them in the pan of melted butter, so you can see the fruit, sideways.  Pour the sugar and water over them. Bake at 350 deg. F for 40 minutes.  Sprinkle some sugar on top and bake about 10 minutes more.
