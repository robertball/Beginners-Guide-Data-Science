Ingredients:
3 pounds buttercup squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 3/4-inch chunks
1/4 cup butter
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 dash white pepper
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
6 cups sliced peeled apples
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups cornflakes cereal, coarsely crushed
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons melted butter

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the squash pieces in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook until the squash is tender, about 15 minutes. Drain; then mash the squash with 1/4 cup butter, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, salt, and white pepper.
Heat the 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over low heat; stir in sliced apples and sprinkle with the white sugar. Cover and cook over low heat until barely tender, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Spread the apples in a 3-quart casserole. Spoon the mashed squash evenly over the apples.
Stir together the cornflakes, pecans, the 1/2 cup brown sugar, and melted butter. Sprinkle the cornflake mixture evenly over the squash.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This has become a must-have at Thanksgiving. It's so good it tastes like it could be dessert! Even people who don't usually like squash change their mind after trying this. It's a delicious blend of different tastes and textures. I use buttercup squash, but acorn squash can also be used; Jonathan, Rome or other dry apples work best. It can also be made a day ahead of time--just add the cornflake topping and bake the next day.
