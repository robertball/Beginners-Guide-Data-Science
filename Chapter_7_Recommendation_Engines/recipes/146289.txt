Ingredients:
6 large tomatoes
salt and pepper, to taste
4 ounces crumbled goat cheese
8 ounces mascarpone cheese, room temperature
1 (12 ounce) can albacore tuna in water, drained and flaked
1/2 cup finely chopped red onion
1/2 cup finely chopped cucumber
1/2 cup finely chopped mushrooms
1/2 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
2 teaspoons sunflower seeds
2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon garlic salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon onion powder, or to taste
salt and pepper, to taste
1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes, for garnish (optional)
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut a thin slice off the top of each tomato, and gently scoop out pulp and seeds, leaving a 1/2 inch wall. Finely dice 1/2 cup of the pulp and set aside. Season the inside of each hollowed tomato with pinches of salt and pepper.
Mix reserved diced tomato pulp, goat cheese, mascarpone cheese, tuna, red onion, cucumber, mushrooms, red pepper, celery, garlic, and sesame seeds in a large bowl.
Scoop mixture into tomato shells up to the top of each tomato. Place on a foil-lined baking sheet.
Sprinkle each tomato with sunflower seeds, Parmesan cheese, garlic salt, onion powder, salt, and pepper. If desired, sprinkle each tomato with  parsley flakes and Worcestershire sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, then broil right before serving until tops are lightly browned, about 1 to 2 minutes.

Description: 
My neighbor delivered a very large bag of his summer tomatoes, and I didn't want them to go to waste. I experimented with the stuffing mixture until my husband loved this combo.  Easy, tasty, satisfying, and a good choice for hot summer nights!
