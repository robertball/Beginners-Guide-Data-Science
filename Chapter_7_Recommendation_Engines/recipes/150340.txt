Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
8 chicken legs, skin removed
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 onion, finely chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
1 small tomato, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon garam masala
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 serrano chile pepper, seeded and minced
1 cup water
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat the oil and ghee in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the cumin seeds in the oil until the seeds begin to change color.
Stir in chopped onion onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger; continue cooking until the onions brown, about 5 minutes more.
Mix in the chopped tomato, tomato paste, garam masala, turmeric, salt, serrano pepper, and water; simmer 5 minutes. Lay the chicken into the sauce; mix gently to coat the legs. Cover pan and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until chicken is no longer pink near the bone, about 40 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.

Description: 
This is a type of chicken curry in a thick gravy with a nice spicy flavor, but is not too hot. You may adjust the 'heat' by adding more serrano peppers. Serve over rice, or with chapatti or roti.
