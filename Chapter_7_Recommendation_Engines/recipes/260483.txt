Ingredients:
2 cups buchimgaru (Korean pancake mix)
2 cups buchimgaru (Korean pancake mix)
2 cups kimchi, finely chopped, juice reserved
1 cup water
1/4 onion, cut into small cubes
1 egg (optional)
1 red chile pepper, diced, divided
1 green chile pepper, diced, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Combine buchimgaru, kimchi, kimchi juice, water, onion, egg, half of the red pepper, and half of the green pepper together in a bowl. Mix thoroughly until batter is pancake-like in consistency, adding more buchimgaru or water if needed.
Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Ladle batter to make 1 large pancake or several smaller ones; cook until slightly golden brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining red pepper and green pepper on top; flip and cook until set, 1 to 2 minutes more.

Description: 
I got to experiment making another anju (alcoholic side dish) called kimchi jeon. Full story and recipe at My Korean Eats. Enjoy while hot. Soy dipping sauce would be ideal with this appetizer dish.
