Ingredients:
4 cups water, or as needed
1/2 pound beef sirloin steak, thinly sliced
1/2 onion, chopped (optional)
5 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
4 cups thinly sliced garae tteok (Korean glutinous rice cakes)
2 tablespoons soy sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 eggs, beaten
2 green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
Combine water and beef strips in a stockpot; bring to a boil. Reduce to medium-high heat and simmer, skimming off any foam from the top. Add onion and garlic; simmer stock until flavors combine, 15 to 20 minutes.
Rinse rice cake slices in cold water and drain well. Stir rice cakes and soy sauce into the stock; bring to a gentle boil until rice cake slices start to float, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir eggs and green onions into the stock. Ladle into bowls.

Description: 
It's been a long time since we've eaten tteokguk (rice cake soup) so it was a pleasant surprise when the wife took over the reins in the kitchen and surprised me and the kids with this delicious Korean soup. Tteokguk is a traditional dish enjoyed by many (if not all Koreans) during the Lunar New Year holiday. The rice cake used to make tteokguk is first made into a long, white cylinder shape called garae tteok. Its shape and length is symbolic, wishing for longevity in life.
