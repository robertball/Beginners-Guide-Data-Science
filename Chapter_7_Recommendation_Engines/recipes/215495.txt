Ingredients:
3 1/2 tablespoons honey
7 ripe persimmons, peeled and pureed
1 pint chilled whipping cream

Directions:
Stir the honey into the persimmon puree to taste; it should be very sweet, since it will be mixed with the unsweetened cream.
With an electric mixer, whip the cream to stiff peaks. Gently fold the persimmon-honey mixture into the whipped cream. Divide the cream into parfait glasses, serving dishes, or a baked pie shell. Serve immediately, chill, or freeze for a frozen mousse.

Submitter: 
tofu
Description: 
Well-ripened persimmons and stiffly whipped cream are sweetened and blended together. This simple dessert is delicious as is, or it may be frozen with or without a pie crust and enjoyed as a frozen treat. Creamy and delicious!
