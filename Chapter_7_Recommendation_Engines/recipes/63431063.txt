Ingredients:
2 Acorn Squash
1 c Leftover Turkey (or chicken)
1 Medium red onion
1 Tbsp pumpkin pie spice
4 whole eggs

Directions:
Roast your squash in a 350 oven, whole, until you can pierce with a fork.  Let cool, then half, de-seed, and scoop out contents into a bowl.  Don't turn off the oven
Chop up the meat of your choice.  Chunks are more fun so keep them big enough to notice.  Alternately you could rip the meat so its long strings.
Chop an onion.  Red is nice and sweet and goes with this mix
Stir together until the egg is well mixed in, add spice, and salt if desired.
Grease a pie dish and bake.
You will know it is almost ready when the edge of mix starts to look lighter in color. (the egg has cooked)  Keep an eye at this point.  When the whole pie is the same color as the outer edge, it's time to take it out.
Enjoy
