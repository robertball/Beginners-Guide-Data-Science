Ingredients:
2 tablespoons ground flaxseed
6 tablespoons water
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1 cup cornmeal
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1 cup Almond Breeze Unsweetened Original OR any Almond Breeze Almond-Cashew Blend
1/3 cup coconut sugar
2 tablespoons coconut oil, warmed just until liquid
1 tablespoon molasses

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Prepare a regular sized 12-cup muffin tin by greasing or lining 8 cups.
In a medium sized bowl, make your flaxseed "eggs" by combining the flaxseed with water, giving it a good stir and allowing it to sit for a few minutes to thicken up.
In a large bowl, mix the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg.
Add the remaining ingredients (pumpkin, almond milk, coconut sugar, coconut oil and molasses) into the bowl with the flaxseed eggs and stir well to combine.
Gently add the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir until just mixed. Do not over mix.
Evenly divide the cornbread mixture into 8 prepared cups. Bake for 25 minutes, until golden in color and a toothpick comes out clean.
