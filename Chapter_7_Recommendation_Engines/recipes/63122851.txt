Description: 
I was trying to create a recipe using Fiber One Original Bran Cereal for an activity in the Allstar Brand Ambassador Program! This is what I came up with...my family LOVED it! This tastes perfect alone, but would also be delicious as a topping for ice-cream! Its slightly sweet, crunchy and nutty!
