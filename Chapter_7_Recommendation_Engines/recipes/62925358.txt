Ingredients:
4 1/2cups (20oz/567g) unbleached bread flour
1 3/4 teaspoons (0.4oz/11g) salt
1 1/4 teaspoons (0.14oz/4g) instant yeast
2 cups (16oz/454g) chilled water (about 55ºF or 13ºC)
1 tablespoon (0.5oz/14g) olive oil

Directions:
On Baking Day…
Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 3 hours in advance for ciabatta.
About 1 hour after taking the dough out of the refrigerator, line the back of a sheet pan with parchment paper and generously dust the entire surface with flour.
Use a wet or oiled bowl scraper to transfer the dough to the work surface, taking care to handle the dough as little as possible to avoid degassing it.
Dust the top of the surface of the dough with flour and also flour your hands.
Using your hands or a metal pastry scraper, gently coax and pat the dough into a rough square measuring about 9 inches on each side, still taking care to degas it as little as possible.
About 45 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 550ºF (288ºC) or as high as it will go, and prepare the oven for hearth baking.
Slide the dough, parchment and all, onto the stone; if you aren’t using a stone, put the entire pan in the oven. (Snippets Notes: This is a shallow pan that you fill with water and slide in the oven right beneath you bread. It will steam the dough and make a really nice crust)
Pour 1 cup of hot water into the steam pan underneath the pan holding the bread, then lower the temperature to 450ºF (232ºC)
Bake for 12 minutes, rotate the pan and bake for 15-20 minutes more, until the crust is a rich brown. Cool on a wire rack before slicing.
