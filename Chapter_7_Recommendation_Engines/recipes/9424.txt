Ingredients:
1 1/8 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup super fine sugar
1/2 cup butter
1 tablespoon cocoa
1 tablespoon sweet chocolate, grated

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C).
Sift all but 2 tablespoons of flour into a bowl, then add the sugar.  Rub, or cut in  butter until the mixture is crumbly.  Divide in half. Work in the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour to one half, then the cocoa and ground chocolate to the other half.  Knead each portion well with your fingers to form a smooth dough.
Turn onto a lightly dusted with cornstarch surface, and roll out each portion to 1/4 inch thick circles.  Using a 2 1/2 inch round cookie cutter, cut out 7 circles from each piece of rolled out dough.  Out of these circles, cut two more circles, one 1 1/4 inch, and one 3/4 inch. Now you should have fourteen 2 1/2 inch rings, fourteen 1 1/2 inch rings and fourteen 3/4 inch circles.
Construct wheels on greased baking sheets by starting with the largest rings, then alternating the colors to fill in.  You should end up with 7 cookies that have a chocolate ring on the outside, a plain ring in the middle and a chocolate circle in the center; and 7 cookies that have a plain ring on the outside, a chocolate ring in the middle and a plain circle in the center.
Bake for 12 minutes.  Leave on sheets for 2 minutes, then remove with a flat knife.  Cool completely on wire racks.
