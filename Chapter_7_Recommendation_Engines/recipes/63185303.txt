Ingredients:
5 Potatoes
1½ stalk of broccoli
½ of a white onion
½ tablespoon Cumin
½ Salt
Olive oil/vegetable oil
French bread
Opitional:
Black pepper
Kale Leaves (For garnish)

Directions:
First peel the potato and put to boil for about 12-15 minutes depending on your preference to the texture of the potato. While the Potato is boiling, cut the broccoli into small pieces, then Sautee it for 4 minutes. Add in the onion. Keep mixing, when the potatoes are done, cut them into one inch cubes and add in with the Broccoli and onion. Mix and crush the Broccoli, potato, and onion. Keep mixing until they get a bit mushy; When that happens add in the Cumin and salt& pepper. With the Cumin, I usually like to add a little more, because I love the taste of it. It should look like mash potatoes with broccoli in it in the end. After you could take your toasted slices of French bread and spread that with this and eat up!
This whole thing should take about 30 minutes or less to cook and prepare. It’s a great appetizer, or snack; And it fun to make with the family and friends!

Description: 
This is a good recipe for people who are trying to improve their diet! Delicious and super healthy! I got this recipe  from an empanada recipe. This was supposed to be a filling for the empanada, but when I was making it one day I messed up the dough and ended up not knowing what to do with the filling, so I just took a piece of bread and slapped some of the filling on a bread; and I was like this isn’t so bad. Ever since then, it’s one of my favorite recipe’s. Hope you guys like it!
