Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 cups salted cashews
1 cup white sugar

Directions:
Grease a baking sheet with 1 tablespoon butter.
Combine cashews, sugar, and corn syrup in a large microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl. Microwave on high until sugar melts and mixture is hot, about 6 1/2 minutes.
Stir 1 tablespoon butter and vanilla extract into cashew mixture. Microwave until hot, about 2 1/2 minutes more. Stir baking soda into cashew mixture until light and foamy. Spread mixture on prepared baking sheet. Cool completely and break into pieces.

Description: 
Through the years I have always made peanut brittle, but when my hubby could no longer have peanuts, I replaced them with cashews. This is one of my biggest requests at Christmas. It makes a nice thank-you gift as well and is a hit at bake sales.
