3 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
1 tablespoon sumac powder

Description: 
This za'atar spice recipe is easy to make at home from scratch with just four ingredients. While in Lebanon wild thyme is used, regular thyme from the supermarket or your garden makes a fine substitute. Za'atar refers both to the thyme plant itself, as well as this spice mix.
