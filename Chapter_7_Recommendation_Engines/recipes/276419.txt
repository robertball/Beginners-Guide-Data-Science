Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups apple cider
1/4 cup stone-ground mustard
1 teaspoon freeze-dried dill
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 pounds skin-on chicken thighs
8 ounces baby carrots
1/2 medium head cabbage, thinly sliced

Directions:
Whisk apple cider, mustard, dill, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add chicken thighs and stir until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from the refrigerator.
Transfer chicken to a plate and pour marinade into a large skillet. Add carrots and cabbage and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat, cover, and cook until carrots have softened, about 30 minutes.
While carrots and cabbage are cooking, place chicken thighs on the preheated grill and cook until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes, flipping halfway through the cook time. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a serving plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve with carrots and cabbage.

Tender and juicy grilled chicken thighs with a perfect balance of sweet and tart. The carrots and cabbage are optional but it's a great way to utilize the apple cider marinade and have a complete meal.
