The Ultimate Reuben Sandwich Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 package (3 lb.) corned beef brisket
1 loaf sliced Russian rye bread (or some variation of rye)
1 jar sauerkraut, drained
thousand island dressing (or substitute with mayonnaise)
2 tbsp butter, or to taste
1 package sliced swiss cheese (muenster cheese works well too)

Directions:
Place corned beef in a pot, submerge with water. Bring to a boil.
Turn down heat to low-medium and cover. Let simmer for another 3 hours. This will make the meat very tender. Add water as necessary to keep meat submerged.
When done, the meat should come apart very easily/should be able to easily poke into the meat with a butter knife. Remove from water and let drain and set/cool for 20 minutes. This will help the meat solidify and make it easier to cut thin slices.
Heat a pan to medium heat, and melt butter. Place two slices of bread onto butter, and place cheese on top of one slice to melt over heat. Cook until bread is toasty and browned.
Assemble sandwich with sliced meat, thousand island, and sauerkraut to your liking!
