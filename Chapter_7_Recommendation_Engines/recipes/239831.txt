1/4 cup salsa
1/4 cup low-fat sour cream

Directions:
Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and jalapeno peppers together in a skillet over medium-high heat until meat is browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir taco seasoning into meat mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.

This is a great low-carb alternative to your standard homemade tacos. I love Mexican food and wasn't willing to part with tacos after starting my low-carb diet. This always satisfies my craving.
