Ingredients:
1 cup plain Greek yogurt
2 medium ripe bananas, mashed
2 large eggs
2 cups oatmeal (old fashioned or quick)
1/4 cup  brown sugar
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 cup  chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F  and prepare a muffin pan by spraying with cooking spray or lining them with paper liners. Set aside.
Add all the ingredients except for the chocolate chips to a blender or food processor and process on high until the oats are broken down and batter is smooth and creamy. Stir in chocolate chips by hand.
Pour batter into prepared muffin pan, filling each cavity until it is about 3/4 full. Optional: sprinkle a few chocolate chips over the top of each muffin.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the tops of your muffins are set and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. Allow muffins to cool in pan for about 10 minutes before removing. Store in an air-tight container for up to a week.

Description: 
These muffins aren’t your average muffins, mostly because they’re made without flour or oil. Instead, they have oats to give them shape, and yogurt to keep them moist and they are healthy enough to eat for breakfast.
