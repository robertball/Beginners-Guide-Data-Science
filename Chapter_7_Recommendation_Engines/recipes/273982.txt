Ingredients:
1 pound dry black beans
6 cups water, or as needed to cover
3 teaspoons salt, divided
1 onion, finely chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, finely chopped
3 tablespoons tomato sauce
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 bay leaf
1 pinch ground cumin

Directions:
Soak black beans in 6 to 8 cups of water, 8 hours to overnight.
Drain beans. Place in a saucepan and cover with fresh water; add 2 teaspoons salt and bring to a boil. Cook until nearly tender, about 40 minutes.
Combine remaining salt, onion, bell pepper, tomato sauce, garlic, olive oil, bay leaf, and cumin in a slow cooker. Add black beans and the cooking water.
Mix well and cook on Low until the beans are tender and cooked through, 4 to 6 hours.

Description: 
My best friend gave me her recipe for Cuban-style black beans. I made minor tweaks to make them in the slow cooker. Serve with white rice for an authentic Cuban meal.
