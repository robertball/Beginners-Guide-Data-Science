Title:
No-Brainer Caramel Sauce Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 can sweetened condensed milk - can be lowfat or nonfat if desired

Directions:
Yes, that is the only ingredient!!  Place the ENTIRE can, UNOPENED in a stock pot and cover with water at least 2" above can (Tip: lay the can on its side or else it will bang noisily on the bottom of the pan).  Bring to a full boil, then reduce heat to gently boil.  Check the clock - the 4 hours cook time begins now!  You don't have to do anything except make sure the water remains gently boiling and always covers the can. Add more water when necessary.
After 4 hours, remove can and let cool before opening.  When you open the can you will be greeted with thick, delicious, goopy caramel sauce.  The consistency will loosen somewhat when you stir it.
* You can cook more than one can at a time; just make sure the cans have a little room between them for the water to boil.
This recipe requires a leap of faith, but believe me, it is definitely worth it! No one will believe you when you tell them how to make it.  These are very cute gifts - make a little homemade label, decorate with a raffia bow & put in a basket with tart green apples. Very impressive and SO easy!

Description: 
You will not believe this incredibly thick and delicious caramel sauce. Great on ice cream, pies, and especially super scooped up with a tart green apple wedge (or three!!).
