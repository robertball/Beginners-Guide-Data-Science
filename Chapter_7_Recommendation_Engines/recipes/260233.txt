Ingredients:
1 head broccoli, broken into florets
1 red bell pepper, cored and sliced into 1/4-inch strips
10 cherry tomatoes, or more to taste
1/2 yellow bell pepper
5 pretzel sticks
1 head cauliflower, broken into florets

Directions:
Arrange broccoli florets in the shape of a Christmas tree. Drape red pepper strips as garlands between the rows of broccoli florets and stick in the cherry tomatoes as ornaments.
Cut yellow bell pepper into a star using a cookie cutter and place on top of the broccoli tree. Cut little thin strips out of the remaining yellow bell pepper to become candles and arrange on tree.
Break pretzel sticks in half and lay as a trunk on the bottom of the broccoli tree. Arrange cauliflower as snow and clouds.
