Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked orzo pasta
1 can chicken broth
2 cups water
1 can italian diced tomatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic
2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces
salt to taste
1 large chopped fresh basil leaves
2 cups fresh spinach leaves
grated Parmesan cheese for topping

Directions:
Combine chicken broth and water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Add orzo pasta, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the garlic and red pepper 1 minute, until garlic is golden brown. Stir in chicken, season with salt, and cook 2 to 5 minutes, until lightly browned and juices run clear.
Reduce heat to medium, and mix in the basil, spinach, tomatoes, and cooked orzo. Continue cooking 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until spinach is wilted. Serve topped with Parmesan cheese.
