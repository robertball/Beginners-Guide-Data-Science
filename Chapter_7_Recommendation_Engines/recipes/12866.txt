Reduce oven's temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Place covered jambalaya on large baking tray filled with to water.  Bake until warm, about 2 hours.
Just before serving the jambalaya, boil 5 quarts of water.  Add the shrimp and cook for 3 minutes until they are firm to the touch.  Drain well.  Toss shrimp and chicken with jambalaya mixture and serve.
