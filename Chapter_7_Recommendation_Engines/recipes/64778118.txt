Ingredients:
(1) 9" Unbaked Frozen Deep Dish Pie Crust
(1) 21 oz Can Cherry Pie Filling
2 Cups Blueberries (Fresh or Frozen)
1 Tablespoon Lemon Juice (Fresh is Best)
1/2 Cup Rolled Oats
1/2 Cup Flour
1/2 Cup Chopped Pecans
1/2 Cup Packed Brown Sugar
1/2 Teaspoon Ground Cinnamon
1/2 Teaspoon Salt
6 Tablespoons Butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Using a strainer, rinse the blueberries, drain and place in mixing bowl.  Add cherry pie filling and lemon juice.  Mix well, but gently (try not to smash the berries).  Set aside.
Unwrap frozen pie crust and place on baking pan of some kind (catches spills and makes pie easier to handle).  Optional but recommended:  Brush crust with an egg or milk wash right before filling.  Set aside.
In mixing bowl add remaining ingredients and cut-in with pastry cutter (easiest) or fork until crumbly.
Spoon cherry-berry mixture into pie crust and spread evenly.  Sprinkle with crumble topping.
Bake for 40 minutes until browned and bubbly.  Cool on wire rack.  Enjoy!!
Favorite Tip:  If your crust isn't quite big enough for all of the filling, put the extra in custard cups or small baking dishes, top with crumble and bake.   Wallah.... COBBLER!  Just watch the bake time because they'll probably finish before the pie.
