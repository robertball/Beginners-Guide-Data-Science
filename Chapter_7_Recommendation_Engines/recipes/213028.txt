Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 cup chopped orange bell pepper
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped carrot
1 cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 (16 ounce) packages dry black-eyed peas
4 cups water
4 teaspoons vegetable bouillon base (such as Better Than BouillonÂ® Vegetable Base)
1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped, sauce reserved
2 teaspoons liquid mesquite smoke flavoring
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat the olive oil and balsamic vinegar in a skillet; cook and stir the orange bell pepper, celery, carrot, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until the onion is translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a slow cooker; mix in the black-eyed peas, water, and vegetable base, stirring to dissolve the vegetable base. Stir in the chipotle peppers, about 1 tablespoon of the reserved adobo sauce (or to taste), liquid smoke, cumin, and black pepper.
Cook in the slow cooker on Low until the black-eyed peas are very tender and the flavors are blended, about 8 hours.
