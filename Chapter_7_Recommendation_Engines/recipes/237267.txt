Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package German chocolate cake mix
1 cup water
3 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk (such as Eagle Brand®)
1 (12 ounce) jar caramel ice cream topping
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed
1/2 cup English toffee baking bits, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 34 to 38 minutes. Poke holes into cake using a straw.
Stir sweetened condensed milk and caramel topping together in a bowl; pour over warm cake and holes. Cool cake completely, about 1 hour.
Spread whipped topping over cake and sprinkle toffee bits over whipped topping.
