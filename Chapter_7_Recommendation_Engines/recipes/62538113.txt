Ingredients:
1/2 Cup (two 1/4# sticks)Butter
4 Medium Onions Freshly Chopped
4 Stalks Chopped Celery
1 12-16oz. Pack Fresh Mushrooms
3Teaspoon Salt
1 Teaspoon Pepper
1-1/2 Teaspoon Bell's Poultry Seasoning
1 Teaspoon  Dash Sage
4 Loaves Bread Diced
5 Cups Water

Directions:
In a pan over medium heat melt the butter. Do not burn it. Chop the Mushrooms and celery and start to cook these. Now chop the onion and after a few minutes, add to the mushroom and celery already cooking. Cook untill the onion is transparent and the mushrooms have cooked down a bit. Now add the Salt, Pepper, Poultry Seasoning, and Sage. Mix well and pour over the Diced Bread. You'll need a LARGE bowl for this. Mix a bit by hand and then pour in the water, but not all at once or in one spot. Add  enough to make a moist mix. The five cups of water should be enough.

Description: 
I think this is my Grandma Whalen's recipe, but it may have been my Great Grandma Hoch's. In any case it is by far our favorite stuffing/dressing recipe goes back generations in our family.
