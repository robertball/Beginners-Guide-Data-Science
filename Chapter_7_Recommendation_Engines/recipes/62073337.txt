Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup light brown sugar
2 eggs
1/4 cup melted butter
1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. allspice
1/4 tsp. nutmeg
1 tsp. vanilla
3 very ripe bananas, mashed or cut into pieces

Directions:
Grease 2 3x7 baking pans and preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large bowl, or stand mixer, mix together flour, baking soda, salt, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg.
Mix in eggs, melted butter, and vanilla.
Mix in bananas, a little at a time, until there are no large lumps, and batter is relatively smooth with small banana lumps.
Pour into prepared pans, and bake at 350 degrees for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean.  Let cool 20 minutes and remove from pans, then ENJOY!

Description: 
My family LOVES this recipe.  My husbands co-workers devoured a loaf on their first break, and always asking me to make more.  This recipe makes 2 mouth watering delicious loaves.  The generous amount of spices make this out of this world.  I mix all ingredients in the same pan, and it still comes out perfect, and with a lot less of a mess to clean up later.
