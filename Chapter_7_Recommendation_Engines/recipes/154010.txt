Description: 
This is a wonderful dish for cold winter days that really fills you up! My mother used to make this for my family, and it quickly became a favorite. This isn't your normal 'hot' chili and it's a great change of pace. It's best when served with buttered saltine crackers. This chili also freezes well.
