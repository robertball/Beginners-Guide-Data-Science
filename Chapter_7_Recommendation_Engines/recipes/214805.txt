Ingredients:
6 large tomatoes, diced
1/2 large sweet Bermuda onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons fennel seed
1/3 cup minced fresh basil
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
1 (20 ounce) loaf French bread, sliced 1/2-inch thick
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing

Directions:
In a bowl, mix together the tomatoes, onion, garlic, fennel seed, basil, 1/3 cup olive oil, salt, and pepper. Chill for at least 1 hour to blend the flavors.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Brush both sides of bread slices with some of the 1/4 cup of olive oil; place slices onto a baking sheet. Toast the bread until golden brown and crunchy on the outside, about 3 minutes per side. To serve, spoon the tomato mixture onto the toasted bruschetta and arrange on a serving platter.

Description: 
This bruschetta is really delicious, a little different than the average bruschetta. It always gets devoured around my house, or wherever I take it. The fennel seed really makes the dish.
