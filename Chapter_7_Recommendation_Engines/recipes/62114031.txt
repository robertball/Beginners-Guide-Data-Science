Description: 
This was a recipe my Dad found for his meal of the month.  He cooked it for my Mum, my 3 yr old daughter and myself. For some reason, my daughter called my Dad Woppy.  We were never sure why.  He was s'posed to be a Grampy.  I didn't think my daughter would touch the meal as she was going though such a fussy eating phase.  She surprised us all, especially my Dad, by devouring it, loving it, and naming it Woppy Chicken.  20 years later,  Woppy Chicken frequents our table and my Dad is close at heart.
