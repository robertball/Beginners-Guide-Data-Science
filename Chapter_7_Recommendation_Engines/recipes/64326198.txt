Ingredients:
1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts, halved
1 1/2 clove(s) garlic, thinly sliced
2 teaspoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 pinch pepper, black ground

Directions:
MAKE-AHEAD: You can combine all the elements of this dish, except the water, up to 8 hours before roasting. Cover and leave at room temperature. Remember to uncover and add the water before placing in the oven.
Heat oven to 425ÂºF.
Place Brussels sprouts, garlic, oil, salt, and a pinch of pepper in a 9" by 13" baking dish; toss to coat. Spread out in a single layer. Pour 1/2 cup water into the dish and roast until Brussels sprouts are lightly browned and pierced easily with a paring knife, about 25 minutes. Serve warm.
