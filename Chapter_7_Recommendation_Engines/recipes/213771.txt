6 eggs

Directions:
Place eggs in saucepan large enough to hold them in single layer.  Add cold water to cover eggs by 1 inch.  Heat over high heat just to boiling.  Remove from burner.  Cover pan.
Let eggs stand in hot water about 15 minutes for large eggs (12 minutes for medium eggs; 18 minutes for extra large).
Drain immediately and serve warm.  Or, cool completely under cold running water or in bowl of ice water, then refrigerate.
