Ingredients:
FOR DOUGH:
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup hot (185°F) milk
2 (0.25-ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm (110°F to 115°F) water
2 eggs
41/2 cups flour
FOR WALNUT FILLING
3 eggs
1 cup packed light brown sugar
1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter, melted
11/2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla
4 cups walnuts, chopped

Directions:
PREPARE DOUGH:
1. Stir sugar, butter, and salt into hot milk in a small bowl until butter is melted and mixture is lukewarm. In the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, sprinkle yeast over warm water; stir to dissolve. Stir milk mixture into yeast mixture. Add eggs and 21/2 cups of the flour; beat on high until combined. With mixer on low, add remaining 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time. Switch to dough hook; mix until dough leaves sides of bowl, about 5 minutes. Set dough in a large, lightly greased bowl, turning dough to coat top. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour.
MEANWHILE, PREPARE WALNUT FILLING:
2. Lightly beat eggs in a large bowl. Stir in brown sugar, 1/3 cup melted butter, the cinnamon, and vanilla. Fold in nuts.
SHAPE BABKA:
3. Punch dough down. Turn dough out onto a large, lightly floured surface, cover with bowl, and let rest 10 minutes. Line three 5x9-inch loaf pans with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on long sides.
4. Divide dough into thirds; roll each third out to a 12-inch square on a lightly floured surface. Spoon one-third of filling onto each dough square and spread to 1/2 inch from edges. Roll up each square tightly as for a jelly roll. Pinch ends and seam closed to seal. With your palms, roll logs back and forth to make uniformly round.
5. With a sharp knife or dough scraper, cut one log in half lengthwise to form 2 striped strands. Working quickly, twist strands loosely together with cut sides facing out, making 2 or 3 wide, horizontal twists. Fit into one of the prepared pans, patting back any loose filling and tucking ends under, if needed. (It might look like a mess now, but it comes out beautifully!) Repeat with remaining logs and pans. Cover pans with a towel and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Loaves should not rise above top edges of pans.
BAKE BABKA:
6. Preheat oven to 350°F. Brush loaf tops with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter. Bake loaves until puffed, well-browned, and a thermometer inserted in centers registers 200°F, 35 to 45 minutes. Tent with foil if tops brown before loaves are done. Cool in pans 10 minutes, then use parchment to lift from pans and transfer to a wire rack.
7. Cool completely, about 1 hour. Glaze if desired, then slice crosswise to serve. (Babka can be wrapped well and frozen up to 2 months. Remove from freezer and let thaw at room temperature.)

Description: 
This Jewish treat is a hybrid of sweet roll, swirl bread, and coffee cake. It's a sweet yeast dough that you roll out, fill, and roll up like a jelly roll, then cut, twist, and bake in a loaf pan. Don't worry: It looks fancy (and it IS a little messy), but it's seriously easy to do. And once you get the dough down, you can try it with other fillings.
