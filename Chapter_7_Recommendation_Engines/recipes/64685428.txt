Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil
2 heads of cauliflower
14.5 oz can of chicken broth as needed
1/4 c Greek yogurt
Salt / pepper to taste
**optional - can add a little bit of instant potato to thicken as needed for thicker fluffier texture
2 lbs Ground turkey
2 cloves garlic
1 box = 2 packets Beefy Onion soup/dip mix packages
2 tbsp flour
1/4 c water as needed to make it creamy but thick enough not to be runny
1 lb frozen corn or pea & carrot mix
1 C Fat free cheddar
French fried onions

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450
Saute cauliflower in olive oil until soft enough to mash with fork.  Stir often so it doesn't get too brown.
Add Greek yogurt.  Slowly pour in chicken broth until desired consistency.  Salt and pepper to taste and combine/mash until fluffy smooth.
Brown ground turkey with chopped garlic and then drain grease once cooked through.  Stir in both packets of beefy onion and flour until combined then slowly add water to make it creamy but NOT runny, generally about 1/4 cup.  Allow to thicken.
In casserole dish layer the meat first, the bag of frozen veggies next, then the cauliflower "mash" and top with cheese and bake for 15 minutes.  Pull out top with the french fried onions and allow to brown for 5 minutes more.
Once out of the oven allow to sit a few minutes to allow the casserole to "set".

Description: 
Old fashioned, stick to your ribs comfort food decadence minus the guilt.  The star here are the cauliflower mashed potatoes that will have your family amazed at their authentic taste.  It's a versatile dish that I've made with frozen and/or fresh  cauliflower subsidized with a potato or 2 or instant mashed potatoes when I've added too much liquid just to soak up extra liquid.  The key here is just to NOT boil the cauliflower.  Hope you enjoy :)
