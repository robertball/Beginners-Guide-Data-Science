Ingredients:
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup French-fried onions, finely crushed
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 pound ground turkey
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1 (10 ounce) package fresh spinach
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Combine Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, onions, garlic, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl and lightly mix. Add beef and turkey; mix by hand until well combined. Form mixture into 8 large meatballs.
Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add meatballs to the melted butter and cook, uncovered, turning occasionally until a crust forms, 10 to 15 minutes. Cover and cook on low heat, turning occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes more. Transfer meatballs to a serving dish and cover.
Add remaining butter to the pan and melt over low heat. Add spinach and stir until well wilted, about 5 minutes. Add cream and water; cook until reduced, 3 to 5 minutes. Add cooked meatballs and cook, 5 to 10 minutes, turning meatballs over every other minute.

Description: 
I know what you must be thinking, no eggs!? When I first came up with this recipe, I was out of eggs, and it turned out just fine. These meatballs hold together very well due to the ground up onions and cheese, making them easy to handle in the pan. Garnish with basil and serve over zoodles, spaghetti squash, riced cauliflower, or enjoy as is.
