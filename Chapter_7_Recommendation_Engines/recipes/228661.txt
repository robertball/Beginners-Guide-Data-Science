Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 cup finely chopped fresh spinach
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
1/2 small yellow onion, finely chopped
1/3 cup 2% milk
1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 pinch dried oregano
1 pinch dried basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 pounds extra-lean ground beef

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.
Mix eggs, spinach, mushrooms, bread crumbs, onion, milk, blue cheese, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, cayenne pepper, oregano, basil, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Add ground beef and mix thoroughly with your hands; pack into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
A slightly different recipe using a combination of ingredients, this meatloaf tastes absolutely divine! Instead of the usual ketchup, tomato paste, and brown sugar, this meatloaf is more of an 'upscale' version of the traditional. Best served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. This is my own personal creation! I substitute ground deer meat occasionally instead of beef, only because I have a freezer full, and it's organic!
