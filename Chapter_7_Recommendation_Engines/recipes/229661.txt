Ingredients:
1 (8 pound) whole bone-in turkey breast with skin
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
6 tablespoons butter, melted
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon dried savory
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried thyme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Loosen the skin from the meat of the turkey breast.
Place the turkey breast into a large oven-safe pot or Dutch oven with a lid and pour chicken stock over the meat. Mix melted butter with chicken bouillon granules, sage, savory, rosemary, and thyme in a bowl. Lift the loosened skin and pour slightly more than half the butter-herb mixture under the skin. Pour remaining herb mixture over the skin. Cover the pot.
Roast in the preheated oven for 3 hours; flip turkey breast over and roast 1 more hour; flip again and roast until the juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast, not touching bone, reads 180 degrees F (80 degrees C), 1 additional hour (5 hours in all). Baste turkey with pan drippings and let stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I created this recipe from a few other recipes I enjoyed. It's not as large as making a full turkey but just as enjoyable. Drippings make GREAT gravy!
