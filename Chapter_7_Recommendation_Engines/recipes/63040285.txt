Ingredients:
2 loaves frozen bread dough (thawed)
1 1/2 c of brown sugar (packed)
1 large box of cook vanilla pudding (can use butterscotch)
1/2 c butter
1 c of milk
1 tsp of cinnamon

Directions:
Spray a 9x13 pan with Pam. Cut up a loaf of frozen bread into small pieces.Sprinkle cinnamon on top.  Melt the butter in a pan, adding the milk and pudding. Cook until it boils. Then pour over the loaf of bread. Cut up the next loaf on top. Let is rise for an hour.  I have left it rise overnight. Bake for 25 minutes. Tip it over onto a cookie sheet with sides. It seems the middle doesn't cook well, so you may need to cook it a little longer. If you have already tipped it onto the cookie sheet, cook with the pan over the top so it doesn't dry out.
