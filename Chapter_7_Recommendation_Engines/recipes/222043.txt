Ingredients:
3 jalapeno peppers, or more to taste
1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes with juice
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro

Directions:
Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil; add jalapeno peppers. Reduce heat to medium and boil peppers for 15 minutes; drain. When cool enough to handle, remove stems of peppers.
Place jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, garlic salt, cumin, black pepper, white pepper, and cilantro in a blender. Blend to your desired texture, 30 seconds to 1 minute.

Description: 
This is a simple salsa recipe I learned from my brother-in-law who worked at an authentic Mexican restaurant. Boiling the jalapeno peppers is the magic to the recipe. This is great with tortilla chips, tacos, or other Mexican recipes.
