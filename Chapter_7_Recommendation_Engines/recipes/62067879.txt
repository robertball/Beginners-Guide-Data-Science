Ingredients:
favorite cheeseball recipe ingredients!

Directions:
Take your favorite cheeseball, but instead of shaping it into a ball, make it a square.  Don't roll in nuts or paprika or whatever it calls for.  Instead leave as is or "frost" with an additional layer of cream cheese to achieve whiteness.  Cut whole pitted olives in half and place on cheeseball to make the whole thing look like a dice.
