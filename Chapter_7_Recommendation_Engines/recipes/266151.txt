Ingredients:
6 tablespoons golden raisins
3 pounds Swiss chard, leaves and thin stems only
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 onion, minced
2 tablespoons bread crumbs, or as needed
2 large eggs
4 tablespoons walnuts, roasted and chopped
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Soak raisins in warm water while chard is cooking. Drain and pat dry.
Cut chard leaves into strips and chop stems.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook chard leaves and stems for 5 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool. Press out excess liquid with your hands.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a springform pan and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Turn springform pan over to remove excess bread crumbs.
Beat eggs in a large bowl. Mix in chard, raisins, onion, walnuts, and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon mixture into the prepared springform pan and sprinkle with a thin layer of bread crumbs. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Bake in the preheated oven until tart is lightly browned on the top, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
This is my version of the classic Italian tart with chard and raisins. The original is made with pine nuts, but I prefer to use walnuts instead. Feel free to use either. Only use the very thin stalks of the chard and discard any thick ones.
