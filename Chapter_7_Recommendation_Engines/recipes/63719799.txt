Ingredients:
4 1/8 cups milk
4 1/2 Tbsp unsalted butter
3/8 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 1/2 pinches ground nutmeg
1/8 tsp + half of that freshly ground black pepper
1/8 tsp + half of that cayenne pepper
1 1/2 tsp dijon mustard
3/8 tsp Worcestershire sauce
3 cups (about 12 oz) shredded sharp cheddar, divided
1 1/2 cup (about 6 oz) diced swiss and havarti
12 ounces elbow macaroni

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish; set aside.
Fill a large pan with water. Bring to a boil. Add macaroni; cook 2 to 3 fewer minutes than manufacturer's directions, until outside of pasta is cooked and inside is underdone. Transfer the macaroni to a colander, rinse under cold running water, and drain well.
Heat milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat (or in a microwave safe, large measure on 50% power for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally).
Melt butter in a high-sided skillet over medium heat. When butter bubbles, add flour. Cook, stirring, 1 minute.
Slowly pour hot milk into flour-butter mixture while whisking. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture bubbles and becomes thick.
Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in salt, nutmeg, black pepper, cayenne pepper, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire, 2 cups cheddar, and 3/4 cup Gruyere/Havarti. When cheese is incorporated, set cheese sauce aside.
Stir macaroni into the reserved cheese sauce.
Pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle with remaining cheeses. Bake until browned on top, about 20-30 minutes. If desired, broil for a few minutes at the end for more browning. Transfer dish to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes; serve.
