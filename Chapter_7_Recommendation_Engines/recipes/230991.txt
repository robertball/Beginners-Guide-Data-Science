Ingredients:
1 pinch cayenne pepper
2 cups brown sugar, or as needed
2 (14 ounce) packages little smoked sausages
1 (16 ounce) package bacon slices, cut into thirds (or as needed)
1 box toothpicks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a large baking dish with aluminum foil.
Stir cayenne pepper into brown sugar in a bowl. Wrap each smoked sausage in a piece of bacon; secure each with a toothpick. Arrange wrapped sausages into prepared baking dish. Pack brown sugar around wrapped sausages to cover by about 1/2 inch. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Increase oven heat to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Remove aluminum foil from pan.
Continue baking in the hot oven until brown sugar has melted and thickened, 30 to 40 minutes.
