Ingredients:
2 tilapia fillets
1/2 tbsp feta cheese
1/2 tbsp spinach, chopped
1 tbsp butter
1 tsp lemon juice
1 tsp mayo
1 tsp Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Take your tilapa fillets and season both sides with salt and pepper, enough to cover both sides. Take your feta and spinach and layer on 1 piece of the fish. Take the other piece and put on top of the covered piece. Take a brush and lightly brush the mayonnaise on top of the fish, then sprinkle the Parmesan on top of the mayo.
In a greased cash iron skillet, place the tilapia mayo side up and sear for 3 minutes. After three minutes place pan in a preheated 375 degree oven and cook for 10-12 minutes.
After this is done, turn your oven and broil and cook until golden brown. Remove from oven and place on stove. Add one tbsp of butter and lemon juice to pan. Spoon butter and juice over top of fish for a bout 2-3 minutes.
Done! It was so tasty that we make this one a regular!

Description: 
As our Disney vacation approaches, our fridge and pantry begin to look bare, and we have to become creative with our meals. I happened to notice we had a few tilapia fillets left, and I noticed I had a little bit of spinach and feta left as well. Result? Delicious stuffed fish! This was actually an excellent dish. Sided with caramelized carrots and quinoa, it was loaded up in yum factor. This recipe will be for one serving.
