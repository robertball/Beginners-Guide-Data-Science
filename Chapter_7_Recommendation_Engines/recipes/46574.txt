Ingredients:
1/4 cup dried blueberries
1/4 cup chopped dried cherries
1/4 cup dried cranberries
2 tablespoons brandy
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup eggnog
2 tablespoons brandy
2 tablespoons water
3/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine dried blueberries, dried cherries, dried cranberries, and 2 tablespoons brandy. Soak for 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan or Bundt pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and 2 cups sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the eggnog, mixing just until incorporated. Fold in soaked fruit mixture. Spread batter into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.
In a small bowl, mix together brandy, water, and 3/4 cup sugar. With pastry brush, brush entire surface of cake with glaze. Cool completely before serving.
