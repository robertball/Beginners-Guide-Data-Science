Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1/3 cup hot, strong brewed coffee
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
GLAZE:
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 teaspoons milk

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Add egg; beat well. Beat in coffee. Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture.
Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts. Spread into a well-greased 8-in. square baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
In a small bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough milk to achieve a glaze consistency. Drizzle over warm bars. Cool completely on a wire rack before cutting.
