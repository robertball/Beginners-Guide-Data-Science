Ingredients:
2 pounds white carp, cut into large chunks
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon red chile powder
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup tamarind pulp
1 cup warm water
1/4 cup oil
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 large onion, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons garlic paste
2 tablespoons red chile powder
2 tablespoons ground coriander
1 pinch salt to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh coriander (cilantro), or to taste

Directions:
Place fish in a bowl; add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon chile powder, turmeric, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and allow to marinate for about 10 minutes.
Place tamarind pulp in a bowl and pour warm water over it. Squeeze tamarind to extract juice.
Heat 1/4 cup oil in a skillet over medium heat; add cumin seeds and stir. Add onion to cumin; cook and stir until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic paste and cook for 3 minutes. Add carp, cover the skillet, and cook for 5 minutes.
