Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
2 eggs
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup chopped peeled pear
1/2 cup chopped almonds

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first nine ingredients. In another bowl, beat the eggs, yogurt, milk, oil and extract. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in pear and almonds. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.

Description: 
I always bake muffins on the weekends and freeze them for breakfasts or snacks during the week. I take a few out in the morning, and they thaw by the time I get to work.
