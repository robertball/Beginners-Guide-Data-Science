Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 large onion, sliced
3 tablespoons curry paste
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2/3 cup water
1 pound pumpkin, cut into 1 inch squares
1 (15 ounce) can small butter beans (lima beans)
salt and pepper to taste
1 (9 ounce) package frozen spinach, thawed and drained
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and stir in the onion. Cook and stir until the onion is soft and beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Stir in the curry paste, cook for 2 minutes longer, then add the coconut milk water, and pumpkin. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the pumpkin is nearly tender, about 10 minutes.
Stir in the butter beans, and continue simmering until the pumpkin is tender, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then stir in the spinach and cilantro. Simmer a few more minutes to reheat, and serve.
