Ingredients:
2 cups water
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh mint leaves
32 fluid ounces Kentucky bourbon
8 sprigs fresh mint leaves for garnish

Directions:
Combine water, sugar and chopped mint leaves in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Allow syrup to cool, approximately 1 hour.  Pour syrup through a strainer to remove mint leaves
Fill eight cups or frozen goblets with crushed ice and pour 4 ounces of bourbon and 1/4 cup mint syrup in each.  (Proportions can be adjusted depending on each person's sweet tooth).  Top each cup with a mint sprig and a straw.  Trim straws to just barely protrude from the top of the cups.  Serve juleps on a silver platter.

Description: 
Sit on the front porch in your rocking chair on a sultry afternoon and sip on one or two of these. The proper way to serve a mint julep is in a frozen silver goblet, but you can use glasses instead--just use the most elegant ones you have! You can make the syrup ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for whenever the julep mood strikes you.
