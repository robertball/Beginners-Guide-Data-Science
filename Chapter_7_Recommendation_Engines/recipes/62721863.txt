Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast, frozen
1 15 1/2 oz can of black beans, undrained
1 16oz jar of salsa
1 small bag of frozen corn
1 pkg of taco seasoning
1 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, cubed
Optional:
Tortilla chips / Mexican rice / Tortilla shells

Directions:
Place chicken in the bottom of the crock pot, and cover with the beans, salsa, corn, and taco seasoning.  Cook on low for 6-8 hours.  1/2 hour before serving, shred the chicken pieces in the crock pot, using a fork.  Place the cubed cream cheese into the crock pot allowing it to melt into the mixture before serving.  This will thicken the mixture up considerably.
I like to serve over tortilla chips with a side of Mexican rice.  My son prefers to wrap his in a tortilla shell.
