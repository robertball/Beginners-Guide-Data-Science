Ingredients:
1 ½ tablespoons butter
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
salt to taste
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ cup orange juice
½  orange, sliced

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken on both sides in the hot butter until golden brown on both sides, about 10 minutes; place the chicken into a shallow baking dish. Stir the flour, cinnamon, and orange juice into the skillet. Bring to boil, and cook until thickened. Season with salt to taste, then pour over the chicken breasts in the baking dish. Cover the chicken breasts with orange slices.
Bake the chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
