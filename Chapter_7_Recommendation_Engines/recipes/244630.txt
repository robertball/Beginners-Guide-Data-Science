Ingredients:
non-stick cooking spray
2 cups whole wheat and flax flour (such as Robin Hood(R) Nutri Flour Blend(TM) Omega-3 & Fibre)
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda
2  eggs
2 cups buttermilk
5 tablespoons melted butter, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
¾ cup brown sugar
⅜ cup hot water
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
¾ cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons skim milk, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions and spray with non-stick cooking spray.
Whisk whole wheat flax flour, white sugar, baking powder, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Whisk eggs, buttermilk, 1 tablespoon melted butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; pour into flour mixture and stir just until batter is combined.
Pour about 1/3 cup batter into waffle iron; close lid and bake until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, keeping waffles warm.
Whisk brown sugar, 3 tablespoons melted butter, hot water, and cinnamon together in a small microwave-safe bowl; cook in the microwave on High until cinnamon drizzle can be poured, about 10 seconds.
Whisk confectioners' sugar, skim milk, and 1 tablespoon melted butter together in a small bowl until icing drizzle is smooth and can be poured.
Place 2 waffles on a plate; drizzle with 2 tablespoons cinnamon drizzle, then drizzle with 2 tablespoons icing drizzle.
