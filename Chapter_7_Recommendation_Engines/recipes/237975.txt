Ingredients:
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons butter
4 skinless boneless chicken breasts
1/3 cup dry white wine or chicken broth
2 tablespoons coarse grain Dijon mustard
1 cup 15% or 18% cream
2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
salt and pepper

Directions:
Combine flour, salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. Set aside 1/2 teaspoon (2 mL) of flour mixture.  Coat chicken in flour mixture, shaking off excess. In a large frying pan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add chicken to the pan; cook, turning twice, 10 to 15 minutes or until no longer pink inside and deep golden on the outside. Remove the chicken to a plate; keep warm.
Sprinkle reserved 1/2 teaspoon (2 mL) flour into pan; stir for 30 seconds. Stir wine into pan, scraping up any browned bits. Cook until wine is almost evaporated. Stir in mustard. Pour in cream; cook for 1 minute or until thickened. Stir in tarragon. Season to taste with salt and pepper
Plate chicken and pour sauce over top.
