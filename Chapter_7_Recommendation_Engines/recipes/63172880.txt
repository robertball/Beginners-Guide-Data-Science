Ingredients:
3 eggs
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup granulated sugar
Pinch of salt
1 cup Guinness
1-1/2 cups chocolate almond milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1-1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup whipped topping of choice

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine eggs, flour, sugar and salt. Whisk until smooth. Set aside.
In a saucepan over medium-low heat, combine Guinness and chocolate almond milk. Heat until just before boiling (small bubbles should form around the edge of the pan). Remove from heat. While whisking constantly, slowly stream the Guinness mixture into the egg mixture until all combined.
Pour mixture back into saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 12-15 minutes or until pudding is thick and bubbly. Remove from heat. Stir in chocolate chips and vanilla until melted.
Spoon pudding into serving dishes, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold. Top with whipped topping.

Description: 
You may be wondering how Guinness-y this tastes. I think a lot of times recipes that call for booze are a waste because the flavor just fades away—not here. I found that the Guinness flavor intensified and tasted almost like a Guinness-flavored liqueur swirled through the deep, dark chocolate. It definitely isn’t a dessert for the kids. Or adults that aren’t fans of alcohol
