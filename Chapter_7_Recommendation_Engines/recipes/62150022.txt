Ingredients:
1 pound of pork neck bones, or rib bones
2 large potatoes, cut into chunks
2 large tomatoes, quartered
1 onion, quartered
1 large carrot, sliced
10 cups of water
1 teaspoon sugar
Salt to taste

Directions:
Place soup bones into a pot and enough water to cover the bones. Bring to a quick boil to remove scum off the bones.
Drain the bones and return to the pot with 10 cups of water.
Add the cut vegetables and bring to a boil then turn down the heat to low and let simmer for 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
Add salt to taste. Fish sauce may also be used for extra flavor.

Description: 
My grandmother used to make this clear soup to be served during our family style dinners. It is a soup that can be made in the slow cooker or slowly simmered on the stove top and makes for a very comforting meal when served with rice on a cold day.
