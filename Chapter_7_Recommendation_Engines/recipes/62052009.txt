Ingredients:
4 thick-cut pork chops
2 cans cream-of-mushroom soup (reduced fat is just fine)
2/3 cup milk (skim, 2%, whole)
3 stalks celery, sliced thin
4 slices wheat bread, toasted and cubed
3 teaspoons poultry seasoning
salt and pepper, to taste
2 tart apples, (peeled or unpeeled), sliced thin

Directions:
Brown the pork chops in a non-stick skillet rubbed with just a little oil.  Arrange the chops in a greased baking dish.  Combine the soup and milk in a medium bowl, mixing until creamy and smooth.  Add celery, bread cubes, poultry seasoning, salt and pepper; toss to coat the bread.  Pour soup mixture over the chops.  Arrange the apples on top (pushing them into the soup mixture a bit), reserve a few slices for garnish.  Bake uncovered in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour or until chops are at 160-165 degrees in the center.

Description: 
The ultimate comfort food - pork chops baked in a creamy sauce topped with tart apples.  A perfect, easy to prepare dish for those cold winter nights.
This recipe can be made low-fat without taking away any of the wonderful flavors.
I have used cornbread for a different taste and texture.  Also good.
