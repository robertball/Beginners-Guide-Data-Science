Ingredients:
¼ cup butter
3 stalks celery, diced
1 small onion, diced
¼ cup all-purpose flour
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup water
¾ cup half-and-half
2 cups cubed, cooked chicken
1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese
⅓ cup buffalo wing sauce, or more to taste
¼ cup creamy tomato soup
salt and ground black pepper to taste
¼ cup crumbled blue cheese, or as needed

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute celery and onion in melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes.
Sprinkle flour over the celery mixture; cook and stir until the flour absorbs into the butter, about 2 minutes.
Stream chicken broth, water, and half-and-half into the flour mixture while stirring; add chicken, Cheddar cheese, buffalo wing sauce, and tomato soup. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cheese has melted completely into the liquid, about 10 minutes.
Ladle soup into 8 bowls. Top each serving with blue cheese crumbles to serve.
