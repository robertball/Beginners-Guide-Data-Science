Ingredients:
3 pounds pork loin roast
1 1/2 teaspoons caraway seed
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground sage
1/2 teaspoon browning sauce
2 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a small bowl combine the caraway seeds, black pepper, salt and sage. Rub mixture all over the pork. Place pork into a shallow roasting pan and bake, uncovered until and internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) is reached, about 30 minutes per pound.
Remove roast from pan, set aside and cover. Pour pan drippings into a measuring cup and add enough water to equal 2 cups. Pour into a small saucepan and stir in the browning sauce and cornstarch. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is smooth. Raise heat and bring to a boil. Cook until thickened. Serve alongside the pork roast.
