https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 (8-oz.) pkgs cream cheese, softened
1 stick butter, softened
3/4 c. crumbled feta cheese
1 c. finely shredded mild cheddar, softened
1 Tbsp. A-1 sauce (or Worcestershire)
1 heaping Tbsp. Greek seasoning

Directions:
Put all softened ingredients in a bowl and using a hand mixer mix until completely combined.  (Add more or less greek seasoning to taste).
Place in a serving bowl and refrigerate at 8-12 hours to soften herbs and combine flavors.
Make sure to take this out about 30-60 minutes minutes before serving to make more spreadable.  If you are in a hurry you can put in microwave for a few seconds at a time on defrost-stirring in between.
I sprinkle a little extra greek seasoning on top before serving.
Serve with crackers.  We like Keebler Wheatables-Honey Wheat crackers with this!
