Ingredients:
1 pizza dough/frozen dough package
2-3 tbsp of flour for dusting
1 8 oz. box of frozen cut spinach (thawed and drained)
1 container of sundried tomatoes (cut into slices)
1 10 oz. package of baby portabellos (thinly sliced)
1 10 oz. bag of shredded mozzerella cheese
1 tbsp of olive oil
2 tbsp of melted butter

Directions:
Roll out the pizza dough, dusting the flour on the counter and dough as needed so that it doesn't stick.  Try to make it into a rectangle shape.
Place on a cookie sheet.
Heat oil in a frying pan and saute the mushrooms until tender.
Combine mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, and spinach in a bowl.
Spread the mixture on the entire rolled out dough, try to get close to the edges.
Sprinkle the cheese on top of the mixture.  You can always add more cheese if you like.
Then roll the dough like a pinwheel so it forms a long log.
Place in the oven at 350 and bake for 45 minutes or until center is baked through.
After about 30 minutes spread the melted butter evenly oven the log and let brown.
Once the bread is done, let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
You can slice each slice in half to make smaller bit size pieces.

Description: 
I took a simple pepperoni bread recipe and changed it by adding sundried tomatoes, spinach and portabello mushrooms. This is always a hit at parties!! This recipe can be so versatile.  You can substitute any veggies, or cheese.
