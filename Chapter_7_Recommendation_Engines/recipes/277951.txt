Ingredients:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons Sriracha sauce
1 pound bay scallops (about 36 small scallops)
1 pinch coarse salt
1 pinch freshly cracked black pepper
12 slices bacon, cut into thirds
olive oil cooking spray

Directions:
Mix mayonnaise and Sriracha sauce together in a small bowl. Refrigerate Sriracha mayo until ready to serve.
Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Spread scallops out onto a plate or cutting board and blot dry with a paper towel. Season with salt and pepper.  Wrap each scallop with 1/3 slice of bacon and secure with a toothpick.
Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place bacon-wrapped scallops in the basket in a single layer; split into 2 batches if necessary.
Cook in the air fryer for 7 minutes. Check for doneness; scallops should be opaque and bacon should be crispy. Cook 1 to 2 minutes longer, if necessary, checking every minute. Remove scallops carefully with tongs and place on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil from the bacon. Serve with Sriracha mayo.

Description: 
This delicious appetizer is prepared quickly and easily in the air fryer and served with a spicy Sriracha mayo dipping sauce. I use the smaller bay scallops for this. If you are using jumbo scallops it will require a longer cooking time and longer strips of bacon.
