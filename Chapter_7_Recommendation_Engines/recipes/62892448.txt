Ingredients:
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 pounds (about 10 medium) red skin potatoes
vegetable oil, as needed
sour cream, optional

Directions:
Combine Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic powder, paprika and pepper; set aside.  Spray a baking pan (I use a cast iron skillet) with non-stick cooking spray.  Then drizzle some vegetable oil into the pan, just to lightly coat the entire bottom surface; set aside.  Halve the potatoes and blot the cut side with a paper towel to remove moisture.  Place in a bowl and lightly drizzle with vegetable oil.  Toss until potatoes are all lightly coated with oil.  Sprinkle on the Parmesan cheese mixture and toss to distribute.  Place the potatoes, cut side down in the prepared baking pan.  Bake uncovered at 400 degrees, for 30-40 minutes, turning cut side up half way through baking time, until golden and crispy.  Serve with a dollop of sour cream, if desired.

Description: 
I have tried a lot of good roasted potato recipes, but I keep coming back to this one.  I've never found one I like better!  These are crispy on the outside, and soft and creamy on the inside.
