Ingredients:
12 cups Romaine lettuce
8-12 oz. grilled bbq chicken (or rotisserie chicken)
8 oz. bacon, cooked and crumbled
2 Roma tomatoes, seeded and diced
1 large avocado, pitted and diced
3 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and diced
1/3 cup sliced green onions
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
Zesty Blue Cheese Dressing and Dip*

Directions:
Wash and chop lettuce (if not buying pre-washed, pre-chopped lettuce). Blot with paper towels to remove excess moisture. Arrange lettuce on large dinner plates and add a handful of BBQ chicken. Arrange remaining ingredients on topâ€“you can either keep all the toppings separate and let dinner-eaters mix it up (or not) according to their liking, or you can just go WILD and sprinkle everything on top. Serve with dressing and enjoy!
