Ingredients:
One cup baking soda
Six cups white vinegar
Eight cups water
8-10 drops essenial oil (opt)

Directions:
I make my own fabric softner. 1 cup baking soda, (I often use the old baking soda from when I change out the boxes in the fridge and then nothing goes to waste!) 6 cups white vinegar, 8 cups water & 8-10 drops of an essential oil (optional-I make it all the time unscented) Use a gallon container. Add the baking soda and 1 cup of water. SLOWLY add vinegar (volcano!) The mixture will foam up so watch it! Last add the remainder of the water and the oil if using. Add 1 cup to final rinse of laundry
