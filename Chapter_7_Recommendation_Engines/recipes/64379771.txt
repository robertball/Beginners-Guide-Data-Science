Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg, beaten
4 hoagie rolls
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pinch salt, or to taste
1 (14 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
4 slices provolone cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut hoagie rolls and pull trenches to create wells for your meatballs. Crumb pulled bread until you have approximately 1/2 cup bread crumbs. In a medium bowl, gently mix by hand the ground beef, bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic, parsley, Parmesan cheese, and egg. Shape into 12 meatballs, and place in a baking dish.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cooked through. Brush with olive oil, and season with garlic powder and salt. Slip the baguette into the oven during the last 5 minutes of the meatball's time, or until lightly toasted.
While the bread toasts, warm the spaghetti sauce in a saucepan over medium heat. When the meatballs are done, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the sauce. Spoon onto the hoagie and top with slices of provolone cheese. Return to the oven for 2 to 3 minutes to melt the cheese.
